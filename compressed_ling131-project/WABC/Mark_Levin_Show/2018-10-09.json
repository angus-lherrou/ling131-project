that the left is now engaged in a sort of mob anger and he's clearly right about that Hillary Clinton just came out and said you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for so all of a civility on the right remember we're told that the right was super dangerous and twenty sixteen\nAnd then it turns out the left to support the antifa\nYeah well they're doing the same thing with regard you from doing normal things in the White House you introduce Brett Kavanaugh and did what I think is correct he apologized to Brett Kavanaugh for what Brett Kavanaugh just had to go through for the for for simple parties and political reasons there's President Trump getting it correct\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo Brett and the entire covered all family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty\nAs President Trump is correct about all that stuff it turns out that independence didn't like how cabinets handled by Democrat either by twenty eight point margin independence were not particularly fond\nOf how Democrats handled all of that but that's not going to stop the Democrat from doubling down there was an MSNBC legal panelists yesterday talking about how Brett Kavanaugh is going to issue in a thousand\nYear right just like the Nazis here it is on MSNBC\nIf this way but they now have control over all three branches of government we're going to see if this rain last for thirty days or two years for cells and you're right because that is how that is what these people have set themselves up for\nA thousand year right now because Brett Kavanaugh isn't just a gang rape but she's also Nazi that's exciting news that we found out about it my favorite part of this particular segment by the way with Noah Rothman that with my friends\nNow he's on MSNBC right for commentary magazine and he started trying to explain why roe v Wade was not settled law and he was then accused of man's leaning on MSNBC because this is how far we've come as a country\nIs not interested in overturning roe the laws will make it over there as he has a ... philosophy and conservatives were\nUnder it and you know and that would not have that little survey to tell you that ... had it right towards ... wedding you don't don't say I'm trying to explain something to a woman and when it has to do with reproductive health care I don't ever do that because we're glad I got I don't know what can we I'm not a good idea here\nOkay [laughter] don't use the word explain when you're talking about reproductive issues but what if\nYou just got it wrong lady like what if you're just wrong what if you don't know what role the way does what if you don't understand conservative judicial philosophy as man's planning now ... in the words of my colleague Andrew claiming I'll be happy to stop man's planning when you start woman understanding it it's so silly it's so silly but don't worry the media have really got their stuff together they're not they're not out of their minds in any way\nSo for example when the president of the United states as the left has decided to engage in a form of mob awkward see Jim Acosta and find you somebody who loves you Jim Acosta loved him Acosta Jim Acosta over on CNN he does well President Trump does about my encourages mom\nYou know this is talk of a mob rule and so on I mean look if you have you been to a Trump rally a I mean if you do hear rhetoric acts as those rallies that would uh conjure up images of a mob or go back to the ... campaign when the president said as a candidate but he would like to punch protesters in the face and so on\nA and so perhaps the president knows what Marlborough and ... looked like because he ... himself\nCornering Senator Jeff flake in an elevator screaming at him you know ten Cruz and his wife Heidi how that out of a restaurant by protesters preparing the senators who questions about Kavanaugh than early on a junior at Sarah Sanders and homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen getting the same treatment out of restaurants\nAnd so what's happening is the ... head of the Democratic party Hillary Clinton\nIs telling her devil taste to confront Republicans wherever you can find them make their lives and comfortable how's that possible how is that fair\nOf course it is not and so we're left with a situation where the American people have got to choose for weeks from tonight for weeks from today will be election day\nSo in twenty eight days away if they decide whether Maxine Waters\nAnd Hillary Clinton and the war war hero Richard Blumenthal and ah and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi should be in charge of the Congress or this behavior will become even more mainstream which to me is impossible winners and losers I was talking to Richard cement and author Richard Valdez earlier the great producers in the ... show\nTo talk about the winners and losers of what happened with a\nWith a course today Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winner I think is due process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some ... substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump notch you one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office the Trump search scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero\nThe economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle is won by Trump including South Korea next fall will be the goddess havens in Beijing and communist red China\nThat takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country\nAnd at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according harass must and it came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent so whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were PIN cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit he hits back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you're not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man and he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful\nIt was wonderful this guy's got no backup ... stack up it continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world and it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nEvan all was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and laws go spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals he's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push cabin off further and further and further cabinet all kind of local looked over Trump and said that's my motto that's the guy I Want to be\nThey never imagined other whip the middle aged judge from Yale had in him to fight back and then no holds barred straight Pearl or fashion bigger But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump\nSo all of his brilliance and eloquence all of those are all of his grade school girls' basketball coach in your teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened\nAt a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later but Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified\nThat it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and ... and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now cabin all\nHe in a sense hypnotic played took on Trump's personality and he fought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin Oh one by Trump rules\nHe knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you got to fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after Christine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about their claustrophobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kavanaugh get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine Ford was not telling the truth what was she lied or not to a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses in every one of her witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapists notes were critical of this\nThat she relates to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens\nAnd the time was in the mid Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen nod or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said at the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas so when she said for boys tried to write for she she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the mid Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh so she flipped and change what she was saying in order to try to take Kevin all down and it didn't work and\nThe second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door with foot and not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist avid direct entry way\nAnd of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes or boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America traveled to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe how\nIs the disease swim all these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's all right Susan Collins put up on Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment in the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we've got four more weeks to go I cannot imagine and America when Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer in charge of the Senate and the investigations that would be launched than all the problems that arise\nSo tonight I Want to get your perspective mark Levin is off until

John please go ahead\nAnd show following this thing Brandt tally from from start to where it is now and uh absolutely I agree with your opening monologue first off factor stubborn thing you know and and the words of our of our [laughter]\nOur president John Adams a you know if you're just dissected and look strictly at facts and you're go off the values of the country that you know proven guilty it's absolutely mind boggling how people can lead to no kidding a conclusion of all if this guy he's guilty\nAnd you know John last night I watched some of the left as media today talking about how how unfair it was\nNot the president declared a innocent a bread ... isn't that what are you aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this was in a case and this wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nIt kind of walk a Christine afford down to perform rose path when she oddly questioning her about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector test and now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something in what she knew what was that the ex boyfriend oh Christine afford and by the way Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend is told his credit cards but I redress\n... what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend for taking a lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit that boy friend Christina forward of the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governor administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically everything that Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taking airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector tests\nAnd she did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for\nBrett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that the only conclusion on it I feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear that no kidding I got a tactic is actually allow that that's\nThat's terrified because you now take take somebody with a lesser degree or a lesser income in life or whatever the case may be a you know so that they're just they're all coming back or something like that\nThere could be no coming back\nWhether whether it ... you know just the mere fact that it can be absolute false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life is\nWhat John Waters Brett Kavanaugh will go to get back his reputation if you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what had happened didn't know how it happened and the four witnesses she supplied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty about and bounced out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight on [laughter] that would that would be a little road it wouldn't come back you know uh but then again I wouldn't get their due process what prevented from such a thing\nAnd you know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney\nBeen in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what a\nSomeone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say well someone feel for no it was a share of her life so if you go in and say my left foot is hurting I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no\nBut when it comes to sexual assault ten to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project\nHas listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later who were wrongly convicted of sexual assault or Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry uh two black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges\nThere was a host or university case were for college she meant at Hofstra overtures raping an Eighteen year old fellow students they came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples\nHow a woman or man falsely accused of someone of a sexual assault\nFor all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look or in the eye which the Senate denied and now that we took ... you know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra

Kennedy violate the norms of the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered\nThe Nixon violate the norms of the presidency with water great in line did he violated how about Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency\nViolated the norms of the president's so please save me the embarrassment\nOf trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency is if Obama and Bush and Clinton and ah Bush\nAnd LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms of the presidency please save me let's continue our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the markets have been show bleach chair and go ahead\nI I just wanted to um thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley your role I thought that he really had to hold the line on some pretty um\nStrong personalities you wanted to pull any direction they courage to cars as much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to add him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me have shown as your question talking about the norms and all I'm Liz listen to a liberal media today because they think Trump last night\nViolated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court did Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how 'bout Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nDidn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal did they violate the norms of the Senate\nAnd did the eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did not violate the norms of the Senate does make a little bit\nI think that all violated annoyance center I think their behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point in the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump several it depends on what happens and he\nDidn't give a hundred percent yes answer Hillary Clinton\nAnd the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November early November the eight twenty sixteen that he may not like it might not accept the election since the election has Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\nAren't heaven they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse because they are determined\nYou can see the devotion and dedication to things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as I say stack\nAbout accepting the results of the election\nIt's the Russian collusion delusion\nOr what whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general named Jeff Sessions who should have resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as she could not do his job as attorney general\nHe should offered his resignation at that moment in right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama\nBut what happened is that that uh when Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf it's the economy as a result of amyloid abnormalities I say let's have more of it if the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea\nPresident it's correct that the trade deficits\nAnd the only reason the communist read Chinese\nAre doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters the Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night and and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they ripped dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nFar this is abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is abnormal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nWell I'm with you and I also did test the fact that they will not acknowledge anything good anything can be as good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has done\nDonald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm aren't perfect you know he never did that so he tried he tried hard hard working there for a million that doesn't have to do it right I have alternate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAnd that too is sick today\nSharon we got her run thank you for your call from Pennsylvania and there's a Chuck Schumer which they get out and vote\nIf you do not want Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to be controlling the legislative agenda for the last

what is the name of the books and what is this book going to help\nBy the political leadership they can't do their job isn't that sad\nAnd makes me sick\nAnd why isn't so much Santa Christine Ford you lied about the second door and the front of your house\nYou lied about not taking an airplane you lied about no one helping no one to take a pass a polygraph test you lied every part of your testimony was either a fabrication won outright lie why isn't someone saying let's investigate Christine forward for perjury why not do that\nOne of them did um uh the senator I'm practically losing my memory I'm so nervous talking to you I'm Lindsey Graham\nLindsey Graham she ... she needed to be investigated of hers ... that's the way I feel\nEvery name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false every factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I think what happened Jeannie in reality is that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor\nYou are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help for your problem so if tomorrow Jeannie you go to a doctor\nAnd say my left hand is hurting the doctor believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist\nHas that Christine for did and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist that there were four boys who tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that happened\nI Believe something fundamentally bad happened diggers theme Ford which is why she's been seeking mental health for all these years and probably what she told the therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that\nFour boys tried do rape her in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties\nI Believe her but somehow in her mind she had recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties it became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward but you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold the therapist\nWho rented a room in our house that cause sort of put the second front door in our house so patients come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago now for Bush tried to rape me in the in my late teens\nAnd the mid Nineteen eighties then some out in our mind to get fame or to get money she decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens I was Fifteen set of the mid Nineteen eighty let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully league current name which by the way it's a crime dying Feinstein's office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage or require her to come forward\nAnd won the Senate said when the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation\nBrett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers were so perfect for um her responses drew out\nI'm feeling some sympathy they were absolutely perfect um to make you on her side and afraid to challenger\n... I'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer referred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue but this woman probably had something happen in her life ... involving those four boys that tried to write a paper\nAnd that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident didn't damage your life so much you didn't get two master's degrees and a doctorate didn't damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years\nAt Palo Alto

mom passed away about five years ago\nMy granddaughter those are the best people I Know and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and be told as a man that I don't care about sexual assault against women when I think about women I think about my wife or forty nine years as an appellate judge and the state of Ohio I think about my sister\nWho's the co chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio I think about my beautiful little granddaughter I Want to protect the women around me and make sure they have all the rights privileges and immunities every citizen\nBut I also want to say that there are times ten to twenty percent of the time when men are wrongfully charged with sexual assault and due process\nFerrets out the good from the bad the right from the wrong and then we from the chaff\nI wasn't Mendez due process rights because that guarantees down the road\nThat wrongful convictions for rape and other crimes which happens hundreds of times every year in this country will be less likely I Want women to be protected and I think men have rights too in a sense to me too movement there's nothing wrong with the me too movement\nAs long as rights and due process goes along with it and if somebody's charge why there's a title nine violation\nOr rape or sexual assault or a groping I don't want my wife groped or my sister growth that's disgusting and if somebody group as a

Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian probe you see the violence and Ryan ... for and all this stuff that's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy let me explain there's the also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration was traditional ... telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so the organized left inside the federal government would release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here the senator from Beijing this is foreign influence\nOur government a foreign agent of red China like congressman Dianne Feinstein she's the one that started this big hoopla about a a a judge Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh allegedly raping and all that stuff\nRecord indicates but that's up to you know he's made a lot more money and you and I put together so what the heck they got a new something Jason's yes man so that's why I put up with him you know I mean he he's a he defines mediocre yeah that's why ... likes a spotlight on him you know\nIt is by Chris well give me an update on the committee chairs\nOkay so are you were talking about what happens if\nThe Democrats win and in one thing that I've heard and I wanted to point out is we can't let 'em have house even how to speak because uh the committee heads have subpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slug Jerry ... are taking over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nWould be terrible I mean\nWhat I mean what legislation would pass what what activities on our behalf whatever occur if Jerry Nadler Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are in charge of the house of representatives what positive things would ever go on\nNothing that I could think of Iran even if we got a mute Mueller out of the picture oh jeez they would\nThey would just keeps the painting and keep investigating investigating and it would be nonstop investigations that when the house so we ever I Want to encourage everybody to donate all you can do\nWhat you came out and cheer volunteer all you can if you can't donate then get out there and knock doors if you see a sign for you know the the other side the Democrat be as nice as you can ... as you can try to engage those people why why you've just curious why you vote for for this person because the reason\nYeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not vote for him and just being is not just in about it but engagement tried to get them to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans\nOr whatever they don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know want to be part of the crowd so trying\nTo talk to me about ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose at Texas Senate seat to a clown like beta O'Rourke is that possible\nUh it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because um\nYou know the betas got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know he was young and you know he's a you know some people I guess finding physically attractive not eat different strokes for different folks whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd you know there there's obviously some liberal natives here you know in Austin area and some other Houston Dallas a but most of most of Texas has you know pretty\nNormal solidly conservative normal there are no yeah\nYeah but uh you know we've got people moving in her changing the demographics so uh it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise blues we've ... we've got to have and we'll\nSee what's happened in Florida is too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida\nAnd they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with him from New York from the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore are moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point is gonna be hard for the for the governor when the U.S Senate seat but\nYou know Scott ... is pretty good governor but nonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flipped Texas or Florida then the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one\nIt's over with a ... and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican can get elected if in Florida and New York uh begin to me as one and the taxes looks the same electorally as New York then we're done because Texas and Florida will tip this thing permanently\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or play I I was not a Trump fan okay I was a pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president and I have to admit I was dismayed by\nWhat happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know when I was sure that Ted west so\nI look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning 'cause I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance\nWhat Ted Cruz would have done and you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles it's Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say doesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star\nAnd there's the animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa tonight he hopefully it will be out everyday between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up\nThose guys the messiah or a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz wouldn't have done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it\nBut Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty oh three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to ride that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes were opened and here's what miles rope into that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump as a president\nOr not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off what and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off\nThings away Donald did know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that have confidence fate and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis kind of get back to where it needs to be\nIf Hillary was in the White House who would be on the Supreme Court would you have Gorsuch whichever Kevin all you'd have to Ginsburg look alikes and imagine the status of the country then an RPG the notorious RPG", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin
