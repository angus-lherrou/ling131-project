I I got you beat on that one I got I'm yeah I'm a I'm ashamed to say well I'm not ashamed to say I don't really know his first name because he's in the Brooklyn offices gentlemen's and and so um I I Believe that his pictures has the foreign actors actually on our website already a sixty four pounds in sixty days\nOh yeah I Know you're talking about yeah sixty four pounds in sixty days yeah um and he took a great profile picture of himself the gentleman is wearing a white shirt and tie and so the profound pictures fantastic so if you guys get a chance definitely go to and Jay diet dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four pounds and sixty days is very impressive\nMan and woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is that um [noise] it's an ...\nAn astronomical number in my opinion officer Amos I I think something to this effect again I don't know the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but\nAh you know this is just staggering number and really just the health benefits is a vast officer he's chasing criminals around it but you can do it much easier sixty four comes down I Would think so I definitely I think that's probably a much better situation for them especially in this heat that we've got going on so we improved\nWe've we improved\nThe safety of our city to yes that's correct if you can chased on criminal ... younger than you know when I went wow ups yeah when when\nOne at a time right so but you know ... pounds of great but I think that um a lot of what we see in our office is really the health benefits of what happens and um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and um what you are a blood tests are and where your numbers are so\nWe had stand who are just um [noise] was in and he's on day thirty three of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nHour which is a twenty seven pounds and thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that\nUm has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however overcome however his a\nHealth uh results or hit overall uh health um benefits have been ridiculous so his blood pressure\nIs now one oh four over sixty four\nWhich I Would say probably a little low [laughter] applied right his cholesterol ah\nWent I'm Down to one oh nine\nFrom from two twenty eight wow so his\nHDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven his triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from two fifty a\nThis is day thirty three of the ...\nWell I mean I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had um a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day into the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do the blood work and all that other stuff by his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not\nWrite so his primary care I fell off the chair absolutely at just blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were here a couple of months ago\nYou know your your numbers were a disaster basically you know and these guys I can understand I have so much energy I'm doing this and doing that I feel so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days in and literally um he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma or it's tremendous tremendous um\n[noise] so I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office yeah fine to their health\nPart of it is the best part land and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and people come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and some saliva and uh we were able to look at you know blood work in a functional level and and then to\nSee what supplements what's support people need and and it's so everybody gains weight and different areas for a reason\nThe bodies generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone a disruption and so you've got the different body types who got the name of the floppy overhanging belly fat where it could be an adrenalin shoe\nPortrayed in hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that side Roy issue with the apple shape apple shape generally thyroid were imbalances or the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be any number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents allowed to use blood work assessment tool or to see when a functional level to keep to keep a ... to ... to body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nBasically get people into the secular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detox of flying itself the hype of ... which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time to drink and a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral are electrified imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight gain a and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so when we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people come off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully the body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just had some a lot of barriers that er can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers Asian the personalization of the of the program the buyer energetic scans\nOf parents live a sample for that or blood work functional ... assessment a DNA testing that shows us to over forty different metabolic factors that we assess or to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a stays healthy as possible so\nReally easy and J died dot com or when a five five five\nA N J diet or I Want it to tell you about a Sondra are we talking about sleep I guess sleep with some some sort of a lot of people coming in with real sleeping issues and you know wonder why people are walking around with trouble to triple ... lattes well sleep it off he's from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation is having like a to take our stomach you know I Know and it was uncomfortable and one of the most awful things you can have\nYou ever so people are coming in I guess ... they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily from sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they're even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving\nA center came in a thirty nine year old female or she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a having a lot of getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times and soon and dream oh adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter solo so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to cortisol as grades it's a it's produced by the adrenal glands and and so\nIt's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if your adrenal exhaustion issues a lot of times you'll see the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit under that\nBut what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she basically been sleeping like a rock\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed with a long way syrup at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she was just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day\nRested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon or much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep so you see when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction [noise] um\nSo you have twenty four pounds sleep in like a rock she came in we did the hair and saliva sample or a ... blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support type of family support we also give her dream of support um got they got the body work in the right way and ah now we've got the results that we say\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more that\nRight between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one a lot of things change in the women's um body you know ... and cycle right and so it's really it's interesting that every ten years right right exactly so I think that it's interesting that um\nYou know you brought that up a but speaking of at the health benefits so we've had this happen a bunch of times in our office but there's just recently happened again uh Michelle I'm\nWho am I Believe she's in her I'm mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really really a lot of weight ... eighty pounds well what happened was um she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so did a lot of\nYou know I'm hormone therapy type stuff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these drugs are really am known for um they'll put on weight output that dealt with a ton of weight on Yammer them and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive but because of that\nUm she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then\nAfterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know of these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful as her first but she was about\nEighty pounds heavier than she had started out before so she came to us\nShe did to a forty day rounds which basically means she went pound for pound them both of them um and that's very um you know it it's common because this was not her regular weight right this was wait put on with your mind right so that's why she went pound for pound because her body really needed it it really needed to get rid of all it's gross so Shankar pound for\nPound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound packs a day for a woman is absolute\n... we've had a number of women whoever outlet right out of screwed up so anyway so she comes and she comes in 'em and she says\nShe goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for a ... test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no hormones great now a ...\nNo ... no nothing on she says I guess my body got rid of all the toxins of all the extra hormones I dropped all this weight\nShe says and now I'm pregnant [laughter] it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know how many times I Would say yeah half a dozen two dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know where it's settled with one child and happy and the baby's healthy and so now she's about to have a second one and she said\nI Can't believe I'm going to have to lose weight again but you know what I think is going to happen to be honest with you is now they are not regulated bodies more regularly our probably game show probably Jay has not\nGained a ton of weight are already and she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different she feels so much healthier and really feels good not as much knowledge\nDay she's really she says it's just a whole different experience for her she feels like herself and it's really great and congratulations to her and I you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we\nHad a gel also I had to somebody came and it was telling me the same thing a joke came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says she would come and go heavy bleeding for days on end and it wouldn't than ah it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent\nAh and she came in and a similar situation you know she said that it then the ... cycle totally stopped\nShe's down Seventeen pounds or in twenty two days which is great uh and the cycle ... seemed like she was regulating weather cycle she hadn't had it became in the beginning a couple of days no issues with it no pain nothing like that no no I'm Serious symptoms that way\nAnd it seemed like that was regulated as well so we do see this all the time when the hype of ...\nThat's your main hormone control that starts regulating itself you're going to see all the types of different hormonal issues go away all types of different um [noise]\n[noise] ah ... problems with women's women's monthly cycles and things like that we see that all the time\nAnd um it's really easy just call one eight five five and Jay diet\nOne eight five five five six five thirty four thirty eight that to schedule an appointment for go over in in one of our five locations or New Jersey New York city queens Long Island a law or what I miss Brooklyn forgot Brooklyn ...\nA ... and so that's and that's to do it that way just remember when you're calling on the phone the folks do not have all the answers are running the program they're just there to schedule an appointment for you

Scott Kelly got himself in all sorts of hot water a you wanted to space and I believe Nineteen Ninety nine and he got himself into hot water with the political left why well not because that's how he's actually a right wing or he's not he actually tweeted this out one of the greatest leaders\nModern times Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over now I could argue with that sweet on the merits victory and magnanimity has not been part of American politics for quite a while I'm old enough to remember when ... when Joe Biden's whole Brock Obama that Obamacare was a big thing\nDeal I'm old enough to remember when Brock Obama shined a rainbow flat on the wall of the White House ...\nI'm old enough to remember after two thousand eight one block Obama simply said to Republicans I Want and I\nHave a memory I don't have short term memory loss not dory from finding Nemo I and I remember all of this stuff happening and now we're told that that it's bad if you celebrate judge cab not being appointed the Supreme Court but here's the part that's hilarious though Scott Kelly isn't ripped up by the right but the sweet instead he's written up by the left why because you had the temerity to quote Winston Churchill\nEach weeded out did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities\nRacist views which I did not support my\nPoint it was we need to come together as one nation we're all Americans that should transcend partisan politics I\nWill not come together with anyone who says I cannot what Winston Churchill not going to happen I Will not come together with anyone who says I cannot call Abraham Lincoln because Abraham Lincoln or most of his career was a guy who believed in colonization of black\nPeople in Africa from the United states was wrong about that that was a bad perspective I'm not going to live in a country where I Can't quote Abraham Lincoln and suggest that Abraham Lincoln was he was not a hero that I'm not going to make common cause of people who say that I cannot quote Thomas Jefferson\nOr George Washington or the wide variety of historical figures were shaped by their time and held opinions that are not within the mainstream up today and I considered a moral today you know why because that's idiotic there are two visions of how westward vision on the west is based on certain fundamental good principles\nAnd those principles were held by people who simultaneously did not live up to those principles and the fullest way shaped as they were by the times in which they let this is called being historically accurate\nThat there are lots of good ideas embedded in times of lots of bad things are happening at the same thing that folks say about that did they often use this with a guy to biblical criticism up\nThe Bible it isn't a moral document because it contains things that we would not like today so for example it talks about slavery and the Bible and the right because the Bible is directed toward people were routinely inflating people and the Bible is attempting to curb them from slavery which is why overtime the greatest advocates for freeing slaves\nWere actually biblical reminded people in the Eighteen the nineteenth century the point is that neither you see the west as repository certain eternal truths that we have not lived up to or you see it as a repository of evil that must be torn down and the same people were saying you can't quote Churchill\nOr the people who say we have to tear down the entire structure from the inside it has to be torn down route and branch and then when we finally done and we can a retinue system in its place\nAnd so they'll tell lies about Churchill ... Churchill said some very nasty things during his career things we would consider nasty now and he keeps racial school and on a friday of groups ranging from the Indians to the like from India\nTo the student needs to certain Asian tribes or the left has done is they've taken those comments out of context to suggest that he was complicit in genocide and burn out which is not true to suggest that you want it to the gas people which is also not true and he wanted to he suggested using tear gas against people just saved their lives as opposed to using bullets actually\nA and a and you know the ... so they they take all the stuff out of context\nThis has relevance today not only because it demonstrates the extremism of the left that we're now at the point where you're not allowed to quote Winston Churchill but explain why there's this big fight that's now taking place over Columbus Day on the left the perspective as the Columbus Day is bad because western civilization is bad and so we must celebrate indigenous people's day on the day the Columbus\nDiscovered has been yellow and on the right to perspective as Christopher Columbus and the west have committed a lot of sense but it is an eminently good thing for the world that western civilization found the western hemisphere that's the basic argument it's really not about Columbus it's about the value of western civilization that's really at root\nThat is what the argument is about we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest I'm sure it will just be more insanity but will be here to break\nI've told this story before they thought it sounded to Italian so they changed it to ... because the Italians were discriminated against the time which\nI Love my grandmother she still alive grandma you're the best but I don't think we were really fooling anyone but the bond joined now by which an object saying I'm just\nMr producer my right do you think we really trick that he won with [laughter] with their producers laughing their adult pig I don't think we were pulling the wool over anyone dies\nBut it feels good doesn't it\nNow we're going to put some meat on the bone and the show because we can celebrate the whole time what's the point of that you tune in here to learn something hopefully right\nI'm going to give you about six or seven maybe eight solid takeaways also want to cover some of the updates and the spike anything but I Want to cover the takeaways from this big huge cabinet Brett Kavanaugh victory this was enormous and I want to start it off\nBy saying this we just took everything they had folks\nEverything they had a unified effort by the iron iron triangle of stupid\nThe media\nRadical far left activist groups and swamp brat Democrats the iron triangle of stupidity\nThrough everything they had our way single legs double legs rear mounted back in troll ... side control elbows from the top boxing Thai boxing\nTaekwondo kicks everything they had they through our way paid protesters unpaid protesters every single thing they had in their gambling done a political weapons they drew our way\nAnd we still one\nI Know you're not used to this I'm not either\nWhere are you still winning ideologically because we do that kind of stuff we go out and vote via the Tea Party revolution but we're not used to a unified establishment GOP up on the hill winning for us you know\nMy show this morning I covered this here are some small thing that gets a piece of paper I'm the most disorganized show host ever in my head um organized but my notes are always terrible because things just randomly pop up and I write them down here are some of the losses we've taken that you and I have fought hard for but the swab rats of abandoned us up on the hill\nObamacare repeal and Social Security reform remember the second term of George W.
