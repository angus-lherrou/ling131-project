Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint

all over the country's pouring millions and millions of dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects\nRound to scientists who have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um Tallahassee\nIs a very corrupt government under this mayor there it's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government ah to get basically city money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what these lobbyists did and they arranged a number of ... in one of which was the New York city\nI'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to infiltrate at\nA he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city of but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to\nGo see the play handled that many people here about the Hamilton ticket they did go to the movie the tickets for at least a thousand dollars at that time um and so\nHe gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that Andrew lied about that but now there's been evidence shows that\nBut then they said while the U.S also arranged a luxury for night stay in the Costa Rica below which ended across that about a thousand dollars a for Andrew and his wife a addition some other folks and again Andrew didn't pay for that and then what happens after\nAll this mark lo and behold mayor Andrew Gillum turns around and he gives those while being two million dollar deal that they were looking for\nIt so Andrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby is God\nA exactly what they were paying for it so that's really the way the government ... corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew as he lied to the country on Sunday night when I brought it up about that but then documents came out almost immediately that ... ...\nThis is denial showed he was lying um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can because he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line or the older that day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you're very smart and the law you understand about\nWhat an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official that now the reason you would do such a ...\nOf course nobody knows if he's in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people in him\nOh it's it's ... it's definitely an ongoing investigation and the bad that much is\nYour um it's interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem and his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said he ... not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission or because the bottom line is why would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents\nAround him on these trips like they round\nAnd round ascendancy immediately tried to racialized decision that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race now\nLast time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it and he took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask

I read brave new world last year and found it to be hilarious what are your thoughts on it and what are some other books that points out the laws and left yes leftist ideology you would recommend or brave new world is actually a very precious take on what exactly a technology center he had an effect society would look like\nAnd then the the basic premise of brave new world\nIs that there is a group of people who have basically separated sex and procreation\nThat they are are drug to be happy with a drug called ... that they are they they're emotionally manipulated be happy and then there are these primitive sort of live out in the middle of nowhere as people used to the question and brave new world really is whether the brave new world is good or whether it's bad it's pretty obvious that it's bad for people who live in western civilization which means you have to ask yourself why\nAs far as other books along those lines obviously the worst and George Orwell or along the lines animal farm in Nineteen eighty four a post apocalyptic fiction I was just some that's actually a book I recommended this week\nA submission it's sort of along these lines a product take on what is happening in Europe I mean the undercover story of the of the year is that the European human rights commission\nThey ruled today that it is proper to find someone for speaking against the prophet

Luther an annual designer\nAnd Hannah rent well I mean you'd have to boot ... is the closest to an\nActual Jewish loss I don't know where workable minded that while I'm gonna leave them out a hundred or rent is not particularly a Jewish philosopher she's more of a philosopher who happened to be Jewish her\nConnection to Judaism is is pretty spring Martin ... is the creator of sort of the I doubt

Republican in twenty twenty four you know there are a lot of candidates out there I Would be surprised if Rand Paul doesn't try to make another run I Would be surprised if Nikki Haley doesn't try to make a run in twenty twenty four\nAh I'd be surprised that doesn't try to make a run in twenty twenty four there are a bunch of Republicans out there probably what she has been you'd think a lot actually believes or an argument I was wondering if you could help explain the hatred of Jews from the radical left at the parade around calling everyone else not thanks to\nWell I think that most people on the left are sincere but I don't know that they've really thought through their own arguments which is why I spend a lot of my time when I talked to folks and left trying to get people on the left to recognize the consequences of their own argument by what do they actually believe that route and\nAs far as anti Semitism on the left I'd suggest in the dirt really three main types of anti Semitism in the world right now there's kind of the alt right anti Semitism which is old style racial and religious anti Semitism Jews are inferior or bad or corrupt or greedy or communist because they killed Jesus and all of this kind of stuff\nThat's tied number one and that's pretty terrible an old school that number two is Muslim anti Semitism radical Muslim anti Semitism\nWhich sort of conflate religious anti Semitism with ethnic anti Semitism\nI and you see that throughout the world where hate crimes against Jews are rising in Europe as the radical Islamic population of Europe rises\nAnd third type of anti Semitism is what this anti Semitism where anti Semitism arises for two reasons one second well a lot of like religion very much into\nThe secular left very often believes that basic ... that that basic distribution of resources that it's not even means that the person who's more prosperous somehow victimized the person who was less prosperous just happened to be more prosperous\n\nHe's a registered Republican\n\nHow do they become or how did he stay a registered Republican given the multiple felonies\nHow\nIt can be restored and the lesson utterly apply to

enforcement local state and federal fabulous law enforcement the men and women of local law enforcement the men and women of state law enforcement the men and women a federal law enforcement not talking about they called me types you know what I mean\nI'm Talking about the men and women of local state federal law enforcement that my last trashes every game day\nThat the law that taxes racist as big in every day\nAnd yet here we had Democrats targeted at local state and federal law enforcement people were fabulous they moved quickly they moved effectively\nAnd they track this guy down what forty eight hours or so give or take but don't worry and another week or two nobody trashing law enforcement like\nThey always do like they always do\nAnd what does this criminal justice reform stuff criminal justice reform they called us how the hell that this guy get out of prison\nHe's got a criminal record not as long as his right arm as long as there's less than his right arm misdemeanors felonies\n\nHow did you get out and this was before criminal justice reform we spend way too much time worrying about convicted felons or people who plead the felonies and not enough time worrying about victims of crimes we've spent way too much time worrying\nAbout illegal aliens rather than American citizens we spend way too much time worrying about illegal alien children dreamers rather than an American citizen children\n\nWe allowed to talk about these things I mean I insist on talking about these things now the president\nHas correctly pointed out\nI Know he's an avid listener to this program and I greatly appreciate it\nThat the media really of lead the way with the rhetoric was\nReferences the Hitler would the references to racism anyone they disagree with on the left and that includes the media of course that's how they frame the issues get ...\n\nAnd there been a number of very smart articles written today and yesterday pointing out hey\nLook political rhetoric even bad political rhetoric doesn't\nThat's defy doesn't explain what a nut job like\nThis does it did\nIt simply does not I just gave you a laundry list of the crimes that he committed to and through twenty fourteen\nDonald Trump wasn't even running for president up and to and through twenty four Cheney committed multiple felonies by the multiple felony he was already radicalized\n\nHe didn't need Donald Trump or anybody else to push 'em over the edge you was already over the years\n\nHe's started committing crimes at least from the public record since Nineteen Ninety One all the way through twenty four team\n\nHas nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing whatsoever\n\nLet the left the media the Democrats have a quote unquote registered Republican\n\nAnd Donald Trump he's driving around with what Trump and Pence on his ah pictures of them and their names on his on his band so they make this connection there is no connection\nThere is no connection whatsoever\nNo media trash in law enforcement\nThat Democrats trashing law enforcement the left trashing law enforcement and now I think we can see why we need a law enforcement\n\nExcusing antifa excusing black lives matter ignoring Obama's relationship with actual\nDomestic terrorists billionaires and burning during among other President Trump has no relationship it never did what the actual domestic\nTerrorists underground student terrorists who are actively involved the bombing\n\nNot Donald Trump has not pardoned terrorists members of the FAA all on the Puerto Rican separatist organization you can lay that on Clinton and Obama\nTrump never did that Trump very been suggested that Trump has been supporting the law enforcement that same law enforcement that just tracked down this not drop\nThat law enforcement\nWhen I asked the question again maybe as a registered Republican this job but how did he become a registered Republican how did he not lose his uh his right to vote he's not even supposed to be on the
