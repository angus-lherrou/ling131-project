[laughter] yeah I Know that the introducing the most advanced sleep surface ever created them my pillow mattress top of\nThe villa matches topics are gone by the way is awesome guarantees you the most

that zips right off is completely machine washable enjoyable to trust me but it's uncomfortable don't spend your money on a new one by my poodle matches covering\nThen communist China's plans\n\nNow Medicare for all\nThey would also nearly double the size of the federal government double the size of the federal government a recent analysis of Bernie Sanders current Medicare for all plan which is supported by Gillum and people like him\nFind said it would cost the federal government thirty two point six trillion dollars over the first ten years and we know these analyses are always wrong they're always law thirty two point six trillion dollars plus free college for everybody\nRight free health care\nThe trustees Medicare say Medicare is going broke and eight years eight years so the Democrats have a plan massively expanding\nAnd destroyed the incredible\nAnd that's a vast understatement of its true costs since the analysis assumes direct Kony and payment touch the providers an unrealistic savings from the ministry of and prescription drug costs but also ignores the enormous cost the delays in rationing that invariably result from government run health care in other words\nAll the people who will die all the people who will suffer when the government takes over a system like this\n\nDemocrats pushing Medicare for all say that those costs are irrelevant because people will no longer have to pay premiums are spend any money out of pocket but they don't say is that everyone would face huge tax increases to finance this government takeover of healthcare\nBernie Sanders plant starts with an eight point four percent hike in payroll taxes\nSharply higher income tax rates and more none of which would fully cover the exorbitant costs\n\nHow many more failed countries ladies in general must we copy this is Venezuela this is the prescription of Venezuela\n\nPhony support for Medicare for all Democrats also point just surveys showing strong support [noise] excuse me for Medicaid for Medicare for all a Reuters yep so St Paul found Seventy percent backing\nIt including a majority of Republicans but that's because people have no idea what Medicare for all actually means run Reuters substitutes the term single payer or government run health care support collapses\nWas little I was forty percent down from Seventy percent and that's exactly why the Democrats camouflage their true intentions lie and to see the American people\n[noise] but even that's probably too high forty percent a separate Kaiser Family foundation survey found almost half of Americans wrongly believe they could actually keep their existing health plans under a single payer system incredibly Democrats\nAre the most ill informed the poll found fifty two percent of Democrats think they'll be able to keep their health care plans\n\nI mean that's absurd right if they're going to nationalize healthcare a single payer system destroy Medicare destroy all private insurance including your employer insurance\nWhy are you going to keep your plan\nStill lack of public support didn't stop Democrats from opposing Obama Care of the nation eight years ago won't stop them from opposing quote unquote Medicare for all they ever get the chance the only way to prevent such a disaster is to keep Democrats out of power at least until their socialist fevers breaks\nThis is another reason you need to go to the polls ladies and gentlemen\n\nThese rogue leftists are so thoroughly completely irresponsible they want to impose their ideology on you and these have real\nLife consequences it matters to your family it managed to the health of your family\nIt matters to people who have private insurance it matters that people who are on Medicare it's incredible what they'd

sides of the side of the other side of evil on it the illegal immigrant caravan continues to move up through Mexico there about a thousand miles from the border right now probably less\nAh they're apparently ten thousand people are walking toward the border\nAnd the folks who are in that caravan as I've said I think many of them are looking for a better life they're looking to come into the United states that doesn't mean that the United states has to admit\nAll of those people or any of those people the United states get to pick and choose who we decided to admit to the country and yet this is Catherine the great moral issue if you believe that America should secure as more of this means the or racist and nasty and bigoted and terrible\nAnd if you believe that people should be admitted to the country because they need a better place to live than this one because you don't care\nAbout America's interests the truth is that people who believe in free flow of immigration even for a while the legal immigration\nGenerally they believe that that make the country that are because on a moral level we have to uphold certain\nCharitable instinct I disagree with that assessment that that's where that's coming from and from people say we have to secure our border that is also coming from\nA good place it's coming from the idea that any country that wishes to preserve its strength that can help other people have to have limits on who gets to enter the country so again there's later explained this debate in which we examine everybody ... motives it it's hard to do that in a polarized political environment\nSo President Trump and he uh he had said about the illegal immigrant caravan\nThat there were random middle Easterners in the middle of it and criminals in the middle of it it turns out there may be criminal I'd be shocked if they're not criminals in the middle of that people have been convicted of crimes and deported torn out trying to come back in there is no evidence of of random middle Easterners and he was asked about it here was his statement in response\nOr they could very well be that there's [noise] there's there's no proof of anything that's what they could very well\nAnd there could very well be is not a good answer to an accusation he made about people who are trying to come into the United states again that is a political tactic by the president\nIn order to get people to talk about the ... pie in criminality of the folks who are in that market but it is one it's another way of polarizing topic this is why that both right and left are responsible for what's happening right now in the country I'm not going to pretend that it's just only on one side for my own political purposes I just don't think that's on it\nAt the same time you see the response to that which is Jorge Ramos who sat there no middle Easterners in eastern and the caravan and Tucker is like um there are still criminals and that caravan and Jorge Ramos is right that they're no middle Easterners like well now you're deliberately missing the point in order to castigate the other side is racing\nI spent three days with these refugees and I have not seen a single person from the middle east that's alive and I think a sober you up [noise]\nYou have to tell the truth through your audience and you don't have you have to make sure that people are not lying about this kind of an because [noise] people from the middle east are not part of the way he let me say\nStupidity on one side right stupidity on the other one the president says they're middle Easterners without evidence are part of the Caribbean\nAnd left as well there are no middle Easterners that means the caravans good this is not the central argument in any way shape or form obviously central argument about the caravan is whether the United states have borders that are protected or whether the United states is obligated by morality and decency an international walk a lot of people really cross the border making that latter cases Tom ...\nWho's the head of the DNC and this gets down to the root of the issue and this is where Americans really shouldn't be decided in the ocean on the basis of stupidity is about middle Easterners and care man but on the basis of what are the values we wish to hold his country and how do we protect the country that her ... getting the wrong answer to Jake Tapper on CNN\nWe are a nation of laws and the laws that are on the books deal with issues of refugees and asylum status and those are the laws that have always applied a it's a humanitarian\nIssue of significance and our laws require that people will be treated with dignity and given that process\nOkay well they are given that process they can go to any checkpoint that they wish to go to and they can apply for asylum in the United states\nAgain the implication by Tom ... a little bit is that folks on the other side I don't want to treat people who are trying to cross the border illegally with dignity that is inherently unfair so in essence the theme of today's show and what should be the theme of our politics if we want to have serious discussions both on the other side we have to cut out\nThe idea that they are inherently bad evil thoughts were manifesting that bad and that evil in ways designed to destroy the country all this has to stop and we don't stop it and things are going to get a lot worse before they get any better we'll be back\nHere tomorrow with all the latest maybe we'll know who sent the farms by that point will certainly bring you up to date eventually Russia [noise]\n[noise] [noise] so we have a winning\nCNN received one of these packages it's outrageous that they received a package\nAm I wrong Mr producer didn't somebody tried to break into the Fox local channel in Washington DC yesterday\nWith a weapon and they were shot I mean somebody was actually shot\nI get that threats\nRush gets death threats Hannity gets death threats but I Know I get that threats\nIt's not fun\nIt's not fun and you're worried about your family you're worried about you you look over your shoulder from time to time it's not 'cause you're paranoid just you had to be a little bit more careful\n\nAbout one in ... out there in ... is still with violence it's the most violent organization I'm aware of in politics today it was downplayed by most of the media downplayed same what black lives matter downplayed\n\nAnd I'm not saying this is exclusive to the left\n\nNot saying it's such closer to the left at all we want to know who did this as soon as\nPossible and I believe the FBI we'll figure this out because nothing exploded so they have these ah these packages and these devices are in their original form which will make it much easier for them to track it down ... they'll get the guy or gal the guys or gals\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my past experience with the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down\n\nAnd they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then they\nThey're able to track people down but they need to find this person or these people because they may do it again they may do more of\nIt that's all we know we don't know their motives\nWe don't know their motives well we know the motive uh obviously it's the threatened if not harm if not killed the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why why can't people just white particularly in the media\n\nNow you can see that question though building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other\nI Am so sick of this you have no idea the president of the United states without question faces death threats all the time is it because what the Democrats say about him is it because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about him or Steve ... says about him\n\nOther day that President et cetera rallies in a rally I think it was used in a says he's had nationalist well I'm not a nationalist but not for the reasons the Democrats on the left say he's a nationalist now we know what he means America First and so forth\n\nAnd they tried Thai attend Nazi ism or the ... or ... these this is in the media\n\nNational socialist party notice when people proclaim that their socialist they don't try to tie them to the Nazis it is nationalist socialist right they didn't say that about Bernie Sanders hey he's using Nazi language he's using style and his language no of course not\n\nMost of the media in this country they revealed themselves so for them now to sit back for the most radical among them on cable TV on MSNBC and CNN for the most radical among them on the today show good morning America\nFor the most radical among them now point a finger at Trump went absolutely nothing to do it this is really just further evidence of how outrageous they are\n\nThe person or people who are responsible for this are responsible for this\nAre responsible for this\nDo you think\nThe media in this country over the last two years have been responsible do you think the media in this country over the last few years have been measured\nYou think the media in this country many in the media in this\nCountry cross the line with their references the Hitler Stalin and racism and all the rest of it\n\nYou think Joe Starbucks cross the line or make emergency or Don Lemon or Chris While I'm On the list goes on and on you'd think they cross the line with their heated rhetoric would their poison language\nAnd now\nYou're going to tell you [noise] calm down stop the rhetoric\nThe heated attacks we must bring it down it's too much having ... the flames now that the firefighters\nAnd same with ... the things that she has said and same with Schumer the things that he has said and the things that they did like I like having a guy like Kavanaugh\n\nTo correct the tensions in the society and the anger in this society do they have any responsibility for it\n\nWell if Donald Trump though surely they do I'll be right back [noise] much\nHim on Seventy seven W ...

back if I may if I can find the damn thing though there it is\nThis big race in Florida for the governorship of Florida Florida's a key state and if you don't live in Florida Florida's a key state Texas is a key state to me that the two key states if the Republicans of any open the future of our re electing the president and future Republican presidents they're huge states\nThe second or third most populous states and the Democrats are dying to take them over and they nominated a Bernie Sanders socialists they left us\nWho has overseen a corrupt administration and telling us to be the next governor of Florida it's pushing a Fifteen dollar minimum wage which we know what that does Seattle tried and it was a big failure\nHe's insisting that Florida law enforcement must not and will not\nTurn over criminals who served their terms in state prisons to the federal government to be deported instead he would have been released into your neighborhood that's the only alternative and Jake Tapper did a lousy job of explaining that he didn't explain it at all\nHe wants to Medicare for all which means eliminate Medicare eliminate every private insurance program eliminate employer private insurance programs eliminate insurance companies altogether and the federal government will take over health care\nSeriously folks really\nHe insists on expanding Medicaid in Florida to eight hundred to eight hundred and fifty thousand more people\n\nSays relieving six billion dollars on the table with the fed when he doesn't tell us twenty five cents out of every dollar spent in Florida goes to medicate as it is today and\nYou're not leaving six million dollars on the table because under Obamacare the first few years up medicate the subsidies are we're a hundred percent but they're not always going to be a hundred percent that could be fifty percent they will be thirty percent who knows but you in Florida will pick up the bill\nFor all of it\n\nThe reason you a growth in Florida is because you have people moving to Florida\nWho want to set up businesses are who want to retire there and spend their money at their money there because you don't have a state income tax that's the main reason why he wants to increase taxes forty percent or businesses and that won't be enough you what she's going to push for a state income tax\nWe've seen this happen when Democrats take over these red states they don't have taxes or income tax\nBut here's the thing the guy's corrupt\nYou're not allowed to say these things called a racist while you know what screw that screw that\n\nShow
