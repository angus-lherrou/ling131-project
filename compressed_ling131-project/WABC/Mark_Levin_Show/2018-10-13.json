help them out somehow a neck your your question is important for two reasons one\nIt's very difficult to obtain the kind of information right now because of this insurance first model\nThere is not a much in the line of of consumer price transparency as you noted even looking forward and you're having trouble finding it it is extremely difficult there are a a smattering of health care facilities often not those that are involved in providing major surgery\nThat will provide some price transparency it's part of the important in breaking the back of this model\nIf we did then you would have everybody that would have to compete on a service and outcome type of model just like we do with everything else that's why you know I I make the analogy to all of their insurance products in our lives if you end up having a you know a\nMinor issue with your car you go to a mechanic he get a fix you can shop around you can see what mechanics or reliable which ones you feel good about see what things cost and make that decision if you get into a significant accident\nYou end up filing an insurance claim probably just looking for a good body shop at your insurance company will go and work with right you're not do as much shopping there so the first thing you know even if we can get to this place are going to be some exceptions\nI don't imagine they'll ever be a good time to be shopping for the best price when you're having to go to the emergency room for some major medical of it right or so that would be in a in a moment where it wouldn't necessarily apply there might be\nSome other major surgeries to where it wouldn't necessarily apply it I mean they were talking major surgeries complications that you don't even know about it until\nYou get in there are so like you know there are some of these things will never be solved a by being able to say oh okay well this is everything I Need medically and here's the price\nBut again for all the basics\nIt would provide the level of transparency and that's kind of the the more important point generally but to your specific situation\nUh again I I feel for you in and I wish you the best and I hope that you can find a some providers nearby that would be able to assist you they can't provide some level of transparency what I have done and then they'll tell you that it's not always the most popular thing\nAnd it's not necessarily or something that always comes with an answer\nBut I Will ask people in my wife's got good at this to ask you how much is this going to cost\nAnd it can lead to the health care provider kind of running in circles and every now and then you won't get an answer I have actually not obtained healthcare and in some instances because they couldn't tell me how would something was going to call\nI won't necessarily just signed a piece of paper that says hey whatever happens in here I'm going to pay for I don't provide any of them my Social Security number because they don't have a right to it\nSo in that context you can ask hey here's my situation what am I looking at and hopefully there are some providers that might be able to provide you with at least some guidance on that type of information\nBut again that God blessed and best wishes to you and uh if anybody comes through some specific information make sure that uh your your information there are we uh we have it and that can

and we're going to wrap up this hour of the show where the quick talk about you your investments and your real estate team\nMatch right your team because if you're starting to invest in properties you don't want to do it alone you'll need seasoned professionals by your side every step of the way to make sure your money your time and all your best interests are protected\nBut start with the hub of the wheel you're real chore there the local market experts and they'll know where to look for quality real estate investments don't know how much no cost and how much rent Bill Pullman that's solid data which you need if you want to create an extra income stream\nYour realtor can also help you prepare a winning offer and negotiate on your behalf\nThey'll also be there to take care of all the details that occur between the time you get ratified contract on your new investment and the time you actually sit down at the settlement table and buy it your real trucking also help you assemble other members of your team who are also very important\nStarting with the lender\nRealtors known members in your community they know which ones always deliver the money to the closing table on time and frankly they know which ones don't many real tours and lenders have worked together for decades and so there's a deep trust there you're real trucking\nProbably recommend three or four lenders for you talk to all of them and find out which one might be the best fit for your investment plans\nYou're real jerk and also help you find a quality home inspector because after all if you buy an investment property and then discover later that you have to pour a ton of money into it well there goes your profit your inspector can give you a good idea of whether you might face big bills down the road\nPlus bill carefully examined the property for safety issues which are critically important for landlords and tenants like\nAlso ask you real tour which insurance agencies in your area or experienced in investment properties you'll need to ensure the place just right making sure that I was the landlord you're protected both in terms of the property itself as well as liability\nAnd finally every real estate investor needs an experienced accountant on their team\nThat's especially important because even though you might be familiar with all the tax implications of owning a home with your own\nAlmost all of that changes when it's an investment property all the way from the directions you can claim on the property to the incumbent generates and even how to treat up from one property to another while deferring the taxes on the profit\nThat's really awesome so you can pour the entire profit of your current investment into your next one and pay the taxes later maybe decades later and accounting can help walk you through all of that\nI Know it may sound like a lot but think about this once you assemble your real estate investment team in by your first property\nWhile they'll still be there when you buy your second and third and fourth overtime you'll develop quality relationships with every member of that team will know you and you'll know them and they all know what your goals are and how you hope to achieve them\nAnd you can expect that every one of your team members will be a powerful and helpful ally as you build your real estate portfolio and become set

course we'll take your questions about other things and cosmetic surgery a but we're going to focus a little bit tonight\nOn liposuction so what is the procedure it started in Nineteen eighty three in France came to the United states shortly thereafter I started my residency at the University of Chicago in Nineteen eighty five so it was a brand new procedure in those years we were we were using fairly big tubes we made in citizens\nAnd for the most part in those days in the Nineteen eighties liposuction was on in the belly and the thighs that's about it\nOr we use pretty big tubes and that we made in ... and put a tube and broke up that sucked it out and boy that was a remarkable procedure because before that if you had heavy thighs\nExpect if you really want it surgery expect to have a big long incision were skin was lifted up and fat was kind of carved out put back it was a it was a procedure that was that in the hospital\n[noise] not a popular procedure\nHigh complication right bleeding infection things like that and when liposuction came in and we can do these procedures to quarter inch or one third of an inch incision\nMy goodness that revolutionized plastic surgery and up to this day thirty something years later it is still the most common procedure in cosmetic surgery well you know some years that's breast augmentation\nSome years it's liposuction that kind of a it's like a horse race one year it's one and one year at the or the other but liposuction has gone through phases so in the beginning it was a\nKind of a high complication a rape procedure because we did not understand how much to take out and how to do it so after it was introduced in the Nineteen eighties we started we started infusing a liquid that contains epinephrine also known as adrenalin into the tissue\nAnd boy that cut way down on the bleeding so we we're limited very limited to a relatively small procedures back in the mid Nineteen eighties and when we were able to put this fluid into the area that would be section\nA we cut the bleeding down from really several units of blood\nTo maybe a half a unit of loving and you say well that's still a lot of bleeding isn't it well\nYou know you go to the red cross you donate hopefully a lot of you do this you donate a unit of blood which is also a pint of blood it's the same thing one unit is one pint\nYou or you give that they give you some cookies maybe some juice and you drive yourself home and say well I just lost the unit of blood that's a lot of blood and I'm able to drive myself home and the same thing with a surgical procedure so even if we lose a unit\nA you know a pint of blood well that's not so bad we make it back in that they are very short amount of time just a few days maybe a week or so\nOr to make that blood back but we don't want to lose a lot more than that we don't want to lose two or three units of blood that would be considered excessive you'd be dizzy afterwards and heaven forbid we do not want to have to transfused people uh with liposuction and so\nWith the procedure we developed techniques so that we cut way down on bleeding we have smaller tubes\nUh we used this epinephrine solution which way down on bleeding and we also limited the number of areas and the amount that would be sufficient and with that we went through a learning curve in the Nineteen eighties but by the mid Nineteen nineties liposuction was an exceedingly safe procedure\nA rare to have a complication and an enormously high satisfaction procedures so we do\nUh well let's say we do hips that's a very common area and women and thighs that's the most common area\nIn men the belly is the most common area and in men and women the neck very very common but liposuction is not just an independent procedure where you come in and I do liposuction it's also a very important part of other procedures that which is ... almost every facelift that I Do\nWear suction and fat with liposuction almost every breast reduction I Do wear sanctioning fat with liposuction and almost every tummy tuck that I Do ... with liposuction so it's a tool and it is also a procedure\nSo we're going to take a ... a short break we're going to come back to the break we're going to talk about the nuts and bolts of liposuction I Want you to give me a call if you've got questions about the procedure or you're going

O. two lasers carbon dioxide lasers for wrinkled reduction now\nUh to the exclusion of many other treatments he's all but given up a chemical pills I still think chemical appeals are useful for color issues for evening out skin tone I think uh that's a better if you don't have wrinkles but if you've got wrinkles\nAnd uh what we called just crawl mayor how's that for word that's your word for the day this crummy or a you know ... pigmentation of the skin\nA then we'll often or will often or do\nA the laser as opposed to the peel which is a Ford just color\nAnd by the way what if you are if you look at your face and you have a lot of these little raised things on your face particularly if you had a little bit of color and your skin if you are let's say Puerto Rican or Indian or African American and you have all these little raised brown things on your skin\nA cannot laser those no we don't want a laser those off this week uh I did one of these sessions it's a kind of a marathon session I took off hundreds of these\nFrom a young lady who might be listening now hello are and what I Do is I Know these up and I shave them off it's very low tech but it works very well\nAnd uh after having hundreds of these on her cheeks and and really you know it's it's one of those things you can't cover them with makeup you have to ah just sort of live with them or you have those shaved off why don't I laser those off\nWell I you know I can get a little better control of the depths of this and the depth of the decision and also the laser does have a little bit of heat injury to it and if you've got some color in your skin the laser has more risk\nOf giving you either a a a lightning a lightening of your skin or even a darkening of your skin\nA so if I shave those off I've got the ultimate control but that's where the uh the skill of a surgeon comes in and I always say you know the laser is a great tool a but it does involve a lot less skill than the actual scalpel and actually doing these procedures by hand\nOr which we've been doing for a long time and a very important that surgeons don't lose those skills because uh in situations like what I did this week we revert right back to what we've been doing for an awful long time\nAll right so I'm a board certified plastic surgery and I see patients all week long uh to help you to help you look better and I get a lot of patients that come in and you know they might have had\nA little too much and that's getting to be more and more common by the way\nA it is a you know cosmetic surgery has been kind of labeled as well it's nothing you know you have a procedure you go back to work the next day people talk about that all the time\nAnd they minimize and ... entertainment my eyes is that a word or they try and uh and make cosmetic surgery seem like entertainment so\nAh let's go ahead and take a phone call but then I Want to talk about overdone plastic surgery and what we need to do about that problem Krista what can I Do for your what is your wrinkle\nHello yes pursue what can I Do for you\nUh yes I've been using the soap and uh and the nighttime ... however I notice that um after you that so\nI get dry patches on save myself where you're talking about yeah okay and then um when I use that nighttime it actually\nWell I have well yeah I guess this is not a stage phone call [laughter]\nAll right so well let's talk about this first of all this I'm really surprised about that with the so because it is such a mild so but you know something that the truth is Chris ... and not going to do\nThat and burned if the nighttime what happened nighttime\nOkay so let's let's talk about what's in nighttime that might be burning you first of all night time really works it's it's real it's got a ph of three point five now what does that mean I Know I don't know if you're a chemist I don't know if anyone's that Camus out there but let's talk about ... for a second\nAnd ah anyway um [noise]\nIt's been cancelled but it is interesting that there are many people that have way too much cosmetic surgery and on that show\nUh they violate is many of the basic principles of cosmetic surgery so when I trained at the University of Chicago with a guy named Tom critic who was that was one of the great plastic surgeons of all time\nOr one of the lessons that we were taught is that people should not come in with photographs\nOf celebrities should not want to look like other people they should want to look better\nFor themselves and it should be a kind of a better version of you not\nTo look like someone else and why is that well you know first of all it's not easy to do that and second that becomes a psychiatric issue to be very honest with you it it really does because we should be happy with who we are yeah you know if your nose is too big we can make it smaller if your hips are\nYou know enormous we can make them smaller if your breasts hang it it really bothers you and clothing we can we can reduce your brass or or lift your breath but but we want to be you know I Want to make you look normal and I want to make you look natural and I certainly don't want to make it look like\nYou know a Victoria Principal or Justin Bieber or a or J. lo or someone like that we want to make you look like you and better so if you bring photographs in\nTo the uh to be consultation you know it's it's okay to bring photographs of yourself\nWhen you were younger but it's really not okay you know for you to bring in shares photograph I Want to look like share in Nineteen sixty five we're not going to do you have to find a different plastic surgery and unfortunately there are plastic surgeons out there\nThat will do things like that but they miss the lecture in medical school and they miss [laughter] as my opinion they miss the lecture and residency\nOr because that's not what we want to be doing and the same goes for over done plastic surgery and what does that mean that means\nPeople that have simply done too much and\nYou don't have to be a plastic surgeon to identify those people you know you can just look in the Upper East side of Manhattan or Beverly Hills or a book on television you know the Emmys are coming up the Oscars are coming up\nJust look and look and you know I don't look at the shows I don't care who wins I just look at the cosmetic surgery when I watch the shows and it's really remarkable what people do even celebrities because some of them go so far that they actually ruined their careers and they really do but many\nPeople come in to see me and you know okay the guy on the radio you're the savior no no no I'm a plastic surgeon I think I'm a well trained plastic surgeon I Love doing what I Do but\nIf you've come in and you've had\nFourteen different procedures and or your faces pulled so tied and or your lips started distorted in your face is distorted you know sometimes the best thing is to simply do nothing and that's a hard thing for people to realize because people want to come in and and look better\nBut you know I have people come in and they've had silicone injected into their face I've had a lot of people in the last six months with silicon and they have the same issues silicone\nCauses scarring in the face and I'm not talking about silicon rubber chin implants which are perfectly fine or silicone breast implants which is contained silicon I'm Talking\nAbout the injection of liquid silicone which is still being done and there are a dermatologist mostly I don't know any plastic surgeons that do this\nBut there are a dermatologist that do this in Manhattan and\nI'll tell you I've seen a lot of those patients recently and it's not good because\nThat material causes scarring it causes the nasal Abe you'll fall to kind of get sick\nAnd I've seen people that it's falling over itself and what that means is it's injected into the fold and then there's so much scarring that the fold actually paradoxically thickens because you get scarring\nAnd I've seen a I saw one last week who had it injected into her over her cheek bones and she's got kind of a red red due to the cheats and to one cheek and that worries me a lot because if you do get infection with a injection of silicon\nOr injection of another foreign material that's a hard problem to deal with\nSo I see people are frequently who have had silicone injected or have\nFunny implants are that are not kind of the uh the status quo in plastic surgery but you know you'll find someone to do almost anything in this field\nUh and I've had a funny funny things are where are these chin implants where it's just enormous or a a lift implants which you know I've taken them out I haven't put them in or these funny or stitches in the neck and you know it's [noise]\nYou really have to do your homework first of all you have to choose your plastic surgeon well uh find out where they did their ... went to medical school find out where they went into the residency make sure they're certified by the American board of plastic surgery I get some references from other patients that's one\nSo part of it is choosing the right class surgeon and making sure\nThat the surgeon is willing to say no no we're not going to do that I've had people this is an interesting one I had one patient from Russia who came in with a vial of something and she wanted me to injected into her and I said well wait a minute first of all it's a felony [laughter] we don't want to do that\nAnd second what on earth is that stuff or you know but\nThere are things that are approved and other countries or that you cannot use in the United states even if someone legitimately just brings it end it's the surge and that's going to get in trouble for doing that and rightfully so we don't want to do things that are not\nApproved FDA approved a real drugs and ah and and things that are are\nAre ah you know\nProven scientifically to be safe\nSo anyway I have these ... patients that bring those things that and I have patients that just ask me for more and and I sit there and I tell them well you know in your situation the best thing you could do is nothing\nLet things dry out but if we try and put more filler in we could potentially contaminate the silicone thats in your face\nIf I if I Try and put up more filler and I could even make your lips worse we want to let things settled down that's a hard one for a lot of people because you know when you come into a plastic surgeon\nYou want help you want to look better and you don't want to be turned down but sometimes that is the smartest thing for the plastic surgeon and the smartest thing for the patient\nBut I Do know that if we do turn people down a lot of times people will shop and as I always say\nIf you're willing to keep on looking you'll find someone that is willing to do anything and that's not necessarily good uh an off and it's not I again I'll never forget my first year practice I had a woman who came in she had a D. V. T. and a leg ah about six months before and she wanted liposuction of her knees\nI said David ... is a blood clot in the last\nAnd uh it's a dangerous thing and it's a travels to your lungs that can be potentially life threatening so so certainly we don't want to do surgery in the early period or maybe even ever if it's cosmetic surgery\nIn the area that you've had a DVD and you know what even if it's not in the area I sent people to a vascular surgeon after they've had a DVD a blood clot\nTo be cleared to make sure there's no residual clot or scarring in the bank but that's kind of a different story nevertheless this particular woman I said you know it's not a good idea it's dangerous to do this\nAnd we don't want to I'm going to turn it down we're not going to do liposuction the best thing you can do is not habits so she went to someone else had her procedure and yes\nHad another DVD you know you don't want to say I told you so ah because I don't but\nYou know if a plastic surgeon turns you down for a medical reason or a psychological reason or you've had too much and that doctor thinks that ah if you do more you're\nLike I said on the TV show one procedure away from disaster you know listen to the doctor because this is how they make their living that's what they do so if they're turning you down\nThen you know that's like a parents saying you know don't play in traffic you know I don't want to see you get hurt we're not going to have you played stick ball out in the streets if anyone do that any more about the way\nSo so listen to the classic sure you have to trust or the doctor and that's where as I say choosing the right doctor you know and I wrote a book about the straight talk about cosmetic surgery which you can still get\nOn Amazon dot com where one final plug for the book I'm Dr Arthur Perry this has been what's your ankle right here on WABC the power goes so\nQuickly I'm Sorry I didn't get to all the phone call so I I tend to talk a lot she

I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with resume or a trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay on South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're ... found in our diet in all considered super fuel the green tea human humans very rich me why did you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect you meet each other worst you call in a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all\nIn separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually\nRetired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for the G ... what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal in July ... issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity\nIn whole want you to sign on to recap\nSome of these headlines you tell me why you're such a green tea advocate\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume but don't actually\nWind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body\nFrom premature destruction due to exposure\nTo environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in the right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right\nAntioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue to sigh on\nSo you've taken the green tea extract you build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to fire on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplementing gradients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on you by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo\nFormula would be offering free bought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human would you smelled C.

program here grape seed extract in pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds\nThat not only do much of what I've already described but also enhanced the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels send the skin so we put those in there for extra boost in antioxidant activity\nBut also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the curriculum and then there is there a troll the bio flab annoyed and hence\nThe overall activity of vitamin C.\nAnd vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we
