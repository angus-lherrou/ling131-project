I have to look for someone to various force behind world events\nThat will be the ... and against violent because if you believe that you have power and that means the Jews must be stopped\nThat's what drove this white supremacists in Pittsburgh and you look at his feet it was all about the Jews have too much power the Jews must be stopped so anti Semitism is a different inclined not just the difference in degree and the second theory of anti Semitism is that all anti Semitism is just basically\nA small version of generalized bigotry bigotry comes in all forms of anti Semitism is just bigotry against Jews that sort of the perspective that brought the bottle is pushing in the aftermath of the shooting in Pittsburgh he said we grieve for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh all of us have\nTo fight the rise in anti Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those look love or pray differently okay so the idea is you're the anti Semitism is just another iteration of intersection of racism basically there is this dominant society that hate minority group Jews are minority group and that's why the dominant side hates them\nThe first version of anti Semitism suggests that America is just it's a story right ... so that means that America is a success story specifically because America\nDoes not see this grave ill that his plaguing the world as as the Jews or anything like that that that speaks to America's national liberty ie version of ... of anti Semitism ... subset of general as bigotry that version of anti Semitism that really suggest\nThat the that America's badly because even if the United states is different\nIt's only different because the Jews are white the reason that anti Semitism isn't bad in the United states is because Jews are more powerful and they are higher on the intersection all hierarchy of power than other groups now what this leads to on the left\nIs they believe the anti Semitism is actually less important than other forms of bigotry specifically because the less sees all bigotry as rooted in hierarchy to power the Jews are powerful its user rich if Jews are tolerated in the United states that means anti Semitism is less important than other forms of bigotry\nAnd that means that you can attribute Jewish access not freedom\nAnd said you can it for the lack of anti Semitism Jews gaining power themselves\nBecause Jews can actually be outstripped miniature sexual hierarchy by other forms of racism and so the intersection of version of the of one anti Semitism it actually can lead to more anti Semitism because what did you just as if the Jews escape anti Semitism if the Jews succeed in Israel did you succeed in the United states that is an effect\nOn them climbing at enter sexual power hierarchy\nAnd not leaving behind their membership in the group victim put in a group victim click and this is why the ... version of anti Semitism is not only wrong it is actually counterproductive and leads to more anti Semitism and has been mainstream into the Democratic party today understanding anti Semitism is the key to fighting it\nAnd I fear that a lot of folks don't actually understand what anti Semitism is or if they do they're ignoring it\nWe'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest news from low back with regard to President Trump's immigration plan awesome latest for for the bench here [noise]\n\nUh the uh

preservation of our on our way to but writes is left to law enforcement particularly our community neighborhood police officers to ensure that our lives property and everyday activities are safeguard\nBelieve police officers are also in the front lines is the first responders when the public's threatened by acts of nature such as earthquakes are hurricanes why accept man than endanger the public safety\nIn certain instances are police officers service neutral protectors of our rights as citizens such as car to guarantee the safety of peaceful protesters who may marched on a public

birthright citizenship then we'll get an all the rest of it\n[noise]\nRyan said something today that I thought it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up\nI heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide than a first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay\nNobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old ins started to interpret it that way as the bureaucracy ...\nThis is all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens there's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it so the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is and so when the president is asked\nAbout it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on executive no you can't change the constitution by executive order what does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't which all explained in a minute that hears\nThe current speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months but now he feels compelled to speak out go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in in in the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise] um and that would involve a very very to link the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house\nWho cares not one ... about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one where you have so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges in New Jersey who say the same exact same ignorant beyond belief illiterate when they come to the fourteenth amendment\nSo I decided let's play a little piece that I did in twenty Fifteen\nOver three years ago we can go back further but that's long enough to provide a basic foundational understanding of what\nThose who wrote the fourteenth amendment and ratified the fourteenth amendment actually\nMeant that's got to cut Eighteen go\nAnd yet nobody did a better job of explaining this then professor Edward earlier who I've talked about over the years\nAnd he's a professor at California State University and he was also at the er Claremont Institute senior fellow there are more than that happens to me right\nAnd he testified before a subcommittee a Congress many years ago almost Twenty years ago\nAnd he set forth the case now he's not the only one professor Thomas west as a leader growl yeah has professor at the University of Texas law school maybe more than them the framers of the constitution\nOr set forth that is a primary the fourteenth amendment go have after the civil war three amendments to the constitution the Thirteen fourteen Fifteen called the civil war amendments and we know pretty much what occurred\nProfessor earlier was testifying you said it's my considered opinion Congress has the authority under section five of the Fourth Amendment\nTo define the jurisdiction of the United states of the fourteenth amendment accords and did it as my contention that Congress has exercise that power on many occasions and most recently and immigration reform of control lack of Nineteen eighty six and I would say they also exercise that\nWith the illegal immigration reform an immigrant responsibility act ... Ninety six he points out senator Jacob how are you are now going to know more than anybody else ladies in Germany you know one of the things I find when I signed books and it's good to do it because I get to talk to so many of you\nPeople say mark your show is different because you really get into the substance now we have fun don't get me wrong we do our thing too\nBut we do really get into the substance it's one\nThing to say yeah yeah yeah obviously the constitution doesn't provide that's not enough\n\nThat's not enough so when you're in a debate format or political format or a classroom format or this format you need to back it up and that's what we do here\nWe back it up senator Jacob Howard the author of the citizenship clause in the fourteenth amendment he spoke he told us what he meant\nHe defined who would fall within the quote jurisdiction of the United states unquote\nReady quote\nEvery person born within the limits of the United states\nAnd subject to their jurisdiction meaning the states they're just this is by virtue of natural law national law a citizen of the United states\nThis will not of course include all persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families have been ... foreign ministers credited the government of the United states\nBut will include every other class a person's it settles the great question of citizenship and removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United states this has long been a great issue in the jury stick if George prudence and legislation of this country\nWhich the call screener Mr producer you understand that right\nIs it not plain English is he not as clear as can be that it does not include alliums that does not include foreigners that does not include families are within bachelors or foreign ministers\nSo the author of citizenship clause intended to count foreigners alien to those born to a bachelor's foreign ministers\nAs outside the jurisdiction of the United states that senator Jacob Howard he knew as this reference to natural law indicates that the Republican base has little are Republican basis for citizenship\nIs consent ten cent of the country you can't self and my great you can't claim\nJurisdiction because you happen to walk into the United states senator Lyman Trumbull chairman of the Judiciary Committee any powerful supporter the fourteenth amendment\nRiver spring rehabilitation is New York's premiere facility in helping older adults live forward with her near replacement ... surgery reverse bring rehabilitation features one of the nation's most comprehensive and innovative services to get you back on your feet\nAs quickly as possible river spring rehab is part of the river spring helps family of care solutions who have been providing care to older adults for over one hundred years river spring rehabilitation emphasizes individual care was a personalized\nPlan for each patient through physical and occupational therapy speech and language therapy rubber spring rehabilitation mixed recovery upon\nThe meaningful journey called eight hundred fifty six senior Gillette river springs expert care counselors assist you in returning to your best selves if you're a senior recovering from an injury operation\nOr health condition river spring health can assist you win living forward contact river spring today eight hundred fifty six senior that's eight hundred five six seven three six for sex or visit river spring health dot org slash rehabilitation\nI Am Dr sleeping and I've been performing pro therapy for almost Twenty years is the natural treatment that simulates feeling and ligaments tendons and joins stay away from steroid shots avoid surgery instead you'll naturally would roll therapy with\nMore than twenty five years of clinical studies would successful outcomes research has proven furlough therapy works for many pain conditions call Dr sleeping today two oh one eighty two Fifteen hundred to a one eighty two Fifteen hundred two oh one a day to Fifteen hundred or energy pro low dot com\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nSex fund to seven nine six four or five that's F.

really learn anything to interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nA convincing citizenship when the children of illegal aliens\nAnd then we have Paul Ryan let's play cuts six again Mr moose and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch checking back the Saudi do interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\nYou know that's not who is changing immigration laws you know I brought as a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent you write so very conservative review a and a Daniel Horwitz what is speaker\nRyan even talking about\nOh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the loss of your patriot dead he's a he's in a better place thank you\nUm you know this is constitutional constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd he has the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you could do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is that even if we agree to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't want kids are a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive Lee but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring\nThis and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seem to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... list and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly what they meant\nAnd nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia but Delia style liberalism right on even if it didn't say any subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the ... arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access to the court in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and\nA federal law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could have never fathom such an egregious argument\nThat someone who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpret it as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage well I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nBecause of problems with the
