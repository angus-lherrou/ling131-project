location\nWith our special show scary thing all about how sometimes issues involving\nReal estate can keep you up all night but when you know the fact most of the time it's not so frightening after all\nTalk about something scary back when real estate today first launched we were right in the middle of the economic downturn\nWhether they suffered a foreclosure or they were forced into a short sale for many people the most frightening real estate nightmare of all came true they lost their houses\nMillions of families had to pack up and leave they had to rent or live with relatives and they had to explain to their children that the family had to move\nIt was heartbreaking time not just a real estate but for all of America\nAs we all know things are better now much better the rate of foreclosure is tiny now compared to bend the economy is stronger more people have jobs good jobs real estate values have rebounded almost everywhere and once again\nWe're finally in a good place but\nEven so I wanted to talk to you for some reason you are in trouble and still at risk of losing your home because even though the flood of foreclosures has passed some people still need help they need information and they need to know their options [noise]\nFirst of all if you're having trouble making your mortgage payments talk to your lender right away they might be able to modify your loans so that your payments are lower every month\nOr they might allow forbearance in which they give you permission to skip a few payments while you get back on your feet later on those payments are added at the back end of your own\nNow the worst thing you can do is nothing calling your lender is really important to\nIt's been might be able to help if not you can always try another lender but again don't just stay in your house worrying and doing nothing\nNow if you don't get anywhere with your lender go on line to the federal housing Finance Agency they have two programs you should know about once called harp the housing affordable refinance program that can allow homeowners to refinance even if they owe more than they're homeless work\nGo online and check it out you know it does have rules for instance you need to be current on your mortgage payments but give it a look and see if it might help you\nThe other is the principal reduction modification program also at the federal housing Finance Agency now that's new and in some cases of allows your loan amount to be reduced so you are less and your payments will be less also every month\nThe program is actually designed for people who are behind on their mortgages so it's only for those who are in the most desperate circumstances but if that you this could be just to help you need\nAgain it's the principal reduction modification program you can find it on line at the federal housing Finance Agency\nNow also get in touch with your local and state governments ever since the crash many of them have created helpful programs for people who are having trouble holding on to their homes find out what might be available in your area and whether you might qualify\nYou see keeping people in their homes is really important that keeps neighborhood strong keeps the kids in school and keeps families on the right track\nSo there's a lot of help available out there again the housing crisis is now over and done with for most people but that doesn't mean everybody and even if there's one family out there who needs help maybe yours you should know that help is available\nAnd here it realistic today you can count on

are very easily helped by Botox because Botox paralyze the muscle\nThat makes those wrinkles and it makes it more difficult for you to ... around and make those wrinkles and and it turns out there are many studies now that show that people\nWho are used Botox are less depressed and less angry because there's some sort of a strange feedback mechanism that if you can't ... around and if you can make these faces\nA then you actually are happier it's it's these are not studies done by play it sounds like a great marketing thing doesn't it uh but it's not done by plastic surgeon these are done by psychiatrists and psychologists and others that's really true but the reason I'm Talking about Botox this week\nIs not because of all those things that you already know uh but there was a good study that was published last week that showed how to speed up the effects of Botox\nNow generally when I inject Botox and I do it every single day in Manhattan or New Jersey practices wherever I Am that day\nUsually Monday's Tuesdays I'm In Manhattan and other days I'm In New Jersey and Botox is just one of those things that I Do virtually every single day and I do it myself I don't delegate it to other people I think there is a very artistic approach\nTo performing Botox to injecting Botox so that you don't look funny you don't look a you know like Joan Rivers used to make the jokes about Botox in my smiling and my drooling you know there's there's a good way to do it and there is a bad way to do it and I'm sure you've all seen\nThe bad Botox out there the people that that arch their browse they kind of look like or\nI don't know some sort of cartoon character you know who those people are there on television and I always wonder you know how to these people have such bad Botox well anyway Botox takes\nA between two and fourteen days to kick in to start so when I injected it doesn't happen immediately every now and then I have an odd you know I don't mean an odd person but an odd patient\nThat has an immediate results and I can only believe that that's a psychological effect because you know it's a biologic phenomenon with Botox it can't\nWork immediately but yeah and occasionally it does usually it takes between two and fourteen days to see the effect Botox last between two and six months on average four months\nSo there was a study or in the journal the American Academy of dermatology this week and it showed that if you exercise the muscle right after receiving the Botox if you exercise then it spreads the Botox more quickly in the muscle\nAnd on average Botox will work\nOne day earlier you know they compare groups of people and it was about one day but it was statistically significant and it was really a repeatable study which means it's probably real it's a real effect that if you exercise the muscle\nSo here's how you do you do raise the motions of the far ahead and then you scale and you do these three sets of forty repetitions it's really like going to the gym and exercising right but it's a it's doing these three repetitions ten minutes apart\nAnd that's all you need to do you you are you exercise after receiving the boat socks and you're kind of squish that Botox around the muscle and it does seem to have an earlier onset now it doesn't last any longer\nOr if you do that I'm the ultimate effect is exactly the same but it will work a little bit faster so in my office so I'm going to start doing this\nUh since the paper was really irrefutable very interesting new study about both talk All right I'm Dr Arthur Perry this is

All right I'm Dr Arthur ... this is what's your ankle eight hundred eight for eight nine to two to eight hundred eight for eight\nW. A. B. C. how many of you have had I Ryan a plastic what is right up plastic\nYou know plastic surgeons love coming up with these words\nYou know a rhino plastic I'm getting a little bit of an echo there ah Bruce but\nUh but uh hopefully hopefully it sounds great to the uh the millions of listeners from Maine to Virginia\nA but regardless of Ronald ... is a very very common procedure in cosmetic surgery and it's a you know euphemistic Lee called a nose job and so many people have had it it's perennially one of the more common procedures\nIn cosmetic surgery and I do many many Ronald ... is in fact it's one of my favorite procedures and and the reason it is is because it is the most creative procedure in all of cosmetic surgery and probably in all of surgery\nA not not any or rather know to noses are like in a uh in life or in the operating room and it is very interesting when we operate on the nose I discover all sorts of interesting things like a\nLot of people tell me that they never broken their nose and we find fractures of the nose refined fractures of the cartilage and a half to think on our feet and repair though so\nRegardless a Ronald classy being such a popular procedure you wonder you know is a because everybody happy with it and the vast majority of people are happy there was a very very interesting study\nThat just was published and they looked at women who had Rana Plaza these ten women with Ronald classes and they compared the before and after photographs and uh obviously if you have your nose done you want to look better after surgery right and and you expect that and everybody expects that\nBut what do you really expect other people will think and most of my patients telling me they don't want enormous changes they don't want to\n... you don't want us to be obvious and and certainly we don't want to perform what's called the signature run a plastic and that's a procedure that uh uh you know these ... have been done and then by the same doctor so the noses all kind of look alike I pride myself on\nA having each knows being very individualize but anyway in this particular study there were ten women who had run a playoff season there before and after photographs were placed side by side and two hundred and sixty four people were asked to evaluate which photograph look better\nAnd they gave them eleven different traits of the parents or personality to evaluate the photographs on\nNow in ten of eleven categories symmetry youth from this visual harmony likeability trustworthiness interesting huh confidence femininity attractiveness approach ability and intelligence in\nCanada the eleven categories the post operative photographs were significantly more favorable now remember these are lay people not physicians evaluating these photographs and asked to to say you know is this person more trustworthy before or after the run up and it's very interesting\nOr that they weren't told which was before and which was after a but they always chose the post operative one the only thing the only category where they weren't uh uh I\nAnd yet was on hormone replacement therapy or gynecologist said let's taper it I've never heard of that well I mean I guess I have heard but there's really no need to tape or we need to just stop\nThe hormone replacement therapy so when you go to your doctor your plastic surgeon and talk about a upcoming surgery your doctor has the obligation to you to keep us safe as possible and that means evaluating you before surgery\nWith for all your medical issue so\nUh I Do a stress test for everyone over sixty years old and you could you stress tests\nThat means you get on a treadmill and we want to make sure that your heart is okay we want to stop or things like birth control pills or home on replacement therapy and have you or be seen by a board certified internal medicine doctor\nTo make sure that everything is tip top and ready to go because let's face it this is not surgery a that is required this surgery that you're doing to make yourself look better and feel better it's important to surgery but we certainly want to minimize the risk so\nThat you know if your doctor tells you to stop the birth control pills and you say you know I'll take the risk no no doctors should simply not do your surgery you should not be on birth control or home on replacement\nAnd you know I get in these arguments we've gone to college is all the time because they said well it's only a small increase\nWell you know what we don't want any increase in the risk\nRight on board certified plastic surgeon Dr Arthur Perry this is what's your wrinkles right here on WABC so we were talking about ... before and talking about how people are in general happier after Ronald plastic and they're judged by other people to look better and all these uh strange characteristics\nUh are attributed to them if they have a nicer looking knows it it's it's I guess it's sort of sad that our society judges what how we act\nBased on how we look but you know this is life and uh unfortunately you're not going to be able to change that so a lot of last these are one of the more popular procedures and one that I enjoy doing immensely because it's very creative so what goes into a ride a plastic\nWell before the operation we uh we sit down and you tell me\nWhat you feel is wrong with your nose is a too big\nA is there a hump is a broad is at ... you know both you know above us is that the er the Carl malls and try and remember that one real wide at the tip\nSo not every knows is too big summer just a have a improper angles summer too short there's lots of different variants in a in a less than perfect nose\nAnd so we sit down and I examined your nose by feeling it that's how plastic surgeon examines and as I feel the cartridges and bones of your nose and then I look inside your nose\nTo make sure that the ... which separates the two chambers of the nose is straight and to make sure there are no surprises in there like I have examined people who have been a cocaine users and have found\nPretty big holes between the nostrils they're so don't do that\nA after that I take photographs of you\nAnd we put your photographs up on the computer screen and I do too dimensional photos those are the standard photos and now the three dimensional photos on what's called the ... system it's pretty cool because we can rotate your image around and uh and it's it's really a very interesting way to ah to look at your face in three dimensions on the computer screen\nSo we do that and then I manipulate the images and this is really eye opening for you and for me because what we do is we change\nThe nose on the computer so I might get rid of the ... for instance and a lot of people say well I don't want the hump removed just just touch the tip and if I narrow the tip you see what happens to the rest of those\nAnd some times uh most of the time we have to do a complete Ronald plastic as opposed to just doing one little thing that you think is wrong because every little action that I perform on the nose affects the other parts of the nose and I can demonstrate that with the computer and so\nWe try to arrive at a photograph a picture of your nose on the computer screen that you like that you say yeah yeah that's that's good I like that\nIf I Can't do that if we can't agree on something I Can't operate on you\nBecause I'm not going to go into the operating room guessing that you'll like this we we are certainly want to have a plan an operative plan and the way I look at those photographs it's sort of the same way and architect designs of house you know he doesn't just tell the carpenters to go out there and start putting up pieces of wood he's got a plan and\nJust like a carpenter or an architect might have some onsite changes in the operating room as I mentioned earlier or sometimes there are surprises so often I Will find that someone did break their nose and sometimes it's just a cartridge break not necessarily a bone break\nAnd heels and you know you might remember oh yeah when I was sixteen I get smacked in the face or had a a a ... a skiing injury or something and I had a bloody nose and and lo and behold Thirty years later I see the crash cartilage 'cause it never quite hills but it's connected with scar\nAnd so are we find that out in the operating room and have to be able to fix that so each a operation\nFor Iran to blast the is different and that there are some set steps that we go through but every body is a little bit different and that that's what makes the operation really very interesting so what what does it take a Ronald classy is about a two and a half to three hour operation\nAnd ah that's that's typical there are some people that do run up last season Fifteen or thirty minutes and I personally would not want that Dr operating on me because this is not a rush we don't want to\nDo it or you know have the the speedy is Ronald ... I'll never forget I did a a um I saw a woman a few years ago\nWho had to run a plastic in Philadelphia by up by ... just to advertise the Fifteen minute ride up last and she walked around for ten years with a terrible to formulate what we call up the Nokia deformity her nose was he long gated light Pinocchio and when she came to me after I think it was nine years she walked around that way\nUh I said yes we can fix it it's very complex the way that you're around a flask was done but I can fix that\nAnd she said she never realize that it could be fixed so went to the operating ever took five hours for that operation because I had to take currently from her ear\nTo reconstruct the missing cartilage from her nose and then take everything down several sizes and afterwards it really looked quite nice and I show her pictures all the time in my office\nUh but uh we don't want to do a Fifteen minute ride a classy we want to do it carefully shows a carefully planned route of plastic and one that hopefully we do not have to repeat although\nAlthough rhino classes are have the highest redo rate of any procedure and cosmetic surgery nationwide it's between Fifteen and twenty percent or so it's not uncommon to have to do a little bit more caring what can I Do for you what is your wrinkle\nI had a\nFelt removed from the edge it might not true because of a ... on the line\nAnd that can be done with that I don't have deep folds right now but first of all how old are you\n[laughter] Seventy five\nWhy I don't know why you laugh that's that's still a relatively young age ... so uh yeah so now now is the one they bailout carcinoma was removed did they\nDid they make an incision along the length of the nasal ab ... and by the way for listeners out there the naval ab ... is the fault that connects the corner of the nose\nWith just a outside the corner of the mouth so just for definitions did they go right along that or did they go across it\nWell the law but it looked like a little white had yeah that will put the fear of God that I might lose half my stroller something later on if I didn't do anything\nBut you have to do some basis are carcinoma if\nIt if it's gone untreated it will you will lose your nose in fact\nThe old days in the old days fifty sixty Seventy years ago they were called rodents ulcers how's that one ... cell carcinoma or called wrote it alters because it actually looked like a rat was eating away is not a wonderful thought right\nWell you know so of course you have to get a taking care of and you want to get it taken care of when it's early and that's why every body\nA should visit their preferably a dermatologist once a year and get looked over for it not a plastic surgeon a dermatologist there the big screeners\nFor skin cancers and they'll look over and that you want to have these are things taken care of early so that it is a relatively small thing but we're running out of ... let me just tell you often there are things that we can do to make you look better\nAfter or if it's less than perfect in the in the scar or you'd make a a an appointment with a plastic surgeon and uh can't guarantee anything but\nUsually we can improve the quality of the Scott\nI'm Dr Arthur Perry this has been what's your record right here on W.

I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza ... I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay on South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea ... came in from Tim recruit\nAnd ... from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're ... found in our diet and only considered super feed the green tea human human spiritual why did you want to combine to read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect do you make each other worst you call in a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all\nIn separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both antioxidants so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain\nA healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extract in ...\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines and research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know when he shouldn't have been using it for thousands of years for the G ... what you've seen recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti ... activity\nIn whole blood get assigned to recap\nSome of these headlines of chill me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume they don't actually\nWind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to\nExposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in the right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the\nRight antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue the thigh on\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to ... so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nAll right let's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on Ulysses by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green\nTea combo formula would be offering free\nBrought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human would you smelled C.
