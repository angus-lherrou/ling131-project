doesn't get any worse than this folks that surely does not\nMuch of this money came to Trump because he helped us parents dodged taxes that's at least the fourth time they've used dodged taxes in this and I'm only on the uh let's see third paragraph he and his siblings set up a sham second time sham corporation a disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents records and interview show\nRecords indicate Mr Trump helped his father taken property tax deduction worth millions more you also help formulate a strategy to undervalue is parents real estate holdings my hundreds of millions of dollars on tax return sharply reducing the tax bill but those properties were transferred to him and his siblings\n\nListen to this these maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue service the times found little resistance from the Internal Revenue\nIn other words\nDo you think for two seconds if the IRS thought that any of this was illegal\nThat they wouldn't be resisting it\nPresident's parents Fred and married Trump transferred well over a billion dollars in a while to their children which\nCould have produced they tax bill of at least five hundred and

sought to distance Mr Trump from the tax strategies used by his family's saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives in tax professionals\nWell of course he did you know distancing yourself it's the same exact way the family that owns the New York times handles it they don't do their own taxes\n\nPresident Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever these matters he said the fares were handled by other Trump family members were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law\nWhy doesn't the New York times except that point even as they go on they can't accept that point that Trump didn't do his own taxes and then he relied on professionals and others\nThe president's brother Robert Trump issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family are dear father Fred Trump passed away in June of Nineteen Ninety nine are below the mother Marion Trump passed away in August two

white man in America white men have no power white man I mean it's such garbage listening to ... all this whining about the four plight of white men is ridiculous\nCache one okay if not we're not crying about the plight of white men there is a white man was being railroaded based on no presumption of innocence\nAnd you guys are cheering it on I Would hope that people of every color would be a little upset when a certain group is singled out and then told that my rules to prevail mob rule has been historically very bad for minorities in this country that's the reason due process it's such an important thing\nIs white part of the fourteenth amendment and not just part of the Fifth Amendment because the idea was due process had an extended to all Americans now all of that is in fact unifying Republicans you should I mean you have Cory Booker at in St bad the lunatic\nWho who says near the senator from New Jersey\nSpartacus he came out and he said that it actually he finally still just as well and it doesn't matter whether Kavanaugh was guilty or innocent I don't like him because I'm ball or something or the air is Cory Booker and it's crazy hours\nAnd then ultimately not whether he's innocent or guilty this was not a trial the ultimately has enough questions you raise that we should not move on to another candidate in that long list put together\nBy the Heritage Foundation that's I don't leave until it doesn't matter who's guilty or innocent\nBut have enough questions being raised okay Mr potato head got up this morning when I put on his angry I [laughter]\nCory\nBooker eight and then they wonder why Republicans are so United so here's a here's a hilarious thing Democrats thought this was going to unite them all the days the it turns out that Quinnipiac ballot chosen to the genetic the Democratic generic ballot lead has been placed in half in a month has been placed in half\nAs I said last week you know we we did a little kind of human a I was doing a live radio show\nAnd the middle of the breaks I was answering questions which we do for subscribers which is why shouldn't describe and somebody asked you know do you think Republicans will be ... that I Know I Am if I if they were in the legal I Would go register to vote eight times in Ohio because yes yes forty nine percent of Americans back a democratic candidate in their local race for the U.S house\nForty two percent support the Democratic candidate\nThat is a massive increase in the Democratic support level when Democrats had a fourteen point lead now down to seven in the Quinnipiac polls it is possible that Republicans retain the house because Democrats or ... or so to stuffing\nWhich would just be poetic justice will not be phenomenal if the Republicans retain the house because Brett Kavanaugh that would just first of all the insanity that is likely to break out on the back of that would just be on the receivable and things will just be nutshell not so ... as I said my children there'll be raising\nIs is quite remarkable quite remarkable and when you add all these things to what the excellent prosecutor did the Republican prosecutor who was universally trashed except by me\nYou can see that Dr Ford is not credible in the least has applies to Brett Kavanaugh with respect to Brett Kavanaugh\nNot in the least and her left wing ...\nLawyers suggested to her by Dianne Feinstein are\nTrashing the FBI now as the Democrats are now you knew they were the FBI that's the gold standard and now they're attacking the FBI which is really their their regular knee jerk position because the FBI has been interviewed Dr Ford or judge Kavanaugh\nThese are the same lawyers for Dr Ford who refused to turn it over to the Senate Judiciary committee\nCopies of her therapists notes even though they wave privilege because the therapist notes will tell a lie to the summit\nIncluding whether Dr for this other issue which is exactly why the prosecutor asked about them I Want to go back to this prosecuted because it's important the media attack this woman\nRadio hosts attack\nOne TV host\nAttack this one senior judicial\nAnalysts attack this woman I said no no no no she's doing this exactly the right way\nNow I'm going to prove to you that that's the case not just tell you and it's not the pat myself on the back it's because I think you're very intelligent unfortunately most of the media do not but I think you are\nAnd here's what I said I Believe it was the day of that hearing isn't that right rich September twenty seven last Thursday when I came on the air caught\nOne go a lot of people have been trashing the ... prosecuted the Republicans hired to ask questions of Ford what was your name again Rachel what Rachel Mitchell I Will take a different view I Want to congratulate her she did exactly what needed to be done\nExactly what needed to be done this is why I Believe that in the end cabin on that will be confirmed she walked Dr Ford through various aspects of her allegation\nWhat amazes me is some of these cable analysts weren't happy with it it's taking too long the people aren't going to follow this the Democrats are they're making speeches and they thought that was wiser because this was all based on emotion everything let me tell you the problem folks let me tell you the problem\nI'm Sorry to say this but whether it's on cable TV and even this business people really think you're stupid people really don't think you're going to be able to follow these things you're smarter than broadcasters including me whether they're on TV or radio you have a great\nSix cents about things you've got commonsense those have you watched the hearing you followed everything the prosecutor was doing\nShe was methodically going down raising questions in a very polite and professional way\nAnd showing gaps in Dr forge testimony some case you she had absolute recollection but in most cases she had none\nNone I'm trying to put anybody down I'm just saying that's what I saw\nSo I take exception to some out there I I thought you did a hell of a job it was very solid that was her purpose that's what she did that's what she accomplished and she she had to synthesize understand and then use an enormous amount of information a very short time and she did and she found gaps\nAre that's me from September twenty seven last Thursday and now virtually everybody's hanging on what she said\nAnd they should and there is even more\nAs the ex boyfriend comes forward noticed the Democrats don't want to talk to the ex boyfriend notice they don't demand that the FBI interview the ex boyfriend notice the Democrats don't demand that the lawyer for Dr Ford turned over her therapists notes from twenty ... twenty Thirteen have you noticed that\n\nNotice the Democrats don't demand is I've been saying repeatedly that Dr foreigner ... go to the Montgomery County police department in Maryland\nSo now they're saying the FBI did an interview for it and didn't interview Kavanaugh will of course the FBI didn't interview them you know why this is not a criminal investigation we say this over over over and over again it is not a criminal investigation\nThey already know what Dr Ford has to say how do I know because we all know what Dr Ford had to say they already know what judge Kavanaugh has to say how do I know because we all know

get to the truth no all they do is interview people and ask them questions write it up and handed over it's only been said four billion times that that's what a background check is\n\nSo what is it that the FBI needs to find out now if they really did an interview Dr Ford then they should take with them prosecutor Rachel Mitch roles memo and as well as several points I've been raising\nAnd then

in Florence South Carolina the shooting a police officer is a local TV station\n\nThat was the segregation party and now we're supposed to believe it's the civil rights party house so\n\nThe Republican Party was never the slave party the Republican Party was never the segregation party\n\nThe Republican Party has always stood for individual lives in life even now what is the number one issue for the Democrats certainly the number one social issue it's abortion\nAbortions and not about life abortions about death whatever your feelings about it there's no escaping that fact\nTo a party or in one point of our history where its primary objective was to protect slavery another time in its history its primary objective was to protect segregation\nA war fought over slavery riots in the war is if you will domestically fought over segregation\n\nThan they claim the mantle of civil rights when it's the Republican Party\nThat oppose slavery that oppose segregation those were not Republican governor standing in any door house and then the Democrats tried to rewrite history well you know the old Democrats or the new Republicans no they're not\nNo they're not in the least the old Democrats are gone they didn't turn into young Republicans\nBut this mindset of nullification you can see with same tray cities secession you can see it in California where the radical left\n\nThe mindset about destroying individual human beings the mindset about old white men and phrases like that it's the Democratic party\n\nThey just change their approach it's all about power the Democratic party cannot survive if the nation is United\nWhat is the Democrat Party the Democratic party is an entity a political entity\nThat is made up of disparate parts\nBased on race based on religion or no religion based on income based on age\nAnd so forth and so it is the party a balkanization as the party of tribalism\n\nAnd so when you and I when we try to discuss the constitution the declaration these are very quaint ideas to the Democrats but they really have nothing to do with anything\n\nThere objective is always how to get power and how to keep it had to advance the cause whether they want elections or lose elections why do you think we have this massive administrative state the progressive tell you why because elections come and go Franklin Roosevelt tells you why\nThat we will only have temporary control over the instruments how these of government but we need to make permanent our policies\nAnd so they have bastard eyes the federal judiciary they've created a fourth branch of government and this massive administrator state so even when they lose elections from their perspective there's a poster when\nWhen they win elections they tell you they have a mandate so they never lose\nObama said when they lost the when he lost the mid term during his presidency that all those people didn't vote he represents them and the ones who\nMine he had a perverse idea that he

York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages\n\nThey went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages that boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard copy as opposed to a\nA electronically provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office the attorney general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue so where did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it now\nAnd half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that bought for his father he could never have achieved great well you've never seen that peace like that written about the Kennedys\nEver and you never will\n\nOr any of these multi billionaire families\nWith a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nMost of Europe for a million New York city aren't you all those buildings but the president's name on he created the\nEven in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River he rebuilt that entire area\n\nThey want you to believe that Donald Trump\nIs a lousy businessman as a lousy developer and bought\nFor his father he couldn't succeed there's some concern about that and they go on about how he he's a tax cheat first of all as I understood it these were his father's tax returns but\nWhy is he attacks cheat has he been adjudicated attacks she now has he been adjudicated attacks street administratively or judicial ... no\nNo he has\nNow what is the president's supposed to do now you know full well when you have these kinds of holdings you can't actually follow your own tax returns you hire professionals and you signed the tax return and you submit it\n\nAnd of course the goal is to pay as little taxes as possible\n\nI asked Bill Clinton that I seem to recall one year he deducted has used underwear remember that Mr ...\nBut there's never been a New York times investigation into the Clintons' like this the wheeling and dealing they haven't built a damn thing is there a single building in New York or any other part of the country with the Clintons name on it now what do they do to make a hundred and fifty million dollars\nDid they pay their taxes\nHow about all these foreign speeches that they influenced the Clintons particularly when she was secretary of state or a senator\n\nIn New York Times doesn't care anymore than the New York times doesn't care that Hillary Clinton violated the SPN jak multiple times or Bill Clinton rape Juanita Broderick and an molested so many other women that what's the me too movement\nIt's interesting isn't it the me too movement except when it comes to Keith Ellison and John Conyers remembered Joe Scarborough defending John Conyers despite what was coming up\n\nSort of this big article and everybody just keeps regurgitate it everybody just keeps repeating out of the New York times because the New York times is always right don't you know\nThe New York times is never wrong\nWe have ah the ... the mayor of a New York city they went to recoup any money that Donald Trump owes the people of New York that's what he said Donald Trump created thousands and thousands of jobs in\nNew York both directly and his buildings and indirectly through suppliers that's not the way communists like it's not
