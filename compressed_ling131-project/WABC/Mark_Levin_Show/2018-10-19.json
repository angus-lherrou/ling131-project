seven eighty four which is twenty twenty four in the Hebrew calendar um you know I don't know maybe a you know I really enjoyed doing the election special and it was a lot of fun\nAnd it's great to be able to do it right before the election\nWe'll see what you know what what comes we'll we'll find out what my dad Shelby says what do you do when you have a turned my problem as an American Jew it's typical not feel threatened by the growing anti Semitism coming from the extreme liberal left and of course a reference to Louis Farrakhan calling for the\nTermination of ... and saying that that he's not an anti Semite he's anti termite which is weird because Everytime I Try to fumigate my house returned my what they do is they didn't proceed to build happy\nInventions in human history create the basic morality of the west and create the only successful state in the middle east every time I tried to get the term I that's what happens is ... it's an astonishing thing he hasn't been banned from Twitter of course\nBecause he was ... and Democrats loving according shall be my materials that are of course in ... brand was supposed to represent one of the most Jewish areas in the world is being cheered on stage by openly ... like when it's our store where do you see this ending answer is nowhere to go because I mean let's look at history and number into all that well for you\nThe difference is this time number one America I Do believe they different country I Do believe that an America steeped in Judeo Christian values that believes in the need biblical truth of the of the Jewish mission and the Christian mission is very friendly to Jews and historically been so\nAnd there is a state of Israel and the state of Israel does have the capacity to defend itself and that changes the very nature of the history in which we live Charles says you're ... seem to always go Democrat and more rural areas Republican\nAnswer is because in rural areas you tend to be a lot more self reliant and there's a lot less conflict with people who live around if you have a big ... pardon face and you have big piece of land\nYour neighbor even bother you that much you don't feel the necessity to regulate your neighbor all that much 'cause there are no extra ... short your neighbor is doing when you live in a city extra allergies are everywhere you when you live in a city the guy next door is playing his music too loud\nIt bothers you and that means you need a regulation about how much noise is allowed and in particular residential building if the guy next door to the side to keep a messy apartment and the smells emanating from our problem need regulations\nIf the streets are not clean\nAnd we all share the same street well then that requires regulation to an all this requires tax dollars spillover effect and highly populated areas are more significant this is the reason why cities tend to be more highly regulated and more top down for that\nNow does that mean that's how they should be run economically speaking no doesn't mean that's how they should be run in terms of regulatory policy no but that's the reason why you get a lot of people together in a very small area it does generally drive people toward the idea that we have\nTo heavily lockdown how we live in a way they wouldn't have you're out in the middle of nowhere we're not bothering anybody and nobody is bothering you rate that have been much like you I was viciously believe middle school and high school\nI feel like a stronger person for it but I also avoid thinking about those times have you been able to forgive the bullies from your you\nHave yes how so well I think forgiveness requires in Judaism forgiveness requires somebody to ask for forgiveness on I think one of the guys who did they ask for forgiveness at one point I even if it wasn't actually one of the guy just one of the guys who was there and didn't do anything yet for forgiveness that I had no problem getting\nIf somebody came to ask for forgiveness now I think I Would do it just because we're all kids were young and people act like atheist when they're young they're terribly when they're young but I don't think you have to forgive to move beyond it as long as you're not spending your your entire life focusing on how you were wrong\nAnd letting it get your brain then you can just move on with your life and sure when I see those guys is there a pang of like God that guy was just the worst\nAbsolutely but is that something that I spend an awful lot of time thinking about no and I think that made me stronger yeah I Do I think that when you go through diversity and you come out the other side determined to succeed I think that does make you stronger John has been learning\nGiven that Democrats have moved there are still moving further and further to less than twenty twenty what do you think will be the most significant almost ridiculous change the official democratic ... party platform from twenty sixteen\nI Would not be surprised if the Democratic party embrace the idea of gender neutrality meaning that it would be that they are in favor of anti discrimination laws that prevent\nAny sort of difference in outcome between men and women are and even reflect the idea that legislation that allow you to self register in terms of gender like that that would not be a great surprise I think that's probably not twenty twenty\nI think by twenty twenty four that's probably in the platform well we'll be back on Monday with all\nThe latest news will be observed you that it will will be here to break it all down and laugh at it which is an inch of erosion\n\nSpeaking about the current situation in Saudi Arabia\n... I Know puppy that there's been a lot of discussion about this will be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemy is a way to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia\nAnd that the print that may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action against\nMr ... soldiers getting kids as they are not that we have I just finally\nFear for our view or we do not have that reporting I'm not sure where you're\nGetting there had been recording to that effect\nThat are not likely according to that effect sure\nNow here's where you have to understand why this matters more than just you know some sort of gas for some sort of outrage the outrage of the day a democratic accusing Jerry cushion or of ... hit on this guy and working in concert colluding if you will with the Saudi Arabian government and the crown prince\nA ... that's certainly all valid and true but here's the most important thing you need to understand about this he's one of their stars\nThe Democrats win the house\nTwo and a half weeks from today and he is in the leadership\nI mean he's he's he's a rising star he they're going to give him power more power than he has right now\nThis guy who was peddling a conspiracy theory that is completely debunked unfounded and atrocious he goes on CNN in turn national television and accuses Jared Kushner the president's son in law and a White House advisor\nOf delivering U.S intelligence to Saudi Arabia so that this is a columnist the ... could be killed\nAnd and they're going to give him power\nNow at this may not be the most important election of your lifetime but if you care about the direction of our country for the next two years if you care about anything positive getting done if you care if if you are sick and tired and fed up\nOf the ongoing drama the UC play out and cable and broadcast news on a daily basis with regard to the Democrats\nAre acting hysterical about this president and about this administration than this is a no brainer this really is a no brainer you cannot give Joaquin Castro\nAny more power than he already has in the house of representatives frankly he has too much as it is as a junior congressman from Texas He shouldn't be on that committee with that\nKind of irresponsible behavior with that kind of irresponsible language by the way he he came out later this is this is amazing he came out later and said I didn't intend\nTo a accused Jared Kushner of any illegal behavior and I didn't intend to accused you're a Christian or could you\nMay have with the U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies with to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that the president may have acted on that\nOne of the people that he took action again\nMr ... soldiers get\nI think he did you hear what he just said and now he claims after the fact via Twitter\nIs how they do it these days that I didn't I didn't intend to accused Jared Kushner\nOf calling a hit or doing anything untoward or delivery misinformation well here's the problem with these Twitter denials these cowards who won't go on television he's fine going on international television on CNN and making this charge\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit with an enemies list to the crown prince the NBA or Saudi Arabia he\nGoes on international TV and delivers that\nAnd then when everyone starts screaming ... and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the Daily Beast\nWebsite which is which is a new left leaning left complete total left the site\nSays I Can't believe that walking capture did that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no no no no he puts out his apology non apology denial non denial walked back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner\nBlah blah blah blah blah and of course there's no reporter not that there would be but maybe poppy\nHarlow over there at CNN would actually a raise their hand and say okay congressman Castro uh I understand your statement saying that you didn't intend can you tell us what you didn't tend to say because it seems pretty dang clear what you\nSaid and and and here's the best part of his denial\nThat never got any follow up and never got any challenging as just accept that oh well he's ...\nHe says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take him in his words they didn't do it he said all I said was there was reporting to the effect that Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate I you see\nAnd now and now that's that's the crux of it because they see\nEverything that happens in this town Washington DC everything that's happening down at the border right now everything that you're seeing on cable news night after night after night all of it has to do with the mid term election that Kavanaugh hearings that was all about the mid term elections\nThe the the the way the media and the Democrats and some Republicans are reacting to this story of this a columnist for the Washington Post who apparently was killed\nBy officials with the Saudi Government the way they are all react that has everything to do with the mid term elections the caravan as they're calling it\nOf thousands of Hondurans Salvadorans Guatemalans waving their flags and marching across Mexico to illegally cross our border and stay here in this country because they believe they deserve to be here\nAnd we can't do anything about it that has everything to do with the midterm elections\nAnd I in Joaquin Castro's non denial denial via Twitter he revealed something that you need to understand because this is the next two years of our lives\nIf the Democrats when\nHe said it's being reporting it's being reported that Jared Kushner did this and therefore Congress needs to investigate\nDr Christine Blasey Ford comes forward\nWith an allegation that has no corroborate ... any witness that she names refugees her story and certainly can't confirm her story\nIt's thirty five years old and nothing anything close to the allegations she made against now justice Kavanaugh\nHad ever been made up until this point but what did the Democrats say what how\nThe allegation is out there and it's very serious so it needs to be investigated in fact we need an FBI investigation and it needs to take weeks and weeks\nAnd not liking cast your eye out west and it's being reported so it needs to be investigated and that's\nThe next two years of your life well the New York times is reporting this so it needs to be investigated the Huffington Post is not reported this I don't know if it's true or not but it's very serious it needs to be investigated\n[noise] I think Republicans if they're smart and Jews let's be clear the jury is out on that they need to start telling voters in key states and key districts exactly what the next two years are going to be like there should be a picture of representative Maxine Waters holding a gavel\nAs chairwoman of the financial services committee making banking laws and regulations and financial regulations for our nation for our economy Maxine Waters\nChairwoman of the financial services committee you want that for the next two years 'cause that's what you'd get they need to show Joaquin Castro heck he could be the next chairperson chairman of the intelligence committee\nYou want that is that what you want for the next two years President Trump had a great line in his rally last night here it is\nA choice to not pay more clear Democrats for his mom [noise] Republicans ... jobs [noise]\n\nThat's right and it's a great way to put it and uh and it rhymes and they do like their rhymes uh and and I think that that has residents but I think it goes beyond that listen it's true that we produce jobs it's true that we've seen the mobs from the Democrats but let's take it a little further\nI mean I like to defer to you on this eight seven seven three one three eight one one I liked the Democrats produced mobs Republicans produce jobs but let's look at this thing in a uh entire holistic way shall we\nLet's look at exactly what the next two years are going to be like with investigations with impeachment with the impeachment of Kavanaugh that they're promising with the obstruction with the resistance with the impossible task of this president this administration getting anything done at all\nToo much

Kato was a think tank that focuses on free market principles and ideas and a libertarian\nOr concepts and principles are and they're all brilliant they're all really smart people over Kato\nAnd ah I'm really looking forward to this a very special edition of life liberty and lived in the Sunday make sure you tune in because I miss mark I miss Mart just as much as you do\nA great to be here I'm I'm lifting my ah outrageous a gender discrimination they won't be ladies only from this point forward but I Do appreciate it I just did an event with mark living here in the greater Washington area we had a theater full of five hundred people a year for the station\nAnd it was great\nThe mark did this great thing at the end of it you know we did like an hour and a half presentation on stage and before we were\nDone he said you know I Want to say one more thing get cut all the ladies stand up to the women in the room stand up and it was more than half of the room and it was so great\nThat he did that and and and I love having there's still a bunch of women on the line wanting to get in\nBecause there's this there's this fake phony despicable myth bits perpetuated\nAbout talk radio about what we do here when we when we discuss big important ideas and conservative principles and values and we have this free flow of information and exchange of perspectives they will lie to you wouldn't say it's\nJust angry white men angry white men angry white men it's always angry white man I'm not angry are you angry I mean I mean there are some things in this country that if you're not angry debt you're something wrong with you but I approached this from an angry perspective I Know that you don't\nAnd and you don't care what color I Am I don't know what color you are white and always angry white men they think I'm In and so when you when you specifically say I'd like to hear from women what I can tell you I've been doing a talk radio for years now the didn't big markets and across the country and when you say women I like to hear from you\nBoom those phone lines just explode because oh let me tell you something there's no way you can grow and expand\nThe kind of of communication product that has been growing and expanding for talk radio over these last decades by just being a just targeting angry white man it's a myth its ally\n... they love to say about what we do here because they're ... they don't want a new generation of listeners the last thing they want\nIs for men and women in their twenties that's when people start listening to talk radio when they're done with the idiots who play music and and uh blow the the ... a bicycle foreign and ring the cowbell and make jokes about a body parts and they they start to you know get real jobs and have to wear long pants\nAnd have bills and are making money and they see how much is getting taken out of their paycheck and they're trying to settle down and actually be a grown up that's when they start exploring other parts of the radio dial and that's when they hear talk radio because they want to know\nWhat's going on out there\nAnd it usually happens in your late twenties early thirties that certainly when it started with me in a serious way\nAnd it terrifies but the mainstream media it terrifies the gate keepers in the media who used to be in charge of all of these outlets radio television newspapers they're still in charge of newspapers but they're not in charge of the Internet\nWhen was the last time you actually bought a newspaper I mean unless you ride the subway in New York when was the last time right\nAnd so they're terrified and so they want they they put the lie out there they put the lives out there that this is hate radio that it's nothing but a bunch of angry old white man shouting and so when we have the opportunity to say hey ladies love to hear from you\n[noise] explodes uh the best gift you can give to\nI don't disagree with you one\nAnd then I'm going to positive for a minute because that's terribly important because the Democrats and open border Republicans are doing this all the time\nThey say well you know these people are just seeking asylum in our country they're looking for a better life and we need to be compassionate we need to follow international protocols for asylum\nSeeking a better economic life is not a legitimate claim asylum ... living in a crime infested country is not a legitimate claim for asylum otherwise my friends in Chicago would be claiming asylum in Toronto right now\nSo the ... but that's all they'll say they'll say well you know the economic it's a horrible economic and they've got a horrible drug problem this horrible gang problem you're right but that's not a legitimate claim of asylum so if that's the reason for
