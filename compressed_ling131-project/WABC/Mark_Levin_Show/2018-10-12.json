I'm a believer that human beings have capacities and rational capacities and in a religious and sold the animals do not have so\nI don't feel the same way about killing of animals for food and I knew about killing of humans for any reason so that is is not good equipped with one in the park like as far as the argument in favor of the animal rights\nThe fact is that a lot of animals are relatively sentiment I mean they're they're pretty with it and for the same reason he wouldn't tell your dog and eat it there's not a terrible automation till accounting now doing it can you do it because human beings require animal protein to survive I think for survival reasons and riding reasons\nThere is a good arguments we made you should be able to eat meat and biblical speaking when people called genesis nine three which is the part where it says that anything on the earth you can basically eat when that does that Noah\nWhich is actually in this week Bible portion and the Jewish community\nIt's important to recognize that this was after the expulsion from eating and eating the typical Jewish philosophy that you couldn't eat animal that everybody was sort of vegetarian and in ... which doesn't sound that decorate honestly in chemicals are delicious but um I\nI said before that in a hundred years people may look back and say how could people eat so many animals and I think that that may be true that said we'd have to come up with some pretty good substitutes for animal protein better than the ones that we have now\nAre widespread vegetarianism are beginning to take place for for human rights ... rather for animal rights reasons least as Mr Shapiro originally I've gotten in discussions about the rich paying their fair share of taxes some of my family who are Democrats are pretty wealthy\nAnd they feel they're not taxed enough compared to everyone else well then they can find it go for it it's all you again I Know you get sick and had in my pocket you feel you're not getting enough I have a favorite charity the argument they use in discussion as a loophole for the rich and that the trickle down effect doesn't work either Arnold loopholes for the rich\nAll the tax breaks exist for everyone it's just the only get to exercise certain tax break in certain areas there are people who get the earned income tax\nCredit I Do not receive the earned income tax credit because I make too much money most people in the United states make too much money it received significant amounts of money back for the earned income tax credit that the loophole for people who are not as wealthy and so it's not a loophole that just with Pakistan instruction when people say loopholes they act like\nWell if I pay my way or a little more than he can find a loophole in the law that's not how it works it's not a loophole as a I don't believe in tax loopholes I Believe we should play pay everybody should have that uh a flat tax\nRate or we should have a national sales tax but there's no such thing as a quote unquote loophole that only applies to rich people it's just there are different types of income like capital gains versus traditional income we can just got one of those are the ... your bad policy\nBut the language of loopholes in accurate how about the trickle down effect doesn't work well the trickle down effect is a term that it's going by left that economists no one on the right has ever suggested that there is something called trickle down where you give money to rich people in rich people suddenly make everybody else wealthy\nThe idea is supply side economics meaning the people who develop new and better ... drive the economy to nobody knew there was a demand for cars\nUntil cars were mass produce and suddenly everyone knew there was a demand for cars they talked about this a little bit earlier this week the lie that\nWage stagnation since Nineteen Seventy nine means that the quality of living since Nineteen Seventy nine of stagnant is just idiotic and ... we live far better than we did in Nineteen Seventy nine without any doubt whatsoever Ronald Reagan supply side economics theory led to the greatest peace time growth\nIn the history of the nation and Joel says is the Democratic party in the recovery due to embrace it socialism in rockets behavior\nJimmy ... and the wasted of history with a wig party well I mean as it currently still as it currently can't sure I Would prefer a Democratic Party that was not insane pressing actual\nSolutions that maybe I disagree with so we can have an honest debate about issues I think that a two party healthy system is worthwhile and I think the right now we have a ... party and the Republican Party and dying party in the Democratic party at least in terms of ideology and the problem is that there are a lot of people who believe in that ideology well we will be here on Monday\nWe are one percent more Americans that thought but Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed and not in other words we went back to believe in him\nAnd ultimately that close but we had last weekend was endemic of us the average American Bully break out but I Believe that he should be confirmed and the United States Senate actually went ahead and did what we want it says sliding scale of morality and all told\nWe only had our public opinion changed by seven percent that entire process that was at seven percent in other words most people are pretty stuck in their basic morality\nBut a lot of times people will go you know how is it the best friend I've had over a year turned around and stab me in the back\nWell that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics whether you might disagree with and just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage the moral outrage by the media on back of Kanye visiting President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality words\nUnless you're potentially the spotted Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno ... so maybe you know as long as you're not the responder saying or or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo out of steel wanted to say that one is evil ten is perfection we're all Tuesday nights\nAnd therefore at our best were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end of whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that mean well means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you start out and I'm not a sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life but when adversity strikes when\nSomething goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting you arrange for his first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you have thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit\nSo many people so many people been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nBet you have people that defend Christine for how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of right by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than ... I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place the morality to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view of things through the prism that you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about you wins climate science and what fraud they are along with Medicare Andy fraud that is Medicare for all its financial for on the conversation\nThe reality is broad bunch of people lying to you but it's all part\nOf our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd she I Believe should ultimately be tried for it now\nI had somebody said well her witnesses the ones that ended up refuting her claims\nMaybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this lesser said there may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of ... who could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can commit felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as you're reasons are good enough\nIf a sliding scale of morality and when we're talking about this sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media\nAre you kidding me are you getting me Twenty years ago today what were we talking about and what did you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media\nThat sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West in the oval office\nThat is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know\nWhere your moral compass happens to be\nAre you by the six or seven and eight where are you where when you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life\nWho are they do or they\nAre they six is not a good day in threes on a bad day\nYou know last week I was talking a bit about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people of things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open ... do you information the first place and the problem is you don't have a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a gaffe an ideal there are only seven percent of folks top to bottom ... ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent through everything that's it\nSo you've got to find people that are open minded and open to information as I pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be stabbed in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself and add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because any more\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including by a former attorney general who happens to now be saying well go ahead and kick the opposition that's the world we now live in\nSo ... and well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years remember the last time we\nWere talking about Kanye West and the president\nWell that was a little bit of a different story and over the past Thirteen Years a few things have changed and ... who is working right now and a few things about this economy and that's where we're going to pick out next right here it is Brian mud filling in for the great one month\nHim on Seventy seven W ...

Bush was a racist\nNo did I go\nDuring the country and the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was I miss memorized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that entire thing was taking place yes\nIn fact actually I went back in and watch that but a lot of uh the the little series there earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was a combination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time he's looking\nHe'll look at gun yet you look at the teleprompter get gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts\n[laughter] but yeah\nIt is bad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers picks up it starts reading the teleprompter\nAnd all the time of it anyway no I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to Institute policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success unique and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThey can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community that's a Donald Trump story so you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a raises Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nThat has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare providing a

make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took ... catalysts that uh\nAgain James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties why didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well I of course open change when it was much bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at him\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep

media which happens to be old mission now they're talking about the ... effect throughout the course of this first that we're all with a sliding scale morality here's something else that you probably don't hear about too often\nNow we have had according to the media Research Center ... news busters now Ninety two percent of the coverage Ninety two percent of the coverage\nOf the Trump Administration by news media the negative Ninety two percent of you you compare it to ... go bomb at the same point about forty six percent negative and you know where we were in the economy you know where we were in this country a couple of years in to the Obama administration\nHere's something that you also don't here\nAgain the omission you'll have the media\nMedia is always happy to say oh here is a poll that shows Donald Trump bad\nApproval rating but there's been a true wisdom pretty much the entire Trump presidency the more informed and engage a person is the more likely they are to approve\nPresident Trump and that remains the gate says we're a little more than three weeks away from the general election if you take a look at an average of various different pulling out there you'll see that among adult only samples President Trump's approval rating about forty three percent\nAmong registered voters at pretty much around the same but among likely voters we've continued to see it rise\nYou'll see some pulling rats was at one point as we got to fifty one percent and an average of all likely voters the president's been averaging around forty six forty seven percent now that might not sound great but let me put things in perspective for for a moment\nDonald Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency compared to ... bombers among likely voters his approval rating happens to be right now three points higher than Brock Obama's brief points higher\nNow imagine this for about a president with Ninety two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet the one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most important those that are most engaged\nIt it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is or isn't in their wallet this was true of Obamacare all the lives that were thrown out there were perpetuated wild that whole deal was going down\nIt was guaranteed not to work it was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay so Obamacare is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later for the same insurance coverage you have Ninety two percent higher premiums\nNinety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that we know about the you know if you like your doctor and keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo people understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage lot folks get upset about the way things are portrayed but remember that if the media me\nIt generally had the type of influence that we think\nThey have\nIf they had the type of impact in elections and that many will still assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nThey you know middle they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better these are all things that are facts and it's why the most informed and engaged\nAre more likely to approve of President Trump is why we

billion over ten years that's diverted\nHere is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent right it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare\nWas projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenty third it's kinda like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of points real quickly and here's the first one\n\nIf we already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal according to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in your one nine percent of Medicare benefits the ...\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see ya\nAnd it gets worse every year from there that currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it you got\nA hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population\nOn it it is financial fraud that's bigger than Bernie made off yeah you have a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nAnd by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to board has given the joy of race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist wins\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you\nOne of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this day and just it was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott who was term limited and running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum it'd be Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians will know\nYou will have the most liberal and leftist governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and you go well that sucks to be you in Florida no it's such to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode the wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination would just thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is\nNow consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check so ... year Michael Bloomberg felt like he used the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win there\nWatching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this ... is critical and again there is one platform piece of particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic when you're talking about the governor's race because Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter Andrew Gillum has also run on impeaching President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate\nIt's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got fifty percent on it it is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's got to get better\nThere is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve\nWhat they're talking about but if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we've got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult it financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a ... I'm not making it up it's according to federal defender has a basic financial literacy test\nAnd right now more than sixty percent of adults bail it a basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have with conversations and concepts like this\nDoesn't matter how educated one is\nGenerally if they are financially illiterate than these concepts might be bought\nAnd sold kind of like hope and change and Obamacare So having these conversations making sure that your financial informed making sure your kids are financially informed pretty important not only for their everyday life but\nWhen it comes to concepts like this because ultimately it's not complicated but it is brought its financial fraud is dishonest and it's guaranteed to fail\nWe'll come back and talk about

to do\nSo her advice is simple listen to yourself\nAnd make the decision if that's\nFor Mayo Clinic radio I did in Williams\nMark Sullivan Seventy seven WABC [noise]\nTesting conservative higher Martin ... show call and now at age seven seven three one three eighty one one [laughter] you know\nWe know this is [noise] all the\nWhy these hydrogen powered I blame\nAnd the grand scheme of things that was one of those ah [laughter]\nWhat just happened moments another Gore's the in the grand scheme of the media kind of losing his mind everybody had to point out what a tiny have I vote password is which job zeroes [laughter] so anyway that was a that was an interesting moment ... but again you know when you've got\nThe the dragging energy and you've got your mega Superman ad on things happen you know it's really hard to get on a channel all of that and and you got to you know every now and then you're going to have a hydrogen I I play\nAnd that the president or the president [laughter]\n[laughter] oh start getting early you one of my\nOne of my all time favorite reactions Michael Meyers\nWatching Kanye do the uh Katrina really like\nWhere is the exit button on this stage right now how can I get off of here\nNow please and ah you know one of those moments but President Trump is always okay what do I do here and you talked about role reversal because he's usually the people ... and making people dumped ... you gotta gotta feeling better once you got a dose of his own a kind of thing there\nAnyway are talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's not complicated and and this is the way the shutdown drop the Mike argument you have\nA Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pacing insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent a hundred percent of folks at work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when you put the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that\nIs the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country and it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is perpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult being financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by federal sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational year but here's something else\nThat is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person that take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody well I haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't put the tax cuts\nSo it's all going to be reconciled when they filed their taxes they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody so I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything\nNow the next poured that fraud comes in with companies\nYou hear how awful the tax cuts are because evil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back all the stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know that that stuff except that that's a fraud as well as dishonest to its ally the ah seem to be so you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] bad the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC with their CFO council\nHave found a few things that are interesting for example one is the the most common way who has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not the first of all the corporate tax cuts\nThis year buybacks right it was horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone through a combination of bonuses an employee raises thirty five percent twenty percent has gone to debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should pay at all that helps the company the gum more stable essence their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of sheer about buybacks in dividend payouts\nWestwood One podcast networks obey radio which is done to re John Melendez you

[noise]\nHat off it made me feel like Superman made\n... favorite would be there or not to know who\nWe're going to be on it however you want to do it [laughter]\n\n[noise] you know some of the things that you didn't necessarily know specifically we're going to happen with Donald Trump is president but\nHey you know there would be the moment so it'd be a little bit differently you know uh and yes you have the fame to outrage the the moral folks in the media that are ... oh my gosh the profanity Twenty years\nTwenty years removed from the oval office equally a blue dress sow Kanye West is using profanity and the oval office is somehow or another Twenty years later oh just reprehensible but the president's you know\nDoing a a little Lewinsky thing that was okay oh that was actually part of the Nineteen Ninety eight midterm election\nThat whole impeachment effort which is interesting because they're on a number of different comparisons you can actually make between that mid term cycle in this one are they talking about some of the\nMisinformation out there the fraud that is Medicare for all talked about how much more money we're really making that take home pay up six point seven percent year over year\nAnd then you get into this recent study that was really just my nominee is why we have the broad being perpetuated that is Medicare for all survey Republicans\nUs economic system is fair to most Americans Democrats do came out earlier this week Republicans believe us economic system is fair to most Democrats do\nHere's the irony of all this success not exactly being part is a good guy you know is not exactly you're right wing Republican conservative type\nBut guess who else is like all of your richest self made people in this country for a few names of the richest Americans for a moment just basis\nWarren Buffett Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates you happened to notice a trend here they all happen to be left to ease once again two sides to stories one side effects so why isn't\nThat with the rich as the most successful the wealthiest individuals in this country actually bean left to use that most Democrats feel the euro us economic system isn't fair\nDoes gets back to what I pointed out earlier this hour sixty percent of adults being financially illiterate\nBut here's the more important point and this is another shutdown argument if you want it you'll have people talked about how much more fair it is elsewhere well guess what the media and world per capita income\nIs ten thousand two hundred Ninety eight bucks and the United states\nYou can even legally work fulltime and earn less than sixteen thousand dollars a year\nSince the minimum wage in the United states which as I pointed out a little bit ago\nOnly point six percent of the population orange is approximately sixty percent higher than the median income around the world so to all the folks who say that our economic system isn't fair nobody's keeping your ear elect you\nLet's go to Ryan in California Ryan go\nHey uh as soon as the tax uh\nThing went through I paid attention to my paychecks\nAnd right when it went through I noticed thirty dollars more and I went to all of my co workers where I work at a buddy shop and all those guys they're like well I've got thirty and so it was like thirty to thirty five bucks that the federal government\nWasn't taking away from me so those crumbs that Nancy Pelosi was talking about actually makes a difference but she wants she comes back man [laughter] she wants her crumbs back but I have a fight\n[laughter] good stuff Bridget arrive once again you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to people\nAbout what is or isn't in their wallet\nAs Ryan just pointed out to be right back talking about
