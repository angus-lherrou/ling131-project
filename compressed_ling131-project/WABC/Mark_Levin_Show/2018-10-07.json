{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "They actually come with his dad early on and they saw the possibilities here and and they came in and they they wanted to invest into us and so then I sat down and they said so what's your exit strategy how we can make money on this and I said\nMy exit strategy is is the epitaph on my on my tombstone is says made a difference in this world and changed lives in quality that literally that is my answer to that sure we just couldn't ever get it together and there's and Lex got the experience of seeing many times for example I'm just going to put it out there but that\nPeople wanted us to go multi level time after time and companies wanted us to and then we would sit down 'cause yeah I mean we needed to make money and we need to be right through the bad times\nI mean what is this as a business you started this as a way to help your patients so that is on the side of it was something you had to get a learning curve on and grow and kind of shepherd from day one this is not something I never thought I'd be doing right I Love\nPractice I Love people and so so as we started doing this do people started you know coming out of the woodwork and it's interesting that people then we would say no there's some there's a ... a major\nThere is a major health food chain that wanted to do something was but when they\nThey wanted us to change it every one every single time they want us to change it\nEvery single time they wanted us to to cheapen it because it had to be cheaper anyway there was this one multi level that\nThey were doing something in some third world countries and helping people and they said you know if they get to these it's better than having to to cap so this is better than nothing and they started convince me just and things like that and so we started talking with them came down to the line\nWhen they were they had already a multi level business they were doing they just wanted to replace it with a slugging play yeah and so we found out they were paying how much how much like was it that they were paying her bottle for those vitamins a dime\nA dime and they were selling them for sixty dollars and and and and so when and that was from the manufacture of other manufacturers are making money too that's right that was their prize they weren't even making themselves\nAnd they were then they ... they just had a good story they were telling these people that they would become into financial independent and blah blah blah when it came down to it they found out that over half of our costs are actually in the product [laughter] they were like whoa whoa whoa we can't do that and where you got to do this or that and that's when they came you know how about two and a Catholic\nIt obviously we could never make it work\nOne of these guys that that was doing this one son he just wanted to make something work\nAnd we even fluid flown out with our attorney because we thought something was going to work with this and everything and and and it just and then it got down okay so how are we going to make it cheaper and I was like I won't change the product I won't change what we do we won't do that these are the studies I have this is why it works is how it works I won't change it we're about changing lives\nAnd if if you could sit in fact I invite you haven't come and sit in on one of our our staff meetings and just to hear it on the phone is one thing that you should come and sit and see the tears that are shared by some of our our health coaches when they tell the stories of who they help to this week\nThat's what our staff meetings are about Mm they talked about their successes and we share them and we and\nThat's what we are and so any ways that we actually produce our own product we've tried we have tried to to get it out because we we thought it'd be easier working with government entities and things that that it would be easier to do that way\nTheir quality could not pass our standard right we wouldn't send it out we literally would not send it out I said you know give me those bottles I'll take them home and eat them but I'm not going to send those out to people\nThe the fact that there's such a high standard in the a product that's in your capsule and the content of what's in every bottle\nA is really unparalleled and so it's one of those things friends where when you get in and Dr Howard says this and the commercials on a regular basis but when you when you\nWhen you pop open the plastic live the bottle and then you pull the the sealed foil seal off if you don't get a whiff when you open the fruits of very strong fruit and it just it just walked right up to your nose and the same with the with the veggies or if you don't ... then you're not you're not taking balance of nature\nIf you don't get that smell it you don't think that there you can take one of the capsules or an open it up and taste it yeah I I challenged with anything else out there and you won't get it we don't use and we don't fill it with things like like\nAlfalfa well and the thing is you've picked thirty one fruits and vegetables as the combination of this all base going back to our previous discussion on the chemistry of what those specific fruits and vegetables mind\nYou take the three and three and a work in combination and how they work in combination and you take those three and three every day\nYou're going to be taking the equivalent of ten servings of a salad and made of those thirty one fruits and vegetables now I don't know how much salad you're currently are ingesting but if you're not eating ten plate fools of it\nWith these thirty one specific fruits and vegetables in it you're gonna miss the nutrition that isn't the compact form of these caps with nothing but whole food\nAnd when you say whole food it's skin it's it's see it's it's all the stuff that that that's in that food wind feasible yet writer example is the whole apple sold pineapple now we take the skin off of some things right now that's not necessarily the edible\nPortion rise [laughter] but yeah every edible part is there and it's very important and we're the only ones who do that we have to have that made special for\nA while and you have to do it under your control because again if you try to outsource that than even the producers will try to cheapen the process and you can't do it can't it just doesn't you can't run the risk\nFriends I Hope that this has been informative and helpful because you're not going to find anything anywhere like balance of

I probably should have done something different in college but then here's the other side of it every one of my experiences even in college with that major in law school especially practicing in the law\nLed me to the person I Am today so it's hard to say I should go back and do something different because I don't know if I Would have done that in the beginning whether I Would have had the same path so it's hard to say well listen you have a\nMultitude of experiences along the way and how you got here by the way from let me ask you something else so with all these different directions how did you end up focused on a a lower income and dating and that being you're calling on television\nWhile I was doing different spots on television like being a legal analysts on Fox CNN CBS but at the same point\nI wanted to be a host and I remember we had a ... a meeting we met hands inside out fishing she is an anchor on picks eleven the nightly news you and I had a breakfast meeting with her\nSaid hey listen I Want to be like Ryan ... crashed I Want to do hosting I Want to host this I Am interested in this and she said whoa wait a second your specialty is law that is what you're on T. V. doing right now\nThat's what you should specialize and just keep focusing on that legal background keep focusing on doing a legal analysts on TV and you're going to get a hook as the more you appear on their people are going to want to have you host certain programs they're legal oriented\nFunny enough that's exactly what happened I started appearing on lawyers which was a legal program they asked me to be the host of it so she was a hundred percent right focusing on what you're really your strength as what you know and the rest is going to lead and it's very interesting so in the case of would have should have could have\nYou wouldn't have done it differently probably not probably not\nWhom were on reflecting this week and always in fashion I'm thinking about life in careers Jesse story is a clear one figure out what you want to do and get focused\nI'm thinking under the heading of should I Would I have I could I have done things differently another way\nI think it's an unusual approach to get yourself settled and figure out where you are I think it's a fascinating exercise I think when we're done with the show if you sit down and started to ask yourself you're going to find some interesting answers to the questions that you ask\nBut I Want to start with a would have and it could have this work for you just\nI think so I don't want to look back and say we should have we could have or we would have done so I think I'd rather [laughter]\nYou know I mentioned in the opening China I mentioned China I Can't believe what's going on with China it's annoying to hell outta me so I Want to talk about the business of trade with China the trade war that I touched on a moment ago\nLast summer I was on CNBC business I was interviewed they called me and it asked me to be a commentator and they wanted to talk about the trade war with China I told them President Trump is negotiating it makes no sense in having a trade war there will not be\nYes that's the honest answer yes\nYou see me speaking French just no film [laughter] I really don't speaking speaking French the answer should should be the smart move the right thing to do I should learn how to speak French should and then I would've could've and shoot 'em ups\nReality I didn't believe that if I devoted my self to study and devoted all my time in ... which of course I couldn't do it had a job I Would never be able to speak French I just knew me\nComplicating things my counterparts ... multiple languages frankly and with the ease\nIts their culture Europeans are expected to be multilingual when you think about Europe it was too small each individual country for brands to grow they need to go outside their borders and because of that they learn to speak the language is the countries surrounding them\nSo they all speak multiple languages in the United states we're spoiled American businessmen and women are spoiled\nThis is such a huge market that if you've never stepped out of the United states does more than enough money to be made by a company and hence we got comfortable speaking just one language English at the same time we're lucky because the world's languages when English and therefore\nWe could be lazy and get it done as time went on Americans realize they had to be global brands such as local brands in the United states and we went and ventured outside the United states in most brands are everywhere if they're good brands\nBut we don't speak more than one language and our European counterparts are taught from birth they must speak English to their native French Italian Russian so they're all multilingual unlike U.S born here in America\nNow would say recent immigrants coming to the population of America more bilingual\nBut I had a choice\n\nI was spoiled and perhaps may be arrogant swashbuckling American with my smile on my face and maybe just not sophisticated enough to understand how important it would be to learn French when I travel to Paris which was frequently\nAs expected for my benefit they all spoke English but I couldn't help but notice in every meeting in multiple situations they would lapse into French for ease then help them move things well\nIt wasn't just respectfully I learned a long time ago that when people speak foreign languages in your in their country it's often done to be a fishing and needs to be done so they can move through\nAnd although I felt like a hub shut American what can I tell you I feel good about who I was and I feel good about our country\nWas excluded from their ... I was a part of this special club I couldn't speak their language\nAnd though I was always treated as a trusted in respected member of the group the language and the language barrier kept me at a distance across an ocean in but not in so again let's go back here I Am at this charity event and the doctor asked do you speak French\nI thought of tonight's theme I would've I could have and I should have back in a moment\nWays in fashion [laughter] fashion [noise]\n\nI've heard from since you were\nLeading Italy that's where they tell you it comes from\nAn awkward would approve this is a collection of men's and women's issues that are in the elite contemporary style brilliantly but they're also waterproof so you guys and gals you don't have to change your shoes and in climate weather\nAnd I should tell you how comfortable they are mentally fashion style but but the comfortably where the ... if you go\nI could tell you the science of contemporary it is a classic feel to them they're easy to wear their elegant yet that for every day high quality and low maintenance the true foundation of timeless wardrobe something you could wear every day and not worry about it I could tell you is\nFoot where that is made for discerning men and women who make bold moves and want to do their best without sacrificing fashion or comfort you should explore the latest collection is I Would tell you the dot com\nI could tell you is amazing styles beautiful fabrics beautiful silhouettes you should really look for them you can find an explorer ... latest collection that I could tell you a dot com\nOr visit the flagship store at Nineteen sixty five Madison Avenue in Manhattan awkward tell you a Q. U. A. T. A. L. I. A. where ever the weather goes they will take you made in Italy and waterproof the best combination\nWelcome back and say here's your house Marc Weber [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nI should have done a lot of things [noise]\nInteresting topic tonight I Would have could have\nI should have tried not to beat myself up too much because in the end I like who I Am but all of us have there are always confronted with I could have I Would have I should have only problem is it's the past and we talk in the future\nI don't want to continue now\nOne of the things I've often thought about is listening yeah if I was\nA better listener I might have done things differently I might have been to be perfectly honest I might have missed opportunities I might have just gotten a little further a little faster Jesse I Want to start a good listener said a serious\nQuestion what are you really ask me that question what okay you're very funny\nBut I I Can't I I don't I Can't believe you're actually asking me if you're a good listener because when you chew it out and you do this a lot\nYou go into your little ... world you forget it you are the worst list [laughter] in the entire world you do now to listen to anything and the worst part about it is half the time you're doing it on purpose\nSo I'm a cash ... but equally as true is when you look at me and my eyes\nOr walking or driving around you're focused exactly what I'm trying to talk about you drill down you asked me the right question so you're an amazing listener\nI Would say eighty percent of the time and you really are but that twenty percent of his time is really an I\nWill thank you for that and while we're talking about would have could have been should have I guess I should have listened more to you Jesse but the purpose of the show is to teach right now and I\nBelieve that being a good listener is one of the top ten skills anyone out there needs to be successful but before I go there to tell you when to listen to school I didn't even know there is such a thing as listening school\nYeah you know if you're in New York every so often maybe every day you get these pamphlets offering services like coming to learn how to put a title on your roof for anything\nWhat are you looking at the bulletin board that Starbucks outlets are alive and I kept\nThem all the time and work and get these things get one that says learned to be a better listener I said to myself gee whiz I Know I'm not a good listener why not go why not go\nSo I had a young lady I work with the company name was I mean who's a worst listener than I could ever be she was one of those people while you're talking to she's talking back not listening to your question and giving you an answer she was the worst said to my secretary at the time ... minutes straight of assistance\nTo to get me a spot at that and get one for I mean it's we go to the thing we sit in the back of the class already making a mistake teacher gets up and start to\nTalk about listening and it was so sophomore okay for those of you out there that means so elementary for those of you out there don't get that means so easy I started to lose interest and started talking and I started talking to be a good listener you have to pay attention to be a good listening you can't do it blah blah blah\nUm talk in a way I was out of the class within thirty minutes I didn't learn anything so if I'm not a good listener that's partially why just and\nI have a question yes for people that do struggle listening and when you do you have to listen to things what's the trick to listening to stuff\nThat you might think is really really boring\nReally I mean people face this all the time in class at work what is the track\nWell first of all now you're taking me in a different direction but it's a fair question\nYou know we all have obligations to be interesting you know think of it that way if you're going to take the time to tell the story or talk to people you an obligation you you wanna talk then you have to know how to present yourself and we've talked about that a million times on this show\nLearning how to present when you're telling a story in Egypt beginning a middle and then ended it has to get there quickly and most of us aren't funny we don't belong in late night TV just to get the jokes try and be interesting okay that's your responsibility and the conversation\nAs the listener you have to drill and you see those movies um what was the movie with\nBy we developed a great relationship what happened was she left the company about six months after I had been there\nAnd I was astounded I thought she was a pillar of the community I thought she was there for ever certainly not after six months to be being there and what bothered me\nWas I read it in the paper I read it in women's wear daily\nAnd it bothered me because I was an important guy at least I thought it was bad and could shed or the head of human resources to Louisville to them or when indices leaving you would think the head of the Americas the c._e._o. of and we do but what is unique would get a phone call and explain what's going on you would think\nBut low and behold I read it in the newspaper and now it's nagging at the end it's bothering the other one of those things Jesse that happens in the just can't let it go 'cause it keeps bothering you yeah that happens every day [laughter] [laughter] you have when\nI don't know if I should have war that three piece suit [laughter] they're back to that yeah father Matt somebody other options I Try to tell you your little overdress would again and then I was wearing three different tied into which tied to go I gave you the right time and I was lucky I had an extra tie it still bother me okay go back to Madame ... medical cheddar and it's really\nAnnoying me in no hurry many\nIs building up but I hold it in because what am I supposed to do I'm In America and everybody else in France and divisive told you many times your words matter and once they're out of your mouth you can take them back\nAnd even worse emails off for ever they're not even subject for interpretation it's black and white they could read what you say so I held it in I didn't say a word about how disappointed I was or how angry I was that I Would lose my relationship with medical center in the company I have to read it in a women's wear daily\nWas owned behold a few months later on in Paris a back of a limousine talking to the president of the tunnel and I just see and it's not my nature\nTo leave things alone so much that\nI have to tell you I'm very disappointed\nThat I had to read in the newspaper that matter could shut it left you guys made it very clear to me that she thought I was an important member of the team that I was respected that I was part of the inner circle in the company\nAnd hear the head of human resources leaves and I don't know\nAnd he looked at me and he said mark were European company with a European traditions\nWhile I respect the fact that you had to read it in the newspaper you also have to recognize that this is a different culture and it's your responsibility to understand our culture and how the European system works\nThis was not a slight on you this is the way sometimes things get done it's different here than in America\nAnd I should also tell you even though I'm the president of the group I to read about it in the paper [noise]\nWould have could have and should have tonight did I learn about the culture did I Do my homework\nDo we all when I look back what should I have done there was no problem the asking that question there was no problem with me being upset that I didn't know but what it did teach me is to go in and study how this company and other companies communicate and\nLearn and that's what I did\nI Would have could have been should have known about it right away you always have to learn and you always have to be in a position to understand when you do so you don't have to look back and say I would have I could have or I should have be back in a minute\n[noise] always in fashion [laughter] this is a professor\n[noise]\nI Am

want to see\nOn it and why we quiet now business\nAnd then watch\nThe show was I wouldn't ... to ... to\n... would've could've should've complained and talked about regrets and things that I missed when they did when I look back as usual things you've done for myself at the end of the day lying in bed thinking about rewind do what I did that day\nWhat I did write what I did wrong and I'm so glad you did wrong\nWhy did I Do what did I miss what should I Do what could have done what\nWould I Do differently from that and I [noise]\nAnd then that the show is about careers from business we certainly talks about should\nWe talk about how to do things right [noise]\nI like the fact that I have\nAny regrets like the fact\nThat I learn every day like this\nJust you know you're here trying to teach you something you know fun and interesting way maybe maybe you'll pay attention to\nSo that you do have no regrets when you think about it I Would uh could and should the next week you

I'd know carcinoma ... cancer\nYou've heard me talk about green tea and the e G CGI ... so that decreases risk for ... cancer and probably five to seven other cancers\nAll of the great nutrients olive oil also it's great to kill infection in your guts are so the list of things that goes on and on that are important for your gut and to decrease cancer is become a very long risk over the years left over the years rather\n... if you'd like to call in do you so now one eight hundred eight for eight WABC one eight hundred eight for eight nine to two to let's go to Rita in Long Island how\nHow are you a lot of pie you very much for work or or\nFor some quite foods that we have a wonderful thing is\nThat we welcome thank you um my question is for former ... is there any research\nThat can be done but will fall in line that can help the the um\nWell I think the best mechanism is to take your blood and send it to a genetics lab in Greece where they can actually find those cancer cells through a specific you know patented process and then they grow colonies of those cancer cells\nAnd they can see what vitamins minerals medications even chemo might have effect on killing those cells over a period of time\nSo that's sort of what we call\nA um chemo sensitivity test tells you what men are things can help to kill that cancer the lab has a list of doctors who participate with him that work with them and\nYou could look the lab up on the Internet or I'd rather I'll give you the abbreviation 'cause it's easier just to research genetic Cancer Center but\nOur period gee period the I. R. G. cc who see so put periods in between our period CPS gee period sea period sea period\nAnd you could look at that lab and they'll give you some great information\nAnd you might be able to find doctors within the area that do that therapy where they utilize that test and put together all the recommendations\nTo help your body typically the doctor that I think that has the most spectacular results against all cancers based upon what I've seen and I've seen him many times is Dr James for second Reno nevada he uses that blood test than he does intravenous therapies with vitamins\nHe may use a little bit of Islam and the ivy to lower your blood sugar and that makes a cancer cell phone to suck up as much sugars they can so you can sneak in like a Trojan Horse some of the ... you know with sugar behind it so it gets absorbed into the cancer cell but I've I've seen this at this point in probably has a thousand cancer patients that are states for with great longevity\nYou know great life expectation and people who are told that stays for they wouldn't be here within weeks or months that are still alive for years so\nThat's a blessing yeah it's a I had never seen it I don't think any doctor the history of the world has stayed for cancer patients that are still alive as his as he does and I've seen it Dr James for sites that's all R. S. Y. T. H. E.\nHorror fight yeah can you I I think how can you please go over the place again our our isn't there yet\nG. A. G. isn't Gabrielle right see yes see\nYes already yes the get go whoa that\nYeah just put those in Google are period gee period sea period sea period and you'll get the lab\nAnd what I felt that way than\nFor research genetic Cancer Center\nFor him to get one and that happens in\nThis in Greece yeah it's a brilliant genetics lab that is able to determine how to evaluate cancer cells and to see what else to damage the cancer cells\nGrowth and replication so yeah it's a it's a brilliant idea but it gets right to the heart of the matter is something you know what to use to get your best effect against the cancer\nOr something yeah really is brilliant wow wow we can go on vacation time there you go you can go there and have a wonderful little girl [laughter] the island but very exactly and the Vatican light that's the way to think how are you guys have got the right idea the right attitude [laughter]\nThat's a really good idea as a matter of fact lawyers dress will be gone I'm telling you I probably would be walking down the beach jumping in the ocean\n[laughter] we can do about it before you go even better yeah why not [laughter]\nBut yeah take a look at that you'll you'll get some great information there quite a for profit from my pride you're very welcome having wonderful God Bless you thank\nYou God Bless you to let's go next to Harry one eight hundred for eight WABC\nHarry how are you I'm good how are you Dr great\nOkay I'm calling I just kept putting on the radio or my father and the ... ... a rats that just recently they want to uh to the gamma knife mhm and uh he's the park and it's a patient as well\n... okay did they say that the ... spread is getting larger over time where that is just find it\nYeah so the previous scandal is two years ago and then there was one of his slaves to centimeters to set a ... centimeter here that\nMake up ... than a millimeter I mean they can grow in in kind of whichever way they want but remember two point five Seventy five or seven years as an inch so two senators is relatively big\nOr maybe you know here I don't I don't recall\nI mean it could be millimeters as opposed to centimeters\nYeah so he said it's growing on an average nothing out of out of the ordinary it's not pressing and anything\nWell it's kind of lucky that with gambling I if they can eradicated I'm sure they've described that to you and that's a lot easier than going into you know cutting into trying\nVisually you know extracted the only problem I think is that whenever you affect the brain with any kind of um even a relatively mild insult with patients that have Parkinson's you know the Parkinson's can increase or progress\nRight right okay so do you what do they think this is benign or did they think that it's kind of ... nine there\nAre certain is but I mean most of 'em are but then I just wanted to make sure that they said that so yeah if they had the gamma knife then that would be probably the best way to get rid of that then the Parkinson's obviously we would talk about doing stem cell therapy\nOkay\nBecause we've done that for patients you could look at the videos on my website and see some spectacular results or with patients that have had MS Parkinson's stroke diabetes or variety of different things\nSupplementation is important for children with high homeless assisting well of course\nYou know kids really don't have great vitamin levels because people rely on something that they see it as a truly origami or whatever and they give it to the kid gives the kid will take it but in many cases what we end up doing is taking a couple of the multivitamin capsules that we have opening it up putting it in food and the kids will have a better nutrient\nContent so we'll check their blood make some recommendations and retested\nSo hyper homeless esteem in her high homeless just in your blood\nCan contribute to pluck in your blood vessels their their eyes us as I see it there are fifty different things that contribute to plaque\nAnd homeless esteem is one of the individual ones the independent ones that can cause plaque without having any of the others you know with it that need to achieve that so we have to test kids for vitamins and minerals as well\nVery important\nUm ... getting like to call and ask a question you could do so right now let's go to how we in Queens how are you\nHello Dr ... last great good so the question is um some forty eight years old\nI've had psoriasis since I was ten I'd say that you know we can reasonably bad case of it okay and um you know I just I I at this point in my life I eat a healthy diet and relatively good shape\nHealthy diet is something that I always talk to people about what does that mean because\nYou're a vitamin levels below me test your blood then it's not as healthy as one might expect a also if some of the foods they're treating her you know creating some information which we can pick up on blood tests that might show up so I Know you're trying to do the right thing of course you are but there are things that we could look at that give us a great deal more information and make it up to find you and your picture\nRight well uh I'm going to specifically mentioned that uh about a year ago had a blood test and from my home or Fifteen Nineteen and I want\nTo go out yes Hi supposed to be three so that's why we were put together once we\nDo the blood test for your vitamins you put together vitamins based upon your blood test and your requirements and then we'd retest that after a month to make sure you're homeless as the levels are down to normal so you're ... you're obviously not getting enough the six ... maybe ... D\nI began taking um the last few months uh I'm not going to say what brand but it's a it's the vitamin ... and that's the way it it's a\nWhile you're kind of winning it because if you don't test all your vitamins\nAnd we don't look at your absorb digestive ability you know you have no idea if you're absorbing the things that you're taking that's why we did a blood test first\nAnd put you on vitamins we know have the high levels of the nutrients that bring down the homeless esteem and then we re check so a lot of people will do that and granted I mean in a way it it does make sense what you're doing makes sense let me try to\nTake a vitamin and try to do this on my own but the problem is you're missing out all of a lot of other things other inflammatory markers to show up in your blood my\nInitial blood tests depending upon what we talk about could be twenty twenty five pages so a lot of important information and of course I'm assisting we always have a conversation about you might not even convert B. twelve\nWhat if you don't have the gene that you would need to make an enzyme called methods I tried to fully duct tape and then you're taken regular B. twelve and it's not working\nI read about that on line yeah seen a lot of need I Need to come in and get these tests and\nYou know there's a lot of great information behind all of this I mean I Know when I say a big blood test people think oh it's a bit blood test but\nThere's so much more behind this like the genetic component to make the conversion of metal to mess will be twelve your vitamin level's red blood cell levels for the vitamins heavy metals or inflammatory markers I'm assisting fire burning agents who had to ... many many things\nSo we'd like to give you that education about what your buddies doing and then everything else becomes easy\nOkay and what with uh I\nGarden City as my closest office I guess if you live west of yes some Garden City is right at the corner of where a medical parkway a steward avenue intersect I'm the second building in from the corner eleven no one's Stewart avenue\nGotcha All right well you know I think I'm going to come in and say that great\nAnd take a look at the website to cause a see some great in for a great videos great studies articles research his doctor\nCal dot net okay I'll do that thanks are we look forward to seeing it OK\nPhone lines robot if you'd like to call and do so now let's go to Benny in Brooklyn\nHow are you betting [noise]\nYeah I Am not have targeted I Nine years\nHungry after our brain injury out of out of run over by a by a van Gogh attack and I had developed at nine years later wow and they have there been talk and\nLet me let me just ask you what sort of work do you do\nOh I don't know any work that I Know when you when I called them\nAll right the question I reason I asked because the people that seem to have Parkinson's MS logic disorders\nHave some work exposure with some sort of chemicals or heavy metals you know cleaning agents or pesticides or you know led marquee cadmium all of that so either way I think with your traumatic brain injury\nAnd with Parkinson's the best mechanism for you once we check your blood and start correcting your vitamins will be stem cell therapy\nOr there's a great video on my website about a gentleman with Parkinson's had been in a wheelchair\nFor years and over the course of a couple of days to see improvement and within a month he was standing up and out of the wheelchair\nIf you look at my website there's three columns go to the middle middle column a ride with a pink shirt a gentleman with MS right below that is a great video on a Parkinson's and we have a few more video self that coming up next week\nUh-huh while I have had no matter what medical marijuana should they have\nNo medical marijuana if anything decreases inflammation maybe and it may have anti cancer effect but it's not going to put new brain cells in your head only stem cells where we take your cells from your bone marrow spin that bone marrow liquid and take the cells himself\nAnd do an intravenous an a nasal approach will put billions of brand new cells into your body to go where you have damaging degeneration and those cells become other damaged tissue that is a fact is known for over a hundred years\nSo the research on stem cell ... therapy is staggering haven't\nLooked at the videos on my website and then look at the research on the bottom to a website\nAnd doing an ugly it's done once\nMost people would typically do it once but I think there are other things that you need to look at you know vitamin mineral Homer levels et cetera so we have to learn about somebody and then put together incorrect as many things as possible we might recommend vitamin D and you'll have might might have energy from that or correcting B. twelve\nYou might have a lot of energy from that but again\nYou want to have new cells put into the areas of damage specially in your brain to get your brain to make a Doberman and again that's what Parkinson's is just a generation of the brain cells that make doping on our time has the disease continues it gets worse than the men the men do work\nYeah he's right away it's not working or not that I I I ... a long time at that time there I mean uh\nWell you're telling me it's not working and I'm telling you as you get older you are losing more of your own you know new cell production that's why when you're putting yourself on board that's why people get such great results and there are Fifteen videos I think there for more we're putting on that show the great results the stem cell therapy and there are two thousand articles on my website most of them\nAre on stem cell therapy so you could read up stem cells for of a wide range of diseases that's why I put the articles and the videos there for you so\nGo to Dr Cal dot net is a website and of course give us a call the office in Garden City\nFive or six seven nine four zero four zero four\nOr five on seven nine four zero four zero for\nThat you have to have the time ...\nYes sir and uh yes you're all good so I look forward to seeing you try to call get an appointment as soon as you can we'll get you and as soon as possible thank you for your call okay phone\nLines rope in one eight hundred eight for eight WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two to let's go to Maria in Bay port\nMaria how are you are you there can you hear me\nOkay we'll give you Maria chance to get on I was thinking about singing the song from west side story but maybe I shouldn't read a and we'll get for a minute to get on\nA let's just go back to some interesting research while we kinda get a better phone connection\nOmega three fatty acids and make certain neural protective effects so you're making three fatty acids of course the good fish oils can help with your brain and are there are many many thousands of studies on the benefits of fatty acids and make threes lowering\nTriglycerides being good for a neuron development hormone development so important to keep all of these things within a good range in your body of course only testing will tell so you can be taken all sorts of stuff\nIf we look at your omega levels or the fatty acids in your blood on their low well you're not getting what your body needs\nAnd if you're taking a cookie tenor vitamin D you and your levels below if you're not taking the right combination or not enough or you're just not breaking down and absorbing digesting but these are all the things that we test for\nYou can't live on a lot of these four years old and he looked great halfway around on platelets regularly and I lost an artist you know going out with high player currently treat it like I Know where\nI get out to black high fat is calling and I also had a black eye in the past and\nI don't have a lot a lot of follow me later with a killer and not going to have like six months ago I had a ... and ... ... children\nIn a moment covers a\nLot going on my recent thing that I think she asked them at Mount Sinai kept out of character leukemia when pollock coyote I tried out with people that just got diagnosed elected now\nTake on All right so you got to come to a question I I'm trying to figure out the thing that I Would comment on if you had that many things going on that or cancer type things you have to have been exposed to some things\nRepeatedly that you know damage your immune system and allow these abnormal cells to pop up I don't think what you're describing has much genetic potential but typically when we see people that have multiple things are multiple types of the gender of issues or cancer this got to be some sort of\nExposure whether heavy metals from somewhere or pesticides chemicals where you live might have they might have sprayed the trees with the uh the insect uh you know killing Asian pesticides that could set the stage for that matter started when you're much younger I don't know but uh something has created multiple areas of degeneration within your means phones\nResponsible for the black anti cannot have any case it never\nHas really nothing to do with mutations 'cause you could get cancer without any mutation it's none of genetic mechanism there are people get cancer from you know bad diets and heavy metal exposure and smoking in all sorts of things\nYou know what I think I think what I was young you know if I Do think I could just hang up and I was probably like chemical I can\nThat's entirely possible you know I don't know there's no way to really answer that completely without really tracking things but\nI think some of the best things you could do would be to learn about your vitamins and minerals you know get them in the right range you want to use for human history humans got pretty strong anti cancer effect can nab annoyed also has some pretty strong kidney cancer effect you might even\nAnd certainly would benefit from doing that test we send your blood to Greece to a genetics lab to see what things have the best ability to inhibit the progression or growth of cancers\nSo there are different things that you certainly can do it just if you have to go beyond the traditional approach of looking at what managed to throw at you because you have a diagnosis gotta learn more about your body\nYou know if that's right I mean\nI've been doing this long enough to give people ideas you know there's research ... Academy of sciences the talks about vitamin C. IDs quadrupling killer cells and helping to selectively kill cancer cells\nThat says prestigious you could get the proceedings and asked Comey sciences so there are lots of important things you have to start looking at in the first thing that I Would do is get your big\nBlood test and we do that all the time\nI feel like the absolutely yep I've had really an appetite I Want to thank you I you're right on and on you and how how old you are you're\nVery very welcome this is what I was put on the earth to do this is what I'm you know what I'm here for so we want to be able to guide you as to what you make your buddies healthy as possible so thank you a great\nWhile you're on you okay the Garden City offices five or six seven nine four zero four zero for the website WWW dot D. R. C. A. L. dot net\nAnd the plain view office five or six for three three three two three too if you'd like to call and do so now we have a few minutes left who might be able to take a call or two so you know as I describe this with everyone\nYou have your individual requirements you also have your individual problems going on\nMaybe one person doesn't break down to digest food well and maybe because of that nutrient levels are low and they're into buddies are suffering maybe have a heavy metal exposure is affecting your member of your focus your concentration there are people\nNow who in the next five years will develop Parkinson's MS cancer heart disease\nYou know this is just statistical because I think these diseases her on the rise from what I see we've seen people that have both MS and Parkinson's and there's no explanation for that at all unless you look at\nWhat I've been describing you know the heavy metal exposure so you know the idea is that if we just randomly throw things out you\nHow are we ever going to say that we're creating a benefit or a result we can guess we need to learn about your body put together the right combinations of vitamins minerals\nExercise\nYou know I'm a fan of using the things that are safe and natural and I think they're going to be great numbers of people who are going to use the hemp derived command annoyed there's no THC in that\nBut can handle it does have a good protection um and even in looking at and many of those Greek tests when they were doing them a we don't do them of course because I'm not an oncologist but\nI'm the can nab annoyed and uh some of the mushroom extracts have some of the greatest anti cancer effect that's also born out by research and also anti inflammatory effect for that matter so as I say learn about buddy first then we put together a plan to got to make a plan\nWhat are you a hundred days parade WABC one eight hundred eighty four eight nine to two two if you'd like to call in to ask the question you can do so now\n\nInteresting supplementation was ... improve coronary blood\nFlow impatience with a history of heart attack\nSo we know insane as a stimulant we know that it's not as significant to stimulate of some of the stimulant drugs with all those risks are side effects but this was an interesting study where they took randomized placebo control study fifty patience with S. T. elevation\nWhich means that theory cagey showing abnormality or you know putting towards a heart attack using the ginseng extract help to improve Connery flow so you know very interesting to see that research but as I say it's not about one vitamin D is that about one drug\nIt's not about one activity when you're doing exercise you should do lots of different activities to get your body and it's best shape\n\nYou want to make sure that what your body requires based on your testing\nIs met\nWho's extremely active needs more vitamins 'cause they're burning through them someone doesn't absorb digest as well may need more vitamins 'cause you need to raise up to levels that get to your tissues and the vitamins are admitted that you're taking the morning may be gone by the afternoon\nAnd we've done testing on that to prove and see if a person takes a small dose of fire at first thing in the morning and let's say their level was low we tested the ...\nBack in the morning when they came to the office and then they come back they took it it's seven eight or nine o'clock when they first woke up we test them uh ten or eleven and twelve the levels of good on a different there'd be having come back we tested at three o'clock in the levels below why because a hundred trillion cells that you have in your body are using up\nYour vitamins and minerals\nYour thyroid and your other hormones so that's why we evaluate people in different ways to really understand all that person is going to need the morning go so far away to meet a little ... little dose of the afternoon\nThen that person will carry through their energy their focus their recall their brain function throughout the entire day instead of having a good morning I'm they're tired by four or five in the afternoon so that's one of the things that we see all the time and when people are put on thyroid they're put on TV for without any T. three\nAnd a lot of doctors think that taking the for will automatically converted to three and most people that does it in years of doing this Thirty years of doing this we find most of our people have very little T. three so he might opt to give them a little T. three and two for\nIt together in their thyroid which makes the most sense and then they feel the energy and then they feel the focus and then they start to lose the extra weight so it's looking at your body testing making recommendation re checking adjusting that's what creates success\nBecause we're tracking to see what your body is doing the same holds true of course the stem cell therapy\nWhatever we use stem cell therapy or whatever people have them come in and put the political together we watch to see you and they might say well you know I'm diabetic but I just realized my sense of smell is back in my vision is better or my hearing is better or my back pain went away\nWe had a lovely lady the other day who had a medical generation we did it in our co visions back\nAnd she can see more of the center of our eyes where she had to turn sideways to look to see things on the side of her eyes and\nBeing able to write her name on a line she's able to do now and read because of your own cells creator repair with them a damaged areas of your body thank you for listening God Bless you all have a wonderful day I'll be back on Saturday morning\nZero nine shoveled three for ... for a number eight zero four zero nine suburbs where his Dutch eight hundred three eight zero for Brazil remind shovels words you can also visited ... to go to invite the more she says buy health luxury for\nThe first [noise]\nThe release of [noise] [noise] oh I joined the protests celebrating thirty five years on the line on Seventy so and do what do you see\nReligion alone brought you buy Sherman's lovers more trouble visited my line from chapel called\nI Want to ah\nOr fear die young\nWho's in the studio with me today thank you for coming in here think throughout they are in the short term you become one of my heroes your father happens to be heroes mind\nYour father is a hero of mine because uh he's a proud represented the state of Israeli serves as consul general\nOr of the state of Israel\nAnd he's not afraid to stand in front of the audience talking about how important it is a to protect your people I see the the DNA of mom and dad is\nBeen instilled within you\nSo let's talk about what's happening in Columbia what's happening to you or the story is received much attention what I don't understand is I hear people talking about freedom of speech Reece beach it's\nA fundamental are right in our country the trouble I see sometimes as there are people talking about free speech for me but not for you\nThis is exactly the issue at Columbia University I'm most pro Israel students who are um probably and loudly pro Israel face\nUm many attempts to sounds them many times that are um seen in a way of demonstrating inside at an event taking the speaker out of the stage in and making him not talk about Israel I'm Carrying down our fliers when we invite people to our events\nAnd this is only the things that happen to us as a group and unfortunately this is also happening to individual not in the sense of I'm hearing down fliers but when it comes to individuals\nThese anti Israel groups are not afraid to um it even happened this week than private messages to our board members calling them hateful people or I'm calling some of it and members of students supporting Israel murders Nazis healers I'm baby killer is\nOut of course these has no factual basis um and they just go round calling us the names in order to do the lead you to ... our presence and our stance on ...\nOf course they have no trouble taking scholarships from money's provided by the board members\n... very generous with the schools are your students who protest you have no trouble protests boardrooms into trouble accepting funds are you are a student majoring in political science true what year are you at Columbia sophomore sophomore\nWere you aware before you arrived on campus of some of the challenges you may have to confront\nYes in fact I think the reason I chose to come to Columbia hum I secret after serving for four years since the spokesperson unit of the idea\nUm I work with the many international media outlets and I understood that he has no real idea of what's happening in Israel what are the challenges Israelis facing and I decided a when I finished my services to four years to come here and fight the battle in a different every now\nI'm not out of the media but that off um public opinion when I heard about the situation in Colombia I decided to come here uh and combine to things that I care about it a lot Israel and higher education in a very\nGood and his team are academic institution so I came to Columbia and unfortunately what I found out that was that\nUm they stretch on the ground is much worse than I thought anything that is a lot do you decide that universities refusing to actually take measures and do things about the complaints boys real students are I'm posing to the university and he said meanest raiders\n... one of the problems I find is will use that we have a number of students and I think you mentioned to me in the conversation we had earlier\nThere are a number of students some of whom are Jewish or apathetic you know you have demonstrated counter demonstrators but there's a significant segment that doesn't appear at all\nI'm not just a Jewish buddies rally students as well\nUm and most of them I cannot blame them he ... he became a very wholesale place to Israelis and pro Israel students there are tenured professors who are for example one of them I'm On the sea levels of course there's a book called the invention of the Jews speaking about how did you is there any invented the people\nI'm ... there are students on campus would that uh took part in being pro Israel were involved with students supporting Israel\nAnd then websites like electronic ... um published hateful and of course are not true stories about them and now they're going to be interviewed for ... or a ... job interviews this is what people see when they will they know their name so I can blame most of them for not wanting to take a stand\nAnd when they see that I'm organizations like students supporting Israel filed a detailed complaint on January and the university has still\nNot taking any measures to punish the people who are are violating university rules of conduct why would someone being involved why would people once you reach themselves and their reputation when they know the university is not going to protect them\n[noise] I remember years ago a group of us out with the president of Colombia the treatment of the board of Columbia and we raise an issue that I'm sure she'll exists\nThere are students who are pro Israel who took courses were professors who happen to have a different view they are afraid\nTo challenge the professor and clothes because they feel if they do they're going to suffer academically they're going to be given agree that doesn't really represent you know a value of their presentation\nI'll tell you more than that\nIn Colombia I ended up as an Eighteen pro Israel students are not taking certain classes\nThere are certain classes and started
