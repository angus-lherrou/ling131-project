may live on one of those districts\nOne of those seven districts in California one of those six or seven districts in Pennsylvania one of those three districts in New Jersey one of those four or five districts in New York\nThey're all over the country you may live in one of those that's very\nVery very important\nThat you get involved\nEven in your own life that you get involved with a handful of people and make sure they vote and imagine if you do that and then a few others do that and so forth and so it would be a big deal it really would is there a silent majority and if they\nWere about to find out are the poles right are are the polls wrong we're about to find out\n\nBut we should be focused like a laser forget about the static we should be focused like a laser\n\nYou know you love
