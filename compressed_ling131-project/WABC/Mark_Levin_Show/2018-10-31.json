WABC\n[noise]\nWelcome back as the bench Shapiro shows or Dr phil Saturday he needs to get into the swing of things by talking about white privilege he did a segment and when she had Michael Eric Dyson and a bunch of other sort of social activists\nParticularly the black community and he did what he called study what was it started well he got a bunch of people of different races and sexism sexual orientation to line up bunch of young people in line and then you had somebody asked them some thirty questions about privilege and their life\nAnd then he had you take a step forward for everything that you ... you had to take a step back for every public you didn't have\nSo it was tough like if both your ... if one of your parents work night to support the family take a step back if you've ever been sexually harassed take a step back and by the end of that little exercise some of the some of the young people were you know pretty far or word on the stage and some of the young people were pretty far backward on the stage\nAnd here's how some of those young people responded to learning about their privilege\nI'm very aware of my white privilege but it really shows when I left behind me most of the people in the very back with people of color\nI was in the I'm not ever in a vat of anything that idea of\nBeing in the front made me feel uncomfortable it's an awkward feeling like they're there and you know that like everyone behind you can look at you right but you can look at them\nAnd landed in the very back again to surprise I don't have very much right now but I've always thought that there are there people who\nHad lived I didn't know and and that and the friend the way I was raised by the border in Mexico that I was in the last ... about where to know that I Am actually doing\nThat I think talking about white privilege in a room full of white people was awkward for in a room full of different ethnic groups I think\nNecessary that ... this was really interesting and really it was a real is something I'm Glad we did well ... it's now it's actually a bad thing the reason is a bad thing is you can listen to what some of the young people are saying there's a woman who was standing in the back and she appears to be a maybe a Latino extraction\nAnd she says you know it never occurred to me that I had it rough right it always occurred to me that there are people who are worse off an island why is that a bad attitude that's a really good attitude\nAnd being awake in the back and you have a really rough and being thought or thinking of yourself to become is it really easy path to slide into resentment and anger and rage and other people who quote unquote have better and there there was a young black woman there\nWho said no I've never stood in the back of my life that's the right attitude the right attitude is you don't have to get into that just because of didn't and birth or problems that you had growing up in America you can get ahead but the entire privilege discussion\nIs supposed to not waking people in the back there is inequality in the United states in terms of where we start we all know that you have to be an idiot and I know that but it's supposed to do instead instill in people\nWho had who were better off growing up that they somehow had an unfair advantage over others and to instill in people who are worse off growing up at the people in the front screwed them right to even set it up in this sort of physical dichotomy where the people who are quote unquote more privileged our head and people who are less privileged R B\nI it's just it just sort of back of the bus mentality oh you've been treated by America wrongly somebody has victimized and in some way\nWell virtually none of like I none of the questions that were at in that segment we're about members of the victimizing each other is that right if you've been victimized by somebody in this group take a step that if you victimized somebody in this group take a step forward none of those questions were about that if there were about that then we can talk about whether inequality an inequity\nAre linked but it wasn't about that it was about have you had a rubber or if you had a better why do you need full discussions have who's had ... there was no more boring discussion in the world then who's had a rubber or ... or who's had a better and I don't just mean boring in terms of\nLike actually not interesting I mean that it's useless and counterproductive when there's a famous joke is that\nThere was nobody more boring than a person who you ask them how they are naturally ...\nAgain the same thing is true when it comes to this sort of stuff because in a country that is free\nWhere you started is not where you end up in ... the idea that where you started is where you end up is a way of ensuring that people don't do all that they can in order to better themselves it's really really dumb stuff is really dumb stuff we'll be back here tomorrow to break down the latest\nWho is as red blooded as they come great hatred combat veteran\nThere's a reason why this African American gets no national attention has not appeared on CNN or MSNBC and any significant way or meet the press or any of the rest of it\nThere's a reason why Iraq Obama is not campaigning for John James in Michigan there's a reason why Oprah Winfrey is not campaigning for John James in Michigan and yet Obama's campaigning for Joe I'm In Florida\nAnd Oprah's in Georgia campaigning for another radical\nThere's a reason why a guy named Robert Francis O'Rourke who calls himself veto has re Seventy million dollars on his receiving all this media attention\nFree media attention all other candidates or not\n\nWe're going to have a special show on life liberty and all of them this Sunday\nTen pm mine is the last of the shows without reruns on Fox on the weekend before the election on that Sunday\nAnd I'm going to do things a little differently on that show I'm going to uh do a monologue and I'm not going to do it normally but I'm going to do it in this case 'cause it's an extraordinarily important time in our history\n\nAnd I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us the tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among them many like Don limit of CNN the thing he said the other day is a fireball offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\nAnd the things he has said and I've gone through and look these are firing offenses but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this they want a divided country they want the race may they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power with these corporations and these executives believe they can ah they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again that birthright\nCitizenship you are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar there that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statute that goes there will be filibustered in the Senate\nSo it's a non issue that Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship some of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that the commentators on TV even some conservatives\nThey pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware or what have been done already these are the same people in Congress refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce our immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass\nA statute outlawing birthright citizenship but why pass a statue if in fact as the laughs at some of these conservatives say 'cause there are no not things that\nBirthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous effects that case then how's the statute gonna affects statue won't fix it because\nThey're saying you have to amend the constitution\nWhen's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way it's been a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did outside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps there\n\nAs we discuss the other day I was I just got says Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me birthright citizenship was not\nActually implemented in this country in the sixties and seventies that Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy by the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and the statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass a statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of Kavanaugh was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\nThe president happens to be right about that the president happens to be right about the constitution the president\nAnd this debate right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happened to be wrong he knows more than I Do\n\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist concocted an ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they when they when you have the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship\nWith a left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous president\nThe plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq walk collectively ignoring enlist uninterrupted case law indicating the opposite all for the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F wells and Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ugly that it was quote establishments no new right declaring no new principal\nOn quote quote\nIt is not the object of this bill to establish new rights but they're protected enforce those which belonged to every citizen unquote that's what he declared an Eighteen sixty six and I want you to think about it how many states ratify this amendment\nIf they believed it will be applied\nTo illegal alien babies known as birthright citizenship not a one\n\nThis madman west pastor\nProtect African American former slaves not foreigners yet to be born who have no right to come into this country illegally\nPeriod\nThe notion that an amendment designed a grand freed slaves who lived here for centuries and had no allegiance to any other jurisdiction that basic rights of American citizens will be used as a tool to prevent Congress from regulating citizenship for immigrants of all stripes is scandal is\nThe first sentence of the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state we're in they reside we need not speculate what subject to the jurisdiction there are means as I said the other day\nSenator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at that time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to its complete jurisdiction quote not allowing allegiance to anybody else on quote of course persons present inside American territory\nAre subject to our partial jurisdiction in the sense that they have to obey our laws and our subject to criminal prosecution for disobeying our laws but one congressional drafter added the second phase of jurisdiction to citizenship clause they require it clearly limiting citizenship\nTo those who in the words of one of the three key draft ers were subject to complete jurisdictions as American\nQuipped start to just
