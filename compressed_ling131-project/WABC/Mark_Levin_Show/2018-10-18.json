Elizabeth Warren\nABC News said this on Monday\nAnd Elizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry about that had one about the peace supposedly objective independent the big quote Warren DNA shows Native American heritage about CNN you'll love this one is as of Monday Elizabeth Warren\nYou know Pocahontas quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test was strong evidence of Native American ancestry BBC\nElizabeth Warren DNA tests fine strong evidence of Native American blood\nThat strong evidence amounts to something less than point one percent in reality she is less Native American blood than the typical so called white American has Native American blood it's unbelievable\nAnd uh about uh the Daily Beast on Monday quote breaking news Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test yes she is Native American how 'bout that\nBoston Globe her hometown newspaper quote Warren reveals test confirming ancestry NBC News but nobody but Clinton network NBC News quote Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she is Native American heritage when you break down the numbers\nThe testing but this person did involve samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than point one percent Native American blood that she played for decades as a minority to make money\nAnd so it's amazing to me how the media covers for those protected inside the

according to certain actresses in Hollywood here nightly says that she is not going to allow her daughter to watch the little\nAgain in a normal world where they normal media\nThe president the United states of America the headline would actually look like and read ... president United States America defends lawlessness\nAcross the border in Mexico and puts Mexico on notice\nThat if they don't stop these illegal immigrants from coming across into this country that will cause the southern border to protect our nation's interests and and it it would be ... by All right because this is what a normal president does this ... what a normal\nMother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than putting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a ... system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\n\nNow all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from art before or many of you know me I I play tennis in college I was almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a now their nation they both came to this country as a student\nWith a student visa legally they didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house 'cause I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate for a civilized nation sets\nYou you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing\nWith an evil nation in Saudi Arabia again he hasn't\nStood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter going to a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust some interactions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage and Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be\nRaichlen is an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's on hands and he's a terrible person they should calm down and she'll be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fight for the country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care venting to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing its thing he's on hands these crazy and he's mean and even when he was so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work and something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure did they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they are like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut our feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify with Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights\nMy point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken alive is because it was a member of the media and it's terrific what happened to him\nBut his ... but the media who's acting like this is something we must were I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know\nWhy we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do we also need a place that we can lay and we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that a relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agree that it's important they've all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees that Reagan Reagan agrees with Jimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy when we've known that this is what we've been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald trumps the villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they say this is too strong it's there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be made and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our our ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective of I'm a journalist and I'm\nGoing to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your life\nMost journalists are self important I Can't use the word I Want to use a\nI Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they're better for example didn't even talk shows are commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hated that has happened I hate this journalist was killed\nBut make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over the demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president it's America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant caravan are legal immigrants heading nine states America is what a president should do\nRegardless of party you don't welcome operate because you don't you know I mean what what what is the media what Donald Trump to do what does it and I know what the left one Sunday but I'm saying that's directly the media do they want Donald Trump to go down to the border and and and make it a great fence\nWith big doors open those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America and break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps and have no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump hug\n\nWon eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven I'll get your reaction you\nCan tweet at me

they know they're just passing on through that's what they're doing they're just passing through the president's tweets today were measured his comments\nWere measured not unhinged not crazy measured they were very measured\nYou're telling a country that we're supposed to be doing trade with that's supposed to uh respect this country and clearly they don't you need to stop these people and if you

yourself because if you allow this to happen to us there is going to be a issue\nMexico was supposed to be an ally of ours allies don't let illegal immigrants break into your country when they know about it weeks in advance\n\nThis is exactly why I voted for Donald Trump because I knew it was going to stand up for us I knew he was going to stand up and be a law and order president which we've

soul\nAnd the reason why I say that is based on facts and the way that she tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh with no facts where she did everything in her power to destroy a good man and his family name all because in the name of politics\n\nShe has now come out\nWith an idea that many Democrats are very excited about\n\nShe says that American families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit a five hundred dollars a six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announce today by the Democratic party the Democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California\nShe then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year should be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be three thousand a year\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases that is why\nAmericans are working harder than ever before right now because of jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment to full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she just said that sense is is is nothing but a ... a\nLie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in our own words is why\nI'm not going to focus on that for ... that's that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you\nHarris says office as she rolled out this plan today cited a two thousand Seventeen survey from the website bank rate that Tom ... found that more than half of Americans\nCannot afford a five hundred dollar\nUnexpected expense such as it rent increase a medical bill or childcare\nNow bank rate survey came out and it said their headline of this phone survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings they rely on in an emergency\n\nSo what you have is you have come out of hairs and saying OK Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me because people can actually pay for their own darn phone bill now food\nStamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps where we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in the great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I got to do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called ... dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected effects pets\nLet me just\nExplain to you how worked this logic is this idea is I'll go back to her first part of her proposal she said\nMaking Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year could be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nAnd the reason why she wants to give you that money every month this because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with the rent increase of medical bill or child care so she wants to give you government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand nine hours here have an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expects now my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody who's making\nNine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make sure I said it's number correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the level freak out so that said it wrong so correct it right now calm\nDown you're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money is going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you you\nJust said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to save that money because at the same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nRemember when we had the tax credit that came out Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they were they deal with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people to save that money they got extra money they went out and spin it right away don't look at the stats\n\nAirs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of it every single month\nOn average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you get an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing be able to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year but there are now going to say that money every month\nFor an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month is not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget\nThis is nothing more than buying votes this is not about ... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey from bank great dot com is the reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nThat is going to save America's middle class by giving them extra money among subsides from the government that now they're going to save that money and not spend it on whatever the crap they're spending their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making the year ... is just liberal and competency at its\nBiggest form you can make\nBring this to a ... a family level if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year and I called my dad and said dad I man I had a flat tire this morning\nCan you can you let me borrow two hundred bucks I don't have it my dad would tell me to drive on the darn fair and get my house in order in my life in order and stop being a screw up\n\nHe would not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're an\nIdiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand dollars a year if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example and I had a flat tire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom look I'm only making fifty grand\nI just had a flat tire I have no extra savings I Can't deal with this unexpected tire expense can you please send over five hundred dollars or two hundred and fifty dollars to use their math ... I I Would hope my mom would hang up the phone on me\nIn fact I Hope she would say I'm embarrassed by you you're an embarrassment to the family get your life together you moron and then hang up on me\nThis is nothing more than buying votes this is\nNothing more than welfare on a higher level than the welfare that we're currently\nIn that they've been offering instead of food stamps you're offering people cash because they're not getting the food stamps anymore so you still got to keep them addicted to you\n\nYou still got to get them addicted to you that's what you got to do just get them addicted to you one age seven seven\nThree one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven than Ferguson filling in for Marco then we'll be right back\n[noise] much of him\nOn Seventy seven W.
