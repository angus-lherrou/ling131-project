I. P. rank has its privileges that's what I'm choosing to talk about tonight\nTonight will be a full look at the privilege and responsibility of success speaking of rank having its privileges\nThe ranking lawyer millennial and co host of always in fashion Jesse Weber Jesse speaking of success and responsibility what are you got to think about this one\nAnd listening to this at I actually thought about me as a lawyer and how hard it was for me to get to become a lawyer to become an attorney law school was very challenging three years of law school studying nonstop and just at the end of it you think it's the conclusion of studying\nAnd then you remember you have to take the bar exam which is where you shut off from society for two and a half months you don't see anybody you don't talk to anybody you just in the library studying and it all combinations on one exam that determines really the fate of whether or not you will become a lawyer so it's a lot of responsibility\nSo you're happy as it all of that I Love the title so there are a lot of people who are not\nSo happy with the legal profession they get kind of bird doubt they have their own problems that title is what I really love the rank of attorney I Love that is when you start a conversation and say hey I'm an attorney oh oh excuse me it gives people pause\nWell I'm very proud of you that you don't have this attorney title I'm very proud of you start in your career it looks nice but while we're on the subject of rank and having his privileges which is the theme of Tonight Show\nI have been told that you out there need to know who your host is and it's been quite some time since we talked about how I got to where I got who is Marc Weber [laughter] very good you know the whole thing there\nWho is Marc Weber is a self made businessman executive here to help you find your success I could keep doing it but\n[laughter] it's great you know what really upsets me and that's when I got to thinking about this subject when you hear of politicians talking about hard working Americans what they want to do for the hard working Americans and I can tell you and I can promise you\nThey're not talking about me you see America is creating some kind of class system right now in someone like me who started working at fourteen years old and never stopped since\nThis isn't a hardworking American because I'm successful and that's why I'm not apologizing at all if I'm not a hardworking American than who is\nIt bothers me that I'm segregated from hard working Americans because I'm successful um the bad guy idle deserve a break\nI pay more taxes than you can possibly imagine and even if I did and just think it would this thirty nine percent federal tax eight and a half percent state tax\nPsycho Medicare real estate taxes town taxes and everything I purchase with the money I left over this tax food gas closed even the interest for my savings that I saved this tax\nI've never been in the cash business I've always been a salaried employee so I have nowhere to hide what comes and gets taxed I don't get money hadn't on thing I'd pay taxes\nI get a bonus check I tell you I got a bonus check when I was with Elvie image an amazing check for a job well then I took a company that never made profit and I made the extraordinary profits and I got a great bonus check when I saw what they took out a tax is\nNow my office at the time for this particular division they lose the corner office on the Eighteenth floor surrounded and windows that opened it was an older building I opened the windows after receiving the bonus check and seeing the taxes and screamed\nOut I Hope you're happy up there because I just paid for all of you to do whatever you're doing\nAnd then somebody down there goes thanks [laughter] nobody said anything the point is in today's environment some politicians are trying to create a class war that's\nBecause they have no class and they have no shame I Am not appreciated as hard working Americans but yet I I'm not ashamed of my success I did it the old fashioned way I earned it\nHowever\nDo recognize that with success comes responsibility and more importantly as we talk tonight we have to understand the business in ...\nStock in their company would go up\nYou are being paid to make a company successful\nYou share in that success that capitalism but don't forget you have a responsibility you have to be good no you have to be great their shareholders deserve you being great\nNow having said that I've had some fun times since in great times made a decision one year to put a billboard Yankee Stadium\nFor five years DKNY was right in center field in Yankee Stadium\nJust you remember those years of those years were fantastic not only did we have the billboard in Yankee Stadium and the Supreme section do you mean with the ... the legends a section at Yankee Stadium where the all the box seats where we named the entire\nWhat's it called a legend section the DKNY lounge the DKNY lines where all the food was unbelievable it's called the white unlimited food yeah fighting for when you want it as much as you want it [laughter] I was privileged front row Yankee Stadium ahead for front row seats\nOf course I went when I could but I had to make sure that everyone in the company got a chance at those seats I use them to entertain most of the time [laughter] if you consider bringing the family hey rank has its privileges I'm not going to apologize\nCompany stock was going up as making profits through the roof the French who owned a company love me yeah set front row Yankee Stadium and I enjoyed the fact that I put that DKNY billboard there whether the Yankees were making progress and we were showing the branch\nOf so many people it was a great time great time and it was a privilege that I enjoy we talked about runway shows before there is nothing like being in New York fashion week sitting front row of the runway show next to the celebrities all the power brokers you want to talk about rank has its privileges\nYou want to get your two cents in this one just\nIt was awesome it was great it was like oh hey Ariana Grande day [laughter] yeah I'm just sitting here Ralph [laughter] don't mind me and if you want to take the voucher it's funny yeah that's what it was like say the interesting thing about all the celebrities I met over a twenty year period\nI Know everything about all of them but they never once asked me a question now the trick to speaking to a really big celebrity just keep asking questions about themselves and guess what they're happy to talk about themselves they well they have their privileges from their rank and that's what we're talking about do not apologize in America for success\nBut I have one of my favorite stories of all time which I don't think I ever told you just it\nWas really bad yeah yeah okay it has to do with going to France my first trip after I got the job with Louis

Mart with a discount store whose time has come this time had come let's face it they just weren't real isn't anymore their stores out there you never heard of\nWorld War if you're a well worth it sounds like it belongs in Montgomery Ward now he's in big retail changed that the management didn't take the responsibility seriously enough for the people that put management in place didn't pick the right people and they went bankrupt k-mart was the fifth horse into three horse race\nAnd ... I like the beginning of the ad I liked that expression yeah okay that's why I get paid the big bucks\nSo between the two rows and the three horse race Sears is making a lot of mistakes on top of which with all due respect to missed elaborate who I Am sure as a genius what\nDid he know about running Sears I came on nothing\nWhat did you know about picking the right talent I'm not sure where was she was bored along the way I'm not sure how could a retailer this size with these brands with these leadership but the idea that you can get people coming and going you can get 'em for apparently you can get 'em for\nYour branch in hard good it was one of the world's great retail is their head of the world and that catalog they had millions and millions of people's names\nYou know what a retail would pay for millions and millions of names\nRight to their door their addresses the phone numbers their likes and dislikes\nBillions and Sears is going bankrupt\nMellow come out of bankruptcy I'm sure they'll never be the same they'll never have the same products I'm sure the inventories starved that I don't know what's going to be the future Sears but on the show that's named always in fashion how can I not talk about it and in the evening where we are talking about rank has its privileges you do well you're entitled\nTo everything but it also has its responsibilities and I gotta say whoever's been involved in managing Sears forgot what their job was and they failed Sears is bankrupt would that'll take a break we'll be back in a\nMinute [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\nI Am familiar with that I spent nine years there as the c._e._o. if there's one thing I knew about that Brent it's fashion and quality at the highest level\nDKNY suits navies blacks grazed charcoal there's insatiable the shirts whites and blues and beautiful patterns the neck where is very very simple but very elegant right up my alley I Love those books\nAnd what they do for spring as they put in some shots of rape color just a ... to ... colors to make those fashion products and those basic goal is to look out and they\nBecame way out or we're also something to marvel at the right piece of data where makes a statement simple elegant\nContemporary and right but it tells the story Deacon White out to where it is amazing the full stuff is great now the follow for spring really really looks sensation\nYou can find DKNY at Macy's or online go find it I'm telling you this is my recommendation as I said nine years working I Know how good it is\n[noise] welcome back to always [laughter] here's your house Marc Weber [noise]\n\n\n\n\nIt's just more ... and this is always in fashion and we're talking business tonight\nAnd if you're just tuning in we're talking the name of the show tonight is R. H. I. P. rank has its privileges you do well in business life you have a great life\nI talked before I've had success in business and I am thrilled by it and I won't apologize for my success in spite of whatever mood goes on in this country I worked hard I earned it the hard way\nNobody gave me anything my success just because of this country provided a system\nFor which we all can operate we all have an\nEqual chance of making something of ourselves we can\nBut\nWith that success you may achieve comes tremendous responsibility\n\nThat responsibility my friends is what it's all about when you work for a company your job is to make the company successful [noise] that's all you should be focused on\nEverything else around you all the pleasantries older people Holden niceties all the tasks all the chores all the\nBeing spent [noise] there's only one reason to be doing it [noise] it's\nTo create a success in the company you're working for [noise] there are linked to people who invest their money with you and your company there are banks lend money to your company there are people that buy your stock\nThere or insurance fund\nTheir pension plans buying the company stock for only one reason to have a secure investment and when they invest in your company they're investing in June their banking on the idea that you know what you're doing\nAnd that would ever benefits you have from the company you also recognize the tremendous responsibility that you have to deliver on behalf of those people who trusted you\nWith the mind I've heard of ... on the tonight it's been a lot of people\nSo they chose calls rank has its privileges but when it comes a tremendous responsibility\nWith a responsibility I Hope you enjoy the show they don't talk to get into this is mark wherever I Will never apologize for success because ... years old and he's\nAnd\nThank you for joining mark Weber and always the fashion at the next week\n[noise]\n\nSome stuff on your shopping cart stop crying [noise]\nSkill flakes from your mom do not\nSee coming stops winning starts [laughter]\nThey're trying to\nBe repeated and repeated wars you buy one for your journal joined us from\nDay one thousand dollars less likely\nTo die of dot com\n[noise]\nJournalist killing mid term elections I mean and Kate's Saudi Arabia's foreign minister says the killing of a journalist was carried out by rogue operators who compounded their mistake by trying to cover it up Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina tells boxes Sunday Morning teachers that the kingdom needs to be held accountable\nHe was clearly murdered in a conflict things like that don't happen in Saudi Arabia without pay for the top knowing we'll find out more I like the president's measured response I liked the idea that he wants to consult with Congress about what to do\nThere are an ally but they need us more than we need them\nFinding heavy metals getting him out of your system so it's a great deal of scrutiny that I Do with patient somebody explain and we we do together\nTo be able to get results so the science of what your body tells us allows us to go forward and then making recommendations and then re testing is the science of proven what we've done has worked\nUnfortunately there's not a lot of that in the health realm today because people are taking things that may or may not work\nI'm I've been doing genetic testing people to see what medications they shouldn't take\nBecause those medications will be harmful for them there are genetic tests that show what would it wouldn't work for you what may be harmful so we're looking at that as well that's just an add on to what I Would call the most you know comprehensive\nA nutritional approach and scientific approach um and I think once you understand what your body needs and you start to put these things in place you realize how important it is\nAnd actually how well it works and that's why we see people that lose you know the way they want to lose\nThey see that their cholesterol is coming down without\nA medications they see that their aches and pains have changed and when we talk about you know comprehensive therapies vitamins minerals correcting hormones or stem cell therapy then you have the ultimate benefits and also the\nA significant change of the degenerative an inflammatory conditions so this is where we are with\nI think the most comprehensive approach that exists um there are no other doctors do the same approach that I did it say do the same tests and then I Do there aren't any other doctors due to some recommendations than I Do and I've made my approach is comprehensive as thorough\nAs humanly possible ICU I take your history ... make recommendations and a lot of other officers doctors have other people doing all the work but I don't\nSo phone lines are open if you'd like to call in one eight hundred aid for eight WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two too if you'd like to call in to ask a question you could do so now let's go to look at some of the research\nA green leafy increased surface vegetables are associated with reduced risk of non Hodgkin's lymphoma [noise]\nThis is great research and and this is some of what I've read I'm a great deal of information is I'm On there on the Internet about green leafy Christopher special decreasing cancerous and this is one\nYou know cancer that they're talking about but I've seen this on the other cases in a population base case control study involving people have not hospitals the fallen and those people that were controlled that didn't have them from Ernie cancer\nHind takes green leafy vegetables and ... vegetables were found to be associated with a lower risk\nSignificant lord risk of non Hodgkin's lymphoma so total vegetables carotene rich vegetables of course red green yellow peppers carrots so I think that there's a great deal to be said to be using large servings of all the good vegetables in your diet every day\nWe'll talk about olive oil and it's got some great anti inflammatory risk a benefit um\nGreen tea of course\nA into a car but also for fame things from a broccoli and the green so there's a great deal of a nutrient density you get from the foods\nThat we're talking about so that would be important to keep in mind a lot of people will have you know what they live for serial they're told to have ... breakfast or a cereal or they're they're told to have a\nUm you know coffee and buttons and things like that but the majority of things that people have touched your bad for them and I talked to people about this all day long\nSo for breakfast you want to have healthy foods you want to either do vegetable juice you might do a berries with some a low carb yogurt for a lot of people they do a protein shake or protein bar\nThey can have you know organic eggs there's so many things that you can do\nThat are not going to be the foods with all the chemicals in the food subtle of sugar content so realistically want to get the best foods in breakfast lunch and dinner\nAnd for a lot of people it's a little bit of something for breakfast a little something to come back to the launch a small launch those something between lunch and dinner and a small or not the big meals that were told that we should be eating\nSo we have to keep our volume of food also down to a more normal range in size\nAnd again once we test to see what you can or can't eat and what your vitamins are then you're done becomes much more purposeful so that's the point we want to have a tailored specific die based upon your body\nOnce again the phone lines robe and if you'd like to call in do so now one eight hundred aid for eight WABC one eight hundred for eight nine to two to let's go to mark in free hold how are you\nYes Hi doctor are you sir I had a\n... years ago I had a meter diameter ... ... a completely wiped out my right side as far as yelling I was three hundred and eighty three pounds but it happened um well I I swimming or walking I lost\nFive pounds and nine that for you I subsequently that I put back about a hundred twenty of it and I question\nThat I had a stroke I think he'd be a route was afraid of it 'cause I Know the only in my foot clearly that I write side as well as their apathy is there any supplements or anything that you've done\nWell supplement wise no but yes on stem cell and they said also the reality is your body at three hundred eighty five pounds it was sort of the uh waiting for the stroke to happen because your body can't in every blood vessels have such\nA relaxed pressure that you're not going to cause a splitting the blood vessel in the stroke so I'm Glad that you've lost the weight gaining it back means that you're probably eating too much carbohydrate I Would bet your vitamin levels\nAre low you're hormone levels that helped to burn sugar and fat might be low I think that if you can can you to do the exercise that's great but we still have to learn a lot about your body\nSo if you look at research and tons of research on stem cell therapy and even videos on my website you'll see a gentleman who had a baseball game ugliest truck where most people never survived that but he survived emitted stem cell therapy on any kind of wonderful response\nSo taking your own cells from your body and doing an intravenous approach and then the nasal approach you're putting it in you know both ways um it's pretty dramatic as to how your body can use its own cells to repair itself that's the only job of stem cells they're supposed to go to areas of damage generation\nA set up shop and make brand new cells that function as brand new cells in your brain your heart your lungs your liver your kidney or paying Chris we've seen people have diabetes that have wonderful results\nAlzheimer's Parkinson's stroke lupus rheumatoid COPD and these videos or on my website you can see that they're almost Seventeen or Eighteen videos there but we have to control and fix every part of the picture\nSo your vitamins have to be great range your minerals yo hormones you know we have to look to see if there are other things that are causing plaque and your blood vessels heavy metals we need to look after blood and urine so there's a lot to look at\nUm how do I make an appointment\nYou just call the office the phone number is five or six seven nine four zero four zero four we also do intravenous out from the poet casting for neuropathy\nAnd even traditional medicine research shows\nThat that can help to decrease the discomfort from neuropathy and we have lots of patients that we've done that we might also takes themselves and inject the area where you described in her up at the weather it's down to legged towards the feet so we may have some add ons as well for that\nLike many cases Eighteen months and the pain is so severe that you know most of the time I I just find myself through the\nDay or meditation doesn't change everything you know medication is not always the answer I don't take medication is that often the answer I think we have to fix what's going on with your body and watch to see your body improve but take a look up the videos on my website you'll be astonished those are people that tell their stories\nWe have a few more coming up with the next week but look at the ones that are on the website now if you want to look at the gentleman that had a stroke I think he's in the um right column there's three columns right in the middle the website and he's a second video down so you can look at that person telling a story\nIt's like I say it's not an appointment tomorrow great look forward to seeing you have a wonderful day Dr thanks very buddy you got\nA one eight hundred eight for eight WABC one eight hundred for eight nine to two two you can call in and ask a question let's go to Joe in Piscataway\nHow are you giving Dr Yes sir\nI'm Seventy nine years old and a federal asked of a little over two years and that this conflict in my stomach it's more or less like a bloated feeling yeah I've had since then I've had three ultrasound of the abdomen tells us\nOne cat scans the abdomen pelvis had a colonoscopy upper end this coffee echo Claudia grand and they can't find anything\nWell they're missing something very simple but I'm Glad you know on one hand\nThat you did a good work up and you found nothing there you know no tumors horrible things so I'm very happy at that point but I'm going to tell you what the most common cause of bloating is\nAnd that's going to be allergic to a food or sugars and your diet so I've done this for Thirty years and I believe me I've seen every person of every age and when we hear about blood and we tell them to not have any grains no bread\nNo rice no pasta no oatmeal no grains whatsoever and watch to see how much of your stomach would feel number one because people are allergic to grains there's GMO\nYou know grains and the sugar of the grains can cause the bloating just like when you mix or when they make beer they they mix of barley in eastern hops it's all this grand new sugar that fermentation process to curse in similar to what's happening in your gun also\nRemove the stem cells from bone marrow do chemo and radiation and then put the stem cells right back in to help to re populated new immune system kill cancer\nAnd also um for in my realm 'cause I'm not an oncologist\nI can use stem cell therapy for patients after five years out from having cancer I think ideally putting brand new cells in the area would make all the sense in the world\nJust like a person who had a stroke and there's death of those cells in the brain or someone who has Parkinson's and the pancreatic cells are degenerating or someone who has no heart failure or a\nCardio my apathy your liver kidney\nA degeneration so you're putting brand new cells and and there's likelihood that the new ... new cells would work like the regular brain cells\nThat is what research has been showing for over a hundred years so research\nThat says that the cells and the rich looking\nLike a research has documented the stem cells only have one job and that is to go to areas of damaging degeneration and make brand new cells and that research the word to stem cell began back a hundred and fifty years ago and orange earns take those German doctor who was doing research\nIn called it a stem cell so that's where we think the first time stem cell was used in a word or a term or in studies but then after that all of Europe stem cells have been used extensively\nThat's where almost all the research has occurred in South America as well but mostly in Europe Germany Italy France Israel or Russia China Japan England France everywhere so that's what we know about\nCells that is their only function to go to an area of damage and become a new cell of that damage type\nIf you look at the literature on my website of two thousand articles to the bottom of the the page to look at the videos you'll see both of literature saying the same thing for different diseases and you'll see people who have been treated and people who had great results with that therapy\nAt you very much\nThank you for the call website is Dr Cao dot net and the officers five or six seven nine four zero four zero four okay let's go to Joe in Muncie Hi there how are you\nHi good how are you a doctor and a great advocate I was dying on I'm twenty seven year old I don't know how she motto I okay at a lot of my age level can knock 'em too high mhm landing at another block that can lack assure models that that put me on it oh okay they\nIn Seventy five of the day\nOkay I mean it's not an unusual disorder you know we have a lot of people that have this I think that it's caused by heavy metal exposure and you could see traditional medical research that says those individuals that have you know feelings in their teeth which are fifty percent mercury the silver feelings the amalgam of\n'em are much higher risk for auto immune thyroid disease and any other autoimmune disease as you can see articles on my website or two hundred and six articles they talk about heavy metals and how they cause auto immune disorders and other things you know can be missing breast cancer so that list of\nDisorders associate with heavy metals is very well\nSo what happens over time is that the fire is being damaged and the antibodies are making it hard for your body you start to be produced and reach the ... the receptors that's why they're giving you the for the only problem is where's the T. three you need to have T. three\nSo you should be taking a fire that T. three anti for because overwhelmingly when I see people that are only on the one fire way tea for\nAnd we test their full thyroid panel twelve different tests and that panel\nWe see it as a T. three is low so you need some T. three as well\nMhm okay and they also have it on the other thing is like a ... a ... well yeah and it came back on the ongoing half yet on how well let me around and cranberry falling on no\nHalfway allergic\nYeah yeah yeah\nThat that were really doesn't exist in the allergy you know vocabulary so\nHalfway doesn't make sense to me either your skin tested positive and you have\nEither a redness at the site or the area increased in size I'm half way is not really a medical term ever like halfway pregnant halfway allergic and it just doesn't exist so did they do a ... test on your forearm or your back\nHow is the algae test on my block\nWell blood test is a screening of only the blood is near the needle that gets sucked up in the two for three or four seconds\nTo show up and put it into the machine and tested so blood is not the most accurate test for allergy\nIt can show negative but you're still might be positive because antibodies might be elsewhere in your body floating around in that blood and of course you can't test all of your blood so blood should be only a screening and in many cases when people are negative\nOr they might be a class one which is a low number\nOf antibody existence and that you know blood too if we do a skin test they might be a two or three\nSo skin testing is more accurate not scratcher protest because they were false negatives with fat which means they do the scratcher ... on your arm\nAnd it's only on the surface of your skin and the antibodies you know I mean I'd buy into it there that's why we do a better test was the the gold standard in ... test we take a tiny needle and raise a little bump below the wheel of liquid in your skin\nWith the allergies and that's the gold standard so that would show if you're allergic gonna Mm okay so yeah\nSo that's the way we look at things in a much more accurate picture\nIs it possible to go off medication at all if\nI depends it's hard to say I mean I think we have to take a little closer look at the cause I Would look at a heavy metal ... blood and urine\nAnd then watch and see how you start to do I mean\nI Would probably start you off on the T. three T. for natural thyroid like armor nature's Freud or ... to get your body where you want to be ... you feel good at the same time using a technique to help to remove the heavy metals and then ... vitamins et cetera\nAnd then get a better picture of your allergies well affect\nYeah and so I feel I can give us a call at five six seven nine four zero four zero for and the website is W. W. W. dot D. R. C. A. L. dot net\nThat I'm not from here with\nMy own thing as your if your caller forward to seeing\nSo there's another perfect example of what I call science in every allergy textbook and every allergy or organization\nBlood is a screening test is not the final word scratcher protests does how false negatives but in ... testing is the most accurate does not have the false negatives so that's why we use something that is reproducible reliable\nAnd that gives us information that's important if you're like phone lines are open if you'd like to call and do so now what eight hundred eighty four eight WABC one eight hundred eighty four eight nine to two two and we'll catch up on the air\nLet's see what else we haven't been here a probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic associate diarrhea we've been talking about this for years\nI'm a good product and go a long way to help to stabilize you've got\nNow remember it's not a on and off switch or like a light switch you turn on the light comes on and off like because all sort of taken a probiotic that might help you got it might not because we don't know what else is going on with you that\nIf there's a bacteria or virus fungal organisms they may be affecting your absorption digest and that's why we do the Halliburton tests are we still test\nSo just taking a supplement doesn't mean that the outcome will occur\nFrom people that have a high blood pressure and they want to take a vitamin combination well if you're magnesium potassium in the red blood cell is low\nAnd you're not correcting that deficiency the supplements not going to work it may be a great supplement it'd be a good supplement but we have to correct the scientific fact of the underlying cause\nThat's why when people say what a vitamin ... takes a disorder vitamin shut take for that does work that way you have to see what your body's doing correct what you need individually your requirement and then watch to see things improve that's why we get such great results of the things we do because as always based upon your body [noise]\nPeople say what do you want me to do [laughter] they say\nIt's not what I watched you do it's what your buddies showing us you need so it's a little bit more complicated than just\nTaken a vitamin here doing a little this little bit of that and I can guarantee you that when patients you know see the blood test that we do and look at the testing we'd do their you know they're shocked you know they're surprised at how much you know you can learn about your body\nAnd how from that information and then we can then start to fix things so that's really how it works it's all about knowledge it's about the testing you know making recommendations retesting that's where we get results\nOkay phone lines robot if you'd like to ask a question you can do so right now one eight hundred days for eight WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two two and we can chat\nVitamin D and calcium of course are important now here's a great start talks about vitamin D and calcium supplementation decreasing the risk of diabetes\nOr this is from the division of endocrinology diabetes metabolism Tufts University medical center in Boston, Massachusetts a double blind placebo controlled style a trial was looking at adults that we're averaging fifty seven years\nSupplementation with vitamin D and calcium\nTwice a day for sixteen weeks showed it improves beta cells function and help to decrease blood sugar levels and help to decrease the hemoglobin agency\nOh well I Would like ... how ... like ... a valuable a car or a local ... overall for how a con better\nWell I mean you could have more of the good fats and all of a condo in such and some people increased their calories to help to maintain their their way\nOther people when they tend to have some car we might allow that but you have to have it with an oil\nLike say for example um you want to have melon and you have it with olive oil you know time restaurants have proceeded to all the time when people put olive oil on it so you're blunt and the uptake of the sugar when you do that\nYou could probably have a berries which alone glycemic index I just don't know how high publicity make you are I don't have the glucose tolerance tests in front of me\nThat you've done recently to see when your sugar drops and how much of crops so that's how we could create a diet it's perfect for you because we test you first look at your vitamins minerals hormones absorption they all of this\nAnd then put together the dive based upon that knowledge you know that's why we can get some good results\n[noise] mhm well what are called cooking up\nWell oil will keep your weight because it's got more calories than it I'm not saying you should have gallons of oil a day but at the Cato oil nuts et cetera and sometimes some people have things that are sugar based when you have oil with it it blocks the uptake of the sugar again I'm not giving you any direct recommendations because of having\nTo do your blood test yet but that's what I Would do to your blood tested a digestive tests you two buddies do\n... will allowing certain vitamin ... and ... you know why would make it worse still feel worse for sure mhm okay thank you Dr\nAll right thank you for the call let's go next to Lorraine in Pomona how are you\nGood anything ... back to ... thank you for taking my call you up to I Am calling and the gentleman that had called earlier with this big belly\nYes that he was talking about and I've been listening to what he ate for breakfast I don't eat\nThat for breakfast I make to organic eggs with spinach and and then I'll have some I don't have some avocado with maybe ... pie on address a little bit of olive oil on it\nAnd maybe that's not good for pilots like sugar right Ayesha I Love it and you're going to be allergic to something to you could be allergic to eggs and not knowing you know so that's how they had not only you know sugar and ... you could be allergic\nI'd had those test I had the tabloid they do test I had to talk I had gone to Dr ... and I had that comprehensive you know so I'm not supposed\nTo have to do a blood test for foods for allergy\nI you know what I'm thinking about it I'm thinking he did a blood test\nI don't get a blood test that has not taught the accurate\nTest for allergy blood is a screening you know when you're a kid and you used to be in a car with your family going on vacation and you look for those Volkswagen bugs we do that when I was a kid you know you're in the back of the car and you're looking around ... ... what I see one you know you account whatever color you want to\nTo pick out it's it's not a scientific thing just to take a little bit of blood and say well that's the entirety of what your blood is going to show\nSo if you're looking at a blood test and it shows zero for allergy when we've correlated that was skin to some people are class one request to test them so the more accurate test is not blood is not scratcher print but introducing will test that's a tiny little needle where we do that up in the skin of you're on\nOn your your shoulder and then we might do a second dose of the first ones negative just to make sure\nI'm asking now I ... I stay away from ... I don't have ... I don't have been out of ... came up the things I should avoid right so I mean I don't have any of that but now maybe the other ... I Do like ... and vegetables\nI hear a lot of sugar in the ... you don't have to be allergic to it to have bloating because organizations you got can start to go crazy ones the sugars out of there\nAnd again I've seen so many times you know I find myself saying the same comments because it's true for some people too much sugar causes the blood and it's like preventing\nYou know these organisms and you're done eastern such for other people it's a food allergy and it could be delayed food allergy you could have something to be fine and it starts to bother you in three days but you never question that food today so\nCaught avocados that photo vegetables at the front to right\nKnow avocados or great that's a great source of oil thing\nSo that's a good thing out correct OK okay what do you have for lunch I click on my own\nFor some make myself a soup like in like a land fulfill part of being so far have turned to fashion and Vanna vegetable\nI Can't eat lentils earnings are also high carbs so\nYeah it might be a potential again became allergic to listen to it being so when people come in with bloated stomach issues we do the ... test to see if they can still make their enzymes interested that can climb clothing if you don't make that we do the allergy testing through skin test\nWill start to cut the grains the sugars and the ... we keep up the lentils and the beans cars and also because can cause boating I mean everybody knows that means can give you guess so\nYou know we need to write CNN and tried to be healthy and you know and it's really [laughter] I mean I Am healthy I ate all the right I Try to eat all the healthiest up but that\nMay or may I ask faced upon you know your upbringing and what your family told you was good to eat and that's great but it's not take into account what your body\nChemically reacts against so it can either be a food allergy that you don't know about the delayed reaction could be um\n... sounds like you're having sugar in storage so we just have take out the things that are bothering you or your stomach will be fine and you have\nMore than enough to eat that kind of trust me I've done this so many times\nI hear myself saying the same sense is over and over again but it's true okay now you know in my head and it's like I'm I'm watching Groundhog Day in my head that the sugars and the truth energy and but it's true it's true okay I'm sure you can help you out certainly give us a call or take a look at the website\nYou'll see some cool stuff you know thank you for the call\nOkay\nWWW dot D.

C. during\nMy years as a rabbi privileged to meet many people people have all different face some no face one of the most special individuals' I've ever encountered is river in a are Bernard who's the founder in ... new leader of the Christian cultural center\nA witch presently has over forty thousand members that's forty thousand members I don't know how many members of our clergy can to make that claim but obviously he's doing something\nA very unique there to attract so many people and I think after you hear him speak today and those of us who for many times understand why he has such a large following good good evening Reverend Bernard\nAh good evening my friends always good to be with you always good to be with you or you know I\nTell people you and I speak I think at least three to four times\nA day sometimes daily of many more weekly but it's always I always learn from you and I think one of the things we all need to understand that you surround yourself with\nPeople or with great minds and you learn from them or because none of us has all the answers may together will find more answers um but it's it's important just run we teach our kids are when you choose friends give people\nA you know people who were of substance because that's a that's an important import a kind of connection so thank you thank you for all you've done over the years and continue to do\nI Want to know as many want to know what's the answer what is it you were doing that may be others could emulate or modified in some way or you know I just came back from Israel\nAnd talking with religious leaders and people are all things I don't get those ... through the doors so many of them are just not connecting with community until there's a crisis you know or some major celebration\nBut if you had to give some advice what would you suggest\nI think you gave the most important word we don't grow in isolation we grow in unity and uh uh this generation owe though\nSomewhat disconnected from community but connect it technologically is realizing that we are social being they're realizing solidarity of the human family and that the church\nHas been a you know so important so critical in fostering family principles and values that govern\nFamily how it is the foundation for society and the whole idea of community within a houses of worship and a community for freight where we are socialized\nEr into shared values respect dignity which are some of the things that we are really suffering from especially in our society\nAnd you know if you're not going to find it\nIf you don't find the community meaningful you live in this bubble so or an echo chamber um we need we need each other we need to communicate to cooperate or we need to lean\nOn one another for support a and you know you you just can't get it on line all the time\nExactly you can't and and you know the common good and the principal of the common good which we share as one of our values and you're going what about social ethics uh can only be improved gone\nAnd fulfill when we are in community if we are individuals\nAnd in a in a nice profit radical individual is pursuing our own good and not a common good society suffers community breaks down and unfortunately we began to these humanize the human person\nAnd you find as I've learned over the years that millennials will come forward and say you know I was on the wrong path\nI thought I could do it differently I looked at my friends and you know they were individualistic\nAnd then I recognize that was avoid a spiritual void or other voids but I I needed people in my life and it wasn't just sufficient to surround myself with the same for people or whatever I'm absolutely\nYeah yeah it's true I mean you know we we go back to the sixties and the baby boomers and that decade or many revolutions\nAre and we felt the need to change the system to challenge the establishment but interestingly enough the majority of us who challenge the system back in those days are now today working in the system to major change because we understand the importance of it\nI remember there was a congressman do you and I know and so when he first started in Congress he challenged the the seniority system it's unfair you know keeps us out he says\nAs I get older I realized what a great system that is [laughter] for it and it is to have those of us older making recommendations and putting us in charge in certain places 'cause we have some wisdom and\nYou know that's the definition of good judgment you get it by bad judgment the mistakes you made and you learn to improve on them and uh you know when when you're in community you have those exchanges and you learn what you've done wrong and when you could do better\nUm and in together a\nLittle bit we all contribute in some ways that's what community you know one ... is the total package\nWe need each other gets in the beginning of the program you talk about how much you benefited from your relationship with me but it's mutually beneficial I benefitted so many ways I in my relationship with you Ira sharpening I\nYou know the access of concern or sensitivity to the common good that sure sign rabbi of of a society in need of help\nBecause as as a sense of community erodes concern for the common good declined and an improper community concern you attribute to rival individual is\nSo if I'm attending a service a Christian cultural center and I'm Christian what is it that you do that seems to resonate with so many people 'cause I Know members of your of your congregation and some say I like the music I like the message\nAnd I'm sure all of those things contribute but this is this more than that I mean such is going to a concert it's not just going to a lecture um so what is it that happens in that context it at sea cc's you call it a B that reaches so many people\nWell you know it it it goes back to a study that was done by two hotter Harvard professors back in Nineteen Ninety eight and they were predict the future they said that we're moving from a products and services based economy to an experience based economy\nFueled by products and services and that which is true ah economically and society at large has also come into the church\nPeople charge by what they experience when they attend worship service when they are involved in any of the programming offered we see\nA house of worship and the community of faith as people are environment people and programs and when that comes together to give them a meaningful experience All right they'll keep coming back we believe in\nWhat we call dynamic off the dock see as opposed to static tradition\nSo we believe in maintaining the principles and values of the faith that are eternal but we deliver them we express that we create an environment that they can experience be experienced in a very practical way\nSo that applies to daily life but also which is what the millennials are looking for is for their faith\nTo be socially applicable ... they want their faith to give them a lens through which they can make sense of what's happening in the world around them spiritually morally or socially politically in every way\nYou mentioned to me a while ago that with millennials and I think is true of others as well give them something they value or Ken value and they'll come back a little like they're looking for valuable connections not just a connection\nI yeah and our values are what we stand for you know what what what we believe is most important in life were willing to pay the price for you know Gallup or did the Gallup Organization did a study on millennials in the workplace and one of the things that they found is that money\nHow much they get paid it's second to whether the job is giving them a sense of meaning and fulfillment\nVery very well and I don't feel any AC down by like it's like my parents are getting killed it's just wonderful I I'm very early on it\nFor a

B. C. lose portion of religion was brought\nTo you by calibrate hospital you know I Am Chaplin of empty and why do shop lifting and why and I had to get special permission to have this interview a it is a great honor to go to the ... and speak with the\nRate police commissioner of New York I'm referring to James O'Neill or who everybody\nReally admires because he never forgot\nThat he was a cop and you talked to police always these are cops cops and I think that's a great thing because sometimes when you rise to the top you forget where you were a that something is never escape from so let's go ... and speak with commissioner O'Neill hello commissioner and rabbi how are you\nAll about if you're asking is are the Irish say um [noise] you are a you're a special guy I I Know you don't you don't like to hear all these tributes but better to hear him now when you can hear some of the ladies latest stage\nOf life um [noise] there are a lot of changes have been implemented and one of the the changes that I witnessed is\nThe bridging the divide that existed for too long between communities and police um when I was growing up in Massachusetts we knew the police they always would come around talk to us and they were part of the extended family I think you have tried to bring back that spirit here in New York [noise]\nYeah I I grab I really have um and there's\nA lot of this has to do with ah my time as a a transit cop you know way back in Nineteen eighty three doing trained patrol by myself or made at night to four in the morning just talking to the people in New York and\nJust looking at them and and and they're and they're looking at at at me saying oh this guy's a it makes me feel safe and I think that's really validated my decision to become a cop and then when I became a precinct\nCommander and I did that for about six and a half years\nUh I think that really helped me\nUh when I became police commissioner 'cause I I Know\nA A N y pd is really good at identifying whether our crime issues and a host of other challenges that we have but there were so much better when we work with the community and it's got to be not just the precinct commander and not just the two community affairs cops and\nThey each and every one of them do a fantastic job but it's got to be everybody doing their job it's got to be the the the the men and women in fact the cars\nIt's got to be the anti crime units it's gotta be everybody's got to have that same spirit that same philosophy of uh of neighborhood policing that that was so much better when when we have a connection to the people were sworn to protect and serve\nSo how do you implement that I mean I Know for example for holidays and the Jewish where we are uh\nAlways grateful to you for bringing us together and talking about you know the important connection between the precinct or a and people can really make sure that they have the synagogue schedule and there'll be patrolling the area to make sure you're safe but on an everyday\nBasis how do you bring people closest ally understand each other more\nSo and that that was that that was a challenge and uh we did uh we did a couple of things to help us with that or we started small we started in Washington Heights and in what in the three three and a three for that out in Rockaway and a far Rockaway and one hundred and one on one\nAnd we receptor does precincts into into the natural neighborhoods that exist there\nAnd we put the same sector cops in those precincts and we created a position called the neighborhood coordination officer and there's two per sector\nAnd they attacked as the conduit between the community and the steady factors and a four times a year they have a public safety summits you hadn't CEOs run those meetings\nIn their sectors are we put that out on a social media you know we get anywhere from you know fifty two to one one sector up and afford to at four hundred people show up at the meeting and uh the connections you know ... what is it you know it's hard to hate up close tried them or we're all human beings\nThat and it it is a great relationship and it's a you know\nIf there's a couple of things that keep me up at night and the terrorism is one of them and the way we get past is the way we keep everybody faith if it is working with everybody\nYou know all of all New Yorkers and you know we have the foreign leave we have a program or with the police foundation helped us with and we have a New York city police officers all over the world and if anything happened is we get that information back in real time and we do our best with that information to make sure we're keeping everybody safe\nBefore you know we're we're all in this together before I let you go you've talked before going on the air above visit with your son to Gettysburg you're talking about the little ...\nYeah I actually my son went to a Gettysburg College so I've been down there a number of times and uh\nI went down a couple of weeks ago a I had a activity where I could actually have two days off in a row I went down with the two other guys are went on a overnight motorcycle trip and\nJust to to go down and and revisit the battlefield and see how fast that battlefield is and and and the danger that was faced by ah\nBy the soldiers down there and the courage to to to fight for what they believe then\nIt's really you know it's an inspiration to this is a this is how we where we are part of where we are where we are today you know could have been you know you could say good or bad or you know there's a lot of time off in the world right now but uh of the United states is it's more than a nation it's an idea and that that's what we need to keep fighting for\nNow you were riding a motorcycle my correct didn't have training wheels on it you're just you're no I was I've been I've been riding a motorcycle\nSince I was a she started riding their bikes when I was twelve so this is a you know one of my passion\nYeah I talked to on the bicycling\nYeah I talked to motorcycle riders on they say they love it to some feeling of independence when you there and uh you know I guess you have to you have to do it to really understand the pleasure of it\nYeah it's quite an experience and ah when you go with your friends that's I tease him all the time whenever I go on a motorcycle with trip with my friends I said it's a you know the best part about it is with your friends you you don't have to talk to him\n[laughter] that's that's what keeps a relationship to exactly yeah what what do we do but it was coming here to studio is a guy on a skateboard texting and he's on the sidewalk\nAnd you know you look at this behavior of some of the the bikers um and ... skate boarders and say my God even walking on the sidewalk can be dangerous\nYeah it's a you know people it's a ... I talk about this being a shared responsibility all the time you know people have to uh not just to look out for themselves they have to look out for everybody else and\nI see people with their heads down and not paying attention to what's going on and that's that's not good for for a couple of reasons so we need to pay attention to our surroundings just not just to keep ourselves safe from simple things but uh you know if you've got your head up and you're looking around and you see something that makes it makes you uncomfortable\nYou know or if you think there's something wrong I think you have a responsibility a to dial nine one one one or a flag down a cop so we can give us the chance to investigate it and that's how all the orcas can help keep us safe\nSo I began the program getting leasing that I needed permission to speak you ... a child in but the truth of the matter is\nUh you work closely with F. did well you wouldn't commission and I grow a good friends and it's inspiring to see that 'cause you know you hear all the stories are they really don't like each other they just you know put on that it's not true ah so thank you\nIt certainly isn't then is that is a a a great leader and find human being and I think what what changed this is a after detective Lou and re most were murdered back in two thousand at fourteen and the uh outpouring of support we received from the fire department will never be forgotten always be thankful for\nI think you are you're you're valued friends and a nice being on today and and just you know I don't know how how we can say thank you better but I always make it a point of going over police and see just thank you for your service thank you for keeping us safe and and\nAnd they all appreciate a rabbi yeah no and the big thing to to you of course police commissioner James O'Neill anytime rabbi take care Bye bye\nI chose the protests celebrating thirty five years of college and on the line on Seventy seven W.
