I was only New Jersey one foot so that's probably why I was I was running around the other officers\nYou know it's ... you know what's great about what I Would like to know I Would like to have these I Would like to have the before and after a while you're going to\nBe on our website definitely once they're finished I mean we like to you know we like to posted pictures of people being done you know several months out because the whole point really able to keep the weight off up so um and I feel that\nUm our DNA report you know I was just looking over I'm One of the patient's DNA reports um a couple of minutes ago right before we went on air and it's really amazing all this information that's in here\nUm you know we're talking about diet recommendations we're talking about eating behaviors we're talking about food reactions um we're also talking about nutrition and what works for you and what doesn't work for you such things that you know um do you have a genetic risk for decreased vitamin C. do you have a genetic risk for\nA decreased vitamin a and you know and during the training what kind of exercise should you be doing\n... you're not spinning your wheels asked him if you should be doing more aerobics or less of this and more of that this was going to give you that information until the late ... you\nKnow also talks about um how exercise actually how your blood pressure for example response to exercise how your cholesterol response to exercise ... loss of body fat how does your body respond to exercise you know not everybody who's going to go run\nThree to four miles every other day and going to lose weight or same way as somebody who for example will do high intensity interval training you know and wait on you know everybody's body reacts differently and\nAh you don't necessarily need to be spending two to three hours in the gym you actually probably don't ever need to spend that long in the gym\nSo this is really what the DNA tests is all about because it really gives you a road map on what you should be doing once you're through with the program I'm so valuable so cool does not change right it does not change do you how to bring you have forever so none of the changes that is so much information it's almost\nA you know ... enough to keep you busy for a couple of weeks just stopped trying to understand exactly how the information I'm really apply you and your body right exactly are they really\nReally it's really amazing and and uh you know that that gives the tools you know that's a personal I should ... one of the parts of the personalization that we do the supplements are also personal lives each individual based on a hair saliva a DNA testing blood work assessment buyer energetic scans that we use\nUh a woman that was a little older and\nI wanted to talk to you about Paula who came in ... the lady talked about six to nine years old Paul or Seventy five years old law so she came in on her first day she came in with a three inch file\nOf programs that she's done over the last thirty forty years it didn't work three\nInch file so I looked at it I thought it was her blood work and where I said oh my God 'cause people coming before work and and different health exams and this I\nSaw I saw it in my eyes bulged out on my head because I was like oh my God I'm going to have to post office but turns out she puts it on the table she was a referral from somebody who's done really well on the program and she said this is everything that I've done and the last twenty five to forty years Thirty years or whatever it was\nIt was a three inch filed everything she did she was none of these things have worked I'm\nOnly here because my friend did this and said that it works otherwise I wouldn't have been here\nSo I looked at it and go look and let me tell you as you said you know let rather than be going through everything that you've done in the past which has or want to explain the program to wire explain the personalization using hair saliva buyer energetic scams a blood work assessment a DNA assessment for going and so forth\nAnd let me explain it to you and then afterwards you told me anything you've done is they've been with us so we we can afford a few ... so I go through it sure looks I mean it goes everything like that absolutely not I've never heard of anything like that starts with exactly let's move forward\nSo low and behold you know we did the different scans that we do we did the ... the functional or assessment of the blood work\nWe take a look at it we give her some fireworks support with diversity adrenal support twenty eight pounds forty days\nI was a great that's really great ... I you know\nI said she's going to ... I said what do you do what you came in fire which came in last week's shirts or what are you doing with our three and trust with the shredded all of\nYeah like I mean I think it's also you know I think we tend to carry a ton of baggage with us we we really tend to go back I think people in general tend to they want to be positive but they tend to be on the negative side especially when they tried so many things and things don't work or you know I think that that's really generally where we're at and they think a lot of people telling people to throw up their old\nCoal I Do I I I think that is a really powerful a powerful tool once you're done um you know losing weight I I think you really need to get rid of the past I mean I'm fraud all your clothes when I did I and I gave them all the way I don't have one single thing from before um when I was a you know over\nThe years ago to try to do it but at what point out the last thirty seven pounds as you get rid of all\nI actually well because I started to try on my clothes probably about halfway through the program so halfway through the program was about twenty pounds down and I realized that I kept going to the forty a day which I did I Would be way down so I actually started to give them away\nUh throughout the program and of course you know once you start to empty out your closet you have to fill it with something and so that really is a very very important part of the forty days out of the time for I think so I may still having a good time you know I think I think it's really really important for the mental health\nTo get rid of what's old to get rid of what no longer fit and you know although we just taped um our first TV commercial which was so exciting and\nUm you know we asked a couple of our patients actually participate in it and screw thankfully they did keep at least\nOne piece of clothing that they have to have the fat pants\nOr um you know in the case of our patient Diana she kept like some of her dresses from before she look I'm rate ready to amazing little after she had a whole transformation she would um you know so\nShe uh they were able to bring in their stuff and really it was really fun shooting the commercial because you know these weren't models these weren't ...\nSo it was really exciting because we had to do like a bunch of takes because when you put someone who's not an actor in front of a camera\nYou know no matter how good their story is they start to go up above above but you know so but you know I've super proud to you know they they did really great it was really inspiring to listen to them we did some uh you know uh um\nSome aback stories almost because actually the gentleman that was doing and producing the commercial he didn't know or patients do he actually asked them to tell 'em him their stories right and it was really fun and cool to sit on the sidelines and watch\nAnd you know seeing these patients who were patients have hours you know I mean Diana or what you know last saw her wait a couple of years ago the other two gentlemen that were in the commercial was over a year ago also\nAnd um to listen to their stories and really what led them to our office for me was very interesting because I one of the gentleman I actually didn't even know because he was going to one of our remote locations are not New Jersey and so I never met him before and what an interesting story he's a\nActually happened to be a semi professional ballroom dancer so on and I said that now that he's retired uh you know he told his wife he wanted to take it back up because he feels so good well he lost close to a hundred\nI think a hundred and ten or something like that pounds um and he's like I you know there's all these things now that I remember I used to do and now I Want to go back and do them again because I have all the time on my hands um ... either you know these are really it was really an inspiring day it was really a great day but\nGoing back to actually I thought of I'm a female patient who just finished up she did um I don't know you might know this um eat her name is eat us I'm not sure if she did sixty days or she did a two rounds of forty days um\nI think she was at the sixty day mark and I'm she's down over fifty pounds she is on our website are hard to foreign actors on our website they are so I'm\nJust almost a ... it's a it's like a great ... percent over fifty pounds you know one of my kids I think it's fifty six now so it's really a these types of numbers are really staggering but what's really amazing for me is the fact\nUm you know you're losing fat and losing fat is the only thing that works long term I'm you know a lot of these other things out there you know everybody's like well the first week or two you lose all water anyway well that's not true no I\nAnd it's not healthy um and losing water is not going to give you any sort of long term and\nYou know a weight loss retention if you will on you have to lose the fat you have to hydrate the only way that you lose the fat is through the life of some bags the only way that that happens is when they fill up with water and they burst\nThat is the only way you lose fat I mean I don't really care what anybody else is saying out there but that is the only way that that fat goes down that is also by the way the only way that you will see herself shrinking and your clothes getting\nBetter yeah everybody loves to close getting burned all it's the best part of the whole thing I mean I Know I never\nI didn't get a chance to keep saying I keep I keep forgetting to talk about the six day people hold on there and we get back to whenever I keep talking about it so we did the men first they would do the sixty days or the female Laurie ah thirty eight pounds and sixty days\nPretty good run to a big number thirty eight pounds in six days to almost forty pounds for a woman that's absolutely tremendous talk about a different person that's
