party is now selling T shirts that say on them Supreme Injustice which I mean listen we sell T shirts here at the daily wire like we have a set of future they have things like that don't care about your feelings which feels like something you'd want to advertise\nAnd feels like a relatively eternal message I'm not sure why you would buy a shirt that says Supreme Injustice and then just be wearing it around like in two years then you weren't going to know what in the world that usually means answer of course there's no\nBut visit to take them that they cannot let this go and if we don't let this go we will win yeah so at the polls are showing up Jennifer wing or\nLike the New York times this disorder Tom drives me up and walk\nHow do I explain justice have no my daughter well here's what you say justice Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault back when he was Seventeen years old there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegation\nAnd we don't ruin anybody's life in this country based on just allegations without any corroborating evidence will get it in two senses but here's what she actually right before he entered politics President Trump was a fan of different\nSort of spectacle professional wrestling and pro wrestling with this long running soap opera like storylines about heroes and villains\nFaces in heels you don't win if letting your opponents climb onto the term buckle up onto the robes hurl yourself on the body of your defeated bell now declared the winner that was what Monday night's primetime swearing in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court felt like well is that for the fact\nThat he will actually sit on the Supreme Court and then decide cases it's just like WWE hey here's what she says with his wife and young daughters in the audience justice cabinet made all the correct conciliatory noises gone was red faced\nSerious men of late September but his claims about dark money and Clinton funded plots gone was the man who alternatively weapon roared\nAnd looked as if he was trying to pass a kidney stone of compressed rage you accused him of gang rape and if he had been robotic you'd have accused him of being robotic how do I know because you did two days before when he was on Martin I'm a gallon show and then and then here's what it said\nThat the gloating crusted over the weekend on Saturday once justice Cavanaugh is a sure thing Senator John Cornyn weeded out his ears for bread hash\nTag along with a picture of a glass of champagne and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell think the clowns you protest adjusted cabinet dissension and helped unify his party many uh but he says that this woman said for the record the clown the angry mob the violent protestors were winning who confronted elected officials in office halls and in elevators\nMany are survivors of sexual violence that same kind of Christine Blasey Ford testify change or their friends get the men in power to hear them and asked accordingly and as I said that has nothing to do with anything I Believe your story of sexual assault that does not mean that I have\nTo believe every story of sexual assault but here's the beat me to the beach what am I supposed to tell my daughters about all of this of course I already know I've been talking about it for years be aware of your surroundings that makes sure someone knows where you are and when to expect you back don't drink too much don't put your breakdown don't walk around or by the same route\nDon't they actually do walk alone and it was\nI asked you out and you're not interested don't hurt his feelings and don't laugh at him\nBecause of humiliated man is an angry man and sometimes angry men or women and so some of that I think is good advice\nFor anyone like walking alone in that are in the climate area is dumb not drinking too much makes sense right don't drink too much that stupid I've never heard this thing that it was I asked you out that you have to not hurt his feelings like that that's a new one I haven't heard that one because frankly I Can't\nThink of it do that I Know who hasn't asked a woman out and has feelings hurt I Can't think of a single do that this is it that this has not happened do and Ninety nine percent of you do go on to ... people\nAnd that that's not actually a thing like here's what she said she said our girls were willing to police their clothes their words their drinking their behavior their choices because they've been watching what they'd seen is that\nIf you get hurt it's probably your fault not a single person said that if you tell probably no one will believe not a single person said that and even if people do probably nothing will happen not a single person says that either the conflation\nOf I'm Upset about justice cabinet with America is just stomach Lee unjust against women is just it's it's absurd and its ally and I'm speaking as a guy with my own daughter\nWith three older sisters it's it it's silliness but again the motivating factor for a lot of left right now is rage and they don't understand that rage there's gonna be a delayed it back but the rage will blow back on the anger is a short term high and it's a long term low we'll be back in the matter with all the\nAnd I would like to hear from you what eight seven seven three one three eight one one as I lay out this remarkable attempt to\nBastard dies the American language and tell us that the mob is not the mob and this is a full court press from the Washington Post and CNN to different host yesterday\nWent out of their way to try to chastise people for using the term mob it with referring to what can only be described as a mob as I laid out for you and explain exactly how we got here from there and why the left is doing this why they're trying to stop us from calling these thugs of the mob that they are I Want to hear from you\nAt eight seven seven three one three eight one one what are you now ready to do\nTo keep the mob from taking power because make no mistake this is all about political power\nWe heard from Hillary Clinton yesterday in her interview with Chris you and I'm a poor where she said we can only regain stability if the Democrats win the house and the Senate she's basically saying no justice no peace no victory in November no peace nice little town you got there\nBe a shame if anything happened to it you better vote for the Democrats or we're going to burn this thing down\nSo what are you willing to do to stop\nThe mob from taking power eight seven seven three one three I Want one because we have an incredibly important election coming up in twenty seven days\nFor weeks from today for weeks from right now this moment when you tune in to hear the great one mark within on the market within show he will be discussing whether we are about to embark upon two years of a Democrat controlled house of representatives which will inevitably mean\nInvestigations impeachment of not just President Trump probably justice Kavanaugh\nOr if a mark within might be talking about the remarkable historic victory of the Republican Party in maintaining majorities in the house and the Senate\nWhich story what we hear for weeks from tonight\nIt really depends on you and it depends on what you were willing to do because right now I have seen Republican voters\nIn my town of Washington DC and yes there are Republicans in Washington and then the greater Washington area but all across this country I assume Republicans motivated an energized and ready to walk across broken glass to get to the ballot box and that's important but it's not everything\nThe only way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen is because people not just voted but they told their friends to vote they told their family members to vote they made sure that they became part of the message and they said we can't let her when\nWe can't let her pick Supreme Court justices we can't let her be the commander in chief look at who she is look at what she thinks of us look at her history\nThat's what happened two years ago\nThis month that's how you win elections when you're up against the mainstream media when you're up against Hollywood when you're up against television and music and the universities and the news media\nThat's how you when you have to tell your friends and your family we can't let this happen so are you ready now are you ready because they just showed you over the weekend over the past two weeks how they're going to govern\nThe Democrats want all of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nThey want to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years what are you willing to do to stop at\nAge seven seven three eight one\nThree eight one one it started yesterday on CNN well actually forgive me it started\nEarly in the morning yesterday in the Washington Post these things happen and they're all coordinated have you noticed that\nThe Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as the mob\nTalking about how this is a dog whistle how the mob isn't really a mob\nAnd then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast is never Trump\nCan ... the republic I was about ... Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican who used to read the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican you switch daily covered the Daily Beast\nAnd but he's a good guy and I know that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine him friend of mine also an never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the cabin on hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left\nThe things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and hopping over the freeway barricades the get him to the hotel where he was having a fundraiser you remember the mobs on the campuses of UC Berkeley and other places across this country\nWhen Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered bench Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involved marshmallows in smaller ers\nAre\nIn the moral words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob are going to use the word ... totally a mock it is without\nA doubt there's no other word is not going to put up a lot of what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that delightful she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often deliver you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I'm Tucker Carlson Shannon bringing a lot a Stewart Bernie and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word rights you jump right on it and then she had her red joined her she got her one rejoined her\nWell we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if ... had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mall which was a mob or the antifa Bob which was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\nA but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left or my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these ads mostly peaceful\nIn the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests abducted at the end the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful that was mostly peaceful mob\nIn Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken that the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nWhat we saw chasing right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or is that a lot I think he is a ...\nYeah and if there was a party or as we call it um out for sure come on let's fix area\nYeah so that's married after and ham jumping in there

branch have nothing to do with judges were talking about people in the state department people at the Pentagon that require confirmation by the United States Senate that are still sitting and still languishing without any action from the Senate\nMuch of it is because of the arcane rules of the Senate which as we know Mitch McConnell can change right now today\nAnd he has not and this is the resistance these are the Democrats Chuck Schumer he says he's said going into this administration that he was going to make every single appointment a fight\nTo the death\nAnd and they would demand debate they would demand the time needed for you I think it's something like ... every single nominee that requires Senate confirmation or if they want to if they want to hold up the works they can put all of these roadblocks in\nThat end up being like Seventy hours of debate for each one and of course the ... in the past they haven't done that they'd been deferential and they've said listen every president deserves the right and opportunity and leeway to put people in place that he has put in place and and selected to be put in place\nThat's called ... that deferential lacked it's called respect for our American government it's called a ... a fundamental understanding that the executive branch of the United states federal government must be failed\nSo that it can function but the Democrats haven't allowed that to happen\nOr let me read this or much of this editorial for you you understand what we're talking about anyone seeking a mid career sabbatical should seek a presidential nomination to a position\nThat requires Senate confirmation GOP majority leader Mitch McConnell is teeing up more votes this week and the GOP needs to move fast because the glacial pace of staffing the government will slow to near zero if Democrats retake the Senate it's it's pretty close to zero now guys\nMr McConnell his folks cloture on three nominees including two assistant attorney general who have been in a rubber room for more than a year to assistance attorneys general have been waiting for their floor vote for nearly a year\nI think about that you want to know why the Justice Department has trouble functioning and doing things why they're spread a little ...\nWe can't we can't run a government this way\nAnd the Democrats are suppose they're supposed to be all about running the government they love the government why are they holding up this president and his nominations just fill basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have one\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty and saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do President Trump nominated\nJeffrey bastard Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto\nErica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate even if no senator as opposed to understand this\nBut Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey buster clerk to run the environment and natural resources division of the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees the Trump has put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the best with you and I would love that by the way back when I was a great guy he was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for\nOver a year we had no one bastard or Germany and once he got there boy he is he is with that continent into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nIn Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry is suddenly doing business with the terrorists mullahs if Iran\nBecause they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin they finally get rid of Grinnell as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what\nAmerica wanted we had no idea that's what Trump wanted well yeah it's because they didn't have as an Basset are there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed closer this is a Senate rule that can be changed in should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate not sick about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now that are languishing\nFor each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\n\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours of course that and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want to slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nGoing back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first two years ... wells\n\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\n\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirm more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just say screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nInstead he is now saying hey it's a nice mid term election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\nHey Joe mansion I Know it's it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from DC but it'd be a real shame if I force you to sit here for all these cloture votes in the next four weeks\nAt quarter McCaskill hey you're not looking good in the polls there in Missouri I bet you like to go there and press the flesh and hand out some walking around money to the voters in St Louis not going to be able to do it if you're forced here to vote on all these nominees so McConnell's playing hardball now\nAnd he said you guys want to go back we got to make a deal on these things\n\nAre let's hope Republicans extract the high price for that privilege some one day I hear it is seared as I was looking for the number earlier I was right outside of was close to two hundred\nOne hundred and Ninety eight nominations are backed up right now awaiting confirmation there's no wonder can you about this is the defense department we're talking about this is the Pentagon there are positions in the Pentagon right now\nThat have been left unfilled nearly two years into this president's administration key positions at the Pentagon that involve national security that involve the functioning of our military\nAnd the Democrats don't care\nOne hundred and Ninety nominations backup awaiting confirmation according to the partnership for public service tracking the nominations range from State Department under secretary the Labor Department spots Charles Stimson was nominated in June twenty Seventeen to be general counsel of the navy\n... pausing for a moment I Know ... he's a great guy I haven't really talked to him about this we trade attacks now and again I just say how you doing how you do and you still don't have a vote
