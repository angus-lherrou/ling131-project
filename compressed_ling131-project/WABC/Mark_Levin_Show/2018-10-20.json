[noise]\n\n[noise]\nSeventy seven so badly [noise]\nIs real estate today [noise] location\nWe are back again now with our special show retiring wealthy exploring\nYour options as you approach the day\nYou leave the office behind for good as we've discussed on today's show real estate might be able to play a significant role in your retirement and even though that can happen in different ways the goal is this thing\nAnd that is to create passive income a revenue stream that you can count on in your retirement\nSo let's wrap up this hour of the show by looking at some of the way he's real estate can help make that happen but before we do remember you should always talk with your financial planner and your account before you make any financial move and that's especially important if you're talking about the retirement strategy\nOf course one way many people generate extra income and their retirement years is to buy a residential property and then rent it out\nThat can be a great strategy but to make it truly lucrative direct would have to be over and above the mortgage the taxes the insurance the maintenance and the condo or age away fees if there are any\nAnd of course you also have to consider potential vacancies\nThere's no guarantee you'll find a renter for the property but in most cases residential real estate is a good investment that could generate a nice additional income stream for your retirement talk to your real chore about the opportunities for getting started in investing\nAnother option of course is to invest in real estate investment trust\nThere are a lot less complicated you don't have to worry about qualifying for a mortgage and there's no finding a tenant collecting rent we're dealing with vacancies real estate investment trust work just like the stock market you invest in a company that owns lots of real estate\nAnd so in effect you are a real estate investor but you're not a landlord\nAgain talk to your accountant and financial planner about which real estate investment trust might produce the tax returns you hope to get in retirement\nAnd there's one more way that real estate can help you generate income and your retirement years and that is seller held financing in this scenario you have an investment property or your primary residence and then when you decided to sell let you hold the mortgage\nIt's perfectly legal and it happens all the time\nThe way it works is you set the term you set the rate and you make it a condition of sale that you hold the note\nSo if someone buys your property instead of getting all the money all at once which by the way is taxable income you just get the down payment\nAnd then every month you get a check for the mortgage it can be very lucrative way to structure your finances and you don't have to worry about finding a tenant you don't have to worry about condo fees are ... and you don't have to worry about vacancies utilities are taxes\nBecause you've sold the place but you still get the mortgage payments since you are the bank\nSo again there are plenty of ways real estate can help you have a comfortable retirement talk to your real ... about any strategies you might be interested in\nMaking helped start the process and again talk to your financial planner about which ones might be the best fit for you because real estate is a big part of many people's retirement portfolios and it might be able to help you achieve your goals are retiring wealthy [noise]\nIf you'd like to hear more realistic today special show retiring wealthy either state

non professionals let's put it this way that are doing these procedures and the buyer must be where but let's talk about the CEO to leisure so\nThey came into the world the plastic surgery in the early Nineteen nineties and what we found was that when we remove the upper layer of skin\nAnd we actually vaporize the upper layers of skin we created a wound and you say well you know Dr Perry why would you want to create a wound the reason we do and many of you have heard this before\nThe body understands very few things with cosmetic surgery but it's certainly understands\nThat if you have a wounded has to heal and the way we feel ones is the same that animals he'll ones that is mammals because reptiles heal them at a different way but we uh we know that mammals all mammals he'll one's the same way and that is by shrinking of wound\nAnd generating college and so if we create a wound we shrink it to heal it and\nThose of you who are aging or over fifty know that you've got some extra skin you've got extra skin and your neck you've got extra skin in your face and against the sagging hanging you say well if you could just remove the skin and of course we do surgically we do with a facelift Rhode Island left or something like that\nBut we can also shrink the skin\nWith by creating wound so deep chemical peel grades one\nBut a laser is a far more accurate way of creating that wound and creating a good result to get rid of wrinkles and so we've vaporize the skin and it sounds so harsh doesn't it but I'm not selling a procedure here I'm trying to explain exactly what happens in a laser procedure\nWe're creating alone were allowing you to heal the one you heal that by shrinking the skin that's a good thing if you've got too much skin if you've got wrinkles it's moves the wrinkles and\nYou feel it by generating new college and and that's a good thing because as a as you know\nYour college and since most of you know because you look at your arm right if you're Seventy years old you can just about see through the skin so you know that in your thirty year old daughter or granddaughter you can see through the skin\nSo the skin things as we get older college and then as we get older and by laser ring or healing or doing certain other procedures\nWe can actually thicken the colleges and picking the skin so those are two good things but the problem with the laser and I did many many many carbon dioxide lasers between Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand five that was the real era\nOf what we call a blade of laser ring and that means we remove the scan\nGive you a little bit of a wound and you go home and stay well hidden although this is a great time of year to do this by the way because we're coming up the Halloween so uh you come to the door after a laser while they'll think you have the best costume on earth [laughter] because you really look frightening after a laser procedure\nA but but it's pretty intolerable and most people do think that a true laser procedure is very intolerable that means you've got about a week to ten days without skin and you have to wash yourself maybe three four five times a day and apply\nA moisturizers like ... or something like that and then eventually the skin heels and you look in the Mary and say wow this is pretty profound the wrinkles are so much better so much better after this laser procedure how about your skin is read for a few weeks sometimes even a few months\nBut quite honestly there is nothing like a full face laser for getting rid of rankles because I've had patients come back twenty\nYears later no kidding\nAnd the wrinkles are still very significantly improved better than Twenty years ago and I've had one particular patient that\nI see her daughter all the time and she comes in she says my mother says still she says a low and she is uh the youngest looking person in her senior citizens community because you did that laser on her twenty something years ago\nBut you know what if you have a laser it really is quite a quite a recovery and most people who have had a laser most but not all\nUh say you know it's good but I really don't want to go through that again you have anything less invasive so here we are in two thousand Eighteen we have what is called the ... now some of these ... have heard about the ... that's just a brand of this particular laser\nBut a fraction aged laser is much more gentle it's very effective at getting rid of wrinkles and we're to talk a little bit more about that\nAt six thirty so we are going to do an interview coming up and they were going to talk all about the fraction aided laser the CEO to laser and the areas we treat because it's not just the face some treaty hands I'm treating the upper neck area now with this laser and it's quite effective and less injurious to you a much easier\nRecovery I Dr Arthur Perry this is what's your ankle\nEight hundred aid for eight nine to two to eight hundred eight for a WABC stay

industry\nHim why be radio dot com to listen to past interviews mind your Sunday I Am Seventy seven so\nHe was\nAnd what is your ankle I'm Dr Arthur Perry board certified plastic surgeon hosted the show so if you have a question about cosmetic surgery or skin care or dermatology give me a call eight hundred eight for eight nine to two to\nEight hundred eight for eight WABC will live in New York this evening\nA last week we broadcasted or actually it was a rerun last week two weeks ago we were in LA we all live tonight so give me a call ... eight hundred eight for eight WABC you'll walk away with a bottle of nighttime and your walk away with a lot of good information\nAll right so we're gonna talk a little bit more about the carbon dioxide laser and the ... or in a minute but first\nI Want to talk about Plex or germ you're not been talking about this on this show for the last few months and the response has been really very good and I want to thank you and a lot of my patients have come in and said they have started using the plaques of germ and they'd love to be a a ... on a commercial at you know they tell me the stories that until\nWe really have to record some of these things because ... is really quite astounding what is ... no it's not skin care and we want to divide\nHow the world the skin care and cosmetics make up into two different or\nA portions here and what you do for your skin could be to repair it that's skin care but you might also put makeup on what types of Germans more in the makeup lines of what actually is it\nIs a product that are my good friend John Green ... came up with and what it is it's it's like a silicon material you put it on your face under your eyelids your lower I Lived for instance or any area that's wrinkled\nAnd it kind of drives the technical term is it's curing over the course of several minutes you probably have seen these commercials on TV they're quite astounding they really are amazing because the wrinkles just disappear\nSo I called up John true story and I said I Need to try this on my wife\nI don't know you know is this real is it not real so John sent me some of the uh the flex a germ from my wife she tried it and the results were quite astounding and with my patients the same way you know again I say it's not skin care because\nWhen you put it on your wrinkles go away if you wash it off the wrinkles are back so it is a temporary fix\nBut boy that comes in handy doesn't it if you're going on television this evening yes it's important if you're going on\nUh CNN or Fox News about how many of you are really doing that but you might be going to restaurants or the theater and you want to look as good as possible and you know I provide you with what I can do with cosmetic surgery and skin care and Botox and things like that\nBut you might need something like ... it really is quite amazing so if you are interested in this product John has given me an eight hundred number you'll get fifty percent off the normal retail price so it's eight hundred write this down eight hundred nine to five\nNine nine six three you've got a call that number to get the discount you just can't call their regular number on TV and say you heard about it on Dr Perry show you have to call this number it's all coated so eight hundred nine to five\nNine nine six three you'll get up to fifty percent off the normal retail price and to tell them that you heard about it on Dr Perry's what's your wrinkles show it is a really good product it's safe\nUnlike there's another class of things that get rid of wrinkles right away you heard me talk about it on the show I call those the swell ers they cause inflammation in your skin and I don't like those because inflammation is not good in the long run\nJohn's product flex a germ does not cause inflammation it's a great products so give them a call eight hundred nine to five\nNine nine six three All right so many of you have had\nThe laser procedure a laser procedure in the past and you know that the recovery is quite intense so that was one of the problems with the carbon dioxide lasers so it kind of a a went full force as an a blade of laser that means that remove the skin between Nineteen Ninety five and two thousand five\nLater in that decade what's called the fractional laser came out and they found that\nInstead of just removing the upper layer of skin with a laser and letting it he'll we can actually drill small little holes in the skin it sounds terrible doesn't it you know all these things are think about what we do with surgery and Botox and things like that\nYou know we have to go through these things to look better but but this is really quite a quite easy to go through so the laser instead of removing the entire ah upper layer of skin will ... little holes in the skin and leave a lot of skin intact\nOne that makes it much more comfortable and to the recovery as much faster and we found that if we do in this matter but to a few different procedures so I'll do two or three of these fraction aided lasers\nWe can get you to pretty close to what we had before with the with the a blade of laser that really bad one that I taught told you about\nUh we can get you those kind of results almost as good and in many cases as good without going through all of that recovery so it's called the fraction aided laser\nAnd the way I Do it is that we don't need to numb you up you know in the old the that that laser that see a blade of laser had to bring into the operating room give you some ... ... or sometimes even general anesthesia and numb you up and do laser what we don't do that anymore we use ... cream\nEmily is like a lie to ... that goes on your skin and uh we put it on for about it\nDon't tell them you got it at a discount right so free night\nTwo thousand Eighteen All right I'm Dr Arthur Perry and you know one of the procedures that I Do a lot of is the face left I Love doing faceless because it's such a transformative procedure and it it really does change people's lives\nWhen they come in when you come in and whether you're forty five or fifty five or sixty five or even Seventy five and you have ... and ... and ... and you look at yourself in the mirror and you've got you know this big neck can you tell me well you're beginning to look like your mother you love your mother but\nYou know you don't want to look like or you don't because that's the memory of your mother and you know look\nI said that on the Oprah show I told this story before and that people didn't quite understand what I meant but if you if you look in the mirror and you see that you know exactly what I'm Talking about so we do a lot of faceless than I Do I'm doing a several this week I Do them every week for the most part they're wonderful procedures\nAnd uh I Do what's called the short Scarface left now and that that means I don't make a decision in the hair line I make a decision in front of the year and then just a little incision behind the ear and I do what's called the two layered facelift\nAnd or would that two layer facelift uh I lift the ... and a separate layer and then I make an incision under the chin and I approached the bands of the neck I remove fat and others fat on top of the muscle those muscle bands and and in many people there's that underneath those muscle bands and that has to be addressed\nSo I Do that's called the ... by the way in case you really want to know what that is so I Do that operation the tightened up ... muscle that the fans of the neck or remove the fat of the neck and we lift the skin and voila\nA you look so much better it's about a four hour procedure I really is there's art work in a facelift and I do more in a facelift than I did when I was a resident uh and so it's a more complete procedure in a more aggressive procedure a but one that should hold up for many years\nSo the question is are faceless safe and the answer is yes as long as you are healthy and what does that mean\nIf you have high blood pressure it's got to be under control for a faceless because one of the complications of face lifting surgery is bleeding during of course that happens in every surgical procedure and a trained board certified plastic surgeon controls that but it's bleeding afterwards\nThat evening or the next day or a few days later that could be trouble could cause problems that could cause us to have to go back to the operating room\nSo um you know scientists plastic surgeons basic science researchers have looked at who might be more likely to\nGet bleeding and and by the way it's not common uh with faceless there's a there was a very good study that was just published in the in the aesthetic surgery journal and they looked at many many other studies ah so that's one that that doesn't just look at a group of people they look at a group of studies\nAnd and the complication rate overall with faceless is about one point eight percent say they two percent or so\nAnd while no one wants to have a complication there are things that can happen unfortunately so what are the things we'll bleeding it's about one point one percent in the overall in these studies and they looked at something like eleven thousand patients so you say one in a hundred but who are the people that could lead\nThose are people that have high blood pressure for the most part that's a real big risk factor for bleeding men also have a much higher chance of bleeding than women for some reason I think there's more of a blood supply to the face because of the uh uh uh the blood has to supply the hair follicles\nThere's more what we called metabolic activity in the face of a man that a woman\nSo ah but so certainly if you've got high blood pressure it needs to be well controlled\nNot only be for surgery but in the operating room and afterwards that's the single most important determinant\nOf whether or not or you're going to have a leading complication after surgery and also if you take aspirin aspirin users are\nCertainly we asked our patients to not use aspirin for a minimum of one week prior to surgery very very important ah because certainly if people forget that if they take aspirin much more likely and people who take aspirin and have high blood pressure that ... blood pressure that is not well controlled well\nThose are people that are really at high risk for a bleeding let's say one phone call Patty what can I Do for your what is your wrinkle\nAre you there Patty\nYeah I got to carry a have a quick question about the way through that you were talking about before absolutely if it okay to perform uh that type of treatment on ... very close to a person I\nGood question by the way Patty\nSo here's what we do you know the laser is a very powerful instrument\nA and you know I shutter when I when I hear about people who are not well trained or sometimes non physicians using the laser it's a very powerful instrument in fact this laser was developed to take paint off boats believe it or not it strips rough it off the boat\nSo yeah it's it's very powerful when I work around the eyes\nWere on the face it all we have steel goggles but when we work around the eyes I use steel contact lenses and so uh the way we do this it sounds terrible right you put the steel contact lens if we put a drop of anesthetic just like the optometrist are off the mall just uses\nAnd then I put a contact lens and it's just like your normal contact lens but it's bigger and only Superman can see through it because it's made out of steel and it and it totally protects your right\nTo do a laser without that around the I without that steel contact lens is extremely dangerous because yes Patty there have been not with me thank God but there have been puncture as of the eyeball from the laser in fact uh I was on the Marshall Kramer interviewed me oh it was a long time ago already was in the nineties\nOr maybe early to thousands when we talk all about the complications of lasers\nBecause as when the laser was a new procedure in the nineties\nA lot of people did not understand the limitations what it could do and how dangerous it was\nA and so there were more complications are always are in the beginning of a procedure but the laser right now is a a a much what we call a mature procedure it sounds high tech and brand new\nBut we've been using it for twenty something years in plastic surgery and it is still quite good so when I Do the ... and it's very affected by the way Patty for ...\nAh we will use that Emily cream because we can't chill that close to the I either so it has to be your care has to be individualize that show that I was talking about before that really cool to scan and\nDecreases discomfort we can't do that around the eyes because it could injure your eyes just the chili so we do use the AMA cream and will do usually one two or even three passes of the laser over that\nYeah and it's quite remarkable the people in the operating room love to do the laser because we actually see the skin tightening right before our eyes so it's quite traumatic the effect\nOh thank you very much it sounds interesting\nIt is interesting it's a very effective tool and just like a you know a night for scissors it's a tool and plan or a liposuction Kenya led to it as a tool and yes it can be a procedure but it can also be just part of another procedure so sometimes we'll use the laser\nAs an adjunct to ah to surgery but I like to use it where it's unique and uh um and better than the other techniques so certainly with wrinkles it fits the bill\nThank you have to say thank you very much\nPatty good to hear from you thank you so much for the phone call I'm Dr Arthur Perry this is what's your wrinkles right here on WABC you know I I promised\nI promised a Bobby Bobby found that I Would mention her again tonight she's a realtor in Holland falls New York you know we're hiring falls is it's

I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit\nAnd ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet and only considered super feed the green tea human human spiritual why did you want to combine to read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect do you make each other worst you call in a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all in\nSeparate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derives so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines and research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using for thousands of years ... ... what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity\nIn whole blood get assigned to recap some of these headlines of chill me while you're such a green tea advocate\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume that don't actually\nWind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which are protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body\nFrom premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in the right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the\nRight antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue to lie on\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to fire on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do\nBut it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nRight let's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on Ulysses by the way these three ingredients are all found\nIn the new green tea combo formula would be offering free brought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human which is spelled C.
