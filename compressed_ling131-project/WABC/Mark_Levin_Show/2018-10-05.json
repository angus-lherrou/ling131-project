I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nThey absolutely are held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do the right guy but I Am one hundred percent certain\nIt was Brett Kavanaugh machine not trying to effectively ruin that man's life his family's life how evil do you have to be to do that\nSo I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did\nAnd it's important once again and we don't just wiped off because break out I was going to make it through this thing and ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored because there will be others we\nEnded up a thorn in the biggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know know Chuck Schumer's credibility or the Chicago Cubs season and I try and rub it in but I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just\nWhy you know not and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are we're on ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes in right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise\nThen we all need to acknowledge what happened here and who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out the made accountable for who and what they are now\nHoldings as we're just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way it really has been that kind of a wake as that\nThat kind of a couple of weeks to kind of three months I mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas and and understand what Kavanaugh's been through an emotionally doesn't know it was kind of feel like we were through another election here this whole cabinet thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... ah yourself for the friends I don't want to show my home station W.

because I Know\nA little bit of a a generational thing here I mean we're talking there are probably like Thirteen Years old but uh yeah flea market Montgomery you know it's mini mall living rooms bedrooms dine that's oh yeah you know you can find the market the saddest thing about flea market Montgomery\nIs that it it went down during the recession was that was maybe one of the saddest moments during the entire great recession anyway\nAre now in this great economy we can have new flea market Montgomery isn't there'll be a there'll be bigger there'll be beautiful or they will have doors and the in the wall I just\nUh by the way I Am Brian mug for the great one more to live in and uh get to some of your calls here and just mom and by the way the the phone lines are not to be confused with the uh the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation line which also has been known to have\nThe exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations\nOn the Marco then show just to go straight to the FBI boys you\nKnow I'm right before the break mentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career is the single most common question I have a receipt and\nThe easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone is to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere and that's the problem most people and this is true conservative too by the way it's not like this is\nUnique to liberals there are a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life you know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm Gallup that start to finish everything that's happened over the past\nThree months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it in other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you did it all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy\nSo if you want to be persuasive the first thing find the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility one of the biggest mistakes that people make just by liking it because once you\nGive up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you for that reason operate\nWith facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information they're just gonna view you as someone who is highly political trying to can communicate\nOr your your emotion rather than principal\nA because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable or is that they are analytical and that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way this surprises a lot of people\nBut I find that common link the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy a lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are\nClosing in on being illegal to drink the youngest one's my oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now and\nI have not blame them right along because when was it that

we're gonna have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately\nAround that period of time but at this point given the Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting confirmed Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe mansion Democrat West Virginia\nWho is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean it's a ... a seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe I after the election of but he is a he said that he is also\nAn board so it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact something that's interesting that developed out of Alaska Lisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no you did not want to end debate and again if debate did not\nEnd today basically Kevin I Would have been dead now than it right there are the procedural vote today\nAbsolutely critical to with her voting no uh you know she has come under heat from her constituents on the right and what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context\nIs the way they've been gone about not screaming not protesting\nNot people they're chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks that had been to lighten up her office or with phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski\nOr to have a ... year the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be kind of the final say if you end up having\nBasically this split court and you had significant decisions don't impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that\nWould stand for all Africans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering when I was taking a look at the most likely outcome here are you looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today\nNow something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positives that can be gained from all this how many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks have known many\nI I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know but they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus\nBut did you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were we learn that right I mean it's one small detail but for many folks\nBecause we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and have it on to check your or a ... that may on what he has been through and and having a backbone\nOf steel and see this thing through holy cow incredible person\nDefinitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nMetal ultimately what I think Brett Kavanaugh's role is to vote one I think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in paying attention second thing is\nI think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effect of president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids to somebody that seems to have all the right for priorities in the right places is the right wing doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many votes necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that other folks have learned about how the Senate actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how\nDelivered if the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until approximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYou know there are a lot of things about our government we complain about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by but they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moment\nAnd we can look back on and this could be an opportunity for generations to learn what they never would have learned and have an opportunity and the time of adversity

Bush in the wake of nine eleven so it took the great depression nine eleven and\nThe botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats the average outcome in a midterm cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats and Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate map\nFavorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was like to be a no vote\nAbout ten points about ten points with the what the difference in her raise North Dakota and she was already in danger there\nClaire McCaskill of Missouri voted no she already was trailing slightly in the polls\nIncluding do end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states and you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted yes\nJoe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on back of this again when I've been taking a look at for ... how much this boat meant and those particular states an average\nOf about ten points gay or nay because those are pro Trump broke having all states so the Senate almost certainly going to stay but still the house you take a walk in if you check any of the polls you check the sites you take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans\nLooks like Republicans are facing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which will be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening\nThey don't see it happening they don't see it happening my question is and this is what I'm working on because again I base everything off of information are we at\nAn inflection point in American history\nIs this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this cabinet situation is that it now I guess to what we went through in any of those other examples not the great depression\nNot\nAfter nine eleven but if you're looking for a ... a good point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy\nWhat's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight and you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton but then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they've made him the issue right\nWe've had the ... investigation we've had\nTo get Trump effort since before he even took office that\nWould certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house\nI could be an allergist you throw cabin on the mix maybe that is too so this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance\nThat Republicans really might gang in Congress this year\nIs this that moment in time than inflection point in American history where things are different\nHistorically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year but there is an eight percent chance that they don't for reason are we in that window will continue that conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud in for the great one\nMonth over him on Seventy seven W.

leave the right and many of them [noise]\nThe ah approaching\nLack of enthusiasm in her voice pull you\nSusan Collins had her finest moment in fact\nAnd I'm Still shocked by it be fined this moment I think any United States Senate or is that\nAt least that I have witnessed still almost beyond belief or if you did not catch Susan Collins her speech earlier today it is definitely a must listen and watch so I take it in for sure\nShe really ended up a lame to down\nAnd uh want to get some of your thoughts let's go to nitty in Anchorage, Alaska and and then he understand that uh you're a you're a little higher on Lindsey than non Susan at this point\nWell just from the standpoint Brian of a senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it wasn't on the for the Senate then have all the trappings but Lindsay made those other members on that and judiciary\nCommittee either eat their spinach\nOkay them exactly what they need to hear I don't think they pay any attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of\nBattle he didn't wait to see which way the wind was blowing that kind of the way I look at it and I think and I'm going to say that um\nThe the never Trump earthquake Susan Collins was one way through my casket with one and Jeff Flake was one I think that they had seen the attendance at Trump rallies they he's been they had four or five I've lost count he's like\nThe Energizer Bunny [laughter] they they and enthusiasm in those rallies when\nPresident Trump was mentioned Kavanaugh's name I Am sure you heard that too\nUm and so I just I I think Collins for her speech today but I really wanted to say how much I admire Lindsey Graham for really having them part a kid there to\nReally say what needed to be sent to the members of that and Judiciary Committee that were acting\nUh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think [laughter]\nBut but actually something you can be proud of but you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham's fight as moment as well are you talking about the the five o'clock hour five o'clock eastern time tomorrow we're going to have this vote and it was only five o'clock eastern time but Lindsey Graham a week ago yesterday ended up by having\nThat particular moment where he sped up now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be pragmatic\nYet emotional plenty of Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately I have to take anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take a given that you are in Alaska so she voted no today the heat is being put on her\nUltimately what are the implications in Alaska does she have a chance to uh to win her next election if she ends up going down this path\nWell I I Wish I were the exact answer to that Brian judging from the very popular radio show in the afternoon for three to six that pair iris and most every day and believe me the people\nI Can't remember very many call for a new one hand for foreign Lisa all the other calls have been um\nUm we hope she'll vote for a ... a cabin on\nOkay it's gonna be interesting to see what happens there I\nActually think there's an outside chance that she ends up becoming a vote in the affirmative tomorrow or I Know that the earlier today a in addition to her voting no to end debate\nShe also indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country but then she walked back through comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although what should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the affirmative because it's not going to alter the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to the show\nAnd thank you sir [noise]\nHey I'm I
