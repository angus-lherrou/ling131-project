A. B. C.\nBefore we conclude the program today I wanted to mention to issues that uh I think are very important first Leah I'm listening to the reports about hurricane Michael\nAnd people refusing to leave and police asking them give us the names of your next of kin or in case you don't make it we have to notify them and then someone said something I think is so so important that is\nIs I don't care what party the governor of the mayor is in Florida it doesn't matter whether you like the person that don't like the person\nWe all have to work together to save lives and I know we live in this divide society you're either on the side of that side but there comes a time we all have to be on the same side uh when it comes to hurricane it I Know\nA Americans were so compassion will all contribute to the cause of helping people rebuild their lives\nUm I've seen numbers of a ... he's a he's going to increase\nBut we're not going to solve the problem by seeing this as a democratic or Republican issue or there was a human issue here that needs to be addressed the second thing I Want to mention is we all get asked to be in certain demonstrations to\nVolunteer for certain causes and one of the questions I Will ask is how many who the leaders are I Know the cause I Know the issue tell me who leaders are and it is very troubling to me when I see important causes the women's march\nLed by heat mourners when I see a ... read when I see people who speak evil uh above the Jewish people who who say horrendous things about us to embrace lose fabric and uh I Can't stand in such company so I Would hope that\nPeople have to separate and say look I'll participate but I'm not going to stand with these people I'm not going to join if they're leading the demonstration or it's important we tell our kids you know be careful of the company you keep because you judge people by their friends and friends can take you in the wrong direction\nI don't see any reason why we can't do better or get leaders who are\nAre appropriate or who are decent uh who are non prejudicial we're not anti Semitic we're not hateful shouldn't be so hard to find such people they're out there um but somehow or we seem to gravitate sometimes to those\nWho do not serve the cause will win the smart ... many of us find that cause report\nThank you so much for listening to religion an alliance rabbi Joe's protesting I Hope to be with you next week [noise]\nYou know visceral fat rating body fat body water or the body water so important the body what it's supposed to be around sixty percent people don't realize that sixty percent of your body should be water if people are coming in\nWith forty percent thirty five percent forty five percent are particularly it\nReally are obese people but certainly ... women obese women in general or if your if your body water is low and you're walking around with a bunch of water and you're walking around with a book with drinking water all the time and meanwhile your water's low uh you're gonna that's gonna affect how your body's metabolism is going to work it's going to affect a your muscle is\nOr like the engine of your metabolism and so if that's not happening uh because your body isn't absorbing water properly maybe one of the reasons you can't lose any weight so we put you on that machine will be able to see if that's the situation there so I said Andrea dot dot com it's only twenty seven dollars and you can schedule appointment come in\nAnd we'll get you go in on the road to health and on the road to possibly shopping and different ...\nTo ... so I got you beat on that one what what what was your number your number one what three days and\nBruce was sixty days fifty six pounds in six\nTo ... I I got you beat on that one I got I'm yeah I'm a I'm ashamed to say well I'm not ashamed to say I don't really know his first name because he's in the Brooklyn offices moments and and so and I I Believe that his pictures has the foreign actors actually on our website already a sixty four pounds and sixty days\nOh yeah I Know you're talking about yeah sixty four pounds in sixty days yeah um and he took a great profile picture of himself the gentleman is wearing a white shirt and tie and so the profound pictures fantastic says you guys get a chance definitely go to Angie diet dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four pounds and sixty days is very impressive\nMan and woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is that\nUm [noise] it's an ...\nAn astronomical number in my opinion about the same as I I think something to that effect again I don't know the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but\nAh you know this is just staggering number and really just the health a benefit you had a vast officer any trace of criminals around it but you can do it much easier sixty four comes down I Would think so I definitely I think that's probably a better situation for them especially in this heat that we've got going on so ...\nSo we improved we've we improved\nThe safety of our city to yes that's correct if he can chased on criminal ... yeah I Know and then you know when I went wow yeah when when\nOne at a time right so but you know ... pounds of great but I think that um\nA lot of what we see in our office is really the health benefits of what happens and um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and um what you are a blood tests are and where your numbers are so\nWe had stand who are just um [noise] was in and he's on day thirty three out of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nHour which is a twenty seven pounds and thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that\nUm has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however and a lover pounds however his\nA health uh results or hit overall uh health um\nBenefits have been ridiculous so his blood pressure is now one oh four over sixty four which I Would say probably a little low [laughter] and if I write his cholesterol ah went I'm Down to one oh nine\nFrom from two twenty eight wow so his HDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven his triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from two fifty\nEight is his day thirty three of the ... well\nI mean I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day into the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do the blood work and all that other stuff but his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not\nWrite so his primary care doc I fell off the chair absolutely just blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were a couple of months ago\nYou know your your numbers were a disaster basically you know and this guy's I can understand I have so much energy I'm doing this and saying that it feels so good at you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days in and\nLiterally um he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma or it's tremendous tremendous\nUm [noise] so I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office yeah fine\nTo their health part of it is the best part land and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and ah we were able to look at you know blood work in a functional level and and then to\nSee what supplements with support people need and and it's so everybody gains weight and different areas for a reason\nThe body is generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone a disruption\nAnd so you've got the different body types you've got to be with the floppy overhanging belly fat where it could be adrenal issue for treating hard belly fat deliver 'em they did that that ... issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid were imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be a Ninety number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents allowed to use blood work assessment tool or to see what a functional level to keep to keep a ... to get the body function better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nBasically get people into the cellular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detoxify itself\nThe hype of ... which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat as basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat you punching somebody to say that somebody too\nSo that's what we were able to do the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight is their thermostat is set up to fifty and no matter what they do they're going to stay to fifty so then we get them their bodies bouncing get 'em down to let's say two time then reset the thermostat a two time you're going to say to ...\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well so if you're going to you know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if you're waiting pops up to three pounds would tell you how to what to eat that day drops the weight back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over your your day forty or or a six year into program where\nSo ah you know it's a system it's personally from the beginning of ... at the end at the end we also use DNA tools or we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating a types or exercise for each individual uh essential the need for central vitamins and minerals\nOr ... different or metabolic factors are assessed so we're looking at over forty different genetic factors to help people not only help keep lose the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end this person lives each individual because everybody's going to be a little different it can't be one or can't be a one or what one thing that sets everybody so it's got to be a little bit there but it's not one size fits all\nThrough able to switch these things up and get the people get people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and bodies bouncing the health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight five five\nFive and J died at twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight and that's the schedule of free go over the system in one of our little five locations and in New York tri state area\nUh the best way to do it I think is to go on line you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in will do a body company an appointment with us a body composition analysis we're going to look at not just wait\nAre we going to look at body fat percentage were going to look at body water percentage were going to look at your ... your your metabolic age so you were going to look at your basic metabolic rate and how much your and your daily caloric intake so those two numbers needs to be close to each other for you to be able to lose way we've got people routinely coming in are in there\n[noise] to get that done at say five five five and Jay diet one eighty five five five six five thirty\nFour thirty eight uh that's good to schedule an appointment a for free go over one of our offices now when you're calling\nAnd you're talking on the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee that uh that's why we were moving all the ... and just come in and get a check up get a get a check up and all that\nUh and so just don't get mad at those people were people yelling at them all the time all the time uh and so just come in and and and uh [noise] and see us are there and uh but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven\nDollars normally finding nine dollars only twenty seven dollars\nOr you can um come into the office will do an appointment with one of ... with one of us\nAre you also will do a body composition analysis will take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage of body what percentage of visceral fat rating your metabolic age your basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things or body water so important that should be closer to sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time and drinking a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight gain a and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people\nCome off of all types of different things so there's no limit to what the body can do when you get it working helpfully the body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just had some a lot of barriers that it can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted knocked down and then\nThe body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers ... the personalization of the of the program the buyer energetic scans\nA parent's live a sample for that or blood work functional assessment a DNA testing or that shows us over forty different metabolic factors that we assess or to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a face healthy as possible so really\nThe N J died dot com or when a five five five A N J diet I wanted to tell you about a Sondra are we talking about sleep I guess sleep\nWith some some sort of a lot of people coming in with real sleeping issues and you know I Wonder why people are walking around with trouble the triple ... lattes well sleep eat off he's from God Knows where\nHe goes to sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation is having like a to think our stomach you know I Know and there was uncomfortable and one of the most awful thing you can have\nYeah but it's so people are coming in I guess they ... they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily from sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical that they're even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the weight and start thinking about how their health is improving\nOr send your came in a thirty nine year old female or she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a having a lot getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's a neutrino adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter solo so important ah they're supposed to you know they're supposed to cortisol as grades it's a it's produced by the adrenal glands and and so\nIt's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if you're you have a dream exhaustion issues a lot of times you'll see the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit under that\nBut what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she basically been sleeping like a rock\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed with alarm wakes up at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she's just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day rested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon\nA much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep cc when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction\nI'm twenty four pounds sleeping like a rock she came in\nWe did herring saliva sample or a bio energetic scans blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support hype a family support we also gave her adrenal support um got they got the body work in the right way and ah now we've got the results that we see\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more that\nI'm right between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one\nI'm a lot of things change in the women's um body you know ... and cycle right and so it's really it's interesting that every ten years right right exactly so I think that it's interesting that um you know you brought that up but speaking of at the health benefits so we've had\nThis happen a bunch of times in our office but this just recently happened again\nUh Michelle I'm who am I Believe she's in her mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really really a lot of weight ... eighty pounds well what happened was um she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so did a lot of\nYou know um hormone therapy type stuff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these drugs are really am known for um they'll put on weight output that tell us a ton of weight on Yammer them and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive but because of that\nAnd she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then afterwards really hard hard time taking it off so\nThen she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know are these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful as her first but she was about\nEighty pounds heavier than she had started out before so she came to us\nShe did to a forty day rounds which basically means she went pound for pound them both of them um and that's very um you know it it's common because this was not her regular weight right this was wait put on with your mind right so that's why she went pound for pound because her body really needed it really needed to get rid of all it's very sad for pound\nFor pound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound for pound a day for a woman is absolute\n... we've had a number of women without an atmosphere it up so anyway so she comes and she comes in 'em and she says um she goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for hand saliva test I'm just one after the program and\nShe says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no hormones great now ... no ... no nothing on she says I guess my body got rid of all the talk sense of all the extra hormones I dropped all this way\nShe says and now it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know I don't know at times I Would say yeah half a dozen a dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know where settled with one child and happy and the baby's healthy and so\nNow she's about to have a second one and she said I Can't believe I'm going to have to lose weight again but you know what I think it's going to happen to be honest with you is probably ... now they're not exactly regulators bodies more regularly our probably gain she'll probably Jay has not\nGained a ton of weight are already and as she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different\nShe feels so much healthier and really feels good not as much knowledge I during the pregnancy she's really she says it's just a whole different experience for her she feels like crushed south and it's really great and congratulations to her and I you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we had a job also I had a somebody came in was telling me the same thing\nUh Joe came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says she would come and go heavy bleeding for days on end and it wouldn't then uh it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent\nAh and she came in in a similar situation you know she said that it then the cycle cycle totally stop\nShe's down Seventeen pounds a twenty two days which is great uh and the cycle shows is it ... it seemed like she was regulating weather cycle

a a march called the Patriot ... patriot pride I Believe um and it happened in Portland over the weekend and it was and it got ugly because ... showed up and people basically started beating the crap out of each other here's a little bit of the bra\n[laughter] fighting with each other really hurting Iran demonstration\nBilled as a martial law and order the streets of Portland descent into chaos

... in the street fighter\nNow as I say what's happening here is that group patriot prayer which I are being cast as white nationalist and I'm not being strong enough evidence to say that this and the white nationalist groups not in any case\nAnd then just coming from a guy who's happy to to say when I think people are white nationalist rabid two episodes after Charlottesville talking about white nationalism\nAnd the evils of the alt right patriot prayer was doing a mark in Portland specifically because they wanted to show that anti was violent and people showed up and it looked like antifa instigating violence and the folks at patriot prayer then got into it with that including some of the Proud Boys from Gavin begin to his group\nUm and it got violent now as I say I think that is perfectly worthwhile to publicly march against violent and\nI think it's okay to defend yourself too but there's a difference between being willing to defend yourself and spoiling for a fight to the point where you are looking to beat the crap out of somebody because number one you shouldn't be looking to be living crap out of people and aggressive fashioned like once the guys down with guys down now it's time for law enforcement to come in\nAnd number two is perfectly obvious that the media are going to play this as though in his right wing group instigating violence as opposed to the boat

nationalist Yemen is not a white nationalist Gavin Gavin is not a white nationalist Gavin I think it should be more strict about who he involves friends but\nIsn't just the Gavin is white nationalist ignores any part of his rhetoric or that that's just not accurate now with that said\nDo the Proud Boys well for a fight yeah they do and you can see that in this particular video in New York now and he was claiming that the problem isn't getting violent\nA pep boys are claiming that he plans to get into violence nearly after the event they walked out there were many members somehow the violence gets instigated and you end up with basically twenty members of the problem with picking living crap out of remember that he ...\n[laughter] and then they will get on the guys are taking them and then eventually you'll see some members of sort of surrounding crowd actually\nPulling people off of these guys [noise] um because they don't want them you know getting arrested or telling somebody on the street brawls fought in public street this is not ... it's not civilization and if the police won't do their job is gonna get worse and worse and mayors aren't gonna do their job is going to get worse and worse\nOn any question it doesn't matter folks throw it out there on taxes the preexisting storyline is\nUm ... tax hikes are going to bankrupt the government and that they're always in it for the rich the Republicans that's the that's they're not asking you a question about tax cuts they're just asking a question to advance the narrative that you're on the side of the rich guys screwing over the average American\nOn health care is that you're looking at throw grandma off the cliff you're cruel you want people to die\nOn schools is that you're starving public schools uh money despite the fact that ... a public schools I've records a matter of fact it doesn't matter they're not really asking questions\nWhat they're trying to do is get a narrative advance and they're trying to do what's called framing or trying to frame the question in a very specific way\nAnd they are used to doing this and winning because what happens they ask the questions the Republicans panic you know listen there's these tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well under these types of of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in taxes\nOf course they're gonna do well under a tax cut that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow but it's not a Republican just answering like that oh yeah\nOh they have been a hard and they're terrified\nThey'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns to the question is do an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance he re frames it in his wet\n\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is eight eight is is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost taught a logical\nTrump knows that Trump is comfortable\nWith that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames Lesley Stahl who's smart she's listening she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal is liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically senses Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop 'em she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter ... sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted and four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nGet the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the away basketball court here she knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop them and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going\nTrump knows the authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes to battle scars at all that's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group pass the talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talked period and the story right\nSo the takeaways here\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activist take away number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know folks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paints this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just any turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word in this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes interview get the last words he gets a last what he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word in the ... this is simple this is really easy\nThe benefit of getting the last word in is Utah class then that's what everybody remembers\nSolve tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie\nAnd and that's why I'm president and you are not add boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversation sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... because of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard\nThat people are attracted to that authenticity\n\nSo he understands he has to reframe it number one and secondly\nHe understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did\nBut to show you how that performance contrast with what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic\nWho they are they based their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren that I\n... I mean who what other president\nOther than Donald Trump will never forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement\nCould have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty ... everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly\nOne one thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks who ever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think\nYou were getting out of a press release indicating that your great great great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back\nMay have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\n\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lives by driving them when Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic Elizabeth Warren will not let this go why did oh lettuce is embarrassing do you understand how this plays\nTo the average working class Americans sitting there toiling for a limited uh whatever kind of a job you're working hanging sheet rock driving trucks\nPlumbing\nElectric work you're an architect you gotta sit here and listen to a woman who put down on our foreign to gain some kind of advantage that she had Native American a Native American heritage wrote an entry in a cookbook about powwow chow\n\nThat's real by the way it is and and as possibly one one thousand twenty fourth America this is I'm not give it a Democratic Party of I I just say you're constantly wonder gosh how did Trump beat us how did Trump beat us because he's just a normal guy\nBattle scars at all your people are fakes you got this guy in Texas I'll bet I'll bet always skateboard you so who cares\nWho cares you got Bernie Sanders not rich they're the worst part he says it's like oh this is my third house now Bernie Sanders the base of fortune richer than what you are the rich he is the one percent\nSounds sounds like yeah bread subscriber base party says it's like oh the tax plan or for sure\nThey're all forties and you wonder you wonder why Trump continues continues to win and every single time or I forgot to take a break come there but you know in from work with and give us a call eight seven seven three one three at one one that's eight seven seven three one three in one one we'll be right back\n[noise] month over him on Seventy seven W BBC Mm\nNo it has often said that the suit makes them in and I've been making my sits in America and the very same New England factories since Nineteen eighty seven when I launched my first collection for over Thirty years my goal has been to help American men look and feel better when it comes to their own sense of style and now I've created my luxury flagship store in the heart of Manhattan\nForty nights in Madison to do just that\nI'm just sort of mood and I've always believed in the quality of service of the great men specialty stores or the past and now you can experience that first hand with distinctive one of ... shootings impeccable tailoring and luxurious fabrics from the finest Italian meals and while you're out to\nAfter the [noise]\nThe rations had had elections infrastructure and governance secrets to the United states has master hackers Tim\nSays that fun as a CIA cyber eighth defies all notions of one of the deadliest by looks like invite former intelligence agent ... turning in Thailand and the tables are turned in the hour cyberwarfare Eric ... tend to not far from guns angst and bite\nMe Whitey site now I'm salad Amazon dot com visit the U.

that ABC nightly news NBC nightly news CNN story on how the Clinton surpluses Mitt they would go away forever but they won't do it\nThey do this and now they're doing it now and the reason I bring it up is because they are\nGood at staying on message that's how they get these myth to persist over time Trump pass\nThem scattered all over the place they cannot stay on message you got one guy who Sparta gifts you got one guy I skateboard in a parking lot Tibet oh you got one guy talking about fart jokes I I'm Serious Sheldon Whitehouse\nThis is the Democrats\nI fundamentally disagree with just

working anymore\n\nThe guys got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media turns it back on them\nHe and he gets the last word in just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview making sure that's the soundbite everybody remembers\nAny talks like normal American this is constantly has the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and their swap rat Democrats back on their heels 'cause they don't know how to respond anymore the standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they're falling on deaf ears\n\nYou know I said with his fair share stuff that I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is done apologizing\nFor taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country even if the orders happened to be successful at Wellesley everybody used to apologize in the past oh no no we're not giving tax cuts for the rich why why are we not doing that\nWhy well because it'll look bad well is it\nThe economy yeah it's good for the economy so who cares that make the case something it's such a war\nMake the case Trump does see\nI told you the numbers before the break this one I Can't get this number out of my head\nThat do fourteen hundred wealthiest taxpayers in the country pay the same percentage of income tax three percent as the bottom fifty percent of income taxpayers this whole country do you understand the gravity of what I just told me for gene hundred taxpayers\nWho are successful and wealthy\nPay the same percentage of the income tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax orders in this country can't let the delusional liberals who are one percenters themselves Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren\n\nJohn Kerry John Kerry used as a was a one percent of one\nPercent are well still insists you don't pay your fair share they have no idea what that even mean it requires you to be a sucker to do no further analysis of the\nFolks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn or you might as well burn it you're flushing\nIt down the toilet you know Milton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while you know it's always worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman like great Milton Friedman\nHe had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on here and there's no turning back this way to spend money summarizes completely why the government giving the government money is a total complete epic disaster\n\nWhat are the most efficient what's the most efficient ways to spend ... way to spend money right\nYou spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why\nBecause the cost of the product of your purchasing matters if your money but the quality of what you're purchasing matters too because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family\nYou want a good car you want to go home you want good clothes you don't buy crappy suffers gonna fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\nWhat's another way to spend money less going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people Friedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer\nDoes equality matter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest feel a little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way when you spend money on other people the quality of what you're buying a matter so much\nIt's not yours\nOther people there's another way to speed less efficient other people\nCan't spend other people's money on themselves you go into work trip your job is is a is paying for the hotel that's other people spending other people's money on themselves you're spending other people's money on your hotel room this quality\nMatter yeah you're damn right your hotel room you want the best hotel room after but there's the cost\nThat no no it doesn't matter that's the jobs money yeah yours give me the the the the top floor of Trump Tower I'll take it cost them matter you may say wow that sounds like really inefficient way to spend money to do it gets worse it gets even worse\n\nOther people
