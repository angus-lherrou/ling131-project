bad you can go to work what are their biggest problems we have\nThe luxury of being a man I really don't want to go this meeting today because they put on their badge and they put their lives on the

bag that that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz so it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points there\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron does Santa's for governor\nFor years after endorsing Democrat\nWrite\nLittle excerpt from the story a major union for police officers but for the police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor\nCharlie Crist anyways a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently who's a Democrat\nThat is a serving out of the saint Pete area but uh anyway what's the last time he

their quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special

whatever you want to refer to this\nPose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for this until he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down\nBy morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mother so their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country\nIt's game over its came over\nAnd part of what may need so upset I noticed what was going on not long after\nThe whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look in in I was tracking violence towards police officers remember\nBefore the whole Kaepernick thing even if you have the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country\nAnd I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida\nThat tracks the violence against police officers\n\nAnd here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he did not for example ... scrutiny of police has resulted in place being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you\nYou might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it was just prove the nonsense narrative\nYou advance but here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics as they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right

hundred gone wrong for one eight hundred God junk\nDot com\nDiet diagnosed\n[noise]\nThey talked about how the deaths occur and I'll explain it to you it's a it's kind of a technical thing but there are some really big bands in the ...\nAnd you think of the bucks a sort of a you know not a a a vibrant area of the body like the face or the brain or heart getting lots of blood or why are these large blood vessels there while they're basically there because a lot of blood has to flow through the bucks in order to prevent pressure sores\nAnd that and that's also why people are fidgety you get a little discomfort in your buttocks are your shift position you turn over at night in your sleep so you don't put too much of a pressure on your on any one area of your buttocks and your thighs\nSo you know we're built to up to withstand these things but we're built to withstand the pressure because we've got a lot of blood flowing through our buttocks\nSome of those veins are as big as drinking straw and I'm always amazed when I operate on the bus next to see how large the veins are I mean they're huge so when people inject fat into the ...\nIt's actually very difficult not to inject fat into these veins\nNo matter what we do as plastic surgeons there is risk so we've been warned well don't go into the muscle well it's not so easy a study was done a just a few months ago and it showed that even when plastic surgeons tried not to enter the muscle they usually did\nAnd it was emphasized well that's where the problems occur so why mentioning it this week well this is not not just the United states problem it's a worldwide problem and many of the deaths that have occurred had been in the Caribbean and in South America people that go there for a what we call medical tourism\nBut also now in Britain so in the u._k. in Britain\nThe uh the plastic surgery society has now looked at the data\nLooked at the procedure and they've gone a step further than the United states plastic surgeons\nThey've actually said stop doing that procedure to their members they said it is too dangerous to do Brazilian butlers and that's very interesting I I I've always said you know why didn't our National Society just come out and say stop doing it they did not do that\nAnd I do disagree with them they should have done that\nUh but they haven't and uh they've just said well be very careful when you do Brazilian but listen these are the things you need to uh\nTo look out for and it turns out the deaths are continuing so my advice to you if you're considering having this procedure listen to the learned opinions of British plastic surgeons in this case\nThe America or the British society plastic surgeons they have come out and said stop doing this to their members stopped doing Brazilian but less in fact they're quoting a number may be as high as one in two thousand chance of dying now that's amazing if you think about this because when you're talking about one in two thousand risk of dying from a a cosmetic procedure\nWell I'll tell you I wouldn't want that I I really want I mean that's the risk of heart surgery which you don't have a choice you have to undergo these risks if um you know the choice is having a heart attack or having bypass surgery or something like that\nBut let's face it we're talking about making your buttocks bigger and\nWent on the show a couple of years ago and we talked about these things and I did some research and it it turns out that you can actually get about an eight percent increase in the size of your buttocks just by doing exercises like squats Ross remember those from gym class squats for us you know these are really intense\nUh exercises that stimulate your gluteus maximus you do that for about six weeks you can significantly increase the size with zero risk and it's good for your health\nSo once again I Hope you're listening and I hope you're not having these procedures are my goal in life and my goal is a plastic surgeon is to make people happy doing procedures to improve your parents\nProve your overall health because or your parents is linked to your health both in terms of physical and mental mental status\nUh but we don't want to hurt people and so rule number one medicine going back a thousand years his first do no harm so a listen carefully I Would not have my buttocks augmented I'm Dr arts

A. B. C. so one of the things that I Do a lot of is Botox and in fact it is the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure\nIn the United states and around the world it's not really surgery then kind of surgery and I'll tell you why\nA it's an office procedure and it's one of the things that are as I say I do a lot of six and a half million people in the United states had Botox last year\nWe use the term Botox but really there are others there's e amen that's another competing product that is in my opinion identical to both talk with some little nuances of differences\nAnd then there's just poured that's another one there are three on the market right now\nAnd more to come I understand we talked about that in the past but there are more of those Botox liked drugs\nOn the way in the United states so\nThey're good because they work very well and they are very very safe\nAnd how safe are they well you know I I have seven doing both talk now for Twenty one years that's a long time and the Botox world I started in Nineteen Ninety seven injecting Botox or shortly after um it was described I Believe at Columbia\nA Botox was first used for a ... of the muscles around the ... the not the not the superficial muscles that create rankles but rather the actual Iowa lead Iran's eyeball muscles and lo and behold they found that uh it was an accident wrinkles went away when they got injected and so\nLike so many drugs the side effects became the primary reason to use the drug and Botox today is an absolute blockbuster drug for allergy and and the other companies that make it so it's really good I use it almost every day on forehead wrinkles you know those horizontal lines of the far ahead\nI use it and the vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows those are the ones that you used to uh to yell at your children you know your scoring and create those\nThey like to call those the eleven lines then we also use it on the crows feed those are the three most common areas\nI sometimes use it on bunny lines we we have great names for these things don't always funny lines are those little lines on the nose when you stretch up your nose or you get those diagonal line so a Botox is pretty good for that\nAnd I also use it probably was increasing frequently frequency on the rumpled chin oh my goodness all these terms rumpled chin and it's very important to use just a little tiny bit of both talk there\nBecause it's very easy to get the muscles\nThat are that close the mouth and that created a smile and create an asymmetric smiles so there's real art artistry to injecting Botox there really is so why am I bring it up tonight well in South Carolina or the dentist have decided that they should be able to do both talks\nAnd you know in New Jersey dental surging both us and other states\nAnd how is that you know is this dentistry what are the dentist really learn you know dentistry as a big field my father was that this\nMy uncle was a dentist my cousin is a dentist\nI got a lot of deaths us in the family and they're wonderful doing what they are trained to do but\nYou know you gotta wonder why our debts is injecting or wanting to inject Botox for wrinkles and the forehead and other parts of the body that had nothing to do with your teeth\nAnd gums which are the primary focus is set a word focus of a dentist so why is that you know you can answer the question yourself uh we we know everybody knows why do people who are not trained in something\nFormally why are they interested in doing it why does one feel why did the atomic trust want to uh use drugs why do they want to do surgery yeah everybody wants to expand what they do\nAnd uh and particularly into cosmetic fields and why because these things are outside of insurance what can I say I call it like I said so the American society of plastic surgeons has tried to really put their foot down and they said this is just terrible\nUh and they've written a very strongly worded letter to the legislature and South Carolina to try and put a stop to it saying that there is no justification for debt this to be doing this\nNow I Know that that's just may call into the show and say hey wait a minute we're trained in the anatomy of the map but you're not trained in the aesthetics of the full face and the muscles and there are cases of injecting Botox into eyeballs believe it or not by improperly trained people you know were injecting right around there\nWhat can I say I I just think you know I'm not here to fill teeth and a and whiten teeth\nI'm not trying to be a gynecologist and do ... tightening I think that's an appropriate for plastic surgeons\nAnd I do think that people should just do what they are trained to do that so that's my uh my little editorial today a particularly in light of the letter by uh uh the American side of the plastic surgeons to the Carolina South Carolina board of dense\nAnd not see the scar I no longer make incision in the heroine so we do that we lift up the skin of the cheek we lift up the gallon a separate layer then we go into the neck with an incision\nAnd it's a incision just underneath the chin and people said well how do you get those bands had to get the fat way down in the neck through that little tiny incision and that my friends is why it takes six years to become a plastic surgeon\nI suppose if I took a two hour course I wouldn't know how to do that [laughter]\nAnd that but you want a board certified plastic surgeon to do these procedures or because they are very highly technical and uh and I hope I make it look easy in the operating room but there's a lot that goes into doing a face looks like that so we make an incision\nOr in the ... underneath the chin and I suction the fat in most cases and I look at those muscles and bring the muscles together and then we go back to the cheeks and lift the cheeks and so everything back and that is a facelift but\nNot everybody wants that not everybody needs that and some people just have kind of loose skin and the bans in the neck and say you know my cheeks are okay I really don't have noticeable jowls\nCatch you just lift the neck\nAnd the answer is yes with an asterisk because sometimes we can do it and sometimes we can't and that is a a a more difficult decision if you're forty five usually yes it's possible if you're fifty five it might be possible if you're sixty five usually it is not possible because\nIf you're if you're sixty five your skin is going to have relaxed to the point where if I Do that then you have to look a little better\nBut please don't tell anyone who did it because if I did it because it's not going to look perfect\nIf you don't then lift the cheeks because you can do this or as long as you're not driving do this in front of the mirror you can take your fingers and put it right in the middle of your cheek and sweep the skin up and back and you see what happens while you're jowls are better\nBut if you're doing it aggressively enough you also see that you're lifting the next skin and that's what we're doing a facelift of course we lift up the skin and everything moves up a but if we don't use that she can citizen\nThen we can't tighten the or the next skin and we're relying on just it reads raping and and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't and again once in\nA it's very important that you see a a board certified plastic surgeons someone that knows what they're doing it has done a lot of these procedures particularly if you're looking at one of those hybrid procedures I've had patients say you know what I don't want any of these things I don't want a I but I have all that extra skin in my neck I don't want a facelift\nAnd there are some procedures that can be done every now and then will actually make an incision in the neck and it's called direct ... of the skin I Do that probably literally about every ten years we find just the right person who wants that kind of a procedure but that leaves visible scar and I don't like to do that usually with a faceless scar\nIt's pretty hard to see after about three months that's my goal my goal and I can't promise that to anybody I Wish I could have promised that you're not going to see the scars\nBut the goal is at three months with a little bit of makeup or maybe even without makeup it's hard to see the scars for a facelift\nSo we have a facelift we have the necklace which is called ... plastic\nWhy do I not say that here because it's a hard words to say and no one knows where to put his ... so sometimes I call it a band lift or a necklace but that does get confused with a facelift but then I have patients that come in and say you know what\nThat all sounds great but I don't want to go into the operating room at all isn't there anything else you can do and once again it depends on your age and your weight\nBecause we do have some tools like all the era and what does all the era it's high energy focused ultrasound it's eight years old now so it's no longer a new procedure I've been doing it since October of two thousand and ten\nAnd I've done thousands of all their procedures and and I know that it's a very good procedure in some people in a pretty good procedure and other people and not so good a procedure in some other people and here's what you have to do you have to really\nFind out which of those categories you are\nAre you someone that's going to get probably a really good results or just an average results or maybe not a great results at all\nAnd you make a decision now I have patients that come in and say you know what we're going to try it because there's no way I'm ever going to have a surgical procedure and with that understood\nWill do out there and who are the better patience for all their procedures and what is it by the way high energy focus ultrasound it's an office procedure it's the only thing that I've had I've had it three times I'm overdue for another procedure\nWhen the residence from Columbia in Cornell it comes to my office I ah I usually teach them on me on the patient that's how I get my procedures I let the residence or do the oath era on me and I find a pretty uncomfortable but most of my patients do not\nAh what can I say so uh so\nAll there is high energy focused ultrasound it's a method of applying heat underneath the skin and why would we do that we do that because he\nCauses a little bit of a a an injury and you know you say once again\nWhy do you want to injure me we injury you to stimulate her normal biologic process something that's been around since humans have been around and and way before humans because most mammals at least he'll and it's very similar way they shrink the skin if there's been an injury particularly a burn\nAnd they generate new college and so we do this in a very predictable way with all sorts of machines lasers all Farah radio frequency which is electric current I like all their I like lasers also but they have different uses\nSo all there are there is no won't there's nothing that you see on the surface of the skin a little bit of reading us for an hour or two usually maybe a wealth here and there that last a day or two\nBut that's about it it is pretty much the or the simplest procedure you can undergo and it takes about an hour to do the sheiks in the neck and I go over the area and I uh I pretty much do a radio show while I'm Talking to you [laughter]\nYou know you're sitting there and I'm trying to distract you but\nUh that's what we go through for about an hour well do I do the procedures myself I don't delegated to a nurse I don't delegated to a physician's assistant I Believe in doing these procedures myself and the reason is because I Try and get a surgical type of resolved with a machine because I can actually see through the skin with all their there's ultrasound\nThat lets me actually see you're fat and underlying structures and I am the machine very specifically at structures that I Want to effect so if I'm trying to destroy a little bit of fat\nAre really pound that area with ultrasound and if I'm trying to lift tissue I Will ah I'll do many more pulses off and then uh then you know the published standards and that's not a bad thing by the way because the public standards are so that we can delegate these procedures to other people\nWhich I don't believe in doing a board certified plastic surgeon knows just how many calls as we can use to get to get an effect so off the air is kind of like ironing those of you who have iron I Know it's a lost art now they don't teach it in school\nYou never learned how to iron but I have hired and it's a it's a method of taking a heated object and and going over an area\nUntil you get a change in the structure of the year that's what I'm hearing and ironing cotton does\nWell we're using ultrasound to actually iron out the wrinkles with the skin and there are some similarities to it so uh we apply that he and sometimes we see the effect right away not usually but sometimes I can raise eyebrows I can raise the ... the jowls\nAnd but most interestingly I can ironed out some of the craziness of the skin and it's unique in that respect because not too many other things can do that sure we can do lasers yes we can do appeals but those all have downtime author has zero down time\nOne time I had a up there I went on to Dr oz show I think it was\nMaybe about twenty hours later so it was very interesting and you can tell that anything was done\nNow we want something to be to show but it takes about three months to see the full effect of all there so if you're looking to look better for a wedding and two weeks then we're not going to be able to help you with out there what can happen in two weeks Botox bill or that's about it but that's another show\nAnd that music means we're coming to the end\nOf the show Dr Arthur Perry this is what's your ankle right here on

next we'll listen to Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate earth balance of nature and a conversation with nationally syndicated talk show host Kevin McCullough\nThis is a conversation you don't want to mess as they discuss a variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nIt is often said that a medical doctors and the in the world of medicine are very suspicious of nutrition and nutrition is ten by nature to be somewhat suspicious of medicine\nAnd the truth is there may be need for both in wisdom is knowing the difference between the two\nMy special guest today is none other than the creator and the originator of balance of nature do he'll say he didn't create it and you'll just say he discovered it Dr Douglas Howard Dr Howard it's good to have you here would you say on an average basis that we're under nutritional lives in this country that we don't have the nutrition in our bodies\nThat are that they were originally created with to be able to fight disease on a natural level\nOh absolutely in fact I started specializing when I came back I I was being a foreign student affairs and Pavlov Medical University in Russia for several years and when I came back I started concentrating more on the geriatric patients at that point in time\nHow many people do you know and even if you're listening how many do know that have bleeding gums ... bruise easily have low energy and losing hair you only body like that will\nFare last aside from you know and but I've almost everybody in my peer group an older\nThan me but I Do I Know people that have the Arab losers sub clinical signs of Kirby ... you know we think oh we get out you know I take vitamin C. pill will all of those are signs of different disease aspects and those are things we look for the first thing is as cells start to die those are the things that are happening\nAnd you know it's interesting as even with bounds of nature I'm not here to tell you that everybody's going to grow a full head of hair back and some people do but that's not what this product is about a but hair loss slows down an even even hereditary hair loss seems to slow and I'll never forget a patient became in once and\nShe said oh I've got to show you this and my husband I go through this and I said OK okay you know and she showed me his head you know take your hat off took his hat off and yeah he was about half bald and she goes no you don't understand she told me the line of hair that had all grown back about two inches of it was coming back and she's I have been saving his head\nFor Twenty years and and I know that head and I know where it was and now he's starting to let me you know want me to grow some of the back and then another one game and she says that you've had a conveyor we're we're going to go in another room and I said okay and she said she said the league take your shirt off\nOkay took his ... he had this you know chest of hair and I says a nice of you know you understand that used to all be gray\nAnd I said well great you know and so and this man happened to have a breathing disorder and because of his meds and some other things and what and he was able to become more active and becoming more activities of the some of his meds because he was taking a balance of nature and it's all a big cycle\nBut as that those things happen then that was an unnatural grain and so when the body was\nPeople to do with it needed to do those things reverse and so there's a lot of lot of fun things\nFriends if you're interested in in knowing more about balance of nature there's people standing by right now that want to talk to you and you can call them simply an eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one you're going to get more information about promo codes and so forth coming up in our next break but to write that number down one eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one\nDr Howard the reason you and I are talking is because the number of months ago maybe a little more than a year ago now [noise]\nAh I called you desperately on a weekend and I said Dr Howard I have the worst flu I've ever had I've never I've never felt this way I've never suffered this way\nYou ask some questions about my my nutritional background I struggled with chronic bronchitis growing up there were regular chest congestion issues and sinuses and ah allergies and so forth that I was dealing with for a long time\nIn fact when I was a kid um I Would get bronchitis nearly every time the weather changed or if it went from real cold to real warm in a fast short period of time in fact this spring here in New York we had one of those days and I could tell my body wanted to to go there didn't get there\nThis time but uh you you talk to me about the difference in sparking a flame and the way infection works in the body and you said ... which is easier to put out the big roaring fire or little tiny spark and of course the answers to spark [noise]\nUm but you did I'm impressed you remember the you oh man he made such an impact or in in you you basically did say basically your flu is a big giant roaring fire right now you've gotta you've gotta get that doused but once you do or the balance of nature with the nutrition from the fruits and vegetables can put out those sparks much more quickly\nAnd I found that to be true because then the next year and a half or so since I've been on the product\nI have not had any a serious re occurrence of bronchitis and when I when I feel like something starting to go up the dosage take a few more fruits and vegetables for a few days under the direction you gave me and it has worked every single time including as recently as just a couple of weeks ago\nAnd a Dr Howard or

up\nAnd it could hardly move to get in the house\nUh and this tournament was especially rigorous just because\nOf the compact period of time and then I'd wake up during the night with cramps a I Would get up the next morning the very stiff stiff and usually take me a day or two to kind of feel like I was back to normal well I I got out of my vehicle and I was aware I wasn't cramping up\nA and that was that was a good thing 'cause I I'd I'd had about a three hour drive from this tournament not on my truck came and took a shower\nOr went went to bed that night and I slept or just are usually regular night's sleep I wasn't didn't feel exhausted I slept about eight hours got up the next morning and uh it wasn't until I was getting out of the shower that I realized that I was not ...\nI was
