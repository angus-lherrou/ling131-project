was up in Tennessee or in the um Taylor's specific endorsement of the Democrat Bill Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nShe was averaging a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee right Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race is now nine points so\nOh I'm not exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in

with what you were just touching on but um\nThis is Taylor Swift thing could be even a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being any body of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on the night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen and Tom Petty were they were pounding the war drums you recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a it was all of a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at you\nBut they're the St Louis or come from the same cloth especially Springsteen were they were anti war a it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taking a serious anymore\nI can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where this celebrities don't apply if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in factors razors they did show\nA from Columbia University back to two thousand eight a presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percent\nOf them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message just what I talked about when a all describing politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell it the first thing is you got to find somebody who is open to the information if you find somebody has closed minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee\nOh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say this yeah I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of dodge men until I was sixteen pay that kind of thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and you know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from

conservative area but I I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more\nThat's that's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states I mean there is an irony there are certain extent you know he's

brain is exploding Joe Walsh the residents feminist in chief over at the nation which is to say a crazy person she has a piece today called\nDonald Elizabeth Warren will not let Donald Trump define her because that's what she's doing when she says she's Native American in fact she won't even let biology to find her it's pretty amazing she won't let any they won't let objective reality to find her it's it's really really an impressive feat according to Joan Walsh Elizabeth Warren releasing her DNA test\nWas a way of preventing Donald Trump from defying her son says you to find herself as a pool that was great now that that was that was really exciting stuff ... do you remember Rachel Dolezal number that white lady is that she was black\nAnd then she could be like the head of this bill can N. double ACP and then people found out that she had just been basically tanning her skin and doing her hair out in in frizzy hair new and everyone said well that's a white lady and that's a

met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat ah it appears to me that the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine percent never get the U.S Supreme Court and so if\nIn twenty days the Senate flips to the Democratic party Chuck Schumer\nWill hold back and not confirm any any of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point it Trump was reelected which most of us believe he will understand the state's democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop they will not nominate you could nominate but they were not confirmed one judge\nSo what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights\nThan traditional values will continue on or else we can make the turn some out back to the middle secondly all the investigations if the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely the investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life\nJared Kushner's live everyone's life from the White House will be laid bare and the next two years were not be about legislation\nBut rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months where Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving the mob power by putting their house\nBack in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect of courses foreign

the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they would say and so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S MCA and its works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with so many jobs and talking about talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million well you're talking about millions of jobs to potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada\nWe couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent are are\nThey make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see
