I as much as I could really liked maybe even love certainly respect in individual that wasn't part of my family or my company for that matter I felt all those emotions towards this fellow ...\nHis father step was one of the largest it's not the largest shirt company in Canada they manufactured there they imported from around the world big company in Canada and the license the van user name and their trademark\nAnd they went out started marketing the Venus and bread for shirts drift shirts they used a package they used our styling they used everything and of course we signed a contract with the\n... by the way it was a cool guy one of the coolest guys when I met him in the sixties and he had just refurbished\nAn asteroid Martin db five James Bond car and go figure\nThat's awesome he actually had just had it read delivered from the u._k. I was in in Canada visiting him and I was floating around and James Bond car ... seats and all\nThey didn't do the inject the seed and if he did he was doing it without telling me 'cause he's gonna throw me out if he was like what I said so back to him we were in his offices and he sits down and says I have a problem\nYou know I signed a contract with you and I'm I agreed to pay you all we're picking number I agreed to pay two hundred thousand dollars a year and based on the size of my business\nI can only afford to pay you a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nAnd I looked at him and said boo hoo why are you telling me this what do I care what you could afford you signed a contract\nTo mark the so we are partners we respect each other I'm telling you I'm doing everything you know I'm doing everything I can to build the brand\nAnd I'm just falling short of the volume I Need to do to pay you the two hundred thousand I really would like you to consider\nGoing to a hundred and fifty thousand in the spirit of the relationship so I said to him you know look a skirts a little complicated because you know how much I admire you and I do believe you're doing everything to make Venus and successful here and I do appreciate everything you've done so far you were in the best stores\nOr we could always do more business but let me go home and I'll think about it\nI went home and I completely forgot about it on purpose you know why would I give him any relief you know I said it's like renting your brand any of you out there live in an apartment you know what\n... went up going to the landlord and so you don't want to pay rent increase got an a landlord and asking for a decrease in your rent when he's through laughing and throws you out of the office you can get a discount and your rent no the answer is no landlord so give money back so why should I and I have a policy when it comes to all these deals I have thousands of these you\nKnow relief\nI went back as I said I'm In the United states ignoring him and sure enough I get a call from my head of licensing depressive licensing as to come in and seeing\nSo he comes in sits down and said look I just got off the phone with us courage ski\nHe's really pressing for this relief I really believe that uh he makes a compelling case he's a great partner used on everything you want him to do he's launched us in Canada we have a straw ordinary business in Canada with a number two shirt company in Canada we never were able to the cat is successfully at least up until that time I think we should give them the relief\nI said you know it's my policy not to give relief I don't believe in it\nI don't believe in it is but mark and he's calling on the friendship you've done everything you blah blah blah blah\nBlah blah blah blah blah\nI said let me think about it so now I'm Still in my president of\nLicensing a couple of days goes by and the head of sales for van using candidate calls my licensing a guy can she happens to be the niece of Oscar a ski\nAnd she comes to see him personally you know you got to help the scans fifty thousand dollars is now principle it's not going to make or break but the company just doesn't feel right we shouldn't have to do this amongst two partners\nSo my head of licensing comes in with her with me they make a compelling case and against my better judgment I gave her the relief of the fifty thousand dollars now why am I tell you the story this has to be a twenty year old story\nBecause they never forgot it\nBecause this is about giving your word and they gave their word to pass let's fast forward about two weeks later goes by and I asked my head of licensing did you speak to the nice again and what an Oscar risky say about the fifty thousand dollars relief\nAnd he said he started to laugh and he said you're not going to like it but she was willing to share with me exactly what he said\nYou know what he said let me say this so stupid we should've asked them for a hundred thousand and you gotta give your word and you got to stick to it I never forgot that story\nAnd shut your mouth [laughter] [noise] or you want to talk about word in business I got another one for you it was a good story right and I liked that one don't ever give relief remember that so this story dates back to when the VH purchase Calvin Klein\nYour associates it's about you I Am sure Mr President missed the c._e._o. sure sure sure sure you're successful the biggest part of your income comes from your company stock and from the boat as you derive for hitting your numbers\nWill your employees your associates who are senior enough to participate in the ... they too have a disproportionate amount of their income\nDerived from bonuses\nOr they perfect no should they be fair yes\nI have examples in my career\nWhere we were promised bonuses I remember a three year Boehner's plan\nThat stayed it if we would earn a certain degree of\nEarnings for sure that I Would get two hundred percent of my salary at the end of three years I remember sitting listening closely every month keeping track are we going to get there are we going to get there\nAnd then in the last six months\nWe were so far away it was ridiculous\nAnd nobody got their bonuses and I remember walking into the chief financial officer\nAnd I don't see that lately I talking chief financial officer of a three billion dollar company who every weekend every month who's telling us how well we're doing it gives the bland and I said I Can't tell you how upset I Am and may be angry to find out in the last six months will be three year plan\nWhen I get a get it\nAnd he looked at me and he said to me more importantly\nYou didn't really believe that nonsense did you\nWhat are you nuts I couldn't believe what I was hearing I was an officer of the company was afraid to put my money you told me all alone is meant nothing he said there was never a chance\nIf it didn't you word matter and he's even answer me\nYou'll word matters\nI Believe the years that I was in control of establishing bonuses\nFrom the time I was president a PBA age to my entire tenure there'll be image every Boehner's plan I was involved with which straightforward and gave everyone an opportunity to achieve their numbers and they themselves every month\nCould do the calculations to determine how they were doing against those bonuses\nWe had carve out when it made sense if something happened to the company that was no control over there\nAt the time this was going on we give a car about if we bought a new company and it would decrease earnings for sheer because there was a start up we would make it counts for that in the ... calculations and for during those times\nEvery one of those people that I was involved and got a fair shake on the bones to boaters she's giving you word\nThe second thing bonuses to protect the company yes students ... but it's also to protect the company we want you working as hard as smart as you can to deliver the results of the company intends to make and for that we're going to reward you with a bonus and here are the criteria for that Boehner's\nAnd if you do the following you received as\nI say to you out there who are in control by city will you managers should your boss is president CEOs your word is at stake here\nPeople are relying on those bonuses\nTo feed their families to require retirement wealth to live a better life you're giving your word that it's\nSet up properly that they have a fair chance of getting that un I implore you to consider this they should go forward into next year with that in mind I remind you to like show usual word will be back in a minute\n[noise] always in fashion [laughter] this is the fashion

creating that because everyone else could affect your do transmitters\nI think a person can have ... Ga testosterone you've seen this before proven it I think there are people that have access carbohydrate in the diet that when they released insulin ensure drops down\nTo low they could have anxiety and depressive episodes so we want to look at all the underlying causes so we can make it clear you know picture to to see exactly what's going on\nOkay phone lines are open first call let's go to audience Staten Island\nHi there how are you how can I help you\nOr Twenty years ago I took some antibiotics\nAnd uh it uh did she thinks her stomach law teacher or prescription\nOver several months prior to ... the ... and ah she just wants to know a she has made some digestive difficulties or midlife that fifty fifty one years old and uh [noise] the question is how short of\nThe Heidelberg cap what would you suggest\nIt's difficult to get to the office what would you suggest\nIt's hard for me to give you the ultimate recommendation without seeing what her deficiencies are in her digestive enzymes those that break ten proteins carbohydrates or fat soon as much as I say here take super duper blah blah blah and mix\nIt really doesn't work that way if you're not making enough enzymes to break down the proteins then you would need a little bit more of the ... would be like pay simulates for storage clerk asked me to her you know get an idea about\nAnd some people think that probiotics and digested enzymes in the same thing they're not so probiotics are are the things that help to stabilize the floor in the gut although some people taking the probiotics would get some benefit they are now\nThe question is is there some underlying issue with you know a reaction to a food because some people taking the antibiotic starts to give them more of a symptom and their debt but and we test those individuals a lot of them have allergies to foods you take those foods out and then all of a sudden they've got fifty percent more benefit because\nWe found that we can remove that food allergen I thought if you do a garden variety ... you might get benefit you might not matter don't\nAnyway that's very helpful as I say uh my wife or his able to ... most who the course of course she has some allergies to [noise]\nUh yeah I Try to avoid those uh yeah actually uh\nThat was the next thing I was going to talk about you know and this is a great question you you you bring up because more people that I see you have these issues they're not so years ago we didn't see as many people are reacting to grains\nAnd we were testing people algae wise for Thirty years so now we see much much more a reaction to see many more reactions to the grains and even so much so that when people tell me they have stomach problems when I see him and cause of taste don't tell them for the sake of discussion just take the grains out of your diet for the next two weeks until I can see you and go with blood work\nAnd people will say ah my stomach feels so much better my voting is done in my skin is clearing up my headaches or gun my mood swings are changing so\nAnd then not only will you start to feel that great brain function again because when you keep the carbs out your buddies burning fat as a primary fields for your brain loves\nI've told and everybody that I've that I've discussed the diet with\nHas come back 'cause I make them right then how they feel day to day they say wow my memory with sharp was focused that's because the carbs are out of the picture on the carbs are not requesting a lot of insulin knocking your sugar down and making you feel groggy and tired and anxious inevitable\nSo we know what the carbs do and you're taking too much and how much insulin you make\nSo it's really the the best process is to learn about your body first and then correct all those things as you walk right through it because then you'll stay on it then you'll continue because you feel great and you'll feel less trash will be able to handle stress better\nOnce your hormones and vitamins and write range so\nI I Would love to see you in person with a new way I Will come the I'm\nSure of course the officers in Garden City the phone number side won six seven nine four zero four zero for\n[noise] I don't know like when I'm ... I'm a\nI mean just as we're talking now is what I'll say to you when you there\nWill take a history examined you get your blood work done or give you a hand on on low carbon nibble kind of put it all together so\nIt becomes easy for you you know the key to any experiences education and knowledge you know knowledge of the key so there's information you don't have right now and that's kind of holding you back from understanding what to do but as soon as you understand that you're you're you're on\nYou know you're on track and you'll get great result and this is what we do for everybody for virtually everything that they present with everything they come in with we teach them about why that is fair\nAnd then create the change in Korea to the improvement\nWell I'm I'm really find that I'm looking forward to me to do I am on a job because I Know why because I was on that last part I cannot tell you the whole thing\nOn my ... my energy level everything like that then I you know then they have a negative tell you everywhere I've been\nThroughout the world people have low carb diets\nYou know go all over Europe South America there's no garbage no junk food there's no bread and pasta and all this stuff and pizza all day long they may have some pasta it's organic and it's not GMO but everywhere you go people are eating better than Americans here is it just makes sense\nSo I think what happens is all the food companies try to influence people to eat all sorts of things\nAnd then people you know lose their track where are you from are you from here I'm\nFrom Orange County New York okay so realistically yeah yeah\nAnd I wonder what I Want to do I want to do a YouTube channel and I want to but I'm I'm I'm In the office and I'm going to put it out\nThere I sounds Great Hey look I Love it you know the more into it you get the better so I think is great for people to track\nTheir symptoms track their benefit I liked the whole idea of videotaping yourself for taking pictures of yourself whatever a combination of things makes you psychologically more into this I Love I think that's terrific\nWell I like to help other people as well but yeah a lot of course\nThey don't know we think oh my God I can never get my body back but it it I thought my body actually transforming\nOf course it was it sided with a main course where you can see what happens\nWhen you fix all the other things that you're on the whereabouts yet then you're really you know take off like a rocket yeah we'd love to help you I look forward to seeing you\nHave a wonderful day\nOkay from lines are open one eight hundred a parade WABC let's go to lose how are you\nHello yes how can I help you\nHigh I was wondering what your recommendation to offer low carb diet for vegetarians\nWell vegetarian ... not a oh don't have the same uh I guess freedom with low carb is just people who could also have a eggs or you know chicken or turkey or fish or et cetera\nSo I I think some of the better things for people that are vegetarian have will be lots of salads Coley flower broccoli as corrupt Cal Cal Robbie and there's lots of ways to make these things and I've been talking about this for so long\nNow but I'll tell ya I go to my mom's house and when we can see my parents and my nephew comes over my sister comes over we just make up these recipes will just take the zucchini slicing thing and you know make cars to key me into pasta\nAnd then cut that ... into appropriate size you know and then put a little olive oil and garlic and the pan you can put the zucchini in there you could put our trip carts little tomatoes you know you could put a ton of things in there that are all vegetables that are not\nProblematic for a vegetarian and the taste great now the other thing they talk about because it's also the new rage his Coley flower cauliflower is appeared on the scene\nEverywhere now you can take ... flower neither sauteed in the pan with garlic a novel or you can cut it up into what looks like rice and it's cold rice ... flower if you were to buy it\nIn a good market or a store and then you could also add things to dodge slices of almond artichoke hearts you can put different things in for flavoring tomatoes um [noise] you know the list goes on and on soy or some people like ... I mean there's so many things that you could do\nTo flavor and change the taste of that but also it gets filling you know you could make a good amount of it and it's almost like a whole meal in one\nYou know in one you know ... you could put nuts in it I mean the list goes on and on so those are two things that\nGet concern is that your parents need to get adequate protein and so many vegetarians or eat a lot of teams like lentils chick peas um whacking variety of things to\nTravel you can have some of those it's just that if you have too much it's going to make you produce too much insulin that is going to knock your sugar ain't gonna feel tired so you could have amounts of those I mean we have to look at your blood test and your hormone levels to determine and your exercise to determine how much of those\nYou know beans and rice or some of those things you can combined instill gain your results because the majority of people that I see\nHave anywhere between a hundred to two hundred or more grams of carbohydrate today and vegetarians typically do because they have fruit and they'll have grains and not have been cetera\nBut I'm not saying could never have lentils I'm not saying you could never have potatoes or yams squash is great of course that's for as low carb comparatively so we'd have to create a diet for you with the things that you like\nThat are vegetarian that are healthy for you but giving you enough variation so you're not you know getting tired of it but it is a little bit more work when you're a vegetarian to do low carb do you have eggs at all\nWhen yeah I'm not really a vegetarian I guess very concerned about me because of all the antibiotics that are\nMore antibiotics are arguing honestly antibiotics are probably the smallest competitive things that are in chicken and steak there Seventy five or more chemicals in stake\nIn the last time I looked fifty five or so in chicken so antibiotics part of it there are things that are um meant to keep the color of the meat looking good there are things that are meant to prevent ... I mean the list goes on and on and so ...\nAnd I feel like if I drive teams at least you kinda know what you're getting you know\nYou'd like to think so and I would say yes if you're getting organic but look there's research that says there's arsenic and rice and Apple's so you have to be very careful what you buy it where you buy it so it's a great point that you bring up you know we've got to really be specific and scrutinize the diet I mean it's one of the most important things we can do\nWhatever is in the water gets into the food so at the lower down on your hand train chain and the less adults are probably the better so that actually is meet with well I was really concerned with antibiotics and one on me but it's true they are all those other chemicals\nYeah you know what did they don't even have names for the chemicals now years ago I bought a book because it was very interesting to me um it was talking about all the chemicals in foods now you know what I'm\nNitrates are like metro civilians and bacon et cetera but the majority of things that are chemicals put into food have no names so it could be one to die mess all three episode blah blah blah blah\nYou know and it's got numbers and letters and and there's NO NAME that you could put a put to that but when a heated to X number of degrees temperature um it can be a toxic chemical or the book is written by Richard Lewis I forget the name but I think it's\nUm having something to do with chemicals in food so you could look up how many chemicals or beef or how many chemicals are in regular chicken you'd be surprised to see the numbers of of chemicals they're so yes you should eat organically and some people like to have organic eggs in the organic chicken in more often\nThan not those are the only protein they have in you know they're close to being vegetarian so they're happy it's whatever makes you happy and healthy\nYeah you just have to choose wisely\nLike the indigenous Indiana Jones movie you have to choose a chosen wisely so yeah it just makes sense you know what your life it's your health if you've got to do it if you don't you're you know you're missing the you're missing the boat but great question and comments thank you for your call\nOkay from mines rubber if you'd like to call and ask a question you could do so right now don't wait for them to the program wanting to underneath for eight WABC one hundred eighty four eight nine to two to once again if you'd like to look at the website WWW dot D. R. C. A. L. dot net [noise] um\nI think we have Seventeen or Eighteen videos on stem cell therapy there\nSix minutes to encourage a fourteen Seventeen we have a few more coming up within the next week I'm great information look at me I have two thousand articles\nUh up on the website and the articles are studies on different things\nUm sometimes I Wonder well how do they know what fluids here this year 'cause nobody knows yet\nAnd how do they have you know so many million bottles of flu shot to give people right you know and there are lots of types of ammonia so how many different types of ammonia might that you know more than ... pneumonia shot cover\nUm I'd rather get people to eat right exercise get their vitamin levels the perfect range you know get\nThem healthy otherwise right Adam Sandler do whatever you like you know I just would rather maximize your health and a ton of ways and get your healthy and most of my patients who have done that don't get sick don't get the colds don't get the flu don't get the things that a lot of\nPeople they're not as healthy get\nOther controversy about that about the er the hall and your vaccine as opposed to the slow\n[noise] well I think any of the vaccines can have side effects you could look that up easily you know on the Internet and there are some people that get the flu\nShot that even have a temporary ... a paralyzing disorder Guillain Barre syndrome I mean I think that a looming mercury there in the the vaccines has preservatives create problems\nSo I think you got to look at that and you could look up online how has the flu shot made housing pneumonia shot made what's in the ... you\nKnow you got to kind of you know be aware of that proactive yeah\nYeah the more you learn the better I mean knowledge is is the greatest thing on earth so the more knowledge you have the better I Would look it up how would you know type into Google how has the flu shot may once in a flu shot one of the side effects of flu shots same thing for pneumonia shot\nYou know okay thank you so much\nFor your call okay phone lines robot if you'd like to go now to ask a question don't wait for the end of the program are kind of moving towards that but we have some time we can take a bunch of calls so give us a call one eight hundred for eight WABC let's go next to Barbara Hi there how are you\nOkay you've got to count that great [noise] um [noise] I have to question I I have a a dermatologist one has had me taking ... theme more ice cap I thought because I had the sunk condition on my\nLower legs and I also have kids now have a funk okay and that seemed like it helped that it has cost me to have diary of which is on the side effects\nYeah any medication that causes diarrhea specially if it's meant to kill the fungus up bacteria or virus so that's not unusual so you might back down and do it a little bit less often so instead of every day you might do it every other day and see if the symptom goes away\nUm fungal organisms are hard to kill you know typically means your immune system is not you know strong in that area\nOf killing an organism that could very easily get to your skin between your toes fungal effects of the nails in the side of the legs as we get older are circulation changes and we're not getting a lot of good hot warm blood flow in with vitamins and minerals and hormones and immune response to our extremities that's why these things happen\nPeople that have diabetic if these things all the time because of its sugar floating around and that's what the fungal creatures love to live off of\nOkay I'd and fully aware of how much sugar on eating them tried any extreme careful\nYeah because while you're taking the medication to try to kill the bugs if you're eating a good amount of sugar your feeling about\nYeah OK and go potty thing half of eating a K ... take it one day but I'm I'm Wondering maybe they've broken half cake\nOr take it every other day huh just to see if you can minimize that symptom now I can tell you there's a whole host of the things that are supposed to be good for fungus and you know I've had patients that have come and they tell me all sorts of things and that could work to some people have used all of oregano in their toenails\nOf course it might work and I've seen people that said it cleared up their fungal infection they didn't use the anti fungal course just walk around somebody like a pizza but that's okay\nAh there are other people that use a coconut oil that might use ti tree oil you know there are lots of different non medication and things that people have tried and I'm not saying you can't try that you just gotta look at you know some research just to see that there is something that says you know we did a study and we saw that this product\nHelpless fungal infection of the nails rub the skin mhm\nOkay I Will die it's more important than you realize how would we really tight with the diet and get rid of the ...\nOkay I Will say the ... tomorrow and I should ask an interest in a different ... he would recommend\nOr you could I think he should have a great conversation with any doctor you have and I think everybody should have great conversations with their doctor not be afraid to ask something say hey this will give me a diary I couldn't do it every other day for a few days or is there a different pill that I can take or is there a different way to do it one of the drugs it's used as ... and then typically came in the pack\nWhere'd you use it you know for a week and then you're off for three weeks and use it for a week again offer for three weeks so you know there are different ways to do that and the doctor could explain that to you\nOkay I Am taking my I I tried to take several times a day just\nGood that makes us if I have a pet can ask another question sure um I had a blood allergy test\nOr six years ago and it showed that was a vegetarian [noise] um do you recommend having a allergy casts every so often because yes she ...\nHer body can change the number one and when you avoid certain things your body will decrease the antibody binding to them but other things can pop up down the road and we've seen people that have allergies you know\nEither genetically or they're allergic constitution or you know some people a year to year they weren't allergic to something before now there are large something that they had met him probably before your body changes and I don't really love the blood test for allergy because the blood test is only looking\nAt a little bit of blood that goes into the needle into the two or three or four seconds so that can tell you every antibodies floating around in all of your body that's why they have false negative results with blood tests and ... tests on a forum or the back\nYou can have false negatives where you're just scratching the surface of the skin or breaking the surface of the skin and you're not really meeting the antibodies a little bit deeper into the gold standard has always been injured during will test\nWhere you take a small needle and raise the little we'll little liquid bumping your skin and you wait Fifteen minutes to see if it reacts so not only can we we only doing traditional really\nBut if the first skin test is negative you might put a second or third dose on and if all three are negative your negative for the second one's positive you're positive so that might be a food that you would have water that might be an allergy and that you do do sensitization for me to it\nAt the answer terminal test is that this is great for one food at a time\nYou couldn't put five or ten different foods on your arm you put one tiny dose of each of those things and see if you react if you do that than you might put a second dose on but whatever you react to even if we have a tiny dose on which has diluted four times from a concentrate we get for the manufacturers so it's very weak we obviously want to start\nShe was a very weak does cause I don't know how large of people are until you start looking but if you're after the first dose you gotta pick up food out as a positive\nOh how many how often do you recommend celebrity every two years or something\nYou know I Would ... it also depends upon symptoms some people that take a handful of foods out they have no symptoms are doing great you may not do it for a few years but people that case would come back and say it's for the year and I have some stomach issues you know we might we test\nIt really depends upon patients presentation everything depends upon what you say when we sit down and ...\nYou know whenever I Want you to keep a good list a running list of your symptoms and if you're avoiding the food or how much better you feel you bring it back in you know a month or two later close to the prom and take it back out again you bring it back in two months later and you don't have in Nebraska reaction but every once a week now more than twice a week so there there's\nA whole conversation went up about this phrase thank you for cold you drink you're listening God Bless you all\nAre the phone number for the Garden City

I I Want to know\nWhat was the source of us run you spoke about lovable a mother for a child you also have a love of God to me about where you found that in the strength to go against you it was ... it was an uphill battle\nTo keep the war against you they were saying come on ... you know uh you're you're fighting the wrong plight but you would do\nMy own community was\n... was was not sure that was the road to take ... but I knew I had a very clear vision I'm very very very clear vision and that came from my parents\nCame from my upbringing we were raised in a home with ... clarity my father told us every single night truth\nSchools that we work with are changing policies and procedures to be more appropriate for the times that we live in\nUm there's no quick fix there's no one answer to your question and I don't know what our guards would have done a I don't know that that the solution um I don't know that an armed guard a solution\nCertainly that the school of thought that says that if there was someone there with a gun maybe they would have put this mad man down\nMaybe not for cops were shot in the process when they got their writer so highly skilled\nI think that we all have to a review policies and procedures we all have to uh use companies like TNN than others who are expert in helping a organizations in schools and institutions been through this problem\nBut there's a peer review aspect of what's happening now and what might change what about what might get ...\nBut it's certainly not a quick fix that but it's certainly not something that any one person or today after\nYou know I I agree with you would uh personally you or I Know a very close to to the police are both on a local and national level I cannot say enough about police who ran into that same story to confront the government and yeah I mean they were hurt certainly\nYeah certainly are those are officers an all law enforcement officers across the country are expected to go into harm's way and to confront an active shooter you can't wait any more you have to go in\nAnd then why pd which you just mentioned for whom I have the utmost respect\nOr as changed their strategy now than or hundreds of additional officers with long done with a ballistic vest to be able to confront\nA exactly the type of Mad Men that are the synagogue met in squirrel ill\nWhen someone has a moving on and they are Fifteen automatic rifle I mean and the person who was the guard doesn't have the kind of sophisticated sophisticated equipment is pretty difficult\n[noise] yeah I mean it is difficult although ... if you get an opportunity and you're carrying a handgun you certainly can take a guy like that down\nBut that's a that's\nA very lucky eventuality in you know there's some evidence that a place I read about it I've know inside information that ah this gentleman had been at seeing what's going on there and conducted from surveillance\nI don't know I mean it's certainly possible that at all with a handgun to take down someone with a A R Fifteen but you have to get extraordinarily lucky and you have to be in the right place at the right time and you have to hope that he or she is not bad enough that they kill you first\nI think what you are\nTalking about earlier is there's no simplistic solution but all of us have a responsibility to do whatever we can to protect one another so that every public place every leader has to ask\nHave we've taken the necessary precautionary measures knock that you know their foolproof not to the guaranteed but at least we have to be able to answer your question have we done everything humanly possible to protect people\nAnd that that's done in consultation with professionals like you that's in consultation with a local precinct and you know that NYPD use is only ... not just here in New York City but in other borrows another counties they're ready to come forward and and sit and meet with\nUh all kinds of no official all kinds of leaders and say let's design a strategy that works best for you because not only striving for everyone\nThere's no question that anti Semitism is on the rise but this is a problem in Las ... this is a problem in church is this is a\nProblem in all houses of worship and\nEvery leader in all of those communities needs to take time now to figure out what they're doing is it effective at what more they can do to keep their congregation safe and\nWe you know I've got lots of calls on the last twenty four hours and\nThe best recommendation I have is let companies like TNN peer review what it is that you're doing with your existing security consultant a fresh set of eyes a fresh perspective Ken Ollie increase and enhance the safety posture\nAnd the security posture of your congregation and I think it's a good time to bring in the best security consultant is you know non us take a look\nRobert when you began your career or in a tea and um did you ever think it would come a day when people would ask you how do I protect the sanctuary how do I protect a house of worship ...\nSomeone said to me yesterday the words synagogue shooting should not be said in the same sentence you shouldn't have to say that\nAnd the fact that we're talking about it today after such a tragedy and Pennsylvania is really sickening to me um and I know sickening to uh all American and really the entire world is mourning for the people of scroll hill\nSo we're going to ...\nI Know that uh some of us who are rabbis or going out to uh to Pittsburgh uh to to be with the families to bring some comfort constellation\nWhich you know or maybe the most important words also for the day after what are we going to do the day after and this requires a real serious\nDetermination to do more than we've been doing because uh we we just have to exhaust every possible having you and you know we use ... we don't have all the answers\nAre as soon as it comes to security were Neal fights and that's where we have to turn to those people like you who are so skilled uh and so knowledgeable in this area it may be together we can make it better or again realizing it may not be\nYou know it it may not be the ultimate solution but at least it's a solution that is better than what we had before\nAs you said rabbi the local police are here to help you state police are here to help you the FBI is here to help you\nAnd and security companies like Tana protection resources or you know help you but there's a lot of people in this fight and they're all willing to help you got to ask and you got to do now is the best time to do it because\nTo be honest with you a sadly this will probably not be the last time we talk about a tragedy like this in a house of worship\nIt's happened before it happened a at a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAnd sadly ah it'll happen again and you really have to make sure\nThat you've done everything it possibly can to prevent that from happening in your house or\nI Hope this is not the new norm by the way I Know you're involved with cyber security\nAnd the previous guest about how ... was talking about some of the ugliness on some of the sites they hate field sites\nUm and it seems whenever someone who's apprehended would never do a you know a search of computers and find out what's ISIS person visited there usually sites that just\nA a replete with hatred of people and maybe we ought to look at that as well are there not boundaries that we need to have maybe we need to reexamine legalities of all list maybe we're a little too permission maybe we shouldn't allow all of this stuff\nTo get out there uh and maybe that will save some life as well\nYeah you don't need to change the laws to do social media monitoring it's a very effective tool we offer it at the end them and when you think that for most of the threats are most of the threats not all of the threat\nYou could very effectively monitor the dark Web and some of these hate filled Web sites and you could see that threat coming before ...\nWell well Robert Tucker to them protection resources thank you so much you you're a you're a great friend I I I celebrated or your daughters about Mr with you and you know there's a lesson that no matter what occurs we're gonna continue to live we're gonna continue to love we're not going to stop the celebrations of life\nWe're not going to allow hate markers or to have his hide a as faith loving people is Jewish people no matter what the faith is are we going to return to the places that we love the people that we love and to hopefully be get again\nThanks rabbi thanks to you and all the things you do it the Gore to rabbis that deep condolences are from me and my family and the ten of protection resources family two of the affected people in scroll hill\nThank you so much Robert ... stay tuned for more a religion on the line\nFor celebrating thirty five years in on the line on seventies W. A. B. C.\nBut you know it's also what are we going to do to make things better I just had Robert Tucker on our good friend Rebecca ... on earlier\nAnd she says and he said you know we can monitor sites we we know you know where some of the heat is on line and we have to do more to investigate those sources because a lot of people are influenced by\nWe have a we have a situation here are portion as we used to say when we were together the Christian portion today or gospel was a a a ... bought him a is asking Jesus please help me to see an end and Jesus gives him his psych back\nAnd I wonder if we're ready now as a nation to say give us our site help us to realize that\nThe the ... the well it is complicity but the duality in which we've presented people as either good or bad eyesight is right or wrong and both sides are involved in this so I'm not looking for a political debate here\nBut but the Savage re that has become the the place of the marketplace of America the marketplace of ideas we need to open our eyes and begin to see that the other may be different but it's not demonic\nAnd and and I think we create these uh these these uh I'm\nI'm trying to think of the word with is that the shoulders with columns\nIs that does that the right word yeah you know we create these columns who come out and the ... and then they destroy it and they fueled by the by the pain and the struggle and the diversity and the pay ... and I'm studying Joe forgive me I'm I'm really I'm sort of out of my element I I I Can't wrap my head around this\nOil and and something you said it's a very important that we have extremes on both sides mhm you know I Know there is very comfortable for some to point the accusatory finger at the other without looking within\nWe all have a responsibility I don't care if you're the president I don't care if you're the press will make it doesn't matter everybody in this together because you and I know we all share with children God we all have the same spiritual birth certificate\nBut by God we can't allow this to continue we have to just say you know as faith leaders as people of conscience we're better than this this is not who we are but unless we come forward and do more than this will continue\nAnd I think it's important now that the ministers and and rabbis and priests and deacons in an e moms and and all the people who proclaimed to speak for God or with God we need to stand up and say now is the time to say enough or if we don't\nWe're going to have more horror stories were going to have more discussions like this and we're going to start to worry about what has happened to our country or the idea that that we could consider that we need solutions that we need armed guards in places of worship what has happened to us\nYou know Robert said rubber Tucker said\nEven the phrase synagogue shooting is something if it's jarring mean who would've ever thought we'd be speaking about the sacred space being invaded by I hate longer\nWealth that we we need to come together ... you know it sounds so saccharin over the last decade every harsher you and I shared and we've we've spoken about it but\nNow my ... my my question is if we don't do something now when will it and and how will it and uh it seems like the societies is beginning to to fray unravel and unless all people of good will stand up we will be or we will continue to be ...\nI think there is a willingness a a strong willing as my faith leaders to come together and just say look we may not have the answers but let's ask the questions and by asking questions maybe we'll find some of the answer is I have to tell you something that move me today\nI was a template manual this morning a it was a showman the police a honor people for their for their courage\nAnd when I left the temple I Walk around the corner is simply manual on Fifth Avenue sixty fifth I Walk around the corner and they're a group\nOf homeless people waiting in line uh to get food to get comfort at temple Emanuel\nAnd I was talking to one of the the homeless individuals and he said something to me that was really so so special we said you know sir we knew\nThe temple would not be closed today in spite of what happened yesterday ... temple would not be closed today\nAnd isn't that a reassuring message that hate mortgage will not stop us from conducting services from celebrating all of our religious traditions or as members of the tradition\nOr they're not going to do it maybe they think they're going to do it but I meet people who are determined uh to continue to to live with coverage with commitment or they're not going to let these terrorists have their way\nWe don't we talk about prayer but prayer in action has to go hand in hand so we continue to pray but we must do something and and what if that means that community reaches out to a to a Jewish community Christian can be reached out to a Jewish community and\nThey share a meal they they they share a lecture they they share time we we do that with the the mosque and and and and the Christians who fight all the time began to stop fighting with each other correct Catholics [laughter] we could have just right and left Catholics come together but it's\nHighly thank thankfully we Jews don't have those issues not just that we're in full agreement all the time\nYou know Joe ... it was very important I thank you for letting me come on I Know we're coming to the end of the segment but ah I miss you and I especially today I I did feel a sense that we were together and it's a it's an honor to be with you\nYou can ... your family is my family right ah and we've we've been together for a sad occasion celibate ... uh but the key part of it is we've been together\nAnd I think we're going to emerge from this in some way but we can only emerged from this in a meaningful way if we do it together all people of faith one family and have you so much deacon Kevin McCormick thank you
