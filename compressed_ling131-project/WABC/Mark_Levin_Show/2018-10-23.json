about it as migrants hair medicine mentioned yesterday is now approaching the American border with presumably the help of the Mexican government you can see the Mexican authorities are driving alongside the caravan\nIt is now ten thousand people large and it's moving towards more now there are processing for asylum in the United states all you have to just go to the U.S embassy in why\nOr you can go to a border checkpoint and apply it can see the pictures if you're if you're able to watch this and because you subscribe to daily where it I Can't even see the pictures I mean these are these are marching stretching the mile long\nHen wide is an enormous enormous number of people well President Trump and he got himself into trouble yesterday because he said listen\nThere's some bad people who are coming in this in this case right now or they're bad people coming into care about who the hell knows the answer is we don't know the answer that presumably some of those people are bad presumably many of those people are not bad but the answer is we don't know who they are so how can we possibly open are born this way\nWhat's happening right now as a large group of people they caught a caravan\nJar of it do you have some very bad for you you have some very bad for you [noise] and we can't let that happen to our country\nOkay so you know he he's made me write maybe he's wrong but we don't know now with the left proclaims that we should let all of these people and presumably but then why not letting the next ... does everyone who wants to come to the United states because they're coming from a bad situation to have the right to come into the United states\nNow I Am pretty libertarian when it comes to people who are immigrating for employment reasons is why I think that we ought to lead and more people for legal immigration methods in the United states but let's recognize something the social structure of the United states is not the same\nIn two thousand Eighteen as it was in Nineteen oh seven the reason I use Nineteen Seventy that's when my ancestors dot here the comparison here is not between the ethnicity the folks showing up I don't care about ethnicity I really don't it makes no difference to me\nThe question is what is the social system that people are being integrated into when my great great grandparents got in the United states when they got here in Ninety seven and they arrived on the boats they spoke it had no money and there was no social safety net they're immediately thrust into a capitalist economy where they had to learn English\nAnd they had that they were forced by circumstance into assimilating specifically\nThat they could operate in the economy of the United states become good American citizens there are people who left behind in their home country to come to the United states that they could actually\nLive a better more adventurous life now I think a lot of immigrant still aren't that but in fact we have a social thing you know the picks up after everybody the fact that if you have a baby in the United states that baby is now an American citizen and you can take advantage of all the benefits of American citizenship that there are all these you know tremendous social safety net metals you means we have to be\nA little bit more circumspect about who we let in the country\nAnd again citing the and the navy and country the Scandinavian countries are really tough on immigration and they shouldn't be because the richer your social safety net the more folks are going to wants to take advantage of it\nAnd let's not pretend that there is no anti American sentiment in this in his Caribbean\nThey're clearly it it can look at some of the pictures I took some of the folks who are who are marching were carrying the Honduran flat and this one I Believe is actually from Honduras ... let's go back to a hundred and five one so you can see at the front of this march there are people who are carrying the hunter and flat\nNow claim the caravan is that these are people who are attempting to escape from Honduras endorses a bad place right it's a place where they can't live the life\nThey want to live at the place of little economic opportunity so why are you carrying the flag of that place when Cuban refugees got on the nineteenth a Chevy inflated the tires and tried to look their way to Florida they weren't carrying a Cuban flag when they arrived on American shores they were trying to escape Cuba that was sort of the point\nIf you were marching from Honduras to escape Honduras why are you coming here with Honduran flat\nWhen my ancestors dot here they weren't hearing a Russian or lithuanian flat and they came to the United states ready to carry an American flag is appalling ... this idea that you can simulate all cultures including people forcibly do not want to be assimilated\nIn a social safety net society is just not accurate and yet that's what Democrats continue to promote\nIt over and Honduras by the way in support of the migrants have been burning American flag then why do folks want in America's Nazi Germany is not really a great pitcher as you I also want to

this is not rhetorical what's going on with the president and his grip on reality loosening\nThis as a base election and it's a fair election why\nIs Donald Trump so frightened wisely so scared why

give you some perspective here this so called national emergency actually really represents about point zero six percent of all the undocumented people already in this country that we're talking about a very small fraction of people here by the president is hoping that this isn't wings riding the same shot his\nIs a news reporter this is the White House correspondent at the senior White House correspondent for ABC News good morning America\nGo ahead\nAnd the White House for help Republicans an engine in in terms of that strategy is stoking fears about immigration\nThere you go this is also an attack on New Year's eve because you're so stupid\nThat the president is able to cause you to be fearful and scared\nYou're so stupid you can't process what's actually taking place\nAnd besides it totally zero point zero six percent of all undocumented people already in this country the irony is that there's so many illegal aliens in this country seven thousand or whatever the numbers marching to our southern border to this reporter simply no big deal\nPeter Alexander I\nKnow the White House correspondent this time on the today show that would be NBC had tipped newscasters cut three go\nYes you're right I mean what's striking here as the economy is strong unemployment is low but instead of talking about his achievements these days the president really is leaning into this message of ...\nOut of fear stop this was another journalist so instead of talking about the economy which of course the ...\nYou never talk about instead of talking about the economy which the media could care less about the president is stoking he's a he's leaning into his message of fear\nNot law and order remind you of course it is law and order but it's fear UC go ahead\nArgument focuses on stoking fears of illegal immigration MS Thirteen shadowy Middle Eastern\nSide just wait a minute I happen to live in a community where MS Thirteen is a huge problem\nMaybe these people don't\nBut I miss Thirteen is a huge and going ... in a lot of states in metropolitan areas it's no joke\n\nIt ten minutes Thirteen that's stokes fear not the president of the United states\n\nGo ahead that's what he's been trying to do recently to try to motivate his base of support his voters ...\nSee it's all about motivating you because you see ladies and gentlemen unless you are absolutely emotionally out of your mind you're not going\nTo vote you're not going to vote\nAnd yet is not immigration a key issue is it not an important issue it may not be an important issue\nTo phony journalists to phony anchors to phony hosta phony reporters but it is an important issue to men and women who go to work every day try to raise their families and live in communities that are exposed to this\nIt is the people who break their ass everyday paying their property taxes and in some states where we have income taxes most states and so much of that money goes to individuals who are here illegally\n\nIt matters to people who are construction workers it matters to people who are truck drivers in taxi drivers it matters to people who work with their hands many people who work with their hands none of these reporters work with their hands at least not above the table\n\nGo ahead I'm across from winning back the house or the Senate or voters obviously what's crucial that circumstance here is that the president recognizes that he is up against the wall right here this is a reporter\n\nNow Gloria borders on CNN Today utterly and completely predictable\n\nBut we need to hear from Gloria border because she's on CNN all the time for it go\nYou know I'm old enough to remember twenty sixteen [laughter] this is this is why they\nKeep bringing up many of them twenty sixteen because they believe it was an illegitimate election I all of us stupid people who came out and voted for Trump because we're racists where Xena folks were home of ... and on and on and on just notice how they keep\nTrashing you even more than Trump it's you\nThis is twenty sixteen all over again and their legitimate election illegitimate as you look at this look at the race made it look what's going on race baiting\nYou have thousands of people\nWho've told us what they plan to do marching to our border there from Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala and other countries not race baiting gr identify\n\nRace baiting is what we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings\nBy the left the Democrats and the media go ahead\nAnd Republicans are feeling good because if you start with Kavanaugh\nThen you ... you know something switched after Kavanaugh\nThe president is now on the campaign trail rally and ... and getting them out to vote and you see in the poll numbers that suddenly Republican voters are all lost as energizes Democrats not quite but all of his energizes Democrats wearables as before this before this fear mongering\nThe before this fear mongering Kavanaugh however we fear monitor and how's the president's fear mongering now\nHe's plain spoken just like Harry Truman he's explaining what's taking place\n\nThere is an invasion taking place seven thousand people who wish to come across the border illegally without you call it a parade\n\nGo ahead and they were like okay I'm going to sit at home and what Trump is doing is getting them out and vote by telling them if you don't
