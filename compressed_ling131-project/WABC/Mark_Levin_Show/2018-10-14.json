FBI investigations that\nWe'll see what comes out which means he was suggesting if something came out he would have thrown him out so everybody was waiting to see this\nBut we have a system here where if you are innocent until proven guilty if you don't like it that's then you move to another country that's the due process system that\nIs what is the foundation of our legal system and we see this constantly I'm Talking the worst of the worst were put on trial you have to say even though you know a hundred percent they did it\nWell they allegedly did this now there are questions about that FBI investigation that I even have why certain people were not interviewed but you know what I see a lot of trials where there's questions about an investigation and maybe people are unhappy with the N verdict\nBut you have to respect the system\nAnd what the system said was he was still innocent and he was not proven guilty and so because that's the situation there was really no grounds to withdraw his nomination\nAnd what's ironic about the whole thing is that despite if you're a democratic or Republican the law is impartial bowl law stayed the same and you're hoping that when he goes to the Supreme Court I Believe you started this past week that he's going to look at the law and have that be impartial whenever\nHe handles any does it so the take away on America's thank God for our legal system because of treats\nEveryone fairly or it's supposed to exactly great now how do we turn this into a conversation about our show because we're all about business\n[noise] well I had a question for you as you were talking about it does the party line\nApply to companies that's a great question Jesse looked the company line because the concept is similar there are definitely Jesse party lines in companies but with a vast difference ... the number one difference\nI could tell you as amazing styles beautiful fabrics beautiful silhouettes\nYou should really look for them you can find an explorer I could tell his latest collection that I could tell you a dot com\nOr visit the flagship store at Nineteen sixty five Madison Avenue in Manhattan awkward tell you a Q.

A. where ever the weather goes they will take you made in Italy and waterproof the best combination\nWelcome back and say here's your house mark whoever [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know this is more wherever I'm thinking about a lot tonight that has to do with the\nParty of the company line what do you say we think about I tell you what I've been thinking about I wanted to talk about the company line for brands started thinking about which brands that I Would\nTalk to you about tonight thought about Calvin Klein great advertising right now we're product thought about Louis Vuitton form a home thought about your because they have a lot going on I even thought about Nike\nBut I'm going to surprise you I Want to talk about\nDunkin' Donuts because they were in the news this week Dunkin' Donuts is changing their name really let's hear Dunkin' Donuts commercials\nTo make them sound can donuts are only fresh [noise] I may have do we make them at least twice a day to make the fuel guidance like supermarket [noise] I Can't make it down [laughter] [noise] so it was\nSo new doughnuts and doughnuts think about how important donut saw Dunkin' Donuts so important that Dunkin' Donuts just change their name to Dunkin\nCrazy right I think that is the worst decision I've ever heard let's talk about it caught my attention and I thought it was worthy of talking about is considering we talk about brands\nDuncan I don't drink coffee in fact\nHe is an interesting thing that most people will never be able to say I never even tasted\nCoffee but I'm told that Dunkin' Donuts has great coffee and therefore\nThe name Duncan I suppose Dunkin' Donuts stock is performing very well they're particularly strong in the restaurants sector compared to all the competitors now why they streamline the product offerings stores easy\nAnd an advocate and walk through in the vitamin in and out quickly\nLots of advertising value pricing it always works giving the consumer\nLower prices and they have great tasting doughnuts and great coffee however thinking the company line you know build its own ever forget the company\nIs all in its name and then name\nOver the door now is no longer going to be Dunkin' Donuts it don't get to emphasize the coffee and downplay who they are\nThere a new company line in that store Duncan now let's not talk Duncan any more about the fried dough round\nThings we make infused with sugar so fattening you can pay them right on your hips your thighs or you know what let's forget we're helping America become obese\nWhere Duncan now the new company line I think it may work PS did\nAnybody ever notice the nobody's talking about crispy cream anymore you mean crispy cream\nOh yeah that's really cool crispy cream is the one that Governor Chris Christie graded beset true now but that's that was a funny guy made a well\nApparently donuts do work anymore and for good reason but I was fascinated by the fact that Duncan\nChange their name and the subject of company lied or the party line nothing angers me more than the company line when it's a load of bologna the spin the spin when it comes to the companies to talk about JC penny\nJC penny is in trouble one of the world's largest greatest longstanding retailers may not make it their value is down by Ninety five percent no one to tell you\nAbout JC penny because I Know a lot about it I'll never forget I was a young man being told them going into my first JC penny meeting in New York\nWalk this is a very very important to count to us we do a hundred million dollars with a wow that's a lot of business yeah they're unimportant again\nSo I went into the meeting a live forget guys just heading up the meeting wanted to make a point and he said hello guys I wanted to start with a story about JC penny that's actually John Cash petty\nThe founder of the company and it turned out to be remarkable story\nAnd he said\nAs folklore with a habit when John Cash penny interviewed someone for an important job and his company he took them to lunch\nWhile you might ask during lunch she would observe them when they ordered the food and the food came to the table he watched\nIf someone would sold their food before they tasted it he wouldn't hire them because he felt the pre judge the food and he didn't want executives pre judging the decisions that needed to be made he wanted thoughtful well thought out people\nThat's the way the meeting began and then of course he said that's the way we want to be with you we want to make sure that you understand the kind of company we are\nJC penny in the early days was one of the first direct to consumer retailers they were on the Internet before there was an Internet it was called a catalog\nBefore rented it catalogs with the way more people marketed directly to consumers you would send a book out with pictures in items to their home\nDetermine what if anything they want it to purchase make a phone call to the company tell them what they wanted to buy give them the credit card and the merchandise we'd be shipped to the home it wasn't the Internet but they were there one of the first\nCatalogs she she petty business was a billion dollars JC penny was a remarkable retailer we\nYou'd business with everyone but JC Penney's to head and heels above them why you might ask\nFirst and foremost JC penny cared about their quality this was a throwback to John ... he felt that quality was more important than anything\nThey were fanatical about quality they tested fabric they tested seems they tested the garment constructions to fit\nWashing everything they were extraordinary in their devotion to quality so when people bought something a JC penny it performed well unless the\nJC penny started building their own private labels you've seen prodded labels everywhere you go John Nordstrom in nordstroms bill it has um oh Daniel Cuomo Macy's all funny they will have their own stores\nAnd their own brands and those stores JC penny was one of the first to develop private label Stafford St john's bay Arizona genes extraordinary private labels only because first and foremost\nYou were talking about everything in the minimum do we do retail\nWas a hundred million five hundred million dollars to these labels\nShe take into consideration that they were building brands within their own four walls\nThey cared a great deal about product and they recognize how important a fashion was JC penny had it all they had a price the head of vision\nBad quality and they had the right fashion so fast forward Thirty years later for CEOs later they no longer have\nA catalog\nTheir brands private brands are no longer as strong they tried some national brands and have done as well\nToasts a strong word I think you're responsible\nTo have the company line in your head in your heart at all times you're being paid it's an obligation to brilliant idea one year\nThat I decided to support the New York Yankees and I put a billboard in Yankee Stadium right in centerfield told the story before and if anybody's interested right the station and remind me I'll tell you the story again as to why I did it was a marketing genius move I thought\nComing with that we had seats front row seats five years I was there in the center field in Yankee Stadium in five years out of these front row seat but part of it was each season I Would take two of the bigger boxes upstairs that were combined together and fight or employees there\nEveryone was offered an opportunity to come we took it for two days there was a group there was often for first day we had four hundred people in New York office or four hundred were invited\nAnd the purpose was to show them how smart we were being affiliated with the New York Yankees house smart we are as a company and how much we value the people that worked for us\nGreat food great beer everything flowing\nI'll never forget one of the sharpest young ladies in the retail sector came over to me one of these functions\nDrunk as could be\nShe knew that I hold her liquor and apparently it's not the first time she's done this\n... you\nKnow first of all I said just said you have to know how to behave because it's really not a party don't get drunk you'll never live with them and I went and sat outside and sure enough to get to sit down and started bad mouthing the people she worked for\n[noise]\nThere's a lesson here is why I'm telling you this story\nBe smart talking party line parties are not parties that are there for you to be smart at one of the great story to tell you and um\nIt's more uplifting than that one but that might be the most important lesson [noise] when I was a ph Venus and we're conglomerate and in Nineteen Ninety Ninety One don't hold me\nWe recorded off first billion dollars a year\nIt was an amazing accomplishment when I started with the company will never forget it was a public company we're doing about two hundred million and here we are doing a billion dollars in sales\nWas nice about all the time one of the founding families Larry Philips Philips Venus was the c._e._o. my closest friend with the time was the president\nAnd I was the president the shirt division at the time and we had a an amazing opportunity to celebrate to a billion dollars also at the time there were six living former presidents of the Venus insurance company\nI spoke with the head of marketing at the time and I said why don't we do something special you had a great idea should celebrating an American company in America and New York what do we take a cruise boat\nAround New York and celebrate great idea\nGreat idea we invited four hundred people to one of those crews boats with a number of floors\nHe said he even had an ... another incredible idea not just fireworks at sundown during the day the party started about four o'clock and went to eat or not I don't recall he hired a\nJet planes\nWhich guy riding it's a congratulations menus Mazie night\nI was very ... because I made the decision to fight all the presidents the former presidents and have them have an opportunity to speak\nAnd those most grateful to have the first president I ever worked for a man named ... who set the role model for me of learning how to speak present without notes I learned how to do it because of him when I saw him speak up\nThey should something very interesting I never forgot he must have been in his mid to late seventies at the time and when he stood up and said I Want to thank you for inviting me\nYou don't know what it's like how good it feels to be remembered unlike that\nEveryone made a speech and I made a speech all the division presidents the c._e._o. everyone made a speech celebrating\nOur ... our night for each one billion dollars\nAt while it was a party why we're there to celebrate there was only one reason really\nWe were there\nTo share with the troops to share with the associates to share with the employees\nWhat a wonderful opportunity and what a wonderful company than using was at that time\nShe'll even go under the heading of celebration even though it was a party was only one reason to be that the party line this is a great company\nYou can have a great future you too can be one of the president's you two could be standing up here and making speeches when we reached two billion dollars\nIt's never party but it has a party line but that I'll be back in a moment\n[noise] always aims fashion she says you have this you have ...

hundred a furry WABC one eight hundred a for a dime to to do and will catch a cold right up on the air secular consumer great research\nRather than be twelve supplementation benefit type two diabetic now of course\nThis will benefit everybody be twelve or something you buddy meets everywhere but you need to be able to convert B. twelve from regular B. twelve high ... into muscle ... that's the active form that can get into your cells and create result lower homeless esteemed which can cause plaque and your blood vessels\nIt's also great for energy it's also important to convert into a pseudo calling which is one of the more important brain neurotransmitters your brain chemicals\nSo when we see people in the office that come in that are tired and their groggy or they say they have brain fog you know very common presentation by the way\nWhen we look in their blood tests and look at the genetic marker if they don't have the normal gene if they have a defect in the gene\nThey can't convert B. twelve then that's a major reason why they're homeless esteem by their heart risk is higher and they don't have energy or they don't have the brain function they should so corrupting mess will be twelve makes a difference of the world the way that we do that typically is with nothing will be twelve shot\nWhich would give you a nice dose it goes into the muscle like a little shot and tear on your rear end and people will typically report wow I Can't believe how good I feel\nYou don't really see that with people taking sibling will be twelve they say well I take the sibling will and I'll tell them maybe you're not absorbing that or maybe the dosage just not\nBig enough maybe need to take more or maybe you need to do the shot and while they're in the office will say hey

open if you'd like to call induced so now one eight hundred aid for re WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two two will catch up on the air so um this past week and I didn't mention it last week on the radio program I was invited down to go to Miami\nTo be part of an uh an amazing new big TV series me of all people so uh it's called paper empire it's going to be a blockbuster TV series the plot is terrific it's about um\nIndividual who is a manipulating in like a Ponzi scheme manipulating\nThe or this market that's the that's a investment market with these new types of a a big point is that so it's a it's a great dramatic a series and the people that star in the series\nOne is Robert ... who's an unbelievable actor and he's been around for years he was in the James Bond movie license to kill many other things\nBut I met him in a spent the day with him he's just a terrific guy also goes round singing it's got an unbelievable voice and he sings Sinatra music uh Denise stretches of course everybody knows who's a that is drugs veto of course he's also a local New Yorker\nOr Steve Gutenberg a variety of people that you've seen before and faces you've seen before belly McNamara Michael Nouri so\nI was asked to come down to play a doctor in a a scene where prison inmate overdose too so I had to buy lab cut on perform CPR in cetera and the scene involves a person dying and going into out of body experience and then coming back and\nThere were ... so it was kind of funny to watch and see how it's done and uh even to be\nPart of the discussion of how it would look and what would be the right way it would be done so I had a wonderful time in a some of the production people uh and the producers are ... are becoming ... wonderful people and just great to spend time with but nobody realizes that that one five minute scene or ten minutes seem that\nYou see on TV or in a movie may take six hours to shoot\nNobody would realize that in that unless you were in the business so when they want to redo the scene and make it come out perfectly in some instance here just that if they're in\nA while it was just amazing to see and there's so many people behind the camera to make it all work and you know you you never really think of those people but there's someone ... controlling the temperature the lighting the sound all of it says a hundred people behind that camera in that view that you see so it's pretty amazing to\nTo be part of it so I'm very very thankful I'm also spent on my sister her kids are ... and a little ... and my sisters gorgeous little doggie a Fox a slash rat terrier so we had a couple of days down there\nDo like I say people you should try to find it to other things if you can if you could opportunities do some things that are different experience\nOh I can it's always amazing to me to see how things were done in a business or in a process that I just don't know anything about\nBut great to uh to be part of that so I'll give you a little more open coming in for when it's coming out on TV but write it down to take a look for paper empire it's going to be a terrific series\nOkay front lines are open if you'd like to go and do so now let's go to Judith in Jackson Heights how are you\nTaking my call I had three years ago I had Thatcher open heart surgery but I think part of having now going back over past experience I kept ... stress pain fight back pain\nAnd I'm Wondering if I got to have pain management\nCats had them if they're if\nThey got to get a we want with it if you're having back paying back pain can come from many things that can come from muscle spasms and putting pressure on the nerve route it can come from degeneration of the disks of course it can come from degeneration of the bone in some women over time as the hormones of decline for a while they can end up with\nOsteoporosis and even compression fractures dinner forks and that's a little bit more rare but I think the first thing to do\nAnd it depends upon what your insurance company would require is needed to do an X ray to look at the spacing of the vertebrae but more likely an MRI because that'll tell us about all the tissue connective tissue ligament tandem cartilage disc bone and made it gives us an entire picture of your back\nSome before trying to use something to treat it or to block the symptom you really have to know what's going on there and I say this for all symptoms\nThat people have so you have to have some clear information as to exactly what they're being in my residency many years ago New Jersey\nAnd the gentleman had back pain and rip pain and uh it wouldn't go away and the doctors are saying oh here take the painkiller take the paint or it ended up being strangely enough that he had a bone cancer that went into the vertebrae into his room I had been a smoker for just a year\nAnd that was a lung cancer that was caused by smoking he was just smoking for one year\nAnd this is what popped up so of course using those medications was a bad idea because it sort of blocked the ability to have that evaluation done you know\nSo what kind of tactics like out of town\nWell any doctor can do an X ray or recommend an X ray your ... your primary care doctor can be so it's not a primary care\nI have a a fair arthritis in my neck and I've had a faint back surgeries are at my lower back up our area at a I have a cat or a testing but I've had that for a while [laughter] hey that's\nAnd the research on stem cell therapy goes back well over a hundred years the first documented the research that we've seen in other doctors have looked at this commented on it as well seems to be back about a hundred and fifty years ago\nA doctor Ernst ... first call these things stem cells so it's pretty amazing to me and you know I watch some of the TV shows and how it's made and I want to see how things work and\nEt cetera but if you're looking at the human body and watching to see how your body responds to stimuli and how it creates repair and how your organs function it's mind boggling and goes well beyond anything else I've ever I've ever seen\nOkay phone lines are open one eight hundred eighty four eight WABC one eight hundred eight for eight nine\nTo two two so to talk a little bit about the new meal plan and I'm going to cope meal plan a for lack of a better title for it um personnel personalize meal plan\nFor so many patients so over the years we've tested and corrected their vitamins and minerals put them in perfect zone they do great we get the hormone levels the right range they do great we have told them to do some exercise some people will just do a little bit of walking around the block which is great other people do more the more you do a better grade\nUm the hard part for people to kind of fix or to work through or to get results with Israeli diet unfortunately in this country we are so\nBrainwashed into thinking that we have to have this kind of food for breakfast and this for lunch and this for dinner and\nUh it's okay to have this and that and we're just way overloading our body with chemicals preservatives carbohydrates and that's why here people are more overweight than almost anywhere in the world in this country so [noise] um got together with a company a\nCatering company to make food I put together a plan and then you get to thirty ...\nA menu it's thirty grams of corporate below to help people burned down sugar burned down fat bring down wait great for diabetic patients and we walk patients through the process we test\nWe correct vitamins minerals hormones have them walk through the diet they can purchase the foods and utilize these foods 'cause so many people that I see are so busy that I don't know how to cook have time to cook\nThey don't cook more than a few different things so this is a great way to order amazing healthy food in that perfect low carb range\nAnd a variety of different things for breakfast lunch dinner then my second Protestant part of the process has to do a fifty or sixty grand carb\nMaintenance plan instead of three hundred grams as some people have so and doing that this is a great way to get your body in great shape so this completes the whole\nPicture as I say or comes full circle with really perfecting nutritional foundation and getting your body healthy so this is going to be ready within the next a couple of weeks and we'll talk about patients talk to patients about it and get them up and running with it\nOK phone lines are open one eight hundred a parade\nWABC let's go to John in the car hey John how are you\nYeah I think that cough sure [noise] um I had a question that trick epilepsy mhm [noise] um so my daughter um diagnose okay\nThat and how old is she now for okay a sheer\nDiagnosed or whatever in April ... she is she's ... years okay I'm saying you know and they help to we're off so first of all I can ... their study that a global crossing towns here in children\nWell not putting off the top of my head I'm not a pediatrician and they haven't extensively looked into seizure disorder in children we see a lot of information about seat seizure disorders are adults and I know that that's related to heavy metal exposure that's been documented literature\nBut you have to understand that the brain in a child is a very um susceptible to issue and whether it's a heavy metal or an allergy or something that's coming in from the outside that can play a role in the way that you make\nYour brain chemicals are looked at all the children who have lots of vaccines with the lumina mercury in the vaccines I think that's the most significant\nDamage in combination and I still believe although traditional medicine doesn't want you to that that leads to change the brain that can lead to autism spectrum disorders so\nWhile traditional doctor say well we don't know and here's a drug crime that I'm I'm the one who says well let's look at vitamins and minerals that slipped to maximize the picture looks look to make the diet\nYou know more specific more accurate\nI'm at her age it would be good to have her see a pediatric allergist so maybe they\nDo a stamp test to see what she's allergic to that can do a blood test for good analogy and see if there is a role remember many years ago Lorenzo so all the TV movie and the mother and father I think the father was played by ... I forget who played the mom but the child had a a defect\nIn the ability to metabolize certain fats oils so they kept switching the oil's around\nAnd the problem with the child had which I think in ... including seizure issues was eradicated from changing the oil's diet so thanks you know it was a relatively famous movie at the time in the book but I I mean you have to look at some of these things as I think that that can play a role\nRight right my next question what is that the vaccine you you've got your first\nWell you know I just don't think you know I Know studies where they've given vaccine some monkeys in Europe baby monkeys the same uh combinations of things and they ended up having neurologic problems in similar\nOr autism spectrum disorder problems so you know I don't I don't you know I don't believe that everything that every drug does to your buddies perfectly safe and without any side effect we've seen patients that have had a than reported\nWhen they had a flu shot years ago the ended up with the ... and they had paralysis for four months I mean who wants to go through that I think it's a they're risky\nLook up information Gardasil vaccine fifty young girls died the first year that that came out on the market so how come you know they push push push without knowing if there's going to be a risk to somebody and I could look up online\nLook up information online side effects of vaccines looking vaccines and how they're made what's in the vaccine you know look look up look about that look up that\nWow okay all righty she actually pan before right before the beginning of the fears\nWell who look up Tamil flew on the Internet and see what you could find on the side effects to it\nRight right right [noise] okay I think he's got like ...\nThank you for your call have a wonderful day phone lines are open one eight hundred aid for eight WABC let's go to Leon in Brooklyn how are you\nI'm thinking how can I help you\nMy phone profit from all over the the problem that that helped him to help them\nWell if it's possible but I Would need to see what's causing the OCD a lot of the\nChanges that occur in person's brain function I think are due to heavy metal exposure led marquee cadmium nickel arsenic aluminum this study's hundreds of thousands of studies that document the damage of heavy metals on the body and interestingly heavy metals create more damage to nerve tissue than almost any other area\nSo I Would need to see what his body's doing it I Would need to see his vitamins mineral levels hormone levels we would do blood and urine for heavy metals 'cause I Want to see what's occurring behind the scenes\nYou have any uh that's what\nI mean I'm sure over Thirty years we've had patients that have OCD I just can't think right now off the top of my head what their names were what the causes of the problems were\nBut even more so when you look at stem cell therapy we know that those cells will go to the areas of damage a generation and make brand new cells we've seen that for ... for Alzheimer's Parkinson's MS there's literature worldwide about stem cells for all of the disorders we see\nSo I think that there are beneficial for for people that don't have\nAlzheimer's Parkinson's MS stroke arthritis lupus rheumatoid pulmonary fibrosis COPD diabetes\nThose things that stem cells are used for there are people that are relatively healthy that like to do stem cells because they want to make brand new cells in organs uh you know as they age so I think that's a brilliant ideas well\nI'm not the fact that they are or not they have different back then do you have to say that you do you do\nYou correct the best mechanism is using bone marrow that's what we were told to do based upon the powers that be and I joined years ago into a big clinical trials first they said that fat\nWas better but then when the centrifuge got faster to four thousand rpm they switched over to bone marrow because the number of cells who were getting was much higher was ten times higher\nSo that's why that is the state of the yard so yes other doctors don't have\nThe same experience other doctors doing different things other doctors haven't gotten a certificate fellowship certificate I did that because I took all the courses you possibly could so\nIt's ... you know there are doctors that are doing things I heard of a doctor you know way up in the northern state uh and he's not a medical doctor he's having someone who stands on his patients I mean you can't do that without being a medical doctor so I\nMean right I Want to economic and my wife ... hot\nThere possible yeah you gotta have a ... well I imagine so uh how old is your wife\n[noise] sixty five\nWell yeah ideally we want to evaluate her vitamins and minerals or hormone levels I don't know if she needs to bring her weight down if her blood sugars too high if she has heavy metals we look at the entire picture you're not going to find a doctor in the world who looks at all the different things that I Do and explains them\nAnd I said to her said mom you know I'm you know I Know somebody is going to be on a a big t._v. show big TV series she said who it sounds great guys charming good looking you know of a blood tells you says who\nSaid you know mom you know the guy blah blah blah blah he does this does that created it and uh she goes who I don't know anybody like that I said my it's me\n[laughter] I said how can you know [laughter] I'm trying to you know I'm teasing her but I'm trying to get her to think that maybe it's me so\nShe left for forty five minutes now at the first five minutes it was great my mom was laughing she just took a bite taken by surprise and I said oh yeah and I said don't want to maybe I'll have them you know make me try to look like\nCarey grant or Tom Selleck or above a black she kept laughing forty five minutes I started wearing a said she still asking me she was she thinks I Can't do this\nSo of course she's still laughing and Everytime\nI call right tease her about something about this she laughs but uh my mom came from a very large family my mother's grandmother had Eighteen kids during the Apollo and of course so they sang and danced and ate all day long and each of those kids ended up having to think about ten children so the whole neighborhood\nUm was a you know my ... my family and my grandmother and her husband had a big Italian store that's the only way you're gonna feed all of those\nYou know mouse hungry mouse and feed the neighborhoods so I sometimes think wow how easy would it be to have grown up or even to go back in time and see what it was like to have so many family members in just one you know big area back in Brooklyn and in a\nClub Bush so um [noise] ah I just think that a\nGrowing up with such a big family and having somebody first cousins all around and you know must have been a really really amazing to enforce it today and you know this time and age people barely can have the two point three kids I don't know what the average\nIs now but people really have a child or two so I think that's a lot tougher on the family environment so ah yeah you know I as I say I count my blessings because uh I can come from a great family and certainly on both sides\nMines robot if you'd like to call in to ask a question you could do now call now before the end of the

many years I don't know if you listen to music consent around or if you had the injuries but we're having a heavy metal exposure we have to look at all those things to see what the underlying causes

A. B. C.\nLooks kind of the comes only speak with a very good friend and someone who has served the public so closely for many years I'm Talking about doctor Anthony see for every\nWho serves now as regional director of region to the United States Department of health and Human Services and then comes as New York New Jersey Puerto Rico in the Virgin Islands or were you Dr ...\nI'm doing well Rob thanks so much I was talking to some people about a gag rule and they looked at me and said no you're kidding I said no I just learned to this myself so talk about what it is and what's being done\nYou know I have to confess that even in even with forty years of service in the healthcare industry I wasn't aware of gag rules\nAre affecting the price of prescription in this country a sign that turns out okay that restrict pharmacies from sharing information with patients who come to their drugstores with prescriptions for themselves\nThe gag rule is issued by the uh sometimes to health insurance companies sometimes by the drug company a at it restricts the pharmacist from letting the patient know that there are less expensive alternatives to purchasing the medication through their insurance plan\nSometimes it's even cheaper to just pay out of pocket for the medication but the problem is that has been restricted that has not been allowed by most of the these agreements from sharing that information with the patient\nWould imagine people would be screaming if this were known to you know more to the public you go to a drug store and you have to you know obviously pay for the medication and you simply say is there anything that would do the same would cost less and the pharmacist can't tell you\nThat's absolutely correct\nWow shocking or until now yeah yeah what so what's happened\nI sew on October have this past Wednesday or the president signed chew a legislation into law\nUh one is referred to as I Know the lowest price act pretty simple right and that prohibits of prescription drug plan I did Medicare Medicare Advantage from restricting a policy from in Wyoming and in Raleigh of any difference in price\nWhether that the co pay or out of pocket so that restriction on the pharmacist is now being lifted under this legislation the other legislation that was signed on on a Wednesday\nWas a patient right to know drug prices that again says at all and that is shreds that health insurance this was a group health plans do not prohibit\nOr punish pharmacy providers for providing certain information to in Raleigh\nSo now we have eliminated a the restriction on pharmacists who I've been told in the past that they want to participate in a particular network or carry a particular drug that they weren't allowed to share certain information with the patients who came to the pharmacy and purchase that medication\nFor every why weren't people making noise about this before this is going on for some time just gag rule\n[noise] yes it has been and that's not widely known that that's probably why are people have not been complaining about it a so this whole subject before priorities that secretary Alex ...\nCame to Washington west way was named as the secretary of health and Human Services for priorities ideal of course but the most important one and that is the opioid crisis facing this nation\nIs second priority and not exactly in Florida but second are already is to reduce the cost of prescription drugs which is what we're seeing here with this legislation\nThe third is to reduce the cost of health insurance and the fourth is\nTo encourage war I ... a transformation in health care in the United states and move more in the direction of value based healthcare transformation of health care for one of my so procedure for quality value and the outcome\nAlright doctor Anthony see for every federal government is lucky to have you and thank you so much for a alerting us a about this latest development I'm sure many people will be relieved to know that they can obtain a vital information about purchasing something at a much lower cost\nAnd I thank you and I appreciate the opportunity to once again ah be a guest on your

Turkish time so we're excited that he is now going to go home and uh we were sitting on pins and needles on the end of our share a this is the fourth time I've been hearing is you're advocating for pastor Brunson\nI originally met thanks to you with the with some Turkish diplomats in New York that was December twenty Seventeen when we get all that you learned about his year long prison beds and that's what I said that the diplomats if you release pastor Brunson\nI'm willing to serve out the remainder of his prison sentence and you were there in the room at the time right right across the
