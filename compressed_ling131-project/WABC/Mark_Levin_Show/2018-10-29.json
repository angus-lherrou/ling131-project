scans\nBlood work a also personalization with DNA or to make sure you're able to keep it off a so it's it's it's completely for you which for each individual and that's that's why you know we got these some tremendous results twenty five to forty five pounds a and and that's what we typically see\n[noise] um it it it's very interesting because we've had so many um we we kind of go in waves in terms of like the uh professions that we see in the office which is really weird I Know it sounds weird but it kind of makes sense now that I Know more information about it so\nThis week we had just one of your off the cuff so now it's ... yeah I Do a lot of the ... well you know you don't remember I set up front right I I'm generally at our reception desk all day long so\nI hear and see so many different things and I really try to tune in and listen to what a lot of our patients are saying when they think nobody's actually listening to them right and so this week we had\nUm a number of commercial drivers and our um you know\nFront desk waiting area and so some of them were current patients some of them were new patients that were just about to get started some of them were just new patients that had just heard the goal over we're about to get into consultation and and what was interesting was that\nI didn't realize that commercial drivers have a whole set of rules about you know that the health that they have to actually uh being or achieve\nShirt with our job driving a big old month strong right it's like if you you know you would think ... or police man I I don't know like a\nA doctor should have certain standards that they're you know\nTough guys are driving a giant truck craze settled there for hours and hours on end and it takes a ton of a ...\nBut you usually don't think of that right so what was interesting is that one of our patients um who I was saying these checkups right so one of the patient so it was sitting in our waiting room and struck up a conversation with somebody who had just been in the consultation is actually signing up and\nAnd the gentleman said to him you know does this program work and um the other gentleman said you\nKnow yes actually it does and and you know the new patient started asking him some questions and I'm the existing patient said\nUm you know the reason I came here because I had this a checkup that my job prescribed and I was basically told that if I didn't lose the weight because I was borderline diabetic borderline you know very high blood pressure high cholesterol issues I if I didn't lose the weight and if my health and improve I was basically out of a job\nThat took and no it's not and so what I found to be amazing is that the potential patient turn to him and said oh my God he said that's what I Do for a living as well and have access to Haitians looked at him and he said\nAnd you haven't had that check up yet and the guy said no I haven't and I'm sure glad I'm Talking to you about it [laughter] so yeah so I\nDidn't realize it but you know lo and behold um our existing patient his name is Paul he said I don't recall the new patients name So Paul said to him you know the side does work it really is amazing it's really easy to follow 'em\nAnd it's really easy to follow the blow while I'm On the road when she never thought that he'd be able to actually do a diet because of that\nBecause you know these guys are always on the road down the road for hours and hours there's not a lot of stops of places to eat it and if there are they usually extremely unhealthy so he says that he's actually been able to find really healthy options in all of these places that he used to stop and now he's eating according to the islands of the program he's almost done with the program by the way I think he's down close to like\nThirty seven pounds of forty days well that's all he really had to lose\n'em and and this amount of tremendous amount taller guy so he carries it well but clearly the health issues where are the more concerning notice and and you know just going back to my original point of the beginning of the show is that really what we're doing is we're changing people's lives in terms of\nHealth and that's kind of the most important thing ham right because with all that fat laws come so many different benefits as far as\nGetting you better feeling a better so\n[noise] talking about the commercial driver's ah Jake uh who you actually saw um\nThis week is done with his two sixty day rounds and he is down a hundred and twenty pounds I'm also commercial driver um and he says that you know he he always meet up with some of his friends along the way along his route said he does and he says people don't recognize him anymore and\nI was like well listen a hundred and twenty pounds is you know\nWhat I'm saying it it ingests them around two six year olds that are two two to six the day around to the program would he be the way he would be the big you know he would end up now for the for the guy who was fifty four already area I beat him while we had somebody who lost sixty nine and six day off you know I Know that perfect for the week yeah no matter All right he's pretty high\nTwenty minutes to a half an hour she's gassy shoes bloated a she and she feels that way for hours this was this was beforehand\nAnd we you know she came in\nAnd did a concert weather obviously a we looked at a bunch of different things uh we did the hair saliva or with the energetic a buyer and drug testing while we took a look at some blood work that she brought in we were able to do a a ... a toxicity support a digester support\nOr minerals and vitamins support and so boom twenty to twenty two pounds um and and forty days which is fantastic a little bit below what we typically see but still you know like she said she looks like she's thirty pounds\nShe looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and [noise]\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on somebody to get you know get help the economy a little bit in the shopping the shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping at a bind some clothing and uh it's always good right I'll go\nI you know I think that there's\nShe looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and [noise] you know she couldn't go spend some money on somebody get you know get help the economy a little bit of a shopping yeah shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping get a bind some clothing and ah it's always good right\nOutta all good I you know I think that there is nothing that feels or um that feels better than I'm buying yourself a pair of jeans at our size or two sizes smaller than you were only like hello twenty thirty forty days ago\nOr so in my opinion it's like you know for a man who is tightening his belt buckle right and and you get to see that mark\nAnd that he's had there for like whatever eight years and now that markets you know now that dealt in different a whole and I think that that's\nI think that's really special and I think um\n[noise] and I think what really matters is the fact\nYou know every single day you're accountable to yourself now and you know what you're doing and you know and\nYou kinda feel comfortable in your own skin now you're no longer afraid of the snack attack you're no longer you know having these cravings and we had Stella call the office this week so she's been off the program for three years by the way\nI'm and she I think she lost about thirty seven pounds three years ago as she is sixty four now so she was sixty one I'm\nThree years it obviously she called because she wanted to know about the DNA testing 'cause I was really interesting to her and also because she gets the complimentary hand saliva evaluation every three months she comes\nIn and she does that and she gets the appropriate or chicken Brianna can handle id of I told her about that too but so one of the things that she said to me that really changed her\nThe program was that she no longer afraid to walk into a supermarket she's no longer\nAfraid to go sit down at a restaurant because she knows exactly where she's at is you know to try like she's completely control in control your eye and she said that this wasn't the situation two years ago she had completely lost control\nAnd that's a scary place to be at and I'm really proud of her that three years later on and she said to me\nShe goes you know it's a daily thing for me now she says I wake up in the morning and I think about what my days are going to look like\nAnd then my second thought is what my day is going to look like food wise is\nAnd it's an interesting thing right we wake up in the morning we think about what we have to do during the day well why not think about what it is that we're going to eat during the day or ... you know that's what fuels our body that's what determines how much energy we have better but really\nDetermines how we're going to feel for the next morning ... but a lot of people don't think of it that way but she says you know it completely shifted her paradigm of thinking like she's completely on a different wavelength in terms of what happens to her every single morning she has a routine\nYou know she knows what she's going to eat she knows what she's gonna do that day and that really helps her in three years later all the way it is still often she's doing great you\nKnow it's great it's great and then that's what you do you empower people now when you have control your empowered and you you can handle it and you know what to do and and so each person is given ten different ways to get the weight off her each person as a weight set point reset\nEach person or ... is given a DNA test that tells them all these different things for over forty different metabolic factors\nAnd so it it that's what it's all about without any shots and hormones in surgery we typically see twenty five to thirty five pounds in women are we typically see thirty\nFive to forty five plus pounds with men and that's mostly fat that's without shots without hormones\nWithout surgery a without hungrier eating natural food uh you're you're you're not hungry in the program because your body is burning so much toxic fat for fuel\nThat were just basically rerouting what your body's using for fuel and then we were out back and and so it's really monitor you every every day you have my personal cell phone number my email address so nobody's ever\nAlone on this process and\nIt's really easy to just go to and Jay ... to get started going to end J died dot com normally Ninety nine dollars but as a radio listener uh right now you go on line is twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis [noise]\nUh where we take over and take a look at a bunch of different things we do a full consultation body composition analysis we look at not only weight\nBut we're also looking at a visceral fat we're also looking at your basic metabolic rate and so we're also looking at daily caloric intake and so the difference in those two numbers important because\nYou know if you if your if your body's functioning your basic metabolic rate let's say you're burning off Seventeen hundred calories a day but your body is functionally taken and thirty five twenty five hundred calories a three thousand calories a day\nAnd you're wondering why you can't lose weight that might give you an answer you know and so we take a look at metabolic Lee high your body is working\nAnd so then we we then do hair and saliva with and do\nThe buyer and genetic testing uh when decided to go forward with the program we then take a look at blood work that people bring in\nTo see what supplementation to support them with and we look at it a functional level or we just tighten up those parameters a little bit so we don't you know if you keep the parameters within a functional level you have to worry less about being diagnosed with big without to buy those problems getting worse and being ... God Forbid diagnosed with something so\nWe want to keep it in a healthy range and keep your body balance and if we're able to do that and there's less chance you know upstream downstream if you if upstream you're able to keep the body balance and you have to worry about the less disease downstream and so that's n J died dot com\nOr for twenty seven dollars for a a a only twenty seven dollars

eight five five five and Jay diet that's eight five five\nFive six five thirty\nFour thirty eight or that's the scheduling appointment and one of our locations we've got locations everywhere in the tri state area or New Jersey New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island and ah Westchester [noise] uh that's great and so you can come in and scheduled appointment or you make a phone call\nRemember when you are calling that the folks on the phone are only there to schedule appointments or they're not there to you know put you on the weight loss program\nUh get mad at the grade no no that yeah

and that of course is gun control people are very angry because Trump right after the attack he said the synagogue need better security or is President Trump's immediate response in the attack\nOf your production inside the results would have been far better this is a dispute that will always exist I suspect but they had\nSome kind of a protection is resentful or maybe you could have been very much different situation is not\nOh I Know you've got a lot of flak for that because\nHe's he's not talking about anti Semitism right they're not only is he not wrong this has been known widely widely known in the Jewish community for legitimately decades for decades in France and you go to France and go to a Jewish institution every Jewish institution in France at the gate and guard\nEvery single one and you go to any place in Europe and if they send it all the security there is heavy\nAnd security at my synagogue is having we have probably Fifteen synagogue my immediate area the security at all of them is heavy and depending on where I was met by now have the security fence all the way around it and does not leave the door in law\nIs that bad yet is it reality also yeah when I pick up a school for my children a Jewish state school for my children have to fulfill certain philosophical commitments obviously but within that ban there are a bunch of schools in the area that that do that very first thing that I look at the first thing I ask about the security considerations that schools\nPaying two thousand and one I remember on September eleventh two thousand one my father and I were actually set to go golfing that morning and we drove up to a school where my sisters were going\nAnd we drove up and they didn't really have security that wasn't the thing back in two thousand one so much\nAnd they asked if we can just stand outside we were the extra security that day on nine eleven that very soon end it right after nine eleven they upped security significantly and that was true for every Jewish institution that I knew about it is true for virtually every dish institution in the United states\nNow one of the reasons that I suspect that wasn't additional security at the conservative synagogue\nIs because conservative informed synagogues typically don't have quite the same security is worth it I ended up um I'm not sure why that is I don't really have an ideological reason or philosophical reason for that I can say that if you go to Beth Jacob in Los Angeles they actually check everybody's bag and this has been part\nOf a Jewish reality for a very long time that mean that I feel unsafe know again I Walk around in public with a um a guy every single day every single day Americans have that country in world history for his but if you actually want to protect you is the answer is not to take the they had the guns out of the hands of people like me\nPart of the hands of people at my synagogue quarter carrying the answer is for some of those people to be arm is that if somebody like the shows up maybe it's not the solution maybe it doesn't solve the problem but you do have a better shot at funding yourself with their guns in the place of a hoax or using the the gun control argument I'm having a hard time seeing that in California is replete with gun control and\nIt doesn't actually stop shootings in California I Know because I live here in the the attempting jumped to politics from something that has had a long and glorious history of thousands of years I find deeply off when\nWe ought to delve into the nitty gritty of anti Semitic rhetoric and the nitty gritty and that's not a policy we ought to delve into all of that but for Jews Jews know that this is nothing new not only is nothing new\nThis is something that Jews have always fought\nNow on the Saturday that this happened the Jews were reading a section of the Bible call by Arabs from from the book of genesis\nAnd that second Bible talks about Abraham sacrifice by them you know they got to labor ...\nVery cryptic section of the Bible that really about adapting to Abraham what are you willing to risk are you willing to bring your child into a more dangerous world and stand for values even at the risk of that child like are you willing to dedicate your child to me that happened in ... which is the circumcision ceremony for Jewish boy that brings them into the Jewish war all\nThe Jewish people have always sort of and they've said yes they're willing to stand with like the ... and willing to stand with life and because they're willing to stand with like there are those want that\nThere are those who want western civilization broken down there are those who want religion destroy\nThere are people who are evil out there the Jews have stood against that they use will continue to stand against us and and if you are part of the right side and you will stand against it too and you'll do so without maliciously tearing down people who are also on the side of western civilization there should be more unity and ...\nWith regard to stuff like that suggested they will be back here tomorrow hopefully\nThey can reach some sort of silly and hopefully we can get together again to go back as we should all be on the same side when terrible terrible things happen like that I don't think we will be by my hope remains and somehow we'll come together for a vegetarian\n\nKerry and his last big speech openly trashed the Jewish state Obama treated the prime minister of Israel\n\nWas absolute disrespecting contempt even reached into the Israeli elections to trying to feed them\n\nAnd they refused do no way out the door with just a few weeks left the ministry and they refused to defend Israel in the un against her enemies they voted present in yet another\nHate filled resolution at the United nations the American media in this country I said back in may had blood on its hands what Hamas backed by the Muslim Brotherhood backed\nBy Iran backed by Hezbollah was riding on the Gaza Strip shooting missiles into Israel Israel defending itself they immediately attacked\nIsrael they immediately attacked the Jewish state\n\nVirtually all of them I spoke about that alliance\nOne Morocco bomb a push through this Iran deal violated our constitution well surely Iran deal gave them a hug and gave on one point five billion dollars in ransom\nFollowed by so attaining another hundred and fifty billion dollars to that regime which is a terrorist regime which is its own people and its own journalist by the way media\nWhich is set it intends to destroy all the Jews in Israel and by the way it intends to destroy the United states Obama was set up right\nHe was celebrated\nObama literally well armed with billions and billions of dollars a grave enemy of ours and the Jewish people\n\nAnd then when ... when the president Donald Trump withdrew from the deal he was attacked\nBy Democrats some Republicans like Bob Corker it was attacked by the media\n\nYou ask any Jew and Israel the president may have a fifty percent favorability rating in the United states is a Ninety percent favorability rating in Israel Ninety percent\nNinety percent\nIs president is the best friend the Jewish people in Israel have ever had bar no other president which is one of the reasons\nThis mass murder piece of crap went into that said I got one of the reasons he denounced Trump being too many Jews around them he said\nKnow like a son in law like his daughter like three grandchildren I don't know that we've ever had a president it's certainly not modern history that had\nChildren and grandchildren\nAnd despite every presidential election pandering about recognizing\nJerusalem as the capital of Israel pandering about moving the American embassy from

seven seven three one two three eight one one well it's an honor to have the ambassador\nTo the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what is taking place here in secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's there\nWhile it's a you know a horrific act or worse anti Semitic attack and us history they claimed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday that to meet with a members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive I'm a with Senator Casey was there\nWe had a a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just taking it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and stand a and what I wanted to do with Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd the in Israel yesterday morning our government and they taught Sunday Sundays like Monday Israel the first day of the week\nAnd the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel stood because we are the one and only two states so we feel or a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why it was important for me to be in Pittsburgh yesterday\nNow you were born in Miami I just want people to know this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami or brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach that was about that yeah we are the ones with I speak that that's true um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were an Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout Europe\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nOr we can ... it is it's going to say a growing problem\nUh many people want to say that it began to two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand four ten and two thousand Fifteen\nA hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half\nOf hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population market their\nAccounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of an\nAttack they crowded against Jews were actually much bigger than it was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which had was about a half century after the Holocaust\nWhere it was politically incorrect to attack cues\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades\nIs that it once again become fashionable a compact cues and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after just now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only two states\nBut the thing out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing ... attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six of the G federation in Seattle there was an attack of two thousand fourteen at a Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas\nIn Kansas City which I think claim three lives and this is the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you can have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans\nUm and there's a stream missing it can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media as you have this rise of these online hate groups\nFiltered by will save

great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a modern I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look with Trump half the time and I post cabin up because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she's a she's a little desperate to be honest with you mark and as you should be because listen I mean she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her\nThat they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nAt dinner McCaskill turns around to vote no on Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court no one justice Kavanaugh no on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could not be we're out of step\nWith his she running in New York and Missouri\nYeah exactly well most of our money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great senator for one of those places but for this state hardly and that is that's her big problem and that's why she's down in the poll\nOr she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a left us to be perfectly honest with you or votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or ... and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she has accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures are from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country\nTrying to prop up but Senator McCaskill ended up by her seat and you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they they don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and to have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\nThe the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in one of your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh is a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that\nThey have not accepted and are not willing to accept\nThe results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said\nAnd that is a huge issue in this race immigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and a bed of the huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes in Congress and that people want somebody's going to be a fighter for\nThe middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill's saying\nYou will oppose us a message of protecting people with pre existing conditions is that your position and she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows that not called her out on them many times in our debates I support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare to do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state\nIncome health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan but is it Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now is she\nGoing on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell she she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to of course we all know that that's\nWhere this is headed and we all know that that that she'll never vote against her party but she never does on ... any major issue an issue consequences and\nYou know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare imagine what they'll do\nTo pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate folks who are or who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda the Claire
