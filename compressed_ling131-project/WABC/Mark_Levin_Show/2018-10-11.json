going to slander do because he doesn't agree with us want to eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven let's get to your phone calls on this one model and you are on the marquee event show than Ferguson filling in an eye hello\nAnd thank you so much and like you're doing excellent dropped on end for mark thank you I appreciate that\nThat you um I have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt a number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was dying in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances\nWhen I started winning and mental health housing and they spoke out about somebody abuses that were going on and some of them you know equating the rules and what have you all of the sudden I seem to have like thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was\nPrior to that no one ever thought it had anything but you know mental illness from depression and uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of the two places even up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on and you're homeless twice I Lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention month\nI think by making it sound as though Congress has some kind of mental illness whether he guys left I think it's not even the issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him the four of them spoke out about Bush [noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't it wasn't you get out her day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now there must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nIt just it just so people know that we were\nWhen we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen\nWorld Health or a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say that says where's the compassion and and I say that first of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your life uh I ... my best friend in college\nUm took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have\nGreat compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West\nAs the left is doing saying you know we're clearly in again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token a black man er and and there and he's taking advantage of using him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative Dan you are on the Marco venture been for some reason I go ahead\nStole my thunder about the uh\nUh President Bush rates black people man I was like I was all part of it that um\nThey check this out so now Herschel Walker is going to be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon ... pie or um I think it's horrible what is left these are doing but that's a whole other thing let's talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only here like will first he's the only attorney general to be a contempt of Congress but that's a whole nother issue when the Obamas better we'll you when you know you really gone too far and Michelle probably grab by the ear and said you can't go this far quite yet we're not there yet\nUm but him Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters are Democrats our base that's all they do their inciting violence and then they said in the in the means of\n... and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide when they when you say they're acting like a mob mentality\nWhen you have people screaming and beating on the doors the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality\nWhen you surround a senator like Ted Cruz at dinner a that's a mob mentality when you go in and you and you do these eat it ends in citizens and scream in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking do you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nDeal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here today to seek out and destroy people when we think about that statistic mob mentality you have to have\nTo ... to ... to first of all you have a woman that doesn't and Mrs Ford they didn't want her name to come out and you do it anyway\nSo you say we don't care about you were going to use your the canary we're going to force you to defend your story about sexual assault so hopefully we can find others it will say the same thing about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then what we are going to do is we're going to find people that say well you had sex so we have a boat in the eighties well wait we've got to recant the store and there might never happen well he he he actually in high school was was every weekend making parties for gang rapes and gang banging and and it's running trains on women\nNo one else was ... but we got a porn star lawyer an Avon Audi that will that will act like it's legitimate animals throw it on the news to try to find other women out there\nThat this is what I mean this is the left this is what they're doing right now this is the normal for them and the reason why they're\nDoing that says I or go back to what I said earlier than\nThere is not a single issue that Democrats can actually run on right now except for personal hate and and to turn people in the villains so that you hate them\nThat's their only play you can't scare people on the economy you can't scare people on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan you can't scare people on on healthcare because you you are the ones that create the health care disaster\nYou can't scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now is to say this guy's a racist and you don't want a racist to be in the White House Kanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible that they really have no platform well don't forget they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and\nI'm above our sights high crime I mean that's what they have to stand on you know speaking about the mob mentality I challenge any of these people to walk down I'm downtown Portland or a I've got friends down Austin's such as you go to parks down there and it's nothing but a ... and they will seek to living heck out of\nYou if you look at the antifa protesters this week that were directing traffic and yelling at white people is that not a mob mentality is the Democratic party not endorse antifa they do is the Democratic party not endorse black lives matter saying after the police and what are we want dead tops and when do we want them now and that's a mob mentality\nEverybody
