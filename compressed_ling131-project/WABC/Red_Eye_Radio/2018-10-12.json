I was talking because the cameras were were on ...\n... doing this because the cameras will be on ... as long as he's doing this\nThe uh the the the token or a comment let me just to get them through here some of the the different uh\nHeadlines of salt on our White House that came from MSNBC\n[noise] yeah that I I Will tell you that I did like uh I did like a ... that one and um\nThat the Trump is a\nExploiting a mentally ill person\nOkay that also came out yesterday um\nAnd what was the the uh and the other one you know that you've basically who's being controlled by you know white supremacy ... the white supremacy that is controlling you basically you have the master and slave ... what you have that analogy was also made ... uh uh uh yesterday the one thing the left can tap\nIs somebody of the status of Kanye West in popular culture not indoors everything that they do\nYeah uh as I said Kanye West is not a a a Walter Williams or a or a Mia Love or even explaining things the way that you know ...\nA he's a rap star ... he's going to be all over the place that has he has been a has been all over the place\nAnd its politics that's not the point it's not the point is not what the point is not dissecting\nThe uh the ... the\nLegitimacy or accuracy of the specific economic and political\n... ...\n... G of Kanye West ... it's the fact that he's in a room with Trump complimenting them and it ends there and so at that particular point and we said this for the longest time before a lot of other shows were saying it\nAnd that the\nUh the liberal elite and the liberal black leadership in this country\nA believes in the bigoted and racist idea that all blacks must think alike and if you don't think alike you are not truly black\nYeah that's it yeah\nThey don't have to go much further than that and that's what you were seen uh yesterday\nMhm look I'm [laughter]\nAnd the more attention you give a Kanye West ... he's he's always out for publicity he's making the headlines and it's not even about a tour or song\nWhen does he not made\nHeadlines the ... the whole point is is that's why he does kid rock was an afterthought\nMhm he was there yesterday apparently they asked him a question right yeah reported it and didn't like the answer\nWell and at some point what where do you what age do you drop\nKid [laughter]\nI I'm just asking questions I like the guy\nBut you can't call them rock 'cause we already have raw [laughter]\nSee\n[laughter] it started out I never thought about that when I was a kid [laughter] starts out well meaning and then how do I have a career at sixty yes exactly\n\nYou know kid rock ... not so much anymore\nOr so it it it it it it could be has a kid rock I'm not sure if you have you on the one time you know I was in when he first ran almost like oh come on in the nineties can stop and then I uh\nI uh\nWas behind the music to the biography of his life ... and you see how hard he worked to get where he got ... that he had not right and you see how awkward and I went oh you know I have a completely different opinion of him and it was just you know you're sort of prejudices you every kid rock\n... having a kid and stuff\nBut ah but ah for um you know yesterday again this is not I'm not going to spend five hours are going over the economic and political philosophy of Kanye West\nHold on let me tell staff had guys or cancel all that stuff that I wrote down for the next ... yeah\nExactly uh but because because you don't need to go that far all you need to do is he likes Trump\nTherefore to the left he's not a black he's not truly black ...\nWhether you had this about me alive so you know ... yeah you know and and that's but that's the backward thinking that's\nThat's that's right that's the bigotry and in tolerance of the left today it's the racist mindset\n\nTo the point where you know coming up with the analogy the Trump is the master and Tanya is the slave should really try to convince America of that you're gonna you're going to try to convince a millennials that right\nThere on the west in his mind views himself as a slave really now\nBut this is this is the what's great is that they're actually proving comedy a write in there from their behavior this is Ben and it so maybe we will spend\nSome time talking to both the accuracy of the ideology of God yeah he was the only thing I mean you know in the past talking\nAbout you know why can't someone just a decide they you know or or for whatever reason\nA you know they why can't they think this way does it matter who they are we've been saying that for\nNo ages and it doesn't matter who they are we we talk about um Hollywood conservatives and you and I both know some that and I haven't seen where they've come out you know and you know I'm\nBack in the day on Jay Leno or or whatever over the years um uh and and claim to be a conservative some have\n[noise] but I I Know a a couple that that are have not\nUh as far as I Know and so I'm not gonna you know I'm I'm not going to talk about who they are in it that really doesn't mean anything or it's just the fact that they know James Woods has set it that's why he better just\nTo hang it up yeah young and and and\nRetire we'd go play some poker if he's pretty good at that but um and and be able to issue his opinion than to have to walk on eggshells around people 'cause he wasn't going to get hired you know he knows that that more and more you're not going to get hired\nUm Kelsey grammar talked about it openly on the

in some of those cases still remain with Canada and Mexico\nOh so you know we stayed in that when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA\nBut the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference a you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA yeah he did a little bit\nBut he didn't do anything that he planned that he said he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nRight that this that this isn't going to do it there were little winds here or there the problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem is\nAnd the president used it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car\nTherefore making it more expensive to buy a car\nAnd making it less likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas\nHas just been flushed down the toilet because it's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right it's\nThe one thing they're ... they're a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I have no idea where the president stands on it as we know he has changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week he'll go from as you did one for me in a complete protection is just sounded like a total free trader\nI've no idea where he really stands I Do know though that in this in the the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA\nThat he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America he put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said\nThat's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter] the original or if they ... the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many\nFarmers were laughing at that comments a while because the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the\nThe the the the fuel producers don't ... don't want it they don't want the higher blend the it it may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell the Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes a lawsuit here comes the lawsuit here comes a lawsuit um but\nIt will the but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend\nBut when there is no market for it than there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily ... might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to eat Fifteen with out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt you can't get that done it too so but\nAppeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the uh on the tariffs\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said that's a tiny number compared to what\nWe're ... we're losing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chains are going to go somewhere else so it's not just by the tariffs hurt us until they're lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal you know or or the the the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever to to ah\nTo to terrify you're not there I ended up all anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious the president used the greatest victory\nAnd that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories and their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services right we don't know how that's a victory right we can't figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question\nMhm\nYeah I mean as an when when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork or as we call it Canadian Bacon and the when they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why did they go back to us for\n\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else\nAre we said this during the you know the um during the permit tore him after the\nUh when when the Gulf spill happened\nThe BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies are producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us our permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision\nShort term right\nAnd so you're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy\nOr you know on a ...\nAt the staff of finger and and frankly\nThe ethanol thing has become you know ... for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to political you know support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa I mean and\nFor those people that the New York times of listening\nWhen you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is the state in the middle of the country\nBut when you go there it is\nAll connected to farming just like Texas has oil directly or indirectly I mean that is\nMeans number one you're not going to buy anything from anybody else which means they're not going to buy anything from you which means us producers only have a market of three hundred and twenty million people are three hundred and thirty whatever it is down instead of seven billion people the farmers would\nBe if they they will be done yeah they said they feed the world yet we as a nation feed the world\n[noise] well that would be ...\nFarming would be ...

fantastic how are you\nAll right yeah that direction I'm going what I go to the ... where would I go to vote is going to be the restoration of some show some social glimpse of due process and\nThe court of public opinion is going to have to be arraigned in show no and I think that's the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great read by now yeah\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and a quarter of a public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due process that's a very that's a\nYou know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here it's\nYeah I I think it is and and people apply it uh it based on their their own life you know our our audience a and a ... and new sounds and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it and we're\nAlways immersed in it but most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of voting\nThey look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't\nUh applied the left believes that they apply their feelings directly\nTo their feelings sleep that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote was a big deal\nAnd if they are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is why those polls start to shape up the way they do and that's why you're likely voter gives you a better read but they look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by you know a slogan are driven by whatever imagery\nBut we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on ah what's the bottle and and Chuck Todd who's saying well a lot of people get it wrong in and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house in the Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying is that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right\nWell what\nChuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left\nAs a you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color of their ... and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the polls show Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or I Do zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms in the first amendment but think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason\nLet's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on TV and Donald salt [laughter] walk a lot of well I'll Try I'll drop Perry Mason I'll throw matlock I'll throw out almost Thirty years of law and order on the television\nMhm everybody understands a presumption of innocence\nEverybody even a significant portion that we're trying to tell you that the allegation is enough\nIf you actually asked them off the record if they believe that they would tell you know why that is bad is just think about that in not just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our popular\nCulture shock for me ... ... and it's great point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislatures more for nova three branches of government dope but in pop culture we got we got those and yes they are simple lessons for the simple lesson can be enough to recognize when the process is being distorted\nFor
