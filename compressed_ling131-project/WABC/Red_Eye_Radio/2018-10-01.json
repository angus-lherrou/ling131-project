C.\nJ. diet dot coms so we\nI'm with the the United States are and what should I say trade agreement and ah [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] ah because of the what was it that they were going to allow a ... I forgot what uh was it a certain type of automobile but there are no which just American automobiles right right they were going to allow I think twenty thousand\n... they they're they were lifting the cap previously they only allowed ten thousand American cars to be sold in South Korea now that we're going to move up to twenty thousand before the terrorists moved in and as well supported we aren't even over\nSix thousand so you you do things like that you set parameters of me nothing look we said this long time ago\n[noise] uh the president will be out all week promoting the fact that he got it done he got the free trade deal done that he got exactly what he want want it or we will see when it comes to fruition but\nAs we have said with most free trade agreements\nRemember it wasn't that the president said he would get a free trade agreement done what he said was he will get a free trade agreement that will get rid of the trade deficit\nYes\nNow I Know the president will be out and he will be selling this irrespective of what is in the free trade agreement\nAnd the people to love the president will say he did exactly what he said he was going to do I'm fine with that as long as he heads in reality he doesn't do what he initially said he was going to do\nWell you know [noise]\nI I'm just fine with everything if they'll just get it behind us\nYou know the the the moving of what we'll do this much more of a here and and this much less\nIt really isn't because there's\nThere's been no promise the only thing I've seen in terms of the measurement\nOf the dairy agreement is that it will mirror that of the the agreement that Canada just reached with Europe and other other countries other parts of the world\nSo I have no idea what that means for the U.S I don't know how to quantify that and\nIt's it again [laughter] there was no um target right there was nothing where they said look we must get this much increase or the dairy farmers of of the U.S\nYou know we're this is what we're working on this is who were working on behalf\nSo I don't there was never this this I guess\nBlind or or goals\nFor them to reach the administration in fact just a few days ago they were saying yeah we're way too far apart to be reaching a deal before the deadline and ... and here we are a few days later\nSo we have no idea what it means and how much of an increase for those dairy farmers in terms of being able to sell the kept Canada that is\nYou know what I didn't hear mentioned it all ... and ... article but right now it's early on and maybe in the maybe tomorrow nothing on the soft amber\nNo I didn't see anything on that in federal yell at you always I did see a lot dairy and automobiles that all that so I I guess my ... and by the way when we say\nWin or lose we're not talking about win or lose by our standards because women lewd by our standards with trading with Canada should be free trade across the board no tariffs no limits or anything if Canada puts tariffs on that's wrong if the United states put tariffs on\nA you know uh uh the batters wrong but is that where we made the compromise on soft timber and that's why you\nDidn't hear the administration come out and talked about you know the the soft timber than we upset okay\nWhen I remember they were going after the soft timber industry claiming that the government subsidizes it in Canada right uh and with the duties and whatever put on soft timber as we know\nA construction in the United states will become has and will become more expensive which will hurt the bottom line of the GDP\nSo I you know look there's a there's a ton of things you're and you just mentioned something that just a couple of days ago we're way far off we're not going to have a deal well the president knew that he had to have Canada in the dealer was a no go and Congress was going to going right\nSo he was under that he was under that pressure to come up with some kind of deal otherwise it wouldn't go through and he had to get it done now because they want it done before December first when the Mexican president does out right so we're right at that sixty day deadline it's got to be done now so there was pressure on the administration\nDid the administration crumble on parts that they wanted I guess we shall see it was interesting that ah I read a couple of articles in the last couple of weeks from Canada where they said you know what the Canadian government decided to do\nWe're just not going to respond to Trump on anything ... he can sit there and script just be quiet say nothing\nDon't give them a target back don't say anything and so if you if you think the Canadians have been quiet lately because of it that was their whole purpose let's just be quiet but Canada knew\nThat they they look they understood candidates stood that look one of the things that we have against the United states in this deal is Trump has\nHe's got to get it done by a certain time period otherwise you know the Congress is not going to pass a trade deal that separate from Mexico and therefore that's the pressure to have in the administration I guess we shall see well\nYeah it it here's what I don't fear right now I don't fear any um any\nPromotion of of a a massive I guess concession by Canada\nBy the administration you know because the dairies tiny ... and that's that's the whole thing is that the movement if there were big movement here we would know about already that would be in the media that would be the story that Trump's claims\nThe fault\nSo again how much of a victory as it did it do anything to change anything and if we haven't gotten the steel and aluminum tariffs done then what does that look like\nBecause that that right now if you look at it what is really impact the economy so far it's been it's been that just the threat of those when they started talking about those tariffs\nWell let me ask you this is it ... are we at a point where both Mexico and Canada because we talked about how not a lot of details and come out about Mexico right so we just to the point where they said look we both got to say we have an agreement to start the clock ticking for the next sixty days right\nWe've come to terms and will work out the details later and we've pushed off the deadline for now\nThan we have a lot of stuff to talk about including that a cabin on the FBI investigation or how the goalposts have been moved remember last week I said that they moved the goalpost\nAre basically from a a a you know a a an American ... American football the Canadian football now I think the goalposts moved to the soccer field now it's that even that ...\nThat much longer now right 'cause the goalposts keep moving with the Democrats will get to that plus your calls and comments we had a great show ahead if you'd like to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety right I\nWas told that it's ... ...

want licensed by the rebels take over history commission was number D.C thirty two\nDiet dial so we'll\nBut at each and every year and it happened a couple of weeks ago and I can't remember if I comment on it I remember seeing that he wrote about it or about the the paper the first paper that he worked for going out of business a courier expressed in Buffalo and normally I Would comment I just can't remember if I did or not you know I Can't remember if I liked that are made a comment\nOr and I went to check the other day after the controversy came out that he did the hit piece job and USA Today I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nUh and when I went to check his Facebook page it's gone ah\nHe wrote an article called is Brett Kavanaugh right that he can no longer coach girls basketball I have the original uh the original tweet in the original article here\nAnd I just thought it's important to to let people know that I knew him and you do any story let people know that your relationship to the subject of a of a particular story ... but he wrote\nBrett Kavanaugh testify the other day that he might never coach girls basketball again he shouldn't at least not until further investigation has concluded\n\nA and then goes on to talk about Kavanaugh said he loves coaching and everything else and then he talks to of of the the so called the ... uh uh experts\nAre talked about how Kevin O's you're free to continue coaching in the Catholic youth organization and his daughters private schools or talk to a spokesperson from the archdiocese of Washington he started coach accused of sexual misconduct\nWould have to go through the legal process and be convicted before being banned talked to other people that you know a a you know ... talked about he showed a hurry shouldn't ah and then he kept asking the question but surely but surely but should he and he ended it by saying this\nAnd this is ... this is not a quote from somebody else\nThis is Eric writing at least on line that I have from the archive story\nCalled the nation is deeply divided sometimes it feels like we don't agree on anything any more but credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that end up in ...\n\nAnd the tweets a that led to promote the article said the U.S Senate may yet confirmed cabinet under the Supreme Court but he should stay off the basketball courts for now when kids are around rights or Brady\nAbsolute piece of\nCrap hit job on Kavanaugh's what it was now USA Today came in and this was just it was written as a sports article\nThey deleted the tweet and\nApparently made him change to the lines the lines that are no longer in the newer article\nIs this part isn't it word says Brett Kavanaugh testify the other day that he might never coach girls basketball again then this line was eliminated he shouldn't at least not until further investigation has concluded and the other line that then was eliminated\nWas the nation is deeply divided sometimes it feels like we don't agree on anything but credibly accused sex offenders should not oh shoot basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that\nThat was eliminated when USA Today took down the one story deleted the tweet\nAnd put out a new story not in the regular sports section but in the opinionated sports section\nDoesn't matter whether you asked the question\nIt's a hit piece which are trying to portray is that you suspect him as a pedophile\nAnd\nIt got me a little bit because like rhetoric for Thirty years I'd like I said no when I was a teenager\n\nAnd I and I look at this and and I ... over the last you know year or so I Will admit that I could see in some of his personal post\nYou know you could you could tell he didn't like Trump but that's okay I mean come on I got friends who do that I've Facebook friends who do that all the time we never ever got into a political conversation ever on Facebook\nRight ah but I did see that you could tell that the you know that that it was in there it was in there somewhere but that's that's fine because people have their political opinions and I'm fine with that we've all got our family members and friends that disagree with some politics all the time\nAnd again I haven't seen era what since we were teenagers so I I you know I don't know but like I said\nUm\nI always thought that he wrote with class this was completely classless article\nA it's a hit job it's unwarranted\nOr it is not up at all\nTo the sports journalistic standards that I knew from Arab Brady\nWhen\nHe started writing as a local writer and then went with USA Today probably for the first you know for for the last you know Thirty years this was just an absolute hippies and\nAnd what gets me angry about this ... you know you and I've done talk radio for a long long time\nAnd sometimes we may get a little bit of overheated whatever but we never really got to we've never really gotten ourselves in any trouble we've had to apologize for anything that we set on the air you know we're management comes in you must apologized because sponsors are all Bailey and that's because number one we don't think\nI you and I don't think in a kind of radical ways to begin with\nWe're not hateful people we don't hate anybody\nBut I've always said if somebody says on the radio and loses that for a little bit to me that's a little bit more understanding even if you tweet it out and it's just a sentence but right here what he did he wrote an\nArticle this was absolutely premeditated it was a premeditated job apparently because of the range that he feels of anything that's relating to Trump\nWell and this is you know the indicative of the the mentality to get on the left this is just one more in a long line of people that are now just\nThrowing everything at the cabinet nominations because they have room to do\nAnd you know how you know he's wrong and now he knows he's wrong\nBecause the editors or somebody got involved and said this goes to the opinion section you got to take out these sentences because these aren't fact based at all because he called it a credible accusation ... that's a political statement that is not a statement of fact\nNo\nAnd the the the fact that the u._s._a. today how to delete the tweet oh and then he deleted his Facebook page completely he deleted for a reason\nBecause he knew the blowback that was coming why because what he wrote was an absolute it piece on a man where there is zero evidence except for the allegation that he's ever done anything wrong well again\nThey you know for them now the claim is reality\n\nAnd so this goes to not just a hippies but a hit piece on his family\n\nNot he's not capable of making unbiased decisions\nNot\nWe're against him because he might overturn roe v Wade\nNot anything else\nIt was a hit job directed toward his children it involves the activities of his children mhm imagine had somebody done this with Iraq Obama and his daughter oh\nThat person will be unemployed by now that person would be done if they were especially if they were working for a major news organization like USA Today\nThat would that would have been over\n\nAnd and but this is what the left sees as a win this is what they see as acceptable tactics\nAnd it will continue now thanks to ... and it's not acceptable and Eric knows\nWriter Erik ... doesn't care if I make sure Eric breeding knows it just so somebody just reams of the conversation they don't think I'm referring to you\nAnd they don't care\nThey don't care it's that it's unacceptable because it's acceptable to them because anything to stop Trump and anything to stop this nomination process\n\nJust reprehensible what he did in USA Today and the and they wonder and then the\nGas that Kavanaugh was passionately defending himself yeah\nExactly\nYeah you're a bunch of hypocrites you know it you're

thing I think it's going to be basically a don't ask don't tell where they the players association really encourages him players not to do it\nOr stay in the locker room or do whatever\nAnd have the thing just slowly fade away because contract talks\nWill well I mean the contracts up what in\nA almost two and a half years now but they'll start negotiating ended a good year out so you're a year and a half away really year and a half year and three quarters away from\nThe the contract negotiations probably starting and they want to make sure that TV ratings are going up and not sliding down because they sign a ten year deal so we believe that the NFL players association has probably gone to the players and the reps in say encourage your people not Neal wow\nWait for Bengals the falcons all players stood buccaneers it bears all players stood lions and cowboys all players stood bills in Packers all players stood the bills kneeled as soon as the game began though indulge versus

I think it was news busters that has the story on the show boilers on HBO\nUm\nI think the rock is in that I think he plays an agent or something but they\nWe're talking about the whole cabinet thing\nAnd the people who objected to cabinet kneeling and everything else and they use them of course it's HBO so they use language blank them\nAnd uh in the in the dialogue and I thought to myself\nWhy is that story even for news busters I mean I Know there's busters typically they're promoting the or they're reporting on the media yes\nYou know if it were CNN saying that or ESPN which I'm sure they have\nWell blank them it was a ... like the people that are going to have people who objected to call you a okay\nAll right I ... what Eric I I've said this before though when\nEvery single person when they say you're not watching ... ... why not explain to them why\nThey go oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that\nEvery single person that I talked to this probably fifty over the last that you know it's been over a year they said well I think it's a free speech issue well actually this and you know what they did was sued

idea how it works ... ... ...\n\nBut I heard somebody else say they don't like it so they don't like it either but yes where that's where we live right now it's on it's unfortunate that in the day in

need\nAnd imagine at that next to that same newspaper machine were Fifteen to twenty two hundred other machines fact checking what was in that MORNING EDITION of that newspaper\nThat's what you have today yeah you can\nThe Washington Post can come out and they can put their story up or seeing it well and and and that's the thing we talked to him give us there but the media controls\nAll whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa one thing we we can tell you with age as we know how it used to be back that not only are there more news sources out there\nYou just brought it up ... not not only they're more than

one of the reason I wasn't surprised as when you know when you see would find finds a Dianne Feinstein did ... that she did not follow the protocol of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd she kept it secret I mean that is so against the protocol of what you do on the Senate Judiciary committee that he was livid and the\nFact that there is a great belief that was the Democrats that actually kept her name secret and then but trade heard trust\nAnd leak the name in order to delay the ... the the cabin on 'em in the cabinet nomination are not nomination but the you know the the the ah Kevin are being confirmed the ... and Kevin confirmation and then when you had the\nSenator from a a Hawaii on the Sunday Morning news show for example and this week being asked are you confident the ah this is Renault we are you confident the Democrats didn't leak the letter a\nShe didn't answer the question right ship\nSo you know you don't have confidence from the Democrats that was stepping up all this wasn't on the left who was stayed in the other day stating oh come on I mean we all know they did it was on\nCNN it was or was it uh I think ah ...

and earlier this year I forgot which month there was January February was huge\nA but one of the problems is a a civilian aircraft\nUh in in July and uh also the uh uh soybeans soybeans was huge and we're not going to be able to make that up with Europe\nAnd as we know the terrorists went into effect a and you have many financial publication St ... okay here it comes because the Chinese tourists have gone into effect the president\nKnew that he had the administration knew they had until\nMidnight mhm in order to get the deal or possibly past uh you know for example in Mexico but you know before the the\nThe president the president of Mexico leaves where they believe that would be no chance after that and the other point was they had to get Canada aboard because there was no chance it was going to pass if it was only between Mexico and the United states so there was pressure on both sides\nUh uh Canada's been very quiet and was reading a few articles in the Canadian media over the last couple of weeks that was stating that was on purpose as said Trump can rail all he wants we're not going to say anything anymore we're done\nWe'll negotiate where we need to negotiate but we're not going to get in the back and forth with them because they believed that fuels\nIt ... it feels his passion and then support for what he is doing in the states so they said if he's just screaming and we're not responding it brings all the rhetoric down and they said Jared Kushner was the one who helped the deal really you know get through\nOn on what the actual deal is we don't know but we don't see any major changes in the free trade deals steel and aluminum or not included don't know why on that one\nYeah and and nothing is done until it's done and the signed agreement\nWill be the agreement or yeah because it would they haven't even worked out everything you know just the uh a lot like Mexico and I and I do think that one of the things is they they said look we got we have to announce when we had to announce that we've come to an agreement to get the clock ticking on this and we can work things out over the next couple of months\nAgo right\nThat takes it off the political table and gets behind the the number\nOne it's one of the problems as we've always said it is with the president we have no idea since she has covered every single opinion on on trade we don't know where he stands we don't know what's acceptable or what's not acceptable he's gone from a complete protectionist\nA and a much of a you know rhetorical protectionist during the campaign and then ah he had the ability about to two months ago to be\nOn Monday a complete free trader and by the end of the week was being protectionist again and so when you hold every opinion on free trade it's tough to figure where the president stands and what this eventual free trade agreement will look like uh but uh if it's more free trade\nAnd it's not protectionist as he promised in the campaign and his supporters\nAre happy with it I'm fine with it yeah\nI mean it's it because it once and I think we will get the aluminum and steel terrorists are those that's going to fix itself at some point it will have to just the way it did during the Bush administration\nAnd it takes it\nTakes a lot longer for that process or let's say [noise] back in the Bush years it took a lot longer for that process to play through to the market this year or or or these days I don't know that that's the case actually\nOn on aluminum and steel because when you talk about the basis of the of manufacturing the based material for so much manufacturing\nYou're going to have ... have already seen a number of industries scream over the the aluminum and steel chairs so that's likely going to play itself out naturally the way it did during the Bush years\nWell you had a lot of financial publications just over the last five days saying ... the indicators are already in that the economy is starting to slow down in the United states and also in China because of the tariffs\nThat have been there and as we subtle along we believe that the president was absolutely wrong to isolate the United states if you wanted to isolate China because of their unfair trading practices\nYeah that you could win if you didn't isolate yourself if you ... the the goals should have always been isolate China don't isolate yourself because you are going to have basically the same free trade agreement that you have\nRight now with Canada Mexico when your\nRole modern western civilizations ... you're not going to massively be able to put tariffs on all of their products and they'll let all of our products going free it doesn't work that way we knew it you're not going to get rid of the one hundred and fifty billion dollar a trade imbalance especially when you have such a huge\nInvestment surplus into the United states so we knew that wasn't going to happen and so to us we thought there was a lot of wasted energy in the administration trying to uh have such incredible trade war rhetoric\nWith Canada Mexico when Europe\nWhen there was really no reason to have it and and with the Asian countries as as well but I Do think that when you see it you're going to see everybody claimed their little victories here there are already ... Canada saying okay this is a great deal of great deals so they're going to be promoting their victories it'll be interesting to see the media in the United states promoting what is viewed as a victory and as we said\nYou have to understand that when it comes to trade now of victory for a particular country is when the consumer\nHas to pay more for a product yeah that's how posterior backwards we are on trade with it's a victory art consumers pay more yeah ha\nBut somehow that's\nThat's the way that it is it so that's how it's promoted yeah that was promoted that's the thing with a consensual hogs that have that the political positive right is what they say\nWe're hurting the economy slightly\nAll right good [laughter]\nThat's because the consumers pay because the consumers pay right\nAnd if the idea is protectionism which it is for targeted industry which it is then\nDefinition you're asking well you're allowing that industry to raise its prices it's not just about being the terrorists\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule I mean I Know oh I got to be close to five or six years\nBut ah I've never run out and uh I I like to have a little cushion but I Want to double up if I feel a little late you know like I Need a little extra I don't have to worry about like being stingy\nWith it [laughter] I'm fifty four years old but anyway it nine years almost ten year it'll be ten years this December sick and went to work one day when I thought I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a master a brain aneurysm image of the brain industrial\nGreat at work and I was on my deathbed that was on a respirator in a coma for thirty five days and the brain trauma unit in the hospital in New Jersey and they own the only reason they even tried to save my life was because I was forty fourth time\nIn three months later I came home and wheelchair and double vision I had to learn to walk again to speak\nIn one in one is to write the alphabet my buddy Andrew Luck and uh I mean I used to be in bed for most of the you know if I went out and did a little something might come home I'd be in bed now I'm up by lake five thirty in the morning and go to the gym\nI Do shopping I cook I energy all day I mean I'm Talking you know I sound pretty wired abductions five o'clock this morning and you know I feel great\nOverall my whole outlook just feeling about my mental aspect everything everything is better than when I came home I was on some pain medications and I don't mean to Seventeen medications maybe forty pills a day now I'm Down to three very very very low dose pills and I'm hoping to get off of everything here\nWhere I was to what I Am now it's unbelievable\nI mean I'm so what so you're speaking to literally a miracle\nFor a limited time use discount code W.
