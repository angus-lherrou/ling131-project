[laughter] that the greatest escape twenty nine or ...\nTwenty nine or out and now they're running\nTheir running up because the alarm goes out to the neighborhood and there's a direct route to Holland and that's where the Germans will concentrate their search but we're gonna we're not going to follow everybody it isn't I have a minute here says by July twenty fifth which is two days hence they still not caught anybody\nThey correct they ... the initial day uh most people got away and then they started in in large numbers to be recaptured\nHowever are are wise guy ... he has none of this heading direct route sees how does he do it\nWrapped porn or had again and most covers gay or one of the two most climbers games he takes the train here is a train to the to the Dutch border uh goes across in the middle of the night he's he's free after thirty six hours he sends a delicious telegram\nA to a Niemeyer back at the camp saying having a lovely time stop\nOr if you ever come to London stop I Will break your neck stop\nA ... ... is aware now that he's a march math and remains marked I understand that it's probably no longer with us but Niemeyer your marked a Blaine can art and gray they are ...\nBy a series of rivers there sleeping in law they're reading what they can from the ground\nThere running hard let's get them right to the border\nThey're exhausted which one can swim one of these cats when Kennedy not the best swimmer right and so they have trouble always but they're traveling together they never leave their mate\nI Love blame when he when they started the tunnel saying shocks away first I Do not understand that what's that many jobs ... ways that the talks on a plane ride and and I have to wait ... shots away I'm about to take all that I Hope I'm shocked\nShocked away although he's intimidated by the tunnel\nThey get to the border and the way you can struck this I don't want to give anything away but it's extremely alarming whether they're going to get through I Can't I kept going to the list to make sure they are okay\nRight because they're not as many of their major being nap the left and right and so I have them cutting you know the narrative cutting back and forth between rap boring and gray and others and um\nUh let's see last come of that we have a list that makes the home run and we have a list that are recaptured what happens to the men who are recapture Disney might brutalized\nNiemeyer goes absolutely mad on them I mean the first to get back he he literally ripped the clothes and then takes their ... this is the last ... last and then shot right at matches there watches and sentenced in isolation for two months\nA rough one gets away and um the traveled uh Fifteen and sixteen is also Peter Campbell

wrap foreign survives for for some time he he he died in in in relative leisure\nAnd all of the Germans we care most about ... what about his face\nNiemeyer who had a shortage ah you know a small fortune\nA warm and it was worth a lot more from al deaths have been tried and tried\nUm they knew his name they knew is crimes he got away with his twin brother who's also were rat really cruel comment on a report that he committed suicide and to guard but those balls\nYes those suicide reports I've learned from tracking Nazis and the second war those suicide reports are part of their kids to get away absolutely was there ever any sighting of him anywhere now he just appeared gone All right so people are\nWho are aware of a man named Niemeyer who boasted that his world war one service if your father grandfather until that story Neal Baskins ready to hear from you know Neal Baskins new book is the escape artist abandoned daredevil pilots and the greatest prison break up the great war it is not good that Niemeyer established\nA reputation for cowardice and brutality that was visited upon the world in the Nineteen forties I'm John bachelor this is the John ... [noise]\n\nWho [noise]\nWho knows if\nThey die a diagnosis\n[noise]\nDowngraded\nJudicial misconduct complaints I'm only a princess Michael who's not we can to a tropical storm as that goes over south central Georgia ... port Florida well the storm system left a trail of destruction after making one for one thing that\nA you know you go back in in the history of storms like this and there were well very few that that can really equal this only a few that that ah the topic uh but uh often in these areas I mean it is it is that destruction and then\nI remember a a you know because we have along the Texas Gulf Coast I mean that's that has happened you've had strong storms come through\nAnd and then you see over the years a rebuilding and and new structures come come about or in in something like this with a hundred and fifty plus mile an hour winds\nIs you know often the case that those those structures those buildings\nAre just aren't rebuilt and and ah there you know often will be ... or they're not repair of all obviously some of them being devastated but but people will choose to decide not to rebuild and ah and move on often\nWhen you see that a ... I was having a discussion with a couple of people some of social media yesterday and you're talking about the the fact that when you think that\nYou know and it was the the outer eye wall where the speed of the hurricane is the fastest such where you had one hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds and I think that was roughly you take the diameter thirty five to forty miles or ... and ... and it moves probably anywhere between thirty and you know thirty to forty\nOr a depending on where it was a and I was trying to explain to people you understand this was like a forty mile wide tornado right right\nThat's the one thing that people don't I don't I don't think a lot of people didn't understand is the facts especially when that you know the winds in the outer eye wall it those areas\nYou just knew and and I you and I had gone back and forth because of some of the coverage on the ah the the Weather Channel and um you know putting on baseball helmets and things like\nThat that Jim ... you know at one point but a helmet on in in by the way there was a smart move because\nDeliveries yeah I Will not about that I always said why you would think they would do that more often even Windsor Seventy miles an hour I Would if I'm Out there sure covering it with the the debris flying around\nBut uh you know and a lot of them are reporting from around the vicinity of of Panama City in ... and really what the worst was to the east ... uh you know a lot of them and and you just knew what you just said well you know it it seems like if you're just a casual watcher you might have been saying well there's\nIt'll be a lot of damage your well that's because I saw one of the meteorologists they had down near there\nAnd you know she talked to a tent or and they just said no get out yeah get out yeah we cannot report you cannot report from a place where you've got wins of a hundred and fifty five miles an hour coming in you that you can't do right which was a very I sat there I said okay that's a very smart\nMove right well that's it when you know I mean that that that tells you that the strength of this storm or when the weather channel runs for cover that is that's one indication that that you should do a you'd look at the number of people that are that stayed behind did not\nUh leave the area did not evacuated a and you know of course our thoughts and prayers are always with everyone affected by a storm and and and uh and others like it or you know we looked at the uh the situation with with Florence we looked at the ... and and covering that\nAnd and the recent storms in taxes you and I I mean go going back to a Katrina really and then a Hurricane Rita\nA along the Gulf Coast and and and the storms I mean we have so much devastation I have a friend in New Orleans you know and talking about that you know people not coming back many of them moving to neighboring states like ours\nAnd saying you know there's you know there's I don't want to go back there's you know again if\nIf there's not going to be that that long term rebuilding effort that is a in some cases permanent devastation or you know not only the physical devastation but of course the economic devastation of of a region or like that my ah my nieces husband their station\nRight now going to school in Pensacola he's in the air force\nAnd uh I was checking in on them and they were you know they had a mandatory basically uh order to you know stay in the in a shelter and uh and stay there he's a he could not leave a but they had of course there on the base where he is\nA they had it set up of course to keep everybody say uh that's you know again I was watching a couple of the storm chasers that were alive on periscope and and Facebook Live throughout the day and one of them had plans to stay\nOr through the whole thing or two to give as much coverage as possible uh but uh he had already are in this building he had a huge sea meant stairwell that he was going to stay in\nA but it was the one in fact a drudge linked to to his coverage or that was that storm chaser but he actually showed everybody where he was going to stay within the stairwell and it was meant yeah I saw 'em and and so\nUm do you look at the I guess the job of these meteorologists and and people and and and a news reporters that are that are out on these storms ah they often stay right there in their hotel was right there close to the beach in fact the that's where the weather Channel's staying at this hotel\nThat was right there on the beach or in one of their locations and\nThose are buildings that are likely a severely damaged although they are bigger buildings and can withstand a more damage than the sum of the other smaller buildings\nAre coming up here just a few minutes after the bottom of the hour\nWe'll talk once again to meteorologist a meteorologist a Tom hale he's been with us he was with us yesterday he was with a with a for foreign ...\nUh as well and uh and Irma doing coverage for many years in fact in his career on hurricanes we'll talk to him and John travels well we'll keep us up to date on the latest uh as of right now Michael still hurricane yeah yeah there were seven divide on our sustained woods wins\nSo that puts it out a category one just just barely a and and we're expecting you and I are talking during the pre show meeting and you were saying you expect a and I think most do or that the next report which comes up here and I'm In uh in forty five minutes\nOr we could see that downgraded to a tropical storm\nAre still very dangerous uh you know if you think about uh the the uh a hurricane hurt sustained winds of Seventy five miles an hour while they're not what the what the storm isn't what it was in terms of its power is still dumping a lot of rain and then of course those winds are still damaging\nSo uh we'll get the latest from Tom hale and Jon Traub along the way coming up here and just that\nWe have an election coming up here and just a little under four weeks yeah um yeah breaking news uh and uh some of the polls out there some of the uh interesting a poll numbers up in the New York times yeah yesterday right we'll we'll get to that\nLook at the CBS headline ... also coming up here on the show prominent Democrats or reject taking the high road and as a viable political strategy that is yeah you know that sat for Hillary Clinton\nAnd uh uh and then the more I got my like Cory Booker or none of the former attorney general\nOh I'm a I've got Eric Holder oh Eric Holder yeah coming out and saying if they go low kick them yeah ah and ... and we\nYou know said this yesterday and the day before\nA in a while we said the day before it looks like they're heading in that direction and yesterday was obvious that that's the direction that the mainstream now of the Democratic party holds is that we're going to be it's gonna be instability it's going to be mop like tactics\nOr it's going to be getting in your face wherever you are and it's going to be getting that on camera mhm uh in order to what to do it and then uh at you when you had Eric Holder going to the point of saying kick them that was really the first statement of using physical force\nAgainst your political enemies they seemed to have no shame and this is coming from not the fringe as as recently as even a month ago remember we had to call and somebody called up and said well not all Democrats are like that and we said well your party is\nYour party and that this was really basically going to where the party is being controlled by the left ... uh but now when it comes to instability and getting in people's faces and wanting to film it\nAnd and getting to the point of terrorizing people with a with a mob yeah how 'bout mob terrorizing people matter where they are\nThat has now become a mainstream mindset of the Democrats if you're a Democrat you know that this isn't again when CBS writes it\nYou know that even in the media are saying well what are they doing here what's your strategy right Hillary Clinton coming out and saying that Eric Holder coming out and and and and say in it and so here we go\nI'm Rand Paul and his wife taking on a Cory Booker for his for his previous statements and I still have not heard one\nOr maybe you may have heard it in one of the debates if they asked one of the senatorial debates I don't know I didn't see that but I haven't seen in any major publication where you had I haven't seen an any publication and make that clear I have it may be out there I haven't seen it where you have one Democrat come out and\nFrom the remnants of hurricane Michael our winter weather advisories\nSubsided somewhat from yesterday we will see some snowfall continue though on

his uh his career is covered a number of storms very few like hurricane Michael because there are very few storms like this one let's talk to in fact Tom hills he joined us right now good morning Tom\nGood morning by Tom\nWhat what is your I I guess first take away in terms of the size of this storm a as we ... we last spoke in our lives our which was the uh the five AM eastern hour on a on Wednesday morning\nUm it it did could you ever have predicted going back to last weekend that Michael would have gotten to a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds plus\nNo I wouldn't have I wouldn't have gone that far I Would have said that it was going to be a major hurricane ...\nWhen when it took its bad because as I shared last died all of the meter logical conditions favorable for this to develop and continue to develop existed um but for it to drop in air pressure down to nine Nineteen Miller bars putting it\nBasically the or the ... the third most in tents hurricane\nUm uh on record that to me uh it's kind of mind blowing a I would've never expected that this would have a lower air pressure than Katrina wow which was\nA nine hundred and twenty million dollars wow or or let's take it a step further I I I I I I'm about to the power of to train up but it was a pretty disorganized tropical storm when it came up through the Bahamas\nOr and actually I was in the Bahamas for that well and at that point I would've never never guessed that after it went over to Hollywood, Florida cut across Florida and then went into the Gulf but it hit the Gulf moisture that had been untapped\nAnd then the atmosphere with prime for that and so while in Nassau, Bahamas where I was a it dumped three\nInches of rain I was an off a at the amount of moisture that it dumped a nobody anticipated Katrina would be much more than a tropical storm and then when it came off Florida\nIt just exploded yeah and and and the thing about Katrina was it ... it grew to four hundred plus miles across it was enormous in size and Winfield [noise]\nBut then we've got to Andrew Andrew that came through in a you know Florida in the seventies Andrew was nine hundred and twenty two Miller bars it was even\nA little less deep air pressure\nAnd so here comes Michael [laughter] okay at nine Nineteen and so yeah yeah I I'm a I'm I was in quite surprised you know it was Nineteen thirty five the

Love the way I Love the way that my life has gone but just make that clear but you start thinking some of the other things that I\nCould love if I could you know that I really love if I could have a few lives and I thought to myself you know it's coming I'm thinking of geology and thinking of you know and you know what they do in the weather channel and thinking you know nature and everything else and what did I Choose\nI sit in a box lightened elated from nature with me [laughter] with you and and [laughter] and when I look at my life I say well what about being a geologist to or do what they do in the weather channel that would really be cool maybe that's because when you sit in a box\nAnd yeah here it's all your life or were were paid to think I Know people were laughing at that [laughter]\nI don't see why I just said were paid to think now it's always on the other thing is\nA a a would've been a and and I figured this one out in my late twenties when I was a basketball coach for a couple of years have been a great team ... of of a school is a great team at I Would have loved to to to do that coaching to me was uh a thousand times better than playing ... yeah and and so I look\nBack and say it but what did I Choose to do what would I rather than anything else exactly what I'm doing yeah sure [laughter] what I like what if I can get a chance to do whatever give it's not even seriously I Know I mean I I look at a number of\nThings my dad was a career military police officer and that was honestly I think I was driven to do that or for a long long time\nAnd it was my dad actually who kind of laid out you know okay this is how this will go if you're successful at it you know and and a number of things that he said if you want to do this and you know he got his masters degree\nUm and he is a you know he was in his day or a top military cop right so\nWhen he laid it out to me before coming to this job I was you know by was testing and everything and that's what that's where I was going\nAnd you know he told me this is the reality and you have to be prepared for the reality because it's even different between the the the the setting in the military which if you're on a base is very secure the differences as they pointed out in uh the Tom Cruise movie\nOr a Jack ... jak reaches act reach a if it's a murder all of the suspects are potentially are trained killers\n[laughter] right [laughter] that's a little bit different that was a great line that right yeah but the but I mean\nSo my dad was kind of pointing out that you know a number of things that that that considered\nTo consider and I came to this job um and shortly after and uh\nIt just kept coming to work and I'll quote another movie Richard Gere an officer and a gentleman nowhere else to go [laughter] I Know I'm not going to answer in a in a in a couple of months\nAt this job and and I love doing this giant to me that that's always Wayne's World yeah what oh yeah you're right at first but now we're on a limb as Chris Farley\nBut you know that was what was satisfying about this job is\nYou get to a you know in foreign people are when there is breaking news and and and storms like this uh we have experts ready and we can we can warn people in inform people\nAnd I said I think it ... and then of course the political discussions and that information I think is also key we've heard from a number of people over the years that talked about how you know they they listened and ah they have become I guess more thoughtful in there and their political views\nAnd I think that's a good thing that's all yeah that that's that's the left starts moving toward violence and and shouting and and what was it that Eric Holder or said if you know if they go oh you're in a low well you know kick them yeah right and and\nYou know when they when that happens again I don't know what it at at what point they come back if they ever do\nTo a civil discussion Hillary saying recently that it's the other days well when we when will return to a civil discussion that's basically her message and her statement\nI I think those with the debate or with the the skills to debate and the knowledge of the ideas on which this country was founded are always going to win\nWhen they go low we kick 'em you know when you were talking about it though what when when you know what\nThings that might interest you and uh this though when you talked about you know radio and I knew this when I was I don't know seven eight years old I knew I wanted to be on the radio ... that was dominant nothing else really entered my mind\nA bit like I said for years it's what I wanted to do I never thought I'd end up doing talk radio ...\nThank God I did because I I couldn't sit and talk about a star is born\nAnd Lady Gaga is wonderful performance every day and and abide by the way I haven't seen the movie so I've no idea what this wonderful or not I'm just I'm I'm assuming that if I'm working for music station I Would have to do that ... what a wonderful performance and the music was just wonderful not that look talking entertainment and we'll talk about entertainment once in a while but to do that every single day\nAnd yeah I have to be positive about what comes out of Bollywood and do that every single day would everybody knows that would kill me to be able to do this and articulate ideas and and uh\nThere's there's two things first off the people to call you and say thanks so much because I've learned a lot that's that's a wonderful thing to have wonderful thing\nThe other wonderful thing and people are saying might think well you can't really me that I Do is when people call you with extreme passion of how they disagree with you\nBecause I'm always amazed wow\nThey really care what I think [laughter] yeah I really I\nI always get that really ... somebody's really ticked off at me for something I said you're kidding really wow that that's interesting and so I said to me that and I know it's gonna happen but you know when we talk about the Democrats and the whole instability thing I Will tell you this\nWhen I'm dirt during the campaign because of the way that you and I you know we've always done shows\nWe don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat no uh you know we're we're conservative you know slashed libertarian I have a lot of liberal friends right and and I don't know if they'd come to your friend any more of a well we but we don't we don't care the the politicians that we analyze we don't care what your label is\nIf we're agree with you we will if we don't we don't\nA lot of people are bothered by that means even on the Republican side had been bothered over the years and not starting with Trump when we disagreed with him we respectfully disagreed with a\nOf when I first got to talk radio George Herbert Walker Bush ...\nRead my lips no new taxes [laughter] so it goes all the way back there with a with W we disagreed with a lot and and uh I'm with a a Trump a few things not ... you know and but the things that we disagree with Trump I Will say our core to our belief\nAs as conservative and free market or you know a a people when it comes to economic things and uh and so we may be passionate about it but the vast majority of what Trump does you know I ... what he actually does substance wise and the legislation that he puts forward\nAnd the executive orders that that he puts forward when you actually read into it on his foreign policy or I've been one hundred percent agreement wet but uh\nYou know to be able to do that to be able to go on and just tab you know the freedom and creativity oh I Know the porno mode to make that\nAs it seems that everything is getting on civil law out there mhm and things are going crazy I don't know what it is but it's like an adult would you agree with me we've never had this discussion seems like I'm getting less flak\nYeah because I'm\nNot really getting there are no I mean I there was more anger a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago or you know from the response that we you know the ... that I Would get from the things that I Would say ... very few and far between now\nWell and and I think the uh while the tactics clearly have changed and when the tactics change and they'd go the direct route as they call it they became they become a ... it's it's beyond a protester\nIt's someone who's going to be in your face and when that happens they don't have because why do they go there because they don't have a debate anymore\nThey don't want to have a debate I'm not saying this is the case where everyone on the left in fact I think there are plenty plenty of Democrats out there\nRight now they can't stand what's going on on the left and can't stand a first of all had no need for Hillary Clinton or or if they did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago\nHighly disagree with that kind of tactic and won't use it but the problem is is that that's squeaky crybaby whining wheel is always going to get the grease and that's where the cameras are that's where the social media is\nOf gaining control but I'm Wondering

is the downdraft translate some of that wind so we have higher gas and so for that reason alone\nAt wind is still an issue especially when it gets across into North Carolina because uh we talked about this for four days in advance as Florence was coming in that they had already had some saturation from a remnant\nA of a tropical storm that pushed its way on through and and of course when\nObviously Florence came through uh the low lying areas that are run up through a Fayetteville and a south of Raleigh that entire area is still very saturated John trout touched on it and he said trees are sitting in mud\nAnd that's exactly what it is we had ... that's the event that we had in the Carolinas with the very slow moving Florence\nAnd as this storm moves up through there I think there'll be a lot more ... and also there's going to be obviously a good deal more flooding now yes they're likely to get about two inches of rain in that area but it doesn't take much for a little bit of flooding to to\nReef read develop and [noise] it's west of there where the heavy flooding is actually going to be taking place up toward Raleigh and then back up a\nA up into Virginia\nA Lynchburg,

are currently eight six six Ninety run I well let's now tropical storm Michael but\nStill a very dangerous storm as a now we turn to a meteorologist Tom hale who joined us good morning Tom\nGood morning don't let that fool you right yeah because uh you you you look at the footprint of of a tropical\nStorm Michael now a which has been wreaking havoc on on a Georgia\nAnd headed for the Carolinas and it's it's the satellite photos or just a amazing or just startling and and and this this storm again still has plenty of energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update or within twenty five minutes or so\nBut the last update has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect in the next report that to decrease\nI Would think so it should drop to probably fifty if that\nUm it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop is reasonable although it looking at it and radar and just kind of clocking it I I I don't think it'll drive more than ten miles it might pick up a mile and forward speed gone to the north east it may be Twenty one miles an hour\nAnd I said earlier predicted it would exit the United states at about twenty three twenty five miles an hour [noise]\nUh but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia before it exits out of here yeah\nUm yeah it's a uh it it it's an incredible storm it let me give you a little kind of a broad overview\nOkay along the coast and the outer banks they're gonna see storm surge from the storm in the Carolinas of two to four feet that's\nWater inundation rice and then you can at high tide waves which could cause some problems it's not the biggest one there then it will be another one or not the biggest one\nIt will be feeder band soon we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes now these tornadoes and the feeder banned the feeder bans are coming in from the eastern moving off to the west so that kind of curbing from southeast North West and the bans have individual storms at 'em and they're moving it\nAbout forty miles an hour now those individuals storms are capable of brief spin up tornadoes\nIn the individual super Sal soon as we get into the afternoon those storms will be heating up in the afternoon maximum heat and that's going to happen\nPrimarily over the Carol North Carolina's where you're going to see that the greatest potential for tornado activity but it's a wind and so whether it's a to an addict wind\nIt's a sustained tropical force winds to forty to forty five miles an hour\nIt's going to do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage and it's got to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina or what has gone on his Florence and so it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed\nThat most of them because of the wind has been toppled over we've seen a lot of root ball photos\nRight on on television mhm so boom overcome the trees now what are the trees hit the power lines bingo\nSo we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand customers now that's they count customers is homes right\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there is only two people affected by every home and we know that number is low and and you're already a one and a half million people already without power\nAnd that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think the next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence\nBetween the Carolinas that over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers yeah and so we're going to get up we'll get over the two million mark on on people affected without\nAny kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power in Pensacola and just
