McFarland doesn't have power McCormack the sailors don't have power to fight off the check as they have to allow them to uh to do this well\nThat's the idea there is that they bring a too many people and it'll be absolute chaos and they won't be able to feed anybody\nSo who knows that this time whether that was true or not it happened several times but destroyers tried to feed the starving people right there much of the screen is going of course hundreds of thousands of miles inland to the famine stricken areas of or Russia but that they saw the the the um\nThe are starving right there who were I'm leaving their babies in one place and then coming over to pick up a grain of corn here or there or the other place and it was you know it was a terrible scene but it may be that there was had to be some sort of order in these circumstances\nOr the American flotilla depart from Constantinople in October a Nineteen twenty three I Hope I get this date rape right Bob they ... they don't ... them or I think but I'm not sure uh September October the fall late summer fall of Nineteen twenty three they leave their their docks in Constantinople the whole fleet leaves out\nNow for the controversy or the Armenian massacre and the debate about whether it was a civil war or not it's still raging today from you're looking over the notes of the officers and the diaries and the memoirs of the men who served in these ... did they have an opinion did they settled this or is it still unclear\nThe American or maybe you know are on the coast of most of these uh regions ah they don't necessarily see what's happening inland\nMore over there are a given orders by there are there are superiors including apple Bush for and so on a they don't necessarily see a exactly what's happened however uh some of the officers like the\nUh the captain of the destroyers she enough to uh to have their opinions originally\nA follower yeah bubble burst all they were be pro term but then they'd have enough to see that all of a sudden things are turning upside down and really the uh the uh the things that took place we're um we're much more on the side of the Turk a Turkish ah people are massacring or sending people again on ... marches\nAre there were others who are not navy personnel are mentioned in Bob's book the most famous of which is Allen Dulles who's there with his wife clover\nAllen Dulles was also there I mean he's representing the state department he's and he leaves lots of notes and diaries about these these also there to do business so there was\nThere was a double track there was a humanitarian work that's what we call it today but there was also an interest in ... in making good contact in good relations with the new turkey\nWith uh the survivors the sultan fleas and Nineteen twenty three and what's left afterwards is auditor turkey I wouldn't tell us did he have an opinion in his notes were the questions massacred was this a pug Rome did he have an opinion\nPeople would come and avoid blissful and they would go to the state department on his way home they'd be um and they would leave the notes with ...\nAnd so the dogs are able to correct blissful at least on the Greek the Greek a genocide that's taking place which they had seen which the Americans were talking about missionaries keep inland relief workers deep in England this mission stations\nAnd so on there it's pretty evident what has happened there are about the audio genocide I couldn't say about dollars his opinions where he is there\nBut the above what he witnessed Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen twenty three and there were clearly massacres of Christians because they were Christian\nUh yes and because they weren't you know a thought to be by the ... the Turks fought to be somehow a a dangerous and in fact the traders the Armenians were thought to be traitors to the Turks\nAmericans Black Sea fleet the U.S navy miss Warren ... evolution Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen twenty three by professor Robert ...

divide\nAll you can call it a policy divide to the political divide in this country today I think we did it went to this like ten years ago yeah what a ... this is the second time we've ever even approach doing this show what the hell's wrong with people what the hell's wrong with people eight six six Ninety right on [laughter] [laughter]\nAh [laughter] seriously because you're posting of someone's gonna click the like button a someone okay now that you're\nGoing to take it a step further you're going to take the child out trick or treating\nReally really\nThat's that's a good idea hey this is going to be funny\nIf this is my favorite line written on the story after initially taking a belligerent stand ... what big Kentucky man now says he regrets dressing his five year old son is Adolf Hitler for a family photo\nNow regrets it ... our regrets it here's the problem regret\nDoesn't happen sooner than the initially attempted to justify the costumes\nBy saying that he and his son love\nDressing as historical figure yeah OK airline and he condemn those who were approached and threatened him and his son during the party\nUnsurprisingly he beat bolt in take idly yeah does it cost ... by the way that the remember the father also dressed as a Nazi soldier to yeah I should I should point that out here\n[laughter] I'm surprised so many people didn't take kindly to the costumes Joyce who do you think and countless people like the social media or right so I\nKnow that that's a Sherlock moment [noise] now\nMy nephew I heard my nephew did a cool thing yeah I don't know where he got it but my dad told me that he came in he went to a Halloween party my nephew's in his early thirties ... uh it was going to Halloween parties shows up at my parents' store and my father said you open the door\nIf he gets there was Abraham Lincoln [laughter] or if he's got the top had he goes I don't know where he fought as you said but the ... the suit everything was perfect and buttoned up you match the door oh wow you want to show us the cost of it goes yeah but ... grams I Know you know the Gettysburg Address\n[laughter] he came to get the so my father told me if they're studying this time I don't know how long it was you said my father knows\nThe almost the I I think my father said I Know the Gettysburg Address he he did about a paragraph for me and he said he kept going and my nephew couldn't he couldn't get it only got about a paragraph or two and he goes that's all I Need and so he went to the party walk through the door and started\nWith the Gettysburg Address ... right ... and I'm like okay that's cool that's good that's that's a good one so uh I was going to go as a conservative talk show host over the weekend but I was invited to different parties mhm\nI'm not going well I mean and that these were parties on yeah I'm not going going where I'm not going to parties are dressed as anything\nWell like I said I was easy for me I was going to go is that that radical then very scary guy Gary Mac them or I didn't want to go as they are currently because on it up to use a tremendous amount of makeup and you know Greece and formula and like that to pay\n...\nA big barber moustache with the squirrels on the end so so there you go and uh I don't have that but you know you could you could try it I haven't heard a lot of a PC complaints this year I Know just don't go as Megan Kelly\n\nAlright that's never been acceptable on [laughter] on the show today we're just one week from the mid terms what I it we're one week from the terms is it just me mhm and our pre show meeting you and I said the sort of the same thing it's really quiet\nFor a long term election with everything that's when ... ... maybe it isn't quite maybe it's just with [laughter] you know the ... from cabin on everything else a caravan and everything else that's happened it's just maybe just a temporary low for a day or just see how like it's quiet yeah yeah I mean I I think right\nNow especially with the house seats you're seeing so much concentration in those districts are right now because the Republicans are just you know doing everything to hold on still the chances the odds are against that the Republicans would maintain the house but if\nA ... again the momentum has shifted and there's some things that we haven't seen in polls we we mentioned this earlier and at the end of last week and yesterday we mentioned it and at the end of last week as well you know there are only a few polls the pollsters aren't as active in the house races so I you know there's there's a lot of stuff we don't know\nUm could this be another Nineteen Ninety four or is a\nNext silver right you know is it is a is it pretty much a given that the Democrats are going to take the house we don't know but ah next Tuesday will be a very interesting day well I mean has said is it\nTo the point of the the ... the one woman or was it on on CNN who said that I Believe was CNN ... who said that uh you know a\nTrump has radicalized more people than an ISIS yeah right yeah now she apologized later on it's ridiculous the GQ column or\nA she was on CNN the the leader Julian ... is apologizing after claiming President Trump has radicalized so many ... of so many more people than ISIS ever did ... why did she apologized she\nMeant it she meant that when she said I'm guessing she thought of saying it before she set it and uh and thought that was a good idea and believed it and still believes it\n\nAnd you just wonder does this help motivate the Republican base when they just keep and being you know\nIt up and we spend a lot of the show yesterday on the\nOn the political divide to go back and forth between the tweets and you know who's to blame for it is a ... in in our opinion just useless discussion to have ... uh it's you know the person that did it we're not going to stop the heated rhetoric is not going to stop it has never stopped\nIn the United states from the beginning the insults are still the same remember we what we forget is social media amplifies you know the the crude and and and rude and\nOr whatever you want to go out of a ... called them you know Bob political outrageous\nAnd provocative statements are and so everybody gets their turn to do it so it may seem like it's more\nBut the fact is politicians used to have dual they used to show that each other\nWhen it got to the point of personal insults we get to this thing again where well you know we're doing things that have never happened before politicians are doing bills\nAs far as we know what I mean we're not paying attention to every house race in you know I don't know it it could be happening somewhere I'm thinking the viewership for sports is down and so that might be an idea from\nBattle of the network politicians take ten step towards turn around but it would be more into obviously we don't want anybody to actually get hurt but what about tasers\nI don't have a pain Paul's\n[laughter] well no but the taser has the thing you know where you're on the ground for a minute\n[laughter]\nI rounded look we're not you're not much good idea or not I'm

bugs or they might be a little bit crazy\n[laughter]\nLook you use your app and you need to you need to own it right\nYeah I Would have I just I I don't know if it's that look like we said I don't know if it's ever been used in the Senate race before\n... ... it's a it's a first but it but once you've used it there are two things\nYou either apologized and take it back in ... and and hope that everyone forgets and by the way everyone in this case will be everyone in your party\nOr you own it full on and say other behavior we saw during the ... thing was uh yeah definitely crazy then all of a sudden it no one\nNo one would hire her to a state senator saying that the uh state senator in the state of Missouri nobody's going to tie you as a federal senator to that person's remarks\nThe crazy Democrats was because that was the feedback they are getting from the undecided independent voters\nAbout the Democrats in the Senate of the United states [noise] yes she won't tell you the truth but that's the truth that's where I\nKnow senator is going to sit there and say I'm going to separate myself from a lonely no federal senator in the Senate of the United States Congress is going to even acknowledge a statement from a state senator\nOf their own party they would never mentioned it because they're not in the same level it wouldn't be even a topic of discussion the reason that Claire McCaskill used that is not because of any state\nSenator it is because we will repeat those again and again and again\nThere a research\nThey're voting research has showed that that the undecided a independent\nThe undecided voter in Missouri is concerned that Claire McCaskill is part of the crazy Democrats in the Senate which is tied directly to Kavanaugh\nWe all know that she won't admit it that's what it's about yep\nYep so\nI I just um you know here's the um the I guess the the situation Claire McCaskill's in is that she really is in that uh you know if you want to call her a moderate Democrat\nBut she's in that position\nThat we knew that people like\nFor a ... I guess moderate Democrats would be in right now\nYou're parties going full on they William Wallace up they've got the face paint and they're on top of the horse full charge\nIf you don't want to get on the horse and and be part of it then then that's on you but the problem is is what are you going to do hang out with Tim Ryan and Joe Manchin Joe Manchin can get away with it\nOr or let's just say he has been able to up until now\nWe'll see what happens next Thursday or next Tuesday but the problem is for Claire McCaskill is that no you're between a rock and a hard place because you can do on the behavior by your colleagues in the Senate when it came to Kavanaugh by your vote\nThat was your confirmation that you're okay with that kind of behavior and so that's the message you sent to the people in Missouri\nAh and ah to the caller that we had last portion of last hour that was talking about the you know our our our conversation when you know yesterday was on the political divide in in this country\nAnd then we got talking about you know the debate because we hear that we need to have civility and the debates and we said nobody actually really wants to debate and they really don't write a we have stated this for the longest time if you've been a long time listener the show\nThat that's the biggest thing that has changed in talk radio people actually do not wish to debate\nOr they'll get on and argue with you but they don't wish to debate the actual issues are at hand and the substance of\nThe actual issues we have dealt with this for the longest time we have not we become more fact checkers than than we like to be\nWe would like to discuss the the issues out there and the substance of the issues\nYou know you and I have a just a special affinity we always had the the show's history goes back to the you know the transportation and and trucking history and so that's always been a part of what we\nHave you know discussed on this show going back decades upon decades and so we're fascinated by how economies work\nBut as we said before economics is actually outside politics it's not opinion\nAnd since people believe that economics his opinion they believe that their opinion or if they're guy or gal is dating a certain thing that the print credibility of economics comes from the person stating that\nNot from the reality of economics I write one thing to do and I both I think would agree upon and that is just massively frustrating that people believe that economics is opinion based\nAnd as we've said before economics doesn't care about your opinion doesn't care about my opinion economics is the way that the masses the billions of people in the world and the hundreds\nYeah what I forgot what was already in ours would well well some were saying you know we have a hundred years or you know the late Stephen Hawking a was a hundred years to get off the planet a because Bob ...

want having commentary on CNN now before\nThe ISIS comments oh wait a while to get the person who said a ... he's a implied that he's having sexual relations with his daughter or that's the person we

problem with criticizing or you know the the person that they voted for president or the politician that they voted for we are not in that camp\nWhere in the camp a lot\nI don't have a I you know I I think Trump overalls done a great job there are things that I disagree with him on it gives it a great job in foreign policy one of the best that we've seen post a Cold War\nUh uh I think that on parts of the economy he has done great things we you and I both agree we would never have seen a Twenty one percent corporate tax rate right uh and we were not never seen across the board and by the way this comes from two people who under the Republican tax plan promoted by Donald Trump\nPay more in taxes\n[laughter] yeah ... ... you know it and you know the Trump said that they wanted to get a tax cut done during the lame duck session oh man God we don't know we don't\nWant another jak Scott arrogant I don't want another tax cut yeah stop it with your\nTax [laughter] stop it started\nOut right now it off in the Republican stomp on your tax cuts stupid tax cuts because lately when you do a tax cut Eric and I get a tax increase I don't know how that works like John ... not that I knew that get us one way or another dang it I knew they'd get us [laughter] for all these years have poured this is what I\nGet [laughter] the trial [laughter] it's good trial\nBubble we still agree even though our taxes increased we uh agree overall with the with the the tax plan without question\nBut some of the economic things we disagree with the way that the president's promoted tariffs than we've had some ... not really much debate on it because we explained the economics of it and most of the response and we've talked about earlier about some people even on the right not wanting to debate\nIt's well he's a great businessman ... that doesn't justify that's about an opinion\nIt's not an opinion on on the at an actual economics and so really people don't want to do when we have a ... when we talk tariffs really nobody wishes to have a debate on that am I Am I correct right I don't know anybody that's really wished avid debate\nA closest we came last week when a guy called up and said but yeah but it's helped my business and and and uh everybody works in the price of you know the the increase in price\nWill [laughter] [laughter] no they don't [laughter] it's lived\nWith him being if you wish that they would but when you raise the cost of goods and ... of goods and services artificially it hurts the economy somebody gets hurt right now you can pick the winners and losers when you put terrorists that I'm gonna I'm gonna do good for this position and against that business\nBut people didn't like Obama before but on economic snow but overall we agree with the president but when we when we disagree with him I don't believe it's hateful rhetoric is where we believe he's wrong which everybody should do we should not practice political I dollar tree and believe that our candidate does everything right\nBecause they don't none of them do ever\nSo make Eric great again\nLower my taxes [laughter] so ah but here\nIf this isn't hey what is it\nBy the way here's somebody who's trying to save their job or save the whatever money they get for being on CNN because she means it in her heart and think about this I think about how delusional you have to be\nHow out side of reality you have to be you couldn't look like the president for some of the things he's done that's fine and dandy we can talk about that in the arena of ideas sure to come pair the president and say he's worse than ISIS and that his followers are like the\nThe followers of ISIS the members of ISIS that will kill innocent men women and children is just as reprehensible and have filled more than\nAnything but I Know any Republican\nIn recent memory has ever said yes\nAnd and that is too because what again when we talk about the the ...\nWhat is it that you're trying to portray how is it that you're trying to label the president as a major and in this case immediate threat\nThat he is radicalized that it's not just him that he was radicalized a great number of people that are also a threat to you\n\nThat they would attack you the way that ISIS would attack you\nI I haven't seen now\nCorrect me if I'm wrong and maybe someone else has seen I haven't seen a group of Trump supporters shouting people out of a restaurant or even have you\n\nPeople wearing making ah America the great again hats shouting people out of a restaurant there there was some group\nThat followed pillows or that was a couple of weeks ago\nMhm okay\nAnd and by the way media league condemned by all by almost every Republican I'm there saying don't do that yeah don't do the tactics that they do don't do it yeah and I guess that's the only instance WW thing yeah okay well\nYou certainly get that at at the rallies but I mean where is where is the same kind of behavior\nI'm Talking about on the level that the left has behaved in which the leftist ... chasing them down at airports chasing them out of restaurants well the behaving landed at in the Senate\nOr the the thing that one of the things that got that comes up every time one of the major points it's brought up every single time and has for a while the Trump is creating instability by studying you know by being part of the chant lock her up lock her up lock her up as we've said\nBefore though that's not an uncivil comment that's a common based on the fact as we've said before of\nMany people believe in that Hillary Clinton should legitimately be in jail\nWell it is based on the fact that she broke the law that is recognized I don't know who doesn't recognize that fact right she just wasn't prosecuted for breaking the law\nHope the SP espionage law and the uh of trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act law by putting the server in her home mhm\n\nAnd we have gone through this ... the actual law and even told me said well yeah yeah but no reasonable prosecutor would if because we'd never fought an instance like this yeah because you never had a secretary of state that put a private server in their home\nTo avoid the freedom of Information Act and to allow foreign entities and she knows that she's smart enough former first lady former senator secretary of state to know that our enemies are looking for anything that's on secured mhm mhm but thinking and believing though that's okay\nWe know what the intent was he in that everybody knows with the intent was I Want to keep stuff private I don't want it to be documented by the government as is law to be archived by the government right now the lawyer for subject to freedom of Information Act right\nThat's what like lock her up about it's not about locking up because she ran against Trump it's not about locking her up because she's married to bill ... it's not like in Iraq because they produce the offspring of Chelsea Clinton who now wants is is expressing interest in front of him for political office\nWell it's not it's not based on rhetoric it's based on a fat right that she broke the law and that she is not above the law\nNow you may disagree with their analysis but you cannot disagree with the fact that backup what they are saying\n\nAnd so they use it by the way they used that every single time and the like the last month where I've seen them saying well let's see what you're saying that the lock her up lock her up that's on civil that's a no it's not meant to be it's actually it's meant to promote civility

Ninety read\nI welcome and a good morning yeah so you know and when we talk and analyze the midterm elections we've talked about the strong and weak points for the Republicans are and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing the Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have hit it too late but it's still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when a all of us I mean we here at at at our job at a put in for you know benefits you're the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it a Obamacare but you know premiums are are coming in now\nAnd we had said this back then that the Republicans left this thing wide open\nThat you know they did a horrible job\nOr a you know when it came to especially premiums that we're going to sky rocket\nAnd we said they got to come up with something as to what they are going to do when they really haven't\nAnd Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and so the twenty Eighteen mid term elections were less than two weeks away this was three days ago and many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters were not yet made up their minds at the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans to win the votes of these undecided voters in honor commitments to the Republicans were ready to support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken healthcare system\nAnd he goes through the whole thing that the should be Republican principles up for the book for America as a Republican principles for America's health and health care system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life supported by a health care system but it's simple to use innovative and affordable\nYou believe that every American should up his or her choice of the doctors and insurance\nThat meets his or her specific needs we believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost and quality of treatment options and that this information should be available to every American in a simple understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions about their own health we believe in protecting patients\nWith preexisting condition so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage we believe in the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs that dramatically or improve health outcomes fall significantly lowering costs we believe that a doctor patient relationship\nIs the center of ineffective healthcare system and it should not be disrupted by micro management from public and private bureaucracies we believe American seniors have ruined their health care benefits and that they their families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats are private third party\nPayers are middlemen we believe in a competitive healthcare market\nWhere private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare interferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps new medical breakthroughs provides less has access to treatment and leads to long wait times\nFor critical care we believe that the current health care system\nIn America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is much less effective\nAnd helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system in an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step towards a better future and then he goes on to the\nRepublican accomplishment so they go to the accomplishments you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nOr the or a six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passed historic VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio",
