something with like a ... hours he arrives in in Europe for the Paris Peace conference but when you get down to practicalities\nMost of these new republic's that are created across\nA central and Eastern Europe\nAll modeled on the fringe homes constitutional system which is awful Europe's most were now to democracy I'm from uh get going back to the French Revolution um and then the legislature has a great deal of old old power\nI'm the executive is deliberately week uh they see the constitution trying to avoid that nothing the podium if you like it from\nAnd so the governments are essentially formed us loose coalition soul shifting forces within the leg just such a um and that ... he's one which helps to weaken and undermine the new democracies in Eastern Europe\nI Would say that that is an example of that that's a demonstration of what happens in Italy\nIn in ... in Germany ... in Romania in hungry\nOr it is also striking irony that the right wing the so called fascists later called but the right is more dominant than the left but still it's the legislature and the fever of the parties to dominate in those countries do I say that correctly\nYes that's right but then what is the response to this kind of political turmoil\nAnd also the way that in some countries ... boycotted by the left 'em by the revolutionary forces that seem to be spreading from the new Soviet Union\nThe response is that we'll just say oh we need a strong figures who are not um bound up in corrupt policy politics in the legislature\nHence the appeal all I'm a dictator like will selenium of silliness the food's dictate that he has a huge impact of you're in the Nineteen twenties long before it\nComes on the scene and\nUm there is a feeling in countries that are not in any way fascist

is it written that way 'cause you don't have a written constitution you have traditions\nYeah we have a very flexible constitution which she'd made and remade to convenience I think some people would say about 'em\nYet at fundamentally um what is different about British political system from the United states as well as from the ... and he is that there is a tradition of a strong executive ... in the parliament the parliamentary democracy we have\nThe person who is prime minister\nIs the person who has a majority in the house of commons\nSo it's not that separation of powers as in your system and basically the the the executive is the person who can deliver the goods\nIn the assembly in the in the palm and um which may or reasonably effective government sometimes it squeezes out the ...

likely voter polls and and this happens typically when you get into this month ahead then you're going to see those those polls tighten up that's that's the way it goes people start making real decisions by\nThe pollsters start changing their methodology and one of the methodologies state changes going from registered voters to likely vote\nI don't know why they ever use registered voters that would be in his next time we get the on um got red ... rash groups and we are going to ask him that question you know why do they do it why not just stick with them with the with the more accurate one right which would be\nWhich would be a ... likely voters unless the questions that they asked to make it so it's tougher to figure out who will likely voter is six months before six months before an election right uh and and I don't know what that would be that they don't that's a good point yeah right I Am so um\nYou know we were looking at some of the different analysis out there what are the analysis that I was telling you about I'll I'll bring it back up here coming up a little bit later on the show but it was really interesting saying\nThat in a normal election for example that you know and this was talking about Ted Cruz and uh uh Robert Francis or working here in ... not in in the state of Texas and it said that\nAnd and you were talking about the ... the average went from a toss up to\n... yeah they well they had the ... the state this is our state Senate race went from toss up to ... ah ah leans Republican\nAnd it will it end if it if the polls keep dragging the way they're trying now it will likely go likely Republican before the elections\nAnd as a and they the some of the analysis of looking at said six percent of Republicans a will in an average election ... will either sit out the election or vote for the other candidate mhm\nAnd they made the point that if that six percent of it was just a normal election and that six percent which is a huge amount mhm all decided to vote for a walk and\nHe would still win by five hundred and fifty thousand votes cruise would still hurts would still witness\nYeah yeah I'm looking at the the breakdown of it and the the uh the history of of those waters because you look in El Paso in his district\nUm in in El Paso county\nIt's it he can run for that house seat and keep that house seats as long as he wants it back to work\nYou when you move out to the you know the the broader much broader said of course the demographics changed drastically\nUm Dallas County All right you might win that uh there's in fact you if you looked at the polls I'm sure Dallas County would show going for him Travis County Harris County so those are Dallas uh Austin and Houston\nAre respectively if if you're if you're not familiar with the counties\nBut that those metro areas are tons of support tons of money coming in from uh the packs but he promised to or not ah except uh in terms of that and and and not he while he promised to reject the the the pac money I guess in\nIn earnest but you really can't reject pac money pac money\nAre ultimately I guess but the the point being is there's a ton of a liberal money coming from out of the state a ton of liberal press from out of the state\nUm and of course uh the the make up the demographics in those those areas that we talked about a bear county in San Antonio\nUh same thing so you've got all these are blue counties\nAnd these metro areas and and that's that's kind of the breakdown of it and he'll do well and and likely win and those that were that were mentioned are and some other counties in or districts\nIn the state but ultimately it comes down to the broader stay as it always does and uh right now it's got an according to our she leaning Republican\nAnd looking at a tendency of of for example you know as as we look at how did the cabinet thing and uh how might it have you know change the way that that people are looking and you look at the CNN the tendency race ah Marsha Blackburn against a a Phil Bredesen\nA British it was up by five ... democratic challenger back\nFrom the poll taken just from the eleventh of the September to the fifty he was up by five and a from the twenty ninth to the second\nBlackburn up by five ... from the second to the fifth which took us to Saturday and write a note tickets to friday friday yeah black burn up a ... that's a Thirteen points movement in a matter of a a matter of a month and that's why we've always said we don't really\nWhen you see plus or minus ... ah you know five or even six or even seven and it doesn't give you an indication\nAs to you know how the polls may tightened and this is the time right now I mean I'm Talking about right now in the election right is when you get a much better idea we always hear from our listeners that polls are never right mhm that is an incorrect analysis\nOr you know\nPresidential elections for example you and I really paid attention\nA front in two thousand eight two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and after the election saying how many polls were close and normally you find usually a a three or four of the polls were probably one or two we're almost dead on and three or four pretty close then you have the you know some of the outliers\nOut there and we always bring that to you after a presidential\nElection but the polls actually do do a good reading in the ... there were a couple of polls that were\nDead on they didn't have Trump winning ... because they just do the popular vote they don't do the electoral vote\nOr but they were dead on us to the vote mhm what Hillary won by what two percentage points but uh and so there were a couple of polls that were dead on but they didn't figure out the electoral college so they didn't figure out in those states in those particular states because they weren't doing that electro electro college\nAnalysis right so uh but they had the the actual vote count which again we come to presidential elections from now on if the Democrats if a case of Cortez doesn't succeed in getting rid of the electoral college a sign of a you know a\n... will will they started trying to figure out are doing more detailed analysis and ah because you've had a you know a a Trump you know have this had his victory so right it'll be interesting to see what what happens there will go be going over some of the polls but yeah the un says that we're doomed\nUnless we pay the amount\nBy twenty Twenty one hundred ... two hundred and forty dollars\nTax on a gallon of gas okay\n... no I Know I here's what I Will commit you would you I Am willing I I cannot speak\nMy children grandchildren great grandchildren or anyone else in my family

I've explain you know what what their background is\nEvery one of them know the fact that Dianne Feinstein could've kept a secret they look at it and they said the Democrats lose across the board here the Democrats lose because they could have kept quiet\nThey could have kept that she was she claimed she wanted now they're suspicious as to who's telling the truth here but they said even if you believe Dr Ford\nAnd that she really truly wish to keep it quiet then the Democrats completely betrayed her Dianne Feinstein completely portrayed her\nBecause as he just said and he's a democratic strategist\nThe Democrats had the chance to keep it all quiet to fulfill her wishes and still do an investigation and they said no we don't care about the woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted and wishes to have her anonymity we are going to use her\nAs a political football we say to that earlier\nAnd I'm sure there were Democrats dating down on a there is a democratic strategist saying the exact same thing that's what will hurt the Democrats is because that's what he as a Democrat believes that they have done\nWell and that's the damage that's his job is to assess the centrally\nDamage what works for them what doesn't work for them\nAnd it is not it did not work for them on any level\nBut not only did you have that situation where they clearly leaked it to the media then beyond that you had the overreach with the two additional accusers coming forward and ultimately the nail on the proverbial coughing in that\nThe sweating the allegation that came across from her by their hands through her lawyer ... that was not only overreach but it was clearly a tactic by Abernathy who clearly has it out for this current president\nSo I have to ask this question because you know after on on Saturday on on on Saturday when I heard it okay\nWe're going to you know where you're Jerrold Nadler okay if we take Congress we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach and I thought that would die out because I thought to myself well that's a pretty bread a bad strategy\nYou have lost in a variety of ways here I don't think this is a win for you so why would you go out and attempt to motivate\nThe right unless you believe you would motivate the left but still if you could impeach them you're not going to he's not going to leave you know the his Supreme Court seat you would need to go to the\nSenate now ... and this is the question I was asking does the house or the\nDemocrats who believe that they would be part of the house leadership and that would be the head of the house Judiciary Committee\nA you know under under you know uh what would go on it if if the Democrats won a the the the house um\nAre they saying that because they believe that the people the both of them are idiots and they believe that they believe that impeachment means we can take them off the seat\nOr\nDo they believe that this will just motivate their base and then they'll completely drop it if they win that they have no intention of of going after impeachment\nHim they'll scream obstruction by the the Republicans that that we wanted to get it done but the Republicans wouldn't let us get it done 'em and that we still want to get it done a it is one of those campaign promises that is definitely going to fall short while the applicants\nIf they had to if they had the the the majority of Republicans couldn't stop an investigation of and people\nWill not an investigation the investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing is it's the promise ultimately what that you'll remove him from the bench\nConversation I usually agent Mesa say Seventeen you\nKnow it has often said that the suit makes them in and I've been making my students in America and the very same New England factories since Nineteen eighty seven when I lost my first collection for over Thirty years my goal has been to help American men look and feel better when it comes to their own sense of style and now\nI've created my luxury flagship store in the heart of Manhattan that's forty nights\nMadison to do just that I'm Joe civil booed and I've always believed in the quality of service of the great men specialty stores or the past and now you can experienced that first hand with distinctive one of ... shootings impeccable tailoring and luxurious fabrics from the finest Italian meals and while you're at it\nBe the man who makes the suit and try a custom made offerings of tuxedos suits and Kashmir jackets for my black label collection so me me at the corner of quality in style or if it's easier [noise] forty ninth and Madison Avenue\n... some ...

after he announced this\nUm and he'll talk about it or you know no doubt while he's in our eye or the you know it it is the corn state\nWhat he's proposing is\nRaising a not a mandate on the blend but raising an language on the blend Fifteen Percent\nAnd then allowing wanting to change the credit for\nUh those blends so uh this is essentially would be kind of a cap and trade means ... approach well there are\nCredits though that they that the oil companies can buy okay oh they don't want to put like right now if they don't want to a a blend at ten percent\nThey can buy credits from other companies and then get the exemption so if they have those credits they're still compliance even if they're not lending up to ten percent he wants to allow them\nTo blend it Fifteen Percent and to sell it year round the pushback on selling it year round has been for eight Fifteen\nHas been that or eat ten even is that especially with the Fifteen while the more ethanol you have in the blood and the more smog there is\nWhich is why you don't see a Fifteen a guy's widespread and even the ten blend\nUm but the they won eight Fifteen to be able to be sold year round voluntarily and incentivized through changing the credit situation with those lenders\nWithin a company so does it take to complete mandate offer you still mandated to they were ten percent there the ... the mandate is still ten percent so then it would be Fifteen Percent but the credits would give you the the incentive to do it even though I don't see\nThe oil companies are not ... they're not responding to this a proposed ah it it is just a proposal now but they're not they're not responding it at all they they don't don't\nCare for this idea does does this increase the tax payers subsidy\nFor ethanol a ...

Martin helping you run more efficiently as rape hunters number one goal our friends in the panhandle and Big Bend area of Florida keeping a watchful eye on hurricane Michael\nIn fact uh so is Westwood One meteorologist John ... who joined us live right now good morning John ...\nGood morning guys so yeah we're looking at the possibility now of a major hurricane a a a hurricane at the level free or above that's greater than one hundred ten miles an hour hitting a in in about twenty four hours from now\nWhat changed over I guess a late Sunday and into Monday the forecast seem to change and showed the potential for the energy increasing in Michael what what was it that we were looking at or I guess you guys who were looking at a that showed that change\nYeah well one of the things that are well a couple of things that will slow down a hurricane would be a wind shear we don't have that one of the things that will slow down a hurricane would be colder ocean temperatures we don't have that or a lessening of low pressure none of the\nNone of the data that we'd like to see that we'll see uh lessening of strength is a is a part of this particular forecast now\nSo uh that's where we are getting this rapid intensification as we move from a category one to a major category three storm\nJohn where do you see a hitting on the Florida Panhandle cause most\nLike talking about the yeah we're talking about the Big Bend area somewhere between the\nAppalachian coal which is down on a state road Ninety eight over to um oh just north of saint Petersburg let's say but we're going to see some road closures definitely guys will see I'd ten affected from Pensacola to Tallahassee\nWe could see sections of I Seventy five shut down the right to in the Georgia or Florida line area so are truckers are going to play an important role in this thing getting supplies in and out of the region there'll be needs for diesel fuel and some rebuilding efforts\nYou know with Florence we talked about the rain event\nThis will be a rain event and a wind event uh we're looking at ah\nThe possibility of up to twelve inches of rain all within less than twenty four hour period of time in that Big Bend area\nWhat about storm surge what is the threat there\nBig time or we're looking at a storm surge and wave heights in and around the a five to\nTwelve foot range with a a major category three storm so that's going to have its impact certainly coastal erosion we'll see folks with a coastal interests uh with uh the maritime industry and folks with homes along the return affected so will definitely see some storm surge effect\nAnd I don't believe we have a full moon right now but if we did that would increase the likelihood of being under a higher tide certainly inundation being grader\nAt this uh Michael's moving quicker though than Florence it's a fast moving hurricane\nYes just slightly faster so it's expected to a move into that area and make landfall as I mentioned in the Big Bend area we're looking right now about eight to nine o'clock tomorrow morning and um [noise]\nWe just hope that everyone hates the warnings we've got several I mean we're talking thirty six counties I think now under a some sort of a advisory either get out or get ready to get out and of course the state of Florida it's been under the state of emergency now for uh about twenty four hours\nAs we look forward to later in the week we mentioned Florence our friends still in recovery mode after Florence what can they expect in terms of rainfall that might affect them later this week\nYeah we'll see this system move right on up through Georgia and then into portions of South Carolina and particularly southern uh North Carolina so not good news for folks trying to dry out in any of that area from South Carolina into North Carolina\nUh we'll see not the twelve inches but certainly are between three and five inches of rain but we got to remember those those are creeks and rivers are swollen there the ground is already saturated so any amount of water not good for the Carolinas\nWestwood One meteorologist drawn trout ain't got no thank you so much for your time we appreciate it you got to just\nA John Will be on that for us in the in the coming days of course in a world keeping it will be keeping us posted a lot going on there of course in Florida we just want

about it uh you and I said I'm we don't need to be at the table how about the scientists that are on both sides of this have the discussion\nBut the ... the problem with that as the politically driven

of coastal properties has the largest factor impacting hurricane risk today a whopping Seventeen trillion\nIn property now exist inside the U.S storm surge zone where is Al Gore when you need to be continued All right the climate change crowd has become enamored of coastal development because it creates a constituency for doing something about climate change\nWell not exactly for doing something about climate change but for throwing more money at coastal dwellers and calling them victims of climate change for the benefit of generating media coverage\nOf climate politics yeah wow yeah no that's a ... or ... genius way ... altogether because think about what that what what is done\nYou know if you if you look at that and and that's that's what happens if if you look at those you know

right what's that would be now think about what it takes to replace that right\nNot just insurance but then there has to come after the insurance there has to come public aid inevitable well the left has used that\nUh and the emotion behind that because who doesn't want to help wild than it is okay this is because this is happening because of climate change\nAnd so not only will we again continue the public aid that's not going to go away but on the other side of that it's the poor public money into in tax greatly\nThe American people based on the theory of man made climate change which is to say oh I don't know we'll start with forty or fifty bucks a gallon tax\nWill start with and that that that won't be the end of the tax I mean if you if you look at it there'll be taxing this is why they wanted you know that it's not necessarily because of climate change it's because you can you can implement the taxation at levels before the retail level\nIt becomes a compounding tax like the vat tax this is the kind of policy that they want until you have a centrally tax the poor especially and the middle class because those are the groups that are affected immediately and greatest\nThen they become what even more dependent\nOn government and they quote home and Jenkins when the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and
