bachelor show\nI'm John ... so this is the John ... show Bob's everybody keeps the website behind the black we're on to space engineering but first we're going to celebrate celebrate earth rise day what the heck is that book\nWell okay you know I wrote genesis started Apollo away and Apollo it was was of course the first mission to go to another planet right and when those extra ... at that planet the Christmas week of Christmas Eve actually Nineteen sixty eight they witnessed\nThe first human beings to witness an earth arise and they took a bill Anders took the first color picture Frank Borman took the first black and white\nAnd those are some of the most important pictures have taken and so I'm a bill hotel who is the author and a dentist and a good friend he put together a website called celebrate Earth Day he's trying to convince Congress are frying make or break that Christmas Eve\nOr thrives day to celebrate the taking of this photograph he put together really ... website which I really liked because he you know includes aspects of genesis there including excerpts from the new audio book um\nAnd and so that's what this is about is trying to celebrate that first interview the earth from space by human beings as it rises above the ah from behind the loan so that's what that is John and of course it is a great this Nineteen sixty eight\nThe Apollo and mission none that when the space race should the Soviet Union but it was a great American achievement this is what America stood for them to show the world we could do things better\nAnd we did something to remember\nIt's based sac said no space sex said no to the U.S government money for Falcon Heavy that's a good decision Bob\nThis is a long time ago this was in ... there was a presentation given by one of the chief executive engineers and he and the presentation\nOn prompted pointed out he was talking about Falcon Heavy and some of the history and how we got there and he said Falcon Heavy we did not take any government money in fact we turned it down they will government agencies Asians say watch who are willing to offer us money to help develop the Falcon Heavy\nAnd we basically said no we're going to do it ourselves when it's done you can buy it when it's ready and will charge you for the service\nAnd he pointed out how that's important position to take because if you take the government like they're going to start telling you what to do and he they wanted to be the free position to make it for themselves\nAs they wish to do it and I think this is something that all private companies should take a lot to space sexes model is the right model don't don't become\nA captured by the government builds your product sell it to the government but then you'll have a better product you can sell to others the government's not going to allow you to do that\nYou attended a business meeting in the region for space industry but you've got balloons\nIndustry where you live right\nYes this is where world view exists is a company that's building and strategy ... long lasting stratosphere stratospheric balloons that can do reconnaissance and ... and also research\nAnd they had originally been trying to two tours in flights like this but they switched strategy to the research component um well the the Tucson southern Arizona areas put together a business roundtable space business roundtable each month late\nAnd I was invited to come and join it and so I went to the first one this week and they were talking about a recent a consulting report that the that the University of Arizona as well as local government had several venture capitals have paid for this consulting report on what are the odds of Tunisia Tucson to grow in the space industry\nAnd they talked about it so that was a lot of opportunities for the southern Arizona area to grow what struck me most about this isn't a flex the world they're reaches across the United states and the world that are doing exactly the same thing aggressively because they all see the space industry\nGrowing in leaps and bounds in the coming two decades and they're doing everyone wants to get in on it and I think everyone should want to get in on it there's a lot of money can be made here and the next few decades shot and this was a reflection of that and I was writing pressed by it and I wrote it up for behind the black or give my impression is is\nA NASA has some discouraging news about deep space travel do you follow it Bob\nHi this is a this is considered to be a garbage study to be very out if there's some truth to it but it's not a NASA study scientists paid for by NASA scientists say that traveling in the face will cause cancer in the store your stomach your intestines and they did a study simulating the radiation that would happen\nA over a short period of time making believe it was a long period of time and they did it on rats and they said oh the rats suffered greatly and so therefore we have we have to do spent lots of money for space radiation a medicine\nAnd this junk that what did they didn't include anything having to do with the actual shielding that's got to be put on these spacecraft and the simulation it doesn't really\nDoesn't really work Siamese face a dangerous but there's no reason to exaggerate the dangers widely which this study does unless they want to generate fake reasons for additional funding which I think was what the ...\nAnd ... says signed a in agreement with a private Israeli company to launch a lunar rover is this more outsourcing and we're going to see more this\nWell if it launching the role for the companies to wean itself if pirates basics to launch it\nWhat's happened is death signed an agreement to work with the rover and use that data for little kind of says all better to work in conjunction with them as well just put an instrument on the on the uh private rover it's just a future where um ... we're transitioning from having the government bill planetary probes to having to become a customer\nBuying those probes from private companies and that's what this is rarely private rovers going to do it launches in December ...\nBob them and he keeps the website beyond the black is the author of genesis which is available an audio form on John bachelor this is the John ... [noise]\n... see New York\nAs the Illinois Kevin fling football\nThat we wanted to go spend hours upon hours just touched on that one day\nWhile getting to the provider he realized he was never much good at throwing or running or country or even cooking yeah governs chances of blame pro football or looking like for so long very long\nBut he didn't hear helped I can save money on car insurance so he's which said\nKind of a touchdown best at least he was still good at that\nI'm waiting for humans [noise] how much\nFedEx delivery passion what we let her by delivering\nDiet dot coms\n\n\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefit\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering the test the problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research and then you have to go and have the blood tests done\nAnd then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way or the symptoms I could look for that would tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic feel will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out in\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health\nThose are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they'd been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think and then we move is normal yeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health now can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\nWell more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about ... half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking that ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and\nIf you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nLet me ask you this when when people started supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products getting at five\nI use per day what kind of a difference and they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\n[laughter] yeah that's probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by wellbeing I just mean the\nFeeling that you know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month to month a month where you you know you get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low and and that's one of the first thing that\nAnd the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move are very similar to the clues we had for heart health are going to talk about that later but but people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your moved the higher you live closer to the sun so the higher the altitude you live at the better your mood\nAnd mood improved in the summertime some mood improved in the summertime and worse than in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this spot in the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people\nThis is what they found they found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven times\nEleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold ... at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life\nTo make you feel a difference when they start to supplement Ropper language she takes about a month I let me let me get this special offer because I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you've got the vitamin D at the recommended dosage the five thousand I use per day\nYou've also asked them to combine it with their omega three fish oils and there's a reason for that I Want you to explain that the synergy you get they seemed to make each other even work better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good for you pay for shipping the shipping deals pretty good\nYeah when I approached purity I said you know vitamin D needs again at the special form of vitamin K the expensive foreign vitamin K to it needs to bore on and I want it to be the patented bore on and it needs magnesium and it needs think\nAnd we'll talk about why that's important but then I said it also needs fish oil there to work together synergistic like\nAnd this is what I Want you to do I want you to give away a bottle of vitamin D a month's supply that sixty capitals in a bottle of molecularly distilled ultra pure Fisher what I Want you to give it away for free and they kind of laughed and they said okay I Will do it then\nAnd they asked me why and I said because in a month most people will feel the difference and they'll come back for more but then I said you know I don't want any Nineteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want any fourteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want to\nEven a nine Ninety five shipping and handling when you get less than five dollars they agreed to a shipping and handling charge you for Ninety five to four Ninety five you get a free bottle of vitamin D a month's supply of the complete formula one you can't buy anywhere else in a month's supply of fish or\nWhat are you going to lose right right what do you have to lose and the reason the purity agree to do this is because the executives there now themselves have been on this formula and they themselves know and that you'll feel so much better after a month that you'll come back for\nMore it's one thing I like about the surety their old school they put their money where their mouth ... they do business the way companies

the following some have advertisement by purity products these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA whose products is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any diseases [noise]\nHello and welcome to the show I'm your host Campbell we've got a fascinating program for you today or yesterday says if their use use molecule in the human body and he says this molecule abuse happens to be concentrated\nIn our skin hair eyes and joins he says this is a substance not only dramatically influences are appearance of the words are younger how healthy we look but more importantly our physical strength or flexibility mobility\nIs our ability to do things ... things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance and how new breakthroughs are allowing us to get it back and keep it\nAs we get older I here's our gas to health or journalists to bill ... bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about\nTyler on a ... acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan where people maintain high levels of EJ and are famous for their ability to define the e gene process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with you pat and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic gas it supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support\nIn particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said free offered today from purity products no strings attached\nThis is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H ... it it makes the well is babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice\nThey never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smoothing skin thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose the men do\nAnd you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back and of course parity products for years now has been talking\nAbout ha and they have a new formula just for the joints H H joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone that's what age age is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... fluids\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at a laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's gotta be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but purity products\nIs introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives or their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill Saudi about ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells\nThat connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose\nThe substance the scaffolding that the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we didn't get into a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our heights we we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know positive daily on was looking\nFor a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it and of course I Want everyone to think of having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the\nHa is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles the thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue costs ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement non drug stores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it well\nHere's Brent writing says no one at parity products made an outlandish claim about ha joined formula but three days after

more fleshed out the love stories intact but what are you going to come to pretty woman and goat cheese they don't get together at the end of version you don't want to\nSort of like\nYou have to keep

football baseball softball a part time of FedEx I get my health benefits there and I spent a lot of time doing a sports\nWhile I did a a a tournament during the spring to a baseball tournaments\nUm and I was actually on the field in a thirty two hour stretch I was on the field for twenty three of those thirty two hours [noise] um\nI had two two breaks where I was able to go to the hotel take a nap and take a shower and after that tournament was over normally I drive home from a tournament get home and getting out of my my uh truck when I drove in my garage\nQuite often I Would create them up\nAnd it could hardly move to get in the house\nAnd the this tournament was especially rigorous just because\nOf the compact period of time um and then I'd wake up during the night with cramps a I Would you know get up the next morning the very stiff stiff usually take me a day or two to kind of feel like a back to normal well I I got out of my vehicle and I was aware I wasn't cramping up\nA and that was that was a good thing 'cause I I'd I'd had about a three hour drive from this tournament not on my truck came and took a shower\nA went went to bed that night and I slept to just use regular night's sleep I wasn't didn't feel exhausted I slipped about eight hours got up the next morning and uh it wasn't until I was getting out of the shower that I realized that I was not ...\nI was a stiff I had in the wake and during that I cramping up\nAnd genuinely where when I got out of the shower I felt like I was ready to go with a normal day\nAnd my body was acting as if I had never done that tournament and that was the first time in\nOh doing doing a high school sports that I had to have that and I've been doing this for about Fifteen Years\nFiber and spice is just wonderful for my thoughts riots and of course the veggies give me the extra strength and a stamina that I certainly made\nSo I'm I'm doing okay I'm not complaining I mean I'm not a young person so I'm In my eighth

it's just a miracle I Can't believe that nothing I've ever tried contrite in and all those other products\nHave never given me the satisfaction that I get from this but I was on vitamins for years and years I\nI was an Atkins patients I've never seen results like this I really never have my body really needed something to push it along and\nI can feel it working I really can as I was holding on yesterday for a while when I called and ah I I Love the new dissertation that Dr Howard was giving up on the telephone I was listening very carefully\nAnd I think it's great to get that little lesson while they were holding on and so some of that crazy you're sick\nAnyway I told you a long story I I'm very sincere about what I'm saying I'm very happy I always have that feeling that I can still

system one eight hundred\nTwo four six eight seven fifty one that's eight hundred two four six eight seven five one or go online to balance of nature dot com next we'll listen to Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or a balance of nature in a conversation with nationally syndicated talk show host Kevin ...\nThis is a conversation you don't want to mess as they discuss a variety of important issues related to house I want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nIt has often said that a medical doctors and the in the world of medicine are very suspicious of nutrition and nutrition is ten by nature to be somewhat suspicious of medicine\nAnd the truth is there may be need for both in wisdom is knowing the difference between the two\nMy special guest today is none other than the creator in originator of balance of nature do he'll say he didn't create it you'll just say he discovered it Dr Douglas Howard's Dr Howard it's good to have you here would you say on an average basis that we're under nutritional lives in this country that we don't have the nutrition in our bodies\nThat um that they were originally created with to be able to fight disease on a natural level\nOh absolutely in fact I started specializing when I came back I I was being a foreign student affairs and problem Medical University in Russia for several years and when I came back I started concentrating more on the geriatric patients at that point in time\nAnd they came in and they they wanted to invest into us and so then I sat down and they said so what's your exit strategy how we can make money on this and I said\nMy exit strategy is is the epitaph on my on my tombstone affairs says made a difference in this world and changed lives and quality that literally that is my answer to this or we just couldn't ever get it together and there's and Lex got the experience of seeing many times for example I'm just going to put it out there but that\nPeople wanted us to go multi level time after time and companies wanted us to and then we would sit down just yeah I mean we needed to make money and we need to me right through the bad times\nDidn't start out as as a business you started this as a way to help your patients so that isn't the side of it was something you had to get a learning curve on and grow and kind of shepherd from day one and this is not something I never thought I'd be doing right I Love practice I Love people\nAnd so so as we started doing this do people started you know coming out of the woodwork and it's interesting that people then we would say no there's some there's a ... a major\nThere is a major health food chain that wanted to do something was but when they\nThey wanted us to change it every one every single time they want us to change it\nEvery single time they wanted us to to cheap and it because it had to be cheaper anyway there was this one multi level that they were doing something and then in some third world countries and helping people and they said you know if they get two of these is better than having to to cap so this is better than nothing and they started convince me does and things like that and so\nWe started talking with them came down to the line\nWhen they were they had already a multi level business they were doing they just wanted to replace it with a slugging play yeah and so we found out they were paying how much how much like was it that they were paying her bottle for those vitamins a dime\nA dime and they were selling them for sixty dollars ... and and so when and that was from the manufacture of other manufacturers are making money to that is right that was their prize they weren't even making themselves\nAnd they were then they ... they just had a good story they were telling these people that they would become into financial independent and blah blah blah when it came down to it they found out that over half of our costs are actually in the product [laughter] they were like whoa whoa whoa we can't do that and where you got to do this or that and that's when they came you know how about two and a cap of\n... obviously we could never make it work one of these guys that that was doing this one's funny just wanted to make something work\nAnd we even fluid flown out with our attorney 'cause we thought something was going to work with this and everything and and and it just and then it got down okay so how are we going to make it cheaper and I was like I won't change the product I won't change what we do we won't do that these are the studies I have this is why it works is how it works I won't change it we're\nAbout changing lives and if if you could sit in fact I invite you Kevin come and sit in on one of our our staff meetings and just to hear it on the phone is one thing that you should come and sit and see the tears that are shared by some of our our health coaches when they tell the stories of who they've helped to this week\nThat's what our staff meetings are about Mm they talked about their successes\nAnd we share them and we and\nThat's what we are and so any ways that we actually produce our own product we've tried we have tried to to get it out because we we thought it'd be easier working with government entities and things that that it would be easier to do that way\nTheir quality could not pass our standard right we wouldn't send it out we literally would not send it out I said you know give me those bottles I'll take them home and eat them but I'm not going to send those out to people\nThe or the fact that there's such a high standard in the a product that's in your capsule and the\nContent of what's in every bottle or is really unparalleled and so it's one of those things friends where when you get in and Dr Howard says this and the commercials on a regular basis but when you when you when you pop open the plastic live the bottle and then you pull the the sealed foil seal off\nIf you don't get a whiff when you open the fruits of very strong fruit there just just walked right up to your house and the same with the with the veggies or if you don't ... then you're not you're not taking balance of nature\nIf you don't get that smell if you don't think that there you can take one of the capsules or an open it up and taste it yeah I I challenged with anything else out there and you won't get it we don't use and we don't fill it with things like like alfalfa\nWell and the thing is you've picked thirty one fruits and vegetables as the combination of this all base going back to our previous discussion on the chemistry of what those specific fruits and vegetables mind you\nTake the three and three they work in combination and how they work in combination and you take those three and three every day you're going to be taking the equivalent of ten servings of a salad and made of those thirty one fruits and vegetables\nNow I don't know how much salad you're currently are ingesting but if you're not eating ten plate fools of it\nWith these thirty one specific fruits and vegetables in it you're gonna miss the nutrition that isn't the compact form of these caps with nothing but whole food\nAnd when you say whole food it's skin it's it's see it's it's all the stuff that that that's in that food when feasible yet writer example is the whole apple it's the whole pineapple now we take the skin off of some things right now that's not necessarily the edible portion rice [laughter] but\nYeah every edible part is there and it's very important and we're the only ones who do that we have to have that made special for\nA while and you have to do it under your control because again if you try to outsource that than even the producers will try to cheapen the process and you can't do the can't it just doesn't you can't run the risk\nFriends I Hope that this has been informative and helpful because you're not going to find anything anywhere like balance of nature you're not going to find stuff that

T. activity and you can compare before and after a PET scan and see the\nThe doctors never did a PET scan of the super ... place and the doctors never got cancer markers cancer markers or blood tests the blood test give you a better idea of what's going on to the body\nSo this doctors at the famous super duper place never got the best pictures of the patient with lung cancer they never got the best cancer markers in fact they never got any cancer markers the patient doesn't even now with cancer markers\nWord until he came to me yesterday afternoon [noise] so what did we do number one I arranged immediately we're getting a PET scan of the patient number two are getting cancer markers of the patient number three they understand now that his cancer has been growing on chemotherapy when he was told\nThat was growing and they should get more chemotherapy will getting more chemotherapy whether it's not working well obviously doesn't help the patients that say it's great for the pharmaceutical industry and great for the pharmacy and great for the doctor and great for the hospital it's great for everybody\nExcept the patient now why did I go to medical school\nI didn't go to medical school to help the president of the hospital live on Fifth Avenue I didn't go to medical school so the pharmacy and the pharmaceutical industry could make more and more billions of dollars\nI went to medical school to help other\nPeople it's very simple matter maybe it's naive maybe it's my upbringing in Iowa but I went to medical school to help other people see this man getting chemotherapy and his cancers growing at one of the biggest hospitals and they don't tell him the truth\nYes of course everyone everyone in that room was angry from the doctor to the patient and as\nWe were all angry and we're working immediately to remedy the situation and that's the work we do that's why it's so important for people with\nCancer to come to Thirteen eighty four broad way and get a

opinion with Dr leader but\nHe was happy at that big place\nThere was so happy because he thought the chemo was work and it was only after he learned the fact that he learned that the chemo wasn't working at all the chemo was poisoned it was poisoned going in his body\nThat wasn't working the cancer was growing it wasn't helping him at all it was operate in the hospital is helping the chemo doctors as helping the pharmaceutical industry is he was happy in his ignorance\nUntil he learned the truth and now I could tell you he's happier yet\nHe's angry at them but he's happy because she understands that he was getting a treatment that was not working\nSo if you want treatment like ours pinpoint treatment with a high success rate and unlike chemotherapy chemotherapy for lung cancer

back\nWe are back on what type of fifty nine year old businessman he single as the children\nThat is a mass others left hand the what's called the the door so parts is that the Palmer part is the part opposite that as a base of cell cancer it's been present for years has been row and\nHe came to me last year it was about a centimeter and a half now it's about two centimeters it's a regular it's ugly as doctors close to home that want to do Mose MOH as surgery that's where they\nThey cut it out sliced by slides like salami and then they want to stick in a piece of tissue from his box or from his legs right in the middle of his hand and I'll take the skin from his leg or as box and saw it on to this whole that's going to be in his hand and call it a day\nAnd he doesn't want that you can't really last summer we talked about all the options she couldn't decide what he wanted\nA he didn't want surgeries actually had this for several years he hasn't ever wanted surgery and he came to me yesterday because she wants non invasive treatment and die ranges I examined him and we talked about logistics and he's got a time to come back\nWe treat many many people were getting kids right now we're seeing a man with a very big skin cancer on his left face it's going up by the side burned by his ear and by the temple it's actually\nLooks like two separate skin cancers and we treat based ... all the time because so many people do not want cutting and bleeding and ... and patchwork and graphs and\nWhy would you want a piece of your ... your face you know just as better options and that's why so many people with skin cancer come here for treatment this is the work we do if you call our office and get our body\nRadio surgery booklet about invisible beams attacking cancer\nYou will see lots of examples around the I kept skin cancers bases subscribers cells throughout the eye\nAnd knows ... years\nBut we treat all over the body literally from the top of the head all the way down to the toes you have so much experience sort of a team fall for working together on this important project and we talked about a woman who's eighty years old she came up with her family\nShe came with her two sons and a daughter in law she was fine until last August when she had pelvic pain trying again to one of the super poop or big hospitals they looked inside the bladder they found an invasive bladder cancer growing into the muscle and she has a urologist scraping\nOf the bladder and she was recommended the conventional therapy to remove the bladder and I guess that scared or often she went to Mexico and she went to Tijuana for six weeks and that concoction spent thousands of dollars\nAnd nothing work I mean concoction never work I've never seen concoction work people talk about it and spend thirty five billion dollars a year in America it just doesn't work all these people are going to change their diet\nOr concoction or animas ozone or\nVitamin C. or acupuncture forget about it if I go to Mexico for vacation that's one thing if I go to Mexico to learn Spanish that's another thing that I go to Mexico for concoction street or cancer well she wet like all the other people and she came back\nWorse for I've treated forty thousand patients I've never ever seen a patient better off because they went for a concoction anywhere in Germany or Mexico or even here in New York\nIs drips and these drops and the animas ozone just don't work and well\nA couple of months ago shit hydro fro says that's a blockage of the kidney a few minutes ago talked about another patient who had bilateral blockage of her kidneys and lost the kidneys this woman has lost her kidney\nHer kidney is dead from the blockage so she went to Mexico for a concoction she's lost her kidney the kidneys that I saw the exams I saw the reports [noise]\nAnd then she started on chemotherapy for this bladder cancer she got in fact that just like the other person she got infected nearly died and she had a scan done a couple of days ago\nCame in with her new scanned through a couple of days ago showing the cancers growing in the long\nAnd the bladder and she's been in a wheelchair since the chemotherapy she got so sick from the chemo and the complications of the chemo she stopped walking her weight has dropped from one of the five to one forty nine\nAh she had this scandal or just a couple of days ago showed a lung the Joel which is growing before was one point five centimeters notes to southern voters most likely it's a metastases from the bladder cancer and also could be a secondary cancer lung cancer\nThe space and that nothing can go wrong\nIt was more like Apollo Thirteen\nApollo Thirteen except when you recover you realize oh my God as you look at the ivy that you're strong too and you realize you're never going to be able to go to the bathroom in the same way you did from the day you adjust the little toddler in\nFact now all of a sudden you're wearing a pad and sometimes it's depends and you're saying hey I understand if I was at my nineties maybe that's the result of just aging but I'm In my fifties and this is happening\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease stroke you're in good shape and still had all these complications\nOh there's no doubt and not only was a in good shape I wasn't heavy I wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that begin to creep up on you when you start the aging process and then all of a sudden I ended up with problems as a result of prostate remove all surgery\nBecause now when your basic functions when you can't you were in a when you can have sex when all of those things go a right not only does it affect you mentally\nAnd you get depressed but you never know when you're going to go here in the middle of a meeting and then all of a sudden you look down at your trousers and you had an accident and now what do you do\nGrab a sweater and wrap it around yourself and run off to the new rich bathroom and then you always carrying around that depends\nWith you and you're saying why did I Do this to myself and my ... and he said no I'm not a mask I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery is something fantastic don't\nBelieve the hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those is you ... to me because you're not part of the old boy's club you are independent autonomous and you've taken a route in which you're providing\nYou'll patients painless methods of recovery fully\nRemaining able to function as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate cancer\nYou know there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing robotic how do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars if I worked on in the auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota and you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow\nI may be scarring these people I may be turning them into a person who can no longer physically\nFunction why am I doing this when there are other remedies and why are they doing it because this is their business they are surge and all they know how to do is cut\nOut your prostate gland that control so much of what a man does and I would suggest everyone out there of void that at all costs don't be still not don't be a dummy like I was get that valued second opinion from Dr ... because he will not abandon you he will get you back on track and

dot\n\nYou're living in what we call an energy deficient state your heart needs co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle your brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system\nIt supplies energy to your lungs to your liver so needless to say we need all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten in your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nI mean you could eat sardines and Mac rolling peanuts we're co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell documented the utility already actually quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two degrees the co Q. ten and the research will know why he's proud of is cutting edge combination purity cause of their co Q. super boost formula what can actually do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I like that so I adopted the term\nIt's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular\nBut when you combine them indeed and this spectacular this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage the cardiovascular benefits\nBenefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and endurance and aerobic capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on beat a boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting we're talking with Dr Allen pressed me know that you present tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten decision\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for the you know I hear I'm running out of gas I got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is that keen nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a pencil and paper and the unity of you are listening we're going to give out a phone number here it's just a few minutes purity products is a tremendous offer on their new co Q. with was very tall formula\nAnd I'm going to give out that information to a few minutes to get a pencil or pen ready right now let's continue our discussion with Dr Alan ... no ... you used an recommended cook you tend to patients your patients for decades you practice but no story gets better\nWe see in a ... a researcher merging onto a spiritual Harvard researcher ... ... healthy aging suit you tilt purity combined the spiritual blended with the co Q. ten you hope you do you want them to give away a full\nSize bottles for free and they finally agreed to that but how would you distill the benefits of you had to list maybe the top\nThree or four reasons to take this formula what would they be\nWhoa you know I don't know if I could do three or four mocked but how about ten or twelve reasons\nThat looks to\nNumber one without a doubt the energy the indoor ends the stamina I mean just stopping there my gosh I Love that you know I mean who wouldn't love energy endurance and stamina\nBut there's more physical performance cardiovascular protection cardiovascular benefits but as we go down the list I'm going to talk about immune support I'm going to talk about increasing anti oxygen levels in your body\nHow would protect cell membranes and end some addict function\nAnd there was just an amazing article on co Q. ten ability to decrease the rough innocent fine wrinkles in your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you a three I gave you a little bit more than that\nWell All right even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very tall blimp purely products how many glasses or read one is equivalent to how many would have to drink a day to get the same boat as it\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day\nAnd that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet\nYeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you could well I don't know but I but you'd have to drink to the glasses of red wine a day\nYeah [laughter] me about how many capsules I've got to take when they do take multi vitamins I take a short\nWhile you just need to take too soft gels a day and that's really easy to take in the best time to take them is writing a book for a meal so you can take you know one before breakfast one before bunch or you could take them together but all you have to do is take too small soft gels right before a meal well\nNow that the person on a pause for a minute remind listeners about this amazing free bottle offer that's going on and how can we afford to give away a free bottled today with all these cutting edge ingredients I mean this is a full sized model

you want to pay attention to especially if there was a man and your life but first\nLet me ask you a couple of quick questions you\nGuys did you know according to the Mayo Clinic after the age of thirty you lose about one percent of your testosterone per year\nAre you concerned about maintaining healthy testosterone levels as you age you don't like the idea of staying healthy fish in energized right we've got a breaking story here today with Bill sorority a lot of ground to cover\nAnd it's part of the purity twenties it the universe read there's even a free bottled give away you won't want to miss out on so stand by a bill Saudis on the line he's an author\nOr spokesman in a high level advisor for purity products use on the cutting edge when it comes to nutrition great story bill welcome back to the program\nYes at in this story is but the guys today but also for the ladies who have a man in their life and I I Want to get their attention and a special way of ... they say that men really only talk about for things which has cars girls' sports and money so how 'bout this dies let me get your attention\nMen's perfect multi from purity products it's brand new so let me tell you this ... going to send you a free bottle hold on for that offer\nAnd I'll tell you what you get your favorite baseball player will deliver it a red Corvette well not really but then I get there and can you remind talking today about a big male subject testosterone we want to read that up and your body\nIt's all about men's perfect multi from purity products\nNow has been a jerk testosterone levels typically declined but research shows that we lose about\nOne percent of our testosterone per year once we hit the age of thirty and it can affect our quality of life from our our energy are like ... to our strengths were libido testosterone is kind of a master switch no\nBill recap white guys should aim to keep their testosterone in a healthy range and bill you got a surprise for us to you discovered she mineral that promotes the tea so that's a big deal I mean who knew\nWho knew and why did they tell us sooner and of course we really couldn't do much about it we need to do it in the context of a multi vitamin 'cause we meet in a ray of nutrients to do this and that's why we're talking about charities reformulated perfect multi from in the men's perfect multi we didn't know\n... well no essential mineral magnesium has a positive influence\nOn our testosterone levels here it is from the international Journal of endocrinology and it says males wear the impaired magnesium status\nAnd low testosterone levels may benefit from supplementation why did somebody tell us and how much magnesium does it take that the cats because you'll feel a little bit of magnesium\nAnd multi vitamins and you need about two hundred and fifty that three hundred milligrams of magnesium a day for this wonderful effect and you need those coal factors\nWhich are zinc and vitamin D\nAnd ... and they're all in this wonderful new men's perfect multi purity products\nAnd I had no idea 'cause I'm up here in this age range and just looking at all the changes go on in your life if you move on and various things are going on in your body\nYou have no idea you're just slowly losing your testosterone you're losing you because that's who you are guys it's your testosterone that keeps you interested in the game we want you to be in the game every day\nAnd of course you can do it with magnesium now at I'm going to stop the show right now okay I Want I Want to solve the stop and run down to the health food store and see if you can find\nA multi vitamin D a three hundred milligrams of magnesium and you can't we did the work for you\nSo fellas this is the way to get this it's the man's perfect multi pat Campbell will be telling you how to get a free supply here just a moment but\nThis is a real game changer for all of us guys it really tells us how to day and the game and that's the important part is it's centered around magnesium\nBill you coined a phrase you call that healthy cheat you want our guys to think about me teeny and sustaining or better yet recapturing you're healthy\nTestosterone levels you see that in adequate intake of magnesium or even a deficiency of vitamin D or low levels of zinc were more on your kind of Rob most of the healthy testosterone we deserve so let's drill down\nWhat are we seeing the science does does a low level of magnesium impact testosterone and can we get enough magnesium in a multi vitamin\nWell you're not going to get it in a multi vitamin the only one that has it now is a purity man's perfect multi\nAnd it's important to have all these coal factors and I'm looking at the science we're on my desk and this is pretty exciting now one of the things they show is yes guys we can go out and exercise and boost our testosterone levels what's interesting if we can't get out and exercise every day they did this study with magnesium and you know\nIt actually increase testosterone levels even for the guys who are sedentary so\nYou know it's really important to see how all of this work and here it is international journal and ... there's a relationship\nBetween magnesium and testosterone and also our bodies strict there say here it is international journal endocrinology again magnesium exerts a positive influence\nOn ... anabolic hormone status which means are testosterone\nHere it is in the journal and magnesium research by the way magnesium has its own journal the only new trend known to have its own journal and and it says here found a relationship between magnesium and total testosterone that's\nJust published last year so we know that the relationship is been here the problem is\nHow do we communicate it because it's so important to get it in the context of a of a multi vitamin magnesium doesn't really work without vitamin B. six and one of the little secrets\nAnd of course where you're going to get to be sick with your ... is it of course in a great multi vitamin it's critically important\nAnd you're going to get these other coal factor so you're getting the picture guys we need these co factors to really make it happen for us and bore on this little ... you need about three milligrams there's five milligrams a day and then the charities new men's
