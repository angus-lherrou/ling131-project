Institute\nAnd what they tried to do was measure how many people died between September of two thousand Seventeen and the following I Believe was the end of February so basically six months um and the hurricane was of course at toward the end of September\nAnd what they tried to do is look at what would be than normal mortality rate over that period of time and then what was excess of over that and they attributed that to the aftermath of hurricane\nAnd this meteorologist by the name of John morale is who is actually born I think in New York but that spent quite a bit of his life in Puerto Rico is a Puerto Rican mother\nOn he made it very um a sensible statement that number one this is not how anybody measures hurricane fatalities\nSo to all of a sudden this extended the six months when hurricane fatalities are generally a measured in a shorter period of time is kind of disingenuous\nOn top of that you have this study at the milk and Institute you have another study at Harvard and you have another study at I think it was Penn\nAnd these studies can have different time frames and they they can they can use different methodology and his point was that for example if you look at the Harvard study there was a ...\nIt is a Harvard study came out and said that somewhere between seven hundred and some people and a thousand and some people were excess mortality and a four month or three months after the hurricane\nThat's a huge window and so what the reporters do is they choose the midpoint of those two numbers and they said this is how many people died well that is far from an exact science I'm an ... something similar was done it wasn't such a broad window but it was something similar was done with the milk and Institute and\nSo I just wanted to point out that you know you have the period of time\nDuring the hurricane that of course you you know off the obviously find bodies and people who have died that you didn't count initially and I think the government's count is somewhere around sixty four so to stand up to three thousand you have to start assigning\nProblems of the hurricane to um problems in the aftermath in other words it wasn't really the storm it wasn't a high wind\n... infrastructure and the uh the emergency exactly and that's\nThat's not how hurricane death are counted that's point number one point number two is to blame this on the federal government I think is really disingenuous when you look at\nThe way that Puerto Rico has been manage I mean I Would say over the last Twenty years at least um you have a lot of the of basically\nRun away populace them on to the point where the electricity company was giving away electricity and when you don't collect a revenue for your electric company you can't reinvest you can strengthen the grid and you become extremely vulnerable to the storm\nThat's what happened and this is a government run electricity company this in a private company but\nI don't remember correctly that the executives in charge of FEMA's office in Puerto Rico were locked in politically to the governor of the island and that a lot of blame shifting has been going on because that's political advantage in Columbus in Puerto Rico nothing to do with Washington\nYeah I mean I was very critical at the time of the hurricane the week after of the way that FEMA behave but not I mean you know the implication is always that Washington doesn't care about Puerto Ricans but in fact the the guy the guy on the island was a Puerto Rican the guy who was running the operation\nAnd he basically in my mind you know messed up because he was saying in in the weeks after the crisis when they're still with no electricity for dialysis patients and all kinds of basically the hospitals were in really bad shape and you add\nSick people who need it electricity and he said well I had the generators but how was I supposed to know that the companies were not going to be able to deliver the hill now I think that's preposterous\nYou're an emergency management ... and he was a Puerto Rican so this wasn't a you know the idea that that bunch of people over here on this on the mainland didn't care about Puerto Rico is she said that FEMA messed up and the and that included have\nMary we have thirty seconds is Puerto Rico learned a lesson is there any indication that they're going to be prepared for another storm thirty seconds\nNo I don't think so I mean they're still blaming a President Trump and not taking responsibility and until they when they're rewriting the narrative in this way it indicates to me that\nThey just want to keep shoving off the responsibility for managing the island to the rest of us\nMary Anastasia Grady for the editorial board of the wall Street Journal she's the America's

they got the the on the whole thing and then make some more comments during the day on on Tuesday a you know what I'm saying uh Canada and Mexico will be great trade partners um but\nWhether you said

they're capable of doing good work but they refused this is where this is how you get Ted Turner\nAnd Greenfield\nA the the ... yeah the former ah what was he the the CEO was the ... or the the the president of CNN whatever he was a he ran CNN for\nFor Turner both of them saying dance too political and these people see them cells that CNN right now see themselves as part of the resistance now we always knew that but you know these are people that are on the right to do these aren't the Fox news type\nSaying that and I miss them as MSNBC to for some reason they've been kept out of the discussion completely\nYeah yeah right right and and it's I think the\nYou know what you're saying here really is that I mean it goes back to that ... the um the the editor at ... at buzzfeed\nSaying this is how we see are you know are journalists now ah and for the foreseeable future basically as active as this is what he was saying that was the message and that's exactly what you're seeing right now since saying\nWell we got a ton of things to uh to uh talk about the background check could be completed today was interesting the story that said you never discussed this in our personal meaning or where the lawyers for Dr Ford are are are\nSaying look she hasn't been you know you haven't interviewed her yet yeah right and I saw store yesterday saying the FBI may not interviewer because she's already been interviewed right what we keep ... and we even because again\nBecause when you're talking about the FBI everybody thinks about an investigation this is not an investigation\nRight so all they are looking for is more witnesses and any new information\nWhat other what this is are there are a you know are out there what\nWere the allegations that were made\nRight what what\nAllegations that were made again here or in you know that that uh you know in the hearing that caused because it was after the hearing okay we need to add the FBI do further background check okay what's the new news out there\nAnd I started thinking I said why wouldn't they interview and I'm like oh it's not an investigation into background checks they already know what you said\nNone of them now I don't know I mean they may interviewer but I I was thinking well why wouldn't they and I went oh she's already been interview and then as you interviewed by the Judiciary Committee and so what they're looking at is okay what other information out is is out there what other witnesses are out there what did she say at\nThis hearing right and we will go talk to those people because she's the one making the allegations she's the one that testified under oath we don't need to interview well\nShe made her statement in fact she ... to the Senate\nIf there were any thing uh that she anything else you wanted to introduce introduced to this\nScenario to this a process kick it actually she can do right now she could what she could still do it and uh she and she had the opportunity to do it last Thursday but the great point you just made she still has the opportunity is still open right\nAnd so what they don't have is they didn't have we didn't have witnesses making statements\nSo she's the one making the allegations so they're checking out her story mhm\nAnd if she doesn't updated with the Judiciary Committee the FBI maybe looking at this and saying well there's ... look this is allegations she made ears and people she mentioned we talked to those people we give you a report well because here's what the people said we don't need to interview her her statement is on record we need to interview all the other people\nThat she made the allegations against or claimed that they were witnesses\nShe has made her statement right we have that and if she wishes to change it and go back to the she can write a letter to to the Judiciary Committee\nStating a here's more information and then the FBI can go check that\nBut they're not doing a here's the point they're not doing a background check on Dr for no they're not\nThey're doing the background check or on the allegations that she made against Kavanaugh now we've\nTalked in recent days about the the possibility of her perjuring herself by telling a different story to the FBI but really when you think about it and you're back away from the whole thing and you look at the\nThe entire forest and not just the the you know the trees here than you or ... you very quickly come to the conclusion that there's likely zero political will to go after her for perjury unless she came out and said everything I said was false and my testimony right and I\nI admit that I was lying about that they they would then but but any kind of you know variants in a story to the FBI likely is not going to be pursued a by the chairman a Grassley or\nBy anyone in the house but I Know and I you you see Grassley saying they want to investigate the fact that her boyfriend says something ... something else because she was asked to specific question have you ever helped anybody in a you know two calls from them about you know how to take a polygraph tests and she said no and her boyfriend is said yes but I view that\nAs putting pressure on her credibility politically in order to get the votes look wants to vote San\n... vote has made if he is if he is confirmed it's done it's over yeah rights ... this is this won't even be a topic next week we'll be back on we'll be back on the Russian collusion\nYeah yeah yeah it is not a ... and and I guess this is it is\nIt the whole I on the ball thing this has to be the process is is really to determine you know or whether the those handful of senators actually uh believe he should be said it or not and that that's it that's actually the only question here\nThe media and the and the left in the media and social media want you to believe it's about Kavanaugh and you know and and you must think that he is you know a rapist\nOr whatever they want to label him as now that's how you build political pressure but actually\nJust what a five weeks out from the mid term election it's it is it's different because they're going to look at the polls it's the polls that build that pressure and I mean\nThe polls on the candidates themselves not whether they believe you brought us the poll the other night of while at when you introduced the facts to the case more people believe in fact it was a majority yeah if uh if he's yeah he said it\nYou know fifty fifty seven percent than\nA change what they think and then when asked well if the FBI comes back with their report because once ... once they were told that the three witnesses to cooperate and witnesses that she named\nThan cooperated they said oh okay well then he should be confirmed and then right there was fifty seven percent then they said well if the FBI does the background check and finds out no new information was sixty percent of Americans believe that he should be confirmed\nA at a you know at that point and of course you're gonna forty percent of America as we said you know roughly it's forty percent Republican forty percent Democrats\nAnd the rest of her into the other twenty percent is roughly independence and that's where you're trying to uh you know that that's who you're trying to convince those in the middle ... those are the senators were looking at as well right and so uh that will that that you know who knows that that poll probably was looked at by a lot of those\nAre a lot of those or a senator so I'm a you know I I think the whole thing of the doctor for commit the you know a perjury ... on that will\nRemain a you know will remain an issue I don't know whether they would ... I I doubt I'd be surprised if they if they confirmed him this weekend mhm I think it's all done yet either get a lot of them they and they will do anything they they move on they move on\nTo the uh the the the next thing they move on to promoting the fact or if I was the Republicans I Would promote the fact that\nYou know we you know the the we you know the Supreme Court you know we've got we've got the Supreme Court going up to the ... election and that would be promoting NAFTA irks me NAFTA whatever it is now us MCA [laughter] yeah I'd I'd be promoting the the the the the trade deal and Republicans\nYou know uh you know we're going to be voting on a that before the term\nI'd be talking about all the positives and that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy spouses and you would reflect on what has happened you know in the campaign\nAnd I think that's what they would focus on at that point uh I just don't think that they would look backwards who knows I mean whether they could have a a a separate committee of you know continuing investigation as to whether she did commit perjury\nAnd ... and and not make it high profile because there would be no
