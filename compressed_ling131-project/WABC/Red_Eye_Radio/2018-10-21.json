so just to to scream against the wind and say that things can change is is naive\nWell then I guess the discussion needs to be on what what is Americanism and I I I Can't get into that now but I Do think that they have to be some things that a country that that sort\nOf remain unique to that particular country\nAway money with that I agree with you on that there's no question and and look it do

from somebody rich comes to about Seventy nine percent\nOf the cause was sounded so how come for six years Bush was president nobody made a big thing out of court here's Obama scripted and nobody made there but what is the big thing now\nWell you know why because it's in the mid term elections coming up and it's Donald Trump you already know the answer that question and\nAnd what's also interesting is you take it from another angle to the number of journalists that have been killed by their own countries over the last well I don't have to go that far back and go back six months it's amazing when

the first place where a meritocracy took place as opposed to you know what\nCaste system you were born into yeah no I Know\nEvery every group has to be satisfied every you know whatever they are sexuality race gender has to be satisfied to placate it you know it's really destroyed a meritocracy of America\nYeah belly good that's a good call in and here's the reason for that too is because the Democratic party especially figure it out but if they segmented the population and and placate each one of those and pander to each one of those\nSections they could build a coalition the problem is that coalition is unwieldy as you see when they have the Democratic national convention and now you see they're going to twenty three\nCandidates are I think there should be more than that there might

when tour of Germany going down to Israel right now he claims he's trying to drum up business I think he wants more of an international\nReputation but right before he left for this trip to the timing couldn't have been worse this story broke\nThe two people that had prominent positions in his campaign or involved in one is Katie Brennan by the way I found out was on my show the Jersey matters she wasn't\nShe was part of a leadership coalition for the Democratic party very impressive young woman\nAnd so all this talk that she may be crazy and all this kind of no no no no no no no no no this this woman is very intelligent and very impressive\nAnd she claims that in two thousand Seventeen while working for the Phil Murphy campaign that another campaign worker and somebody else that was high up in the campaign al Alvarez who was part of the Latino outreach for film Murphy's campaign\nRaped her now this isn't like a a meat to accusations she did all the right things she went and got a

sure you're a kid shows that you are\nHad sex but it's your word against his so we can even say if it wasn't consensual\nEven there was no history of relationship between the two and so rather than even pushed the case forward\nShe dropped the case which is suspicious he's under fire right now\nMore importantly the person under fire is Phil Murphy and and his wife Tammy since he keeps bringing her into this conversation I'll bring er into because Katie bread and wrote to both of them like I said she did all the right things she wrote to both of them and said\nI really need to have a meeting with you about a personal matter something that happened this is during the campaign and they didn't even respond they didn't they didn't\nMeet with her so then Phil Murphy comes out because you know he's he's\nAll he's all into me too and and\nEvery single liberal cause at least in policy maybe not in action especially with Katie Brennan\nAnd he comes out and he says we are going to have a I'm going to get an independent prosecutor we're going to look into this I Want to find out oh by the way that I'm leaving out a big part of this\nNobody really has the appetite for it to talk about it

studies are showing virtually everybody has vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about ...

of the first thing that\nAnd the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move to a very similar to the close we had for heart health they were going to talk about that later but but people who live the closer you live to the equator\nThe better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun so the higher the altitude you live out the better your mode and mood improved in the summertime so mood improved in the summertime\nAnd worse than in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this spot and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found they found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven time eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold Veit at the University of Toronto actually did an interview\nShovel study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so and what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life\nAnd they can feel a difference when they start to supplement

a little\nFriend vitamin B. six is going to help boost the absorption four or five times so that we get enough of it and once it's there it gets bound up by a binding protein and you need some selenium to release it of course in the context of a great multi vitamin\nLike purity product new men's\nPerfect both the U.S have the selenium you have this like you have to be six had the magnesium

in ESL face the essays are called essential fatty acids\nAnd the two most essential fatty acids are the two that are found in fish oil da and eat PA ... the business and the fish oil\nPurity fish oil products have three times more concentration of these two key fatty acid than standard fish oils these are called pharmaceutical grade fish oils meaning\nThey're manufactured in one of only a handful

offered to the free bottle offer stay tuned we're going to be given up that phone number Jason let's get to ingredient number two because this will make us three super pill does something that no other fish oil product can do it actually lowers cholesterol talk about these plants demos explain how this works and why it's so important\nRight well I don't know anyone who isn't concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements\nThere is one compound one ingredient that stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical studies shown to lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL is the bad cholesterol\nHDL the good cholesterol though obviously you don't want to lower HDL plants they're all only target LDL and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in his little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level\nSafely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all since the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking Staten drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to that and\nThat and work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plants that rolls work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called\nMy seals into thinking that the plants they're all are actually the cholesterol particles so that might steal pick up the plants they're all instead of the cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles instead sort of just get pass through your intestines then you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them\nThe point is if you're on that and you can take plants they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants they're all to deliver the benefits as shown in the study\nThat's something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that were all on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever shown any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nJust about every area of health has impacted by these two compounds they are found in every single selling your body the ha is found in every cell membrane in your body including\nYour brain where it's highly concentrated ten percent or so of your brain by weight the dry weight of your brain is the ha yourselves can't talk to one another your neurons can function you can't make neurotransmitters once you start to replenish\nYour body with Colin thank you ten and with these omega threes certainly if you've been to fishing for a long time you can see changes that you won't even believe and it happens very quickly if like a plant that's sitting in the darkness that doesn't have any water you put it into the sun\nYou pour the water in you know within hours it goes from its wilted condition to a beautiful upright plan we've seen those types of changes and people\nJust by putting back the necessary ingredients and their health can be transformed\nFish oil is doing this now for millions of people across the United states you've got to get it back\nThis is a great way to do it and you get all the other benefits with the plants there all your cholesterol the coins on Q. ten really just a

body remembers with regard to smoking\nBeen thinking show I pursue a diagnostic low dose ready graphic imaging test to search for evidence of lung cancer\nLenny writes what's your opinion or their tests are available to detect lung cancer thank you lead and they in Queens so that's a great question and\nThe answer is yes if you're a smoker history of smoking especially between fifty five and Seventy five you're churn should cover your welcome to come here\nAre people who get imaging tests have a twenty percent lower rate of dying of lung cancer\nSo for ... the answer is yes it's a great

lemonade for bringing up that question which is a great one\nNo one talked about sixty one year old woman she's a black woman from Jamaica with high blood pressure and quieter\nAnd she has biopsy proven non Hodgkin's lymphoma she has cancer lymphoma cancer\nIn the back of her abdomen called the retro parent's name was diagnosed two years ago and she's had some tests showing progression she's had no treatment should a biopsy one of the big hospitals in New York City but it got to college just and then she'd by cancer doctors\nAnd she's been seen by some of the big super duper poop or doctors one who recommended by up to the bone marrow in one recommended no treatments has been watched for almost two years and she has for tea and who else or whether it's on our fifty two pounds just five ten\nShed some new had actually as a side of this condition she's up to date\nFor the pap smears I examine the woman and even with these little floats\nIt's not something that could be felt or no possible lymph nodes in her body she has is flick you a farmer and we talked about all the options are other doctors sad to say did not a this is a localized relatively localized lymphoma conglomerate of lymph nodes\nWhich we could easily treat and most likely we could put in remission maybe you successfully cure her this is the work we do so just because your doctor doesn't remember the lower Deborah studied\nAbout all the treatment options we most likely did and we would most likely tell you about all the options so for this woman she's most interested in getting rid of them far more with our visible beams are visible beams of radio surgery [noise]\nThis is the work we do every day we see so many patients with cancer as many people who never knew they had other treatment options until they come to Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nIn New York City so it was worth a trip in I Believe so these are the issues that we need to meet in person lots of people tried to call on the phone or the radio or doctor Lederman I have this but often\nPeople have never been told exactly what they have or where it is or the size\nCertainly most patients have never been told about all the options until they come here and meet\nMe me yours truly Dr leader but that's the work we do at Thirteen Eddie for Broadway and speaking of which I Want us to go to another man this is a man who thought he did the right thing and ended up getting not so it's the right thing let me tell you about this man is sixty nine years old\nBorn in Ukraine has two children a kid with his daughter has heart disease and lung cancer and the smoker back pain in the show he refused treatment\nHad terrible pain yet an MRI which showed cancer growing through the spine any way to ... months and months see what a pain killers and they went into kidney failure from the pain\nKillers while then they went through all of the big hospitals you had a biopsy showing Adam ... carcinoma kind of cancer belonged to travel to the spot and\n[noise] and then went to radiation facility and they gave them a dose that was so low they would not help nearly anybody [noise]\nMaybe it was great for the radiation doctor gave him to super low dose but if you don't give an adequate does than there is no chance to help the patient and that's what happened with this man he went to other\nDoctors gave him a low dose dose we'd never use and they gave them that dose of radiation which was too low to help that they gave him chemotherapy that he went to a super duper pooper scooper St Elsewhere hospital the given him into therapy\nAnd it's getting worse all the treatment is getting the radiation doesn't help the chemo doesn't have the mental therapy doesn't help you went to a super duper super famous place doesn't help you can step on his right like as paying into like he has control luckily of his bowels and bladder\nHe doesn't already numbness of his ... doesn't have any number of the legs\nHe's lost twenty five pounds he's gone from one sixty to one thirty five is five foot one these ex smoker equipped recently we just talked about smoking and how to\nAvoid death from lung cancer and smokers [noise]",
