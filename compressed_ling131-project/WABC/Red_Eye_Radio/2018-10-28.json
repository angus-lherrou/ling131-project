before the election will ten days before for what I'm ready to say all share it calms the election on that today\nIt's the Republicans will hold the house but not what you hear the going to hold the house and they get a hold the Senate folks and what you hear Steve said you know what's going to control\nI still I I don't think so I really don't think they're going to hold the house I Hope you're right I Hope you're right but I Will\nSay this the Democrats taking the house might be one of the best things that can happen to them from because then you'll have a villain then it'll have an adversary did he can really go after and I I think they're going to make the mistake\nOf putting Nancy Pelosi backup as speaker we'll see but I I think they're going to take the house and it's going to end up re electing Donald Trump\nJohn from Staten Island urine Seventy seven WABC\nBig ammonia Larry wanted you to work at a mentioned the bomber are going to be prosecuted\nAnd no matter what the they say it's part of it or not you know he did the wrong thing\nI Want to do well with the Democrats to stand up one bill is blue government buildings none of that guy has a college degree job making hundreds of thousands tenured maybe you should be given up like maybe whatever's wealth is to pay the tax dollars that he blew up all these buildings that I don't see the Democrats is good for that\nYeah and you know the Democrats kind of hit the fact that when the Republicans were shot up a a year and a half ago by ... by a Bernie Sanders reporter you didn't you didn't hear him blamed as much as you're hearing Donald Trump blamed for this\nBut that guy specifically said it was because of Bernie Sanders and his support for Bernie Sanders he hated Republicans and he actually shot people\nOr John [noise]\nA lot of hypocrisy [noise] a lot of hypocrisy in the media on this but again uses on either side what somebody's in saying there is a [noise]\nYou can't political rhetoric shouldn't be able to send somebody up there and when it does you gotta blame the person not a political rhetoric we're coming right back with your phone call we have a few other job is including Megan Kelly\nAnd\n\nForth deadly shooting I suspected gunmen interrupted Pittsburgh synagogue shootings that left eleven people dance faces twenty nine counts including hate crime charges the community came together Saturday evening to remember the victims\nBack in two thousand twelve was titled partisan polarization widens in the Bush or Obama years it showed that the political divide has wide has increased every year\nSince two thousand and with the widening of the political divide political tension has intensified\nThat trend has been stopped it just keeps getting worse in the past\nCouple of years we've seen campaign rallies turned violent we're seeing protests that were anything but peaceful we had the beheading of the president's depicted on social media by Kathy Griffin\nAnd this this pipe bombing this this attempted pipe bombing is it the pinnacle\nThe hatred reached its violent climax of the baseball field were Republican members of Congress were practicing for a bipartisan charity baseball game\nThis summer a year ago\nThe gunman traveled from Illinois with a rifle and an evil mission and he was clearly deranged\nBut it was our hateful political rhetoric viewing from his\nHis smartphone his TV and his computer they gave him purpose house majority whip Steve ... was one of the by shooting victims remember it was the quick work of the security detail you got to detail cars you is leadership\nTo to Capitol police officers killed the government and they saved lives without them that baseball field would have been a killing field\nWhat I remember is is the next day even that same day Congress coming together with prayers for the victims and the promise both Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan saying this that they're going to lead the nation and more civil discourse yeah that lasted\n\nOn social media that same day as they were doing that it didn't matter\nYou can't bridge the divide that easily\nWith heightened that free all Democrats and Republicans were on social media while they were calling for more civil discourse blaming each other for the shootings\nIn post in tweets filled with hate and threats and of course the irony is that they were the examples with a full throated partisanship\nThat was really to blame and now a year and a half later that hateful\nBecause again fueled yet another Mad Men the Kentucky at another evil mission of pipe bombs in terror aimed at those he believes there is enemy simply because he doesn't agree with them\nAnd again are we really surprised\nWe have rightfully as a society demonized people for hate aimed race or religion or gender but hate and politics that's fine that's okay that's even encourage by late night talk show host Hollywood cable news even the politicians themselves\n\nLook there's probably after these midterms maybe beforehand is going to be another call for a rhetorical proves on Capitol Hill but it will again be shallow and ineffective\nAmerica all of us we've spent did this place of politics is a blood sport\nDo you really expect America to pump the brakes now\n\nBut perhaps Congress can do something a little bit more lasting\n\nLook I don't believe in the concept of hate crimes no matter how poor and hate is a mode of not a crime\nYou can't charge somebody with a hate crime unless there's another group that and of itself makes it not a crime but if we're going to have them if you're going to have hate crimes in the books\nIt's time to add politics to the list\nBecause politics is the new hate\nTom from Staten Island urine Seventy seven WABC\nHey Larry I just want to follow up with two topics you're talking about time especially with this Republican Democrat um one thing you have mentioned ... prior caller colder and says you know religion you know ... you get closer to the religion people on line you know back and forth on social media and you know but yet\nYou know you say this in politics and just what you had said Steve ... got attacked the pipe bomb or so it is happening and they all they all lashing out it'll have to go into a a place and blow it up it's happening already\nRight without actually yeah\nYou know and the other point I Want to make as you mentioned earlier about like um [noise] uh before there was like racism and ... and sexism you know what it's now it's in the form of politics yeah because if ... if I'm a Republican they call me a racist or you know I'm just using that as well if I'm Republican they\nCall me something else and it's it's like they took over that like you had said but\nIt's still exist because now they're making it you know some people make it as like your racist 'cause sure your public in or you're just because you're a Democrat I mean this is not really too far too far\nYeah their name calling and the fact that we can't look I there's a lot of people I disagree with that I can talk to and I can have a conversation with and I can hear their point of view and I hope to your mind and we might never convince each other but at least we can uh you know stand calls in and Russell calls we have other people to call but I don't agree with it all\nKnow what and you may want another good point you know I I just wonder you know I work for a major company and you know what I got to be honest with you when I sit around with people we have people from other states so we have people from other countries coming I don't talk politics\nBecause I don't know what their views are I mean it's very sad were in the state and I think I don't know where I heard it on TV or something that I think they have more people talk about politics more than Russia you know\nDuring the Cold War you know back in the day that we were doing in America now which is very sad\nYou know it is sad and and thanks time and it's a shame that especially Republicans and conservatives seal sometimes like they have to hide as if they're embarrassed it if you support the president of the United states\nYou people are embarrassed by that and I know that many people that called the show that are avid Trump supporters saying I'm not embarrassed I get it no not everybody is but there are some people\nAnd that's why it was such a shock in two thousand sixteen because people we didn't even want to tell pollsters that they\nThat they were going to vote for Trump that's why it was such a surprise and people now\nDon't want to admit they're going to vote Republican so so when Steve from Manhattan calls and says the Republicans are going to keep the house I don't think it's going to happen but I wouldn't be stunned Howard from Brooklyn urine Seventy seven WABC\nHi I just wanted to say a lot of people may not know that Randall\nStephenson is actually the head of CNN now because he is chairman of AT and T. an ATM keyboard home box office Warner Brothers and CNN\nAnd the government is challenging it and maybe reverse but for the moment he didn't try guy was surprised 'cause I handle all that counts where I didn't church and I also did telephone engineering for select trick and I was surprised he is allowing\nThem to be that liberal because you wouldn't think telephone company even though they are an entertainment company now to want to get into that ball game but apparently does me when I look at it said this week and apparently he must have gotten permission to say it or he or he didn't get knocked down a power relieved by getting them\nYeah that was really is Steven conservative\nI don't I don't know but apparently he's a liberal are they allowing them to continue because I always go to CNN eat the salad\nA dry and you know drop it completely or turn it back into what Ted Turner had it as a real real good network\nHelp well thanks to laugh at it I didn't realize that I ... a TNT I don't think Stevens who can do anything right now because ... doesn't officially owned and that still has to be okay\nBut oh it was okay but they're still they're traveling with your good but he still went ahead with the with the uh a merger because you can't hold off because\nThey ... going through the court in a Washington the three judge court and if they were like ... they're going to take it to the Supreme\nCourt they may not want to hear it that's going to take a while even in the region Colgate Ninety Days or more so they can lead to hang around get talking about in eighty five billion bail which they borrowed thirty million dollars on this is the big money\nYeah I'm going to look it up right now as we're talking about it because because my ... my sense is he hasn't even moved in yet right he can't he can't legally isn't an easy they stay on the whole thing\nBut he's taking a profit from major be oh hold her it didn't if it was it in the paper and prove that they're earning the quarter\nAnd that's all from HBO\nWell no I'm guessing that's what they report it ... because he got HBO and he also has a direct T. V. but that he bought from Fox a long time ago we got the Warner Brothers were up at the end the CNN profit but then in Nineteen what does the word\nI Howard I'm gonna I'm gonna take a look at this and we can talk about it and the second Greg from do monitoring Seventy seven WABC\nSpewing venom at the top of her lungs and always going to try to blame Republicans and conservatives and even a lonely parts like me well cars on the radio because I get even with these much because I let them out of it are given the\nSame found medicine that that idiot on the on the benches view says why she tries to blame the trust that you know ... or ... and our other compatriots because then [noise]\nThey don't ... some crap\nAbout conservatives but when it comes to the side\nWhen they have to admit that that got violent bastards when long criminal records or sent stuff in the mail that can kill people or actually go out and shoot people because of their political views\nThat of course we wiped that that goes on page fifty nine of the New York times already going all the way in the back and won last that go ahead one last thing the fact that you and I are going to have I might lose that bad and the Senate but\nYou're telling me that they're going to take the house I'm telling you the Democrats are always going to take twenty or less seats so you want to bet man that is double nothing and you can either got to parmesan dinners or you got it from me\nI ... I don't think I don't think I'm going to take that bet um because because I wouldn't be shocked if the Republicans take the house I don't think it's going to happen but I wouldn't be shocked by it we're going to find that very early on if they're going to take the house watch New Jersey watch Pennsylvania especially\nIn New Jersey it is very possible which I wouldn't have believed two weeks ago there's five Republican seats out of the twelve there's five Republican seats the Republicans could lose all five of New Jersey if that happens it's done it's it's going to happen\nIn Pennsylvania because the Supreme Court ruling where they fix the gerrymandering I I think the Democrats are gonna think of a three seats now they have to get twenty three there's eight there I I'm not positive they're gonna take five in New Jersey I Would guess three I think Christmas is going to survive I think MacArthur is going to survive\nBut we'll see it's possible Abigail from\nQueens urine Seventy seven WABC higher I how I Am hey good Abigail\nUm I just wanted to point out all the red frog ... hard on mouth about social media fights\nAnd why is that that we don't investigate and keep up by all these students like the ... ... ... any time that an infant animals Twitter about the hobbies goals and ... and why people not to get it right around\nYeah no I agree with you I said that at the top of the show that it it's amazing that on Twitter add on Facebook\nThey are so militant about conservative viewpoints kind of point but then then this guy says he's going to blow up people the the person in Florida and there's other guy talks about hating Jews and how is it a guild use and nothing\nThey they they get nothing so I agree with you I agree with you completely and I think I Would hope that Twitter and Facebook because of this because a lot of people like yourself are calling them out on this ... they're going to look at their policies\nIf my ... author that around like Siri without Louis baggage that can actually\nSat on making video going on and on Twitter how are we fighting not and I found out he can turn out on Twitter refused to take him down and they thought now is not hate speech according to our lives and therapy that could you could look at it on Twitter ... her high terminal a little card game fate\nYeah a couple of people thanks a lot of the games are a couple of people have called to talk about uh Louis Farrakhan and and what he said Louis got up on Farrah Khan has been an anti Semite for a long long time and it said worse but the fact that he's not taking down your rights Sandy from Westchester urine Seventy seven WABC\nYou very anti\nHate it and I just I've been thinking about the um God you know if they had an armed guard at that dude that guy never would have got in there and you know when I'm also thinking I Know that they don't have a problem had an armed guards at the doors\nAfter the shootings so why would they be a problem before the shooting and what's worse on guard at the door or getting shot\nNo you're right I I don't look I have a problem with both sides of the argument that because there are some situation where you're talking about is reasonable having an armed guard at the door is reasonable I can I can I can get with you on that I understand that that smart\nThis ideas sometimes for instance remember the Aurora shooting in a movie theater yes and there were people that said man if the people in there just were allowed to be armed they would have been able to take out that shooter middle they probably would've killed each other now\nThat I don't know not that that too chaotic yeah exactly that\nActual armed guards at doors schools a synagogue churches your eye and a big bird the blind date was on the news earlier that can deal with him but he's talking about well we shouldn't have to have that in America well I agree but guess what we have that now\nYou exactly that this idea that we can get rid of all guns with this idea we can somehow lessen guns is not going to happen now not going to happen so we should deal with what we're what we have and protect ourselves right\nBecause they always finding the crazy people or whether they're legal you know they're always finding a way to do what they have to do\nSandy thanks a lot for the phone call will be back after this\nPerfect timing

to have you on the show such great information Sherry can you share with us a\nQuick study or to to sort of back this up highlight the science behind the elite asked his anthem that's found in as the FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD at biomedical research\nOr he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function and sell you the performance in the body he says actors Anthony simply sip heard at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance\nAnd accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science and sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams about this at the daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output\nAnd those who did not take it so they fight fast learn me remember this after that that is one of the few\nThat ... accidents that can actually neutralize free radicals even at the site of the mitochondrial membrane if like secular body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and organs on many levels so listen to this mark and there are fourteen clinical studies\nOn ... for brain how\nSeven studies on skin health fourteen studies on I help including research for depth perception and focus\nSix studies showing after that then supports cardio function forty two studies I'm healthy aging and cellular help and there's a ton of research on human performance to showing benefits for energy stamina endurance\nAnd this soft FX it's incredibly powerful and versatile it helps you stay in the game of life state energized active alerts healthy and even stronger\nValues impressive on so many levels so much information there and I know this last does and then there's about a dozen happens to\nI'm looking here I see it as a patent for promoting either health and reducing I achieved\nThere was a pet and for inhibiting the expression of cytokines in sales end up happening is on compositions were body fat reduction\nThere's one for improving muscle atrophy an older adult Sherry I like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrients magically do all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nYeah I Know it it sounds amazing too good to be true but it really is true many of the studies that I'm referencing\nHere they're available on top of that these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back the benefits of asked his aunt and by the way muscle output is better with us does that too and this comes from after that the research published in the international journal sports nutrition November two thousand and eleven\nThis was another study done with cyclists they took four Nelly ... than than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists improved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race\nI mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also burn fat more efficiently which makes sense based on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked the FX will promote and improve power output in your muscles I mean I tell people asked FX\nIn strength and power out it it's transformative if you like\nEnergy and this was found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nAnd so much great information you're just tuning here we're talking with pharmacist an author Sherry Turkle here on your host mark Larson on his hand ribs study that you mentioned I understand there this involved what a twelve milligram dose\nAnd they saw on Ninety three percent boost in hamstrings and people who struggled with though at tennis elbow now that's a big deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis ... what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this uh Ninety three percent increase in a person who has some repetitive stress and there although it's an almost doubling enhanced strength\nSo just think about all the things that you do in your daily life picking up groceries your kids your grandkids gripping the steering wheel of a car playing golf for tennis gardening or riding a bike a doubling of grip strength makes a big difference\nI mean when you take after than than you get stronger you feel stronger you have more energy and difference if you play

I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion from Dr Gilead him in because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear\nFried and hysteria shed and they said oh you got to get that planned out of control so much of what Amanda's in his life robotic surgery as your ... and I've been kicking myself in that took his ever since maybe the\nDome is decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow you've been shot up with ... show bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat five times with ... someone was trying to kill ya oh yeah and they almost succeeded but when you had that robotic surgery\nYou said oh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of depends with my body\nLiquids and I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trials is I feel like a little infant who can't leave the crib and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt like wow what an idiot\nI was not to go to you Dr Gilead him in and get that second opinion now you were shot up hollow shell bullets but the complications what was worse actually the removal of the prostate gland that control so much of what Amanda's in his like from simply going to the bathroom\nAnd urinating it was five times impossible to stop and other times it was impossible your date\nAnd then to try to have the urge to emerge forget about it it was Mike I might as well have been a unit was input tent and naturally that plays a head game on you so now you don't even feel like you're a man any long ago it was\nJust a bad decision and I didn't have all the guidance and I should've come right to you for that second opinion because you would have stayed me away from that because obviously it wouldn't have been surgery and I would have been able to maintain all my manly abilities and been able to go to and from the porcelain palaces and we leave myself when necessary\nYou seem very angry about having that robotic surgery\nExtraordinarily angry because it's been years since it was twenty twelve and I'm Still play with all the problems that have resulted from that and I know they'll never get better and in fact as I age they'll probably get worse\nWere ever warmed you'd have all these urine or problems and structural problems after robotic surgery\nNo in fact I was still surgery surgery surgery is the answer to get to try and cut out and you'll never have to worry about cancer coming back again and then the very\nFirst thing they did just a month after my recovery was to say you got to take a PSA tests I said what are you talking about we got to see if you have\nCats I see you took my prostate out they said you never know [laughter] you never know I said how come you didn't tell me that before you took my prostate out and then it\nJust a series of situations that unfolded from being a continent urinating too much not being able to have sex and none of it you know in ... about that in

case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nI mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts\nWe're co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I just didn't you told you already have to be quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two groups to cook you tune in the reserves for all you know why he's proud of the cutting edge combination purity caused their co Q. super boost formula what can actually do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I like that so I adopted the term it's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which spectacular\nBut when you combine them indeed and this spectacular ... if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage the cardiovascular benefits\nBenefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and endurance and aerobic capacity and as we said before it supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on beat a boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting we're talking with Dr Alan ... know that you present tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten decision\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for tea you know I hear I'm running out of gas I've got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is the key nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a pencil and paper and a pen handy if you're listening we're going to give out a phone number here it's just a few minutes purity products is a tremendous offer on their new co Q. with was virtual formula\nAnd I'm going to give out that information to a few minutes we'll get a pencil or pen ready right now let's continue our discussion with Dr Alan ... no ... you used an recommended cook you tend to patients your patients for decades you practice but no story gets better\nWe seen abundance of research merging onto a spiritual Harvard research and was virtual for seminal desserts healthy aging soup utility already to combine there was a miracle blended with co Q. ten year do you want them to give away a full\nSize bottles for free and they finally agreed to that but how would you just still the benefits if you had to list maybe the top three or four reasons the ticket was formula what would they be\nWhoa you know I don't know if I could do three of four mock but how about ten or twelve\nReasons sorry that wants to\nNumber one without a doubt the energy the indoor and the stamina I mean just stopping there my gosh I Love that you know I mean who wouldn't love energy endurance and stamina\nBut there's more physical performance cardiovascular protection cardiovascular benefits but as we go down the list I'm going to talk about immune support I'm going to talk about increasing anti oxygen levels in your body\nHow would protect cell membranes and end some addict function\nAnd there was just an amazing article on co Q. ten ability to decrease the rough innocent fine wrinkles in your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you a three I gave you a little bit more than that\nWell All right even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very tall blimp purity products how many glasses to read one is this equivalent to how many would I have to drink a day to get the same bit of it\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day\nAnd that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet\nYeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you could well I don't know but but you have to drink to the glasses of red wine a day\nYeah to me about how many capitals I've got to take when they do take multi vitamins I take a short\nWhile you just need to take too soft gels a day and that's really easy to take and the best time to take them as writing a book for a meal so you can take you know one before breakfast one before bunch or you could take them together but all you have to do is take too small soft gels right before a meal\nWell no doctor

importantly our physical strength or flexibility and mobility\nIs our ability to do things look things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance and how new breakthroughs are allowing us to get it back and keep it as we get older [noise]\nAll right here's our gas to health a journalist bill ... bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about\nTyler on a ... acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to step back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan where people maintain high levels of EJ and are famous for their ability to define the e gene process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with you pat and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic assets supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support\nIn particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because\nThere's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said free offer today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H ... it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice\nThey never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do\nAnd you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back and of course parity products for years now has been talking\nAbout ha and they have a new formula just for the joint\nH H joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints to people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints what a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space between\nThe two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluids\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplements purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's in molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means\nThat you can absorb this orally we actually proved\nThat in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternative for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill sorority about ... acid or ha no bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough and what exactly can do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells\nThat connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose that the substance the scaffolding that the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we being getting to wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain of shrivel up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know positive daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and\nOf course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose it we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people who've tried this if you're taking Luke ... supplement it took Thirteen Years for doctors to adopt glue costs ...\nSulfate it's a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it well\nThe difference this stuff really work it's your own personal discovery that's why purity products want you to have this free bottle offer you call nobody's gonna how do you call that number they're going to send you a\nFree bottle a full month supply you just kick in a few bucks for the shipping and your going to experience this for yourself\nLike the people who've written in and set all these wonderful things there's Harold eighty fifth year he says I'm In and says I'm doing very well\nOn H.

these things I'm not going to value weighted by the CIA product is not intended to diagnose treats you want to\nThe preceding program was paid for by purity products\n\n\nMost respected your sports these you know you have\nA scar on the line with us [noise]\n\nSite [noise]\nFamous\n[noise]\nSpend time with\nOn TALK radio [noise]\nDiet dot coms\nReport\nDeadly Patrick shooting the clothes they Pittsburgh neighborhood of mourning their tragic loss following Saturday synagogue shooting\nResidents of Pittsburgh's close knit squirrel hill neighborhood are grieving after eleven people were killed and six others injured when a man carrying an assault style rifles and other weapons attack the tree of life synagogue hundreds of people attended a candlelight vigil not far from the synagogue this woman says the community will get through this\nAt our facility in my practice Ninety percent of the women keep their breast so it was lots of reasons why so many women come one is that we're open minded one is regarding principles to do what a woman wants\nBut first to inform the woman of all the options we talk about surgery and we talk about chemo we talk about hormones we talk about\nRadiation and radio surgery but it's up to each person\nThe woman for example with breast cancer to decide does she want to have surgery or not she want came or not to shoot what or ... or not but she want radiation or not we don't push people to do things against their wishes\nAnd that's most likely why she came here she was likely came here because she understands we have a large experience\nOf putting women with breast cancer for forty years or the thirty five years with radiation we see so\nMany women with early breast cancer sometimes when we come to us a little ... little dot like that of a pin breast cancer and sometimes women come to us with breast cancer that has traveled\nAnd sometimes women come to us with breast cancer like this woman with a mass of local cancer just being through the breast\nRed talk about other examples of women that I've treated like this who is a breast is healed\nWho's cancers gone away masses even up to ten centimeters loving centimeters who's mask goes away with treatment here at Thirteen eighty four Broadway and this is the work we do\nThis woman sixty five years old with this huge mass hole in the press about ... bleeding losing massive cancer has had no tests when she walked into my office yesterday it was the first they should scene of position about her cancer\nAnd we offered to stage are up and get a biopsy a biopsy can be easily done with a tiny little needle into this mess it's painless and easy\nWe'd do blood tests including cancer markers markers for breast cancer so she can evaluate how she is doing she can evaluate our physicians are doing and she\nWe've asked to get a pet CAT scans to stage upper whole body to see if it's cancers traveled because when cancers grow to such a large proportion they have time to leave their primaries side like in this case to leave the breast\nAnd travel elsewhere whether that might have been to the lymph nodes lungs or liver\nIt's we're so she should know that it allows for better treatment decisions for her\nAnd her physicians to help guide her I always believed that the physician doesn't decide anything the physician makes recommendations to the patient\nAnd the family and then the patient mainly the patient the patient is the president of United States of his or her body then decides it should not be the physician deciding it should be the patient who is informed\nAnd so she's decided to go ahead with a little biopsy she decided to go with a PET scan and we did the blood test already\nAnd then she'll come back the next few days and have an answer and that's the work we do it'll keep you informed about what happens is woman with this huge ... leading mail order as right breast cancer that has never\nBeen evaluated until she walked into our doors at Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nAnd speaking about women with cancer I Want to talk about a woman who has had a long journey\nComing not only from Canada where she resides but then to Mexico and Austria and Europe and now here to there today for Broadway what drives her what motivates or let me tell you about this woman [noise]\nShe's sixty years old she's married with kids she comes with her husband from Ontario [noise] so it's about an hour and a half west of\nToronto and there's many many hospitals and Canada's Canada's hobo nationalized healthcare so you'd think that everything would be so fantastic there\nBut she found a lump in the breast and chest pain and well she went to the hospital with his chest pain and their doctors do an X ray\nAnd they said it was a normal ex rather center at home and they told her to come back in a year year and she came back in the year and she said everything is worse and everything was worse much worse and she had more and more pain and suffering and what did they do\nAnother\nChest X rays chest X ray is the most I Would say it's one of the most antiquated past it's been around for decades and decades there's much more sophisticated test to evaluate a person with chest pain if you're going to take them seriously and that's what we do here at thirty for Broadway\nThe cancer was eventually diagnosed when she had a CAT scan it took a almost a year and a quarter to get a CAT scan in that country and Canada a lot of people say oh well nationalized medicine so fantastic here's an example where she's going to get a test\nShe couldn't get a test she eventually it took them more than a year to get a CAT scan and when she had a CAT scan showing what was felt to be a lung cancer\nIt took six months for her to see a doctor a cancer doctor in Canada to see a specialist treating lung cancer\nAnd so what did she do she went to Mexico tier one where she paid tens of thousands of dollars to get concoction ... heat therapy\nSome chemotherapy and some very low dose of radiation to the spine\nThen she came back to Canada and by then that delay period has lapsed or doctors saw her gave her some more chemotherapy by then it seemed like the chemo wasn't working very well the cancer was widespread and then she traveled to Austria where she spent\nTens of thousands more tens of thousands of dollars far from home\nShe got hypothermia immunotherapy chemotherapy [noise]\nThen returned home and for the last five months has been receiving vitamin drips and Adam has an ozone layer trail none of which has worked\nHer last scan in Canada was three months ago her last a PET scan while she only had one PET scan\nAnd comes to us now with terrible pain and our sacred honor pelvis or tell bone she's losing a tremendous amount of weight to the last six months she's lost fifty pounds she's gone from two hundred and four pounds down\nTo a hundred and fifty two pounds just terrible pain she's suffering terribly\nHer cancer markers cancer markers or markers we talk about them ... and her doctors in Canada to the markers and what did they find well her cancer marker six months ago was two thousand normal cancer markers three three point zero her cancer mark was twenty three hundred\nA month and a half ago it\nWas more than six thousand and now it's twelve thousand it's doubled in the last month reflecting most probably the cancer has doubled in the last month\nShe is suffering terribly she has trouble breathing because there are cancers blocking the airways are long she's having coffin shortness of breath and number two she has intractable pain because the cancers growing through are sacred met her spine bones growing through\nAnd so we remember all this has taken place over more than a year and\nA half a year and a half we in one half of day\nWe're able to stage or a get cancer markers get a PET scan and get rid of the results of the same day and planned the treatment the same day together out of pain and suffering to open up her airways all the same day and got her a PET scan\nThey were the result shoulder where the cancer was short where the cancer Israeli\nOffered to plan a combined motel what he plans to treat or to treat the cancer in the bloodstream through the cancer and the bones of truth to cancer at the long\nHaul within a day we did more in a few hours that she had it in a year and a half in her home and traveling the globe being in three countries on two continents she finally came to Thirteen eighty four Broadway\nWhere she had attention care staging blood tests physical exam explanation\nUnderstanding and treatment to treat this painful cancer to treat this cancer blocking the airways this is the work we do and it's easy to see\nWhy people come from around the world for our care why don't you come here why don't you come from the midst of Ontario in Canada here\nWell because of a neighbor she had a neighbor friend she has a neighbor friend who came with a terrible ... as a connective cancer ... cancer of connective tissue is just as a cancer of the uterus tissues neither carcinoma ... sarcoma cancer the connective tissue\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease and stroke you're in good shape and still had all these complications\nThere's no doubt and not only was I in good shape I was in heavy I wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that began to creep up on you when you saw the\nAging process and then all of a sudden I ended up with problems as a result of prostate remove all surgery because\nNow when your basic functions when you can't you were in a when you can have sex when all of those things go a right not only does it affect\nYou mentally and you get depressed but you never know when you're going to go here in the middle of a meeting and then all of a sudden you look down at your trousers and you had an accident and now what do you do grab a sweater and wrap it around yourself and one officer they knew rich bathroom and then you always carrying around it depends with you and you're saying why did I Do this to myself and my ...\nAnd you said no I'm not a mask I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery is something fantastic\nDon't believe the hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those is you ... to me because you're not part of the old boy's club you are independent autonomous and you've taken a route in which you're providing\nYou'll patients painless methods of recovery fully\nRemaining able to function as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate cancer\nYou know there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing robotic how do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars have I worked on in the auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota and you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow I may be scarring these people I may be\nTurning them into a person who can no longer physically\nFunction why am I doing this when there are other remedies and why are they doing it\nBecause this is their business they're surgeons and all they know how to do is cut\nOut your prostate gland that controls so much of what a man does and I would suggest everyone out there a void that at all costs don't be still not don't be do me like I was get that valued second opinion from Dr ... because he will not abandon you he will get

is this route to zero seven ... seven\nAnd a lot it's got to be only one okay so tell me who says ... double oh seven\n... seven but you're not double o seven anymore I understand All right so what are you down to I mean you are you being demoted are promoted by her majesty's got run a\nLot of that's a promotion or a demotion we we've got to find out\nWell let's talk about it when they have prostate cancer and I know Ralph I Know route very well because Ralph calls from time to time Ralph as a patient of mine routes appears on a DVD so if you want to see the real Ralph in person you can see them on a DVD talking about is cancers so\nWhen you're a PSA goes down after prostate cancer treatment that is a promotion that's better\nI go All right so ... so how are you doing\nThat the whole problem that you know that's a very famous number\nBut that was yesterday that was so that was mentioned history so because let me let me introduce Ralph and then I Want to reduce themselves so Ralph as a man that I met more than a decade ago I think it's almost twelve years and he\nSaid this was the last ... when I got was the November two thousand and five so it'll be like Thirteen\nYears I was Thirteen Years and you had prostate cancer you're working for a big company and do you bike you bite from Brooklyn to Manhattan every day or very physically fit or do you have this cancer and your effort surgery didn't want anyone to screw up your body so that's how we met right\nRight absolutely\nSo why should take it from there you ... how would he diagnosed with prostate cancer so other people could learn because you actually in a way diagnosed yourself\nAll men are actually I did diagnose myself I mean outside of the fact that I had to go to your hours just to get the ball rolling\nNow but it was your diligence your doctor said oh everything's okay and you said but Dr and tell people what you said\nYou know ... or ... like let let me just backtrack a little bit I hadn't been taking annual physicals for many years and uh it was a point at which they started doing\nHe said I think that was and I'm just gonna say Nineteen Ninety nine two thousand when the place I was going to start it all the essays the first one I had was like point eight\nPoint eight but next year or one point to the next year after that one point eight\nAnd ... up to two thousand and five it went up to three point three now now that will that will that I had been going to\n... that that that was a problem because it was on the federal\nThey didn't even speak about it too right no one spoke to you about it\nYou know that's the only one person said you know the last one I says it's three point three what it's on the holdouts so you have a I ended up being that it was going up over those over those years I said you know what it wouldn't hurt to get it looked into\nAnd you were smart because going from zero point eight to three point three is an increase up to four hundred percent more than it was so four hundred percent increase is a high PSA velocity PSA velocities how rapidly UPS say is going up\nRight and I have five men out there at that\nSchool before you advice men so you had a biopsy even though you're PSA was less than for your PSA was going up you didn't like it and you requested the biopsy you requested the investigation right", "show_name": "Red Eye
