T.E Lawrence he's gassed in May of Eighteen\nKermit eventually will destroy himself correct yes he commits a well he he's he's the one who becomes closest to Franklin Roosevelt\nAnd and he is an alcoholic\nHe's very depressed he goes up to serve in World War two and the Aleutian any illusions and in Nineteen forty three he blows is a blows is brains out\nAh and but Clinton is comedy is compelling and he's extremely smart and learns Arabic does all the right things and the one who goes with his father and the addition ah eat is however says permit ah my blonde with a black car and eat it was ...\nShe was she she knows that that the decision not to run in Nineteen away it is a mistake\nA ... a chi chi are other sons Archie and Ted junior\nOr they or go off to France as the whole family goes off to a friend's everybody's in uniform one of the sisters goes off the ... I I I like the scene where Nicholas Roosevelt one of the cousins appears in uniform and breaks down yes very sad so Kermit is not a hundred years later gas but\nNews comes in March of Eighteen that Clinton's cracked up crashed the plane but he's OK march of Eighteen these yeah training that grabs a couple of motorcycles too that's when a a John Mitchell the boy mayor of New York yes or dies in a plane crash training in Lake Charles Louisiana so\nFlying a plane I've done a couple of books on written back around I Know that getting on one of those planes was\nNot going to come out at at\nA training base that the Clinton is that for almost a year they lose a pilot a week a train those\nPlanes were what you call them flaming coffins but that to fly them was always a risk even to land them to take them off a march of Eighteen Archie is wounded and gets quite ... quite a care Ted juniors blown up with the same a shell that hits Archie RG badly wanted\nVery badly wanted his knee and his arm is is is really the the nerves are damaged it's gonna be\nMonths for him to recuperate and he ends the war back in the state because he's states because he is so ... says able the rest of the is yes he's he's raided a ... as as the U.S army does this he's raided a hundred percent disabled in World War one but he goes off and fights again in World War two in the south Pacific\nWhere he is again a hundred percent disabled so these Roosevelt are very brave guy as junior\nIs wounded eventually he's wounded in July of Eighteen but he's blown up with Archie Ted junior will be on the beaches of on the Utah be that's right he's the famous or generals lands I think he's deputy commander of the division fourth division\nAnd they're lost and he says we start the war here exactly he has a heart attack within a couple a day that's all right guys right on right on the beach or now we've come to Clinton\nThis is a very hard part of the book to read because you know it's coming Clinton is killed in action\nHe's ambushed as you presented by Germans fighting over showed a chef ... this is in July of Eighteen the big battles the massive loss of death the really stupid generally will come in September and October\nMassive direct assaults by our divisions against fixed fortifications of the German army first troops with machine guns and\nOf depots but I'll leave that there he's he's killed in the ... the news comes to Roosevelt first from the ... amendment Thompson yes he delay there's a delay a couple of a couple of hours of a day or so until these cells to eat it but they don't absolutely no well\nTelegram comes into the newspaper says ... more hill for and the rest of the censored the telegram has brought the tea are by this reporter NTR says it's not Kermit he's traveling it's\nNot that it's not it's written it's quite don't tell Mrs Roosevelt\nThen the word comes in and it's a it's it's this tragedy in stages where\nHe's been shot down but is he dead is he alive rocket plane wasn't burning when it went down and hope that he can't he crashed before you can survive a crash is he a prisoner people don't know and it takes a while before the\nWord comes in from the Germans they start dropping as affects behind the American lives they put out official statements that Quentin is finally did he was killed with two bullets\nIn his head he's ride right away or the tragedy now worse because TR apparently loses all interest you know almost everything except for what his grandchildren\nHis grandchildren of course he has to finish World War one he has to he has to go out his his health is increasingly deteriorating and even before Clinton's death he spends a month at Roosevelt Hospital on the west side here in Manhattan\nUh with with abscess is and his\nUh there's an operation on his on both ears and his left ear is completely ruined the ... yes he's got ... and he and his heart is slow yes and he's lost his ballads so he has to learn how to walk again in that you if you take a look at the picture the cover picture in the book you\nKnow the usual thing is T R is when he's speaking you banging his fish into his is open palm and in that\nPicture he's holding himself up with both hands against the podium and against the stench in holding the roof up and that's a very telling picture that September thirtieth Nineteen Eighteen he had\nA physician who was treating them routinely\nYeah it's just they use morphine regularly they used morphine that we know of twice and probably more in when he goes back into the hospital on armistice day on armistice day\nNineteen Eighteen he's given morphine for the pain and he has given morphine for the pain on January fist\nOf just before he goes to bed or the night of his death\nRight and now we come to the part that you piece together like a detective story was it was it a decision of him his own to take his own life or to risk his death with morphine\nThis really came to me at the end of writing the book I write at the end and and the information came in in a torrent\nTo me once I started to think about it having the background that T.

weeks\nAnd it's one of those topics that happens more frequently now\nMhm where in the debate of actual critical thinking\nThe Democrats have\nNo argument there making arguments yeah\nBut there is so easy to\nBlow a whole in there because it comes down to ... to what it is supposed to come down to\nIn America is there evidence\nWell we all know we all know that the Democrats we all know all all that\nYou know that you know a a a believe the you know what to believe the accuser\nYeah right oh that is a line that we all know that's a line of BS\nFrom the left no you believe the liberal accuser\nYou don't leave the\nRepublican accuser but as a Republican woman accusing you don't believe it it's only\nIn the cases\nThat are important to them where you believe the accuser we all know it\nRight\nWell otherwise you consider Bill Clinton the criminal or a number of times over right now can I ask another question\nYou know I just we just mentioned Amy Schumer because of you know people know who she is the ... the ... model thing why does that you buddy give her eye on the right ability I I Know this probably maybe we've mentioned her just once or twice as being joking but why does anybody give her any type of credibility\nWhatsoever I've always well then again if you're talking about the left I say you should give somebody credibility by the substance of their argument was that the gays you'd never hear from anybody on the Web so I I forget about what I just said there well I don't know\nWhy she's relevant is she in the current show I don't know I actually don't know I don't know why she's relevant otherwise I saw what those who's the boss to runs all the time you know I'm just me and she was in the the one with the uh which is\nYeah yeah yeah and so she was a witch right yeah yeah\nYeah so I don't know I I have no idea if she's in a TV show right now\nBut I don't think she was in something last year I don't I really I mean she's\nShe's relevant to the situation because she claims you know that she was sexually\nAssaulted so no I don't know\nAnd as you I mean I Know I Know that she had in part of it yeah it's just part of that already too okay yeah yeah\nI didn't know that she said she was sexually assaulted that's what I didn't know okay that makes that would that would be a connection that you could use to gain\nYou know right of incidents biopic because that's what it's about right okay but I I but pop culture wise I don't know she still is or not I actually don't\nWell as I said you know we because we hear people coming forward\nYou know the you know saying look I've also been I was sexually assaulted two ... and I stand with her well as we said before whether you were sexually assaulted or not\nStill does not give you any more credibility when a charge is filed or you know when the charges filed against someone I don't mean legally but in this case\nA ... in um in his nomination to the Supreme Court\nBut the allegation itself\nHas to be backed up by evidence your case for no matter how Amos an evil it might have been if you were sexually assaulted has nothing to do with this case right\nAbsolutely nothing because you were sexually assaulted does not give you a better insight as to whether Kavanaugh is guilty or not right none zero right\nAnd that is portrayed you know it's one of the one falls that's portrayed\nWell then you well okay then you were late here in ...\n... because you are sexually assaulted then uh what you think about cabinet carries more weight no it doesn't that's ridiculous I it's ridiculous statement to make or to be promoting it has promoted constantly in this you know only thing that matters is the evidence\nIn every Seattle case in you and I talked about this how long have we talked about this when you know whether it was Trayvon Martin where people were taking sides left and right and we just said look here's the problem you've got that was at the two or three or four minutes band there mhm where he was running away and then next thing you know\nUh he was on top of government that's the only thing that people saw at that point and because of that huge blank space in there that no witnesses are there nobody can say what happened\nSo they went by the physical evidence which was the wife the uh the the injuries to Zimmerman's head but exactly we've said and even a juror or a jury member said it's possible that he got away with murder it's just that with the evidence we couldn't prove\nBecause he claims that you know he felt as his life was an imminent danger and and\nWe rejected at that point and the people uh who would call this show and with certainty say they knew the guilt or innocence right\nAnd we had people bring it up yeah the Trayvon Martin was an an angel doesn't matter whether he was or was not an angel right or at any other time of his life it doesn't matter what their men headset at any time in his life right all the matter is he said I'm\nGoing to tell us your what I write Trayvon Martin right with that and that would have been obviously right would have been which of course they didn't\nSay ... but people were definitive in their belief of guilt or innocence and\nBased on a lack of evidence and what they think possibly happen we have rejected that we will always reject that as Americans\nAs far as I'm concerned you're obligated to reject that type of yes mindset absolutely go by the evidence the evidence is what dictates everything\nThe motion is what carries the ah the the cause and and and such protests\nAnd and certainly for the families who suffer are the the loss of a loved one whether it's a Trayvon Martin's family or or Michael Brown family you can feel for their loss but also know this this this is possible but many people find it impossible\nTo feel for the last of the family but also believe\nAnd see by the evidence see what the evidence shows that the evidence points to that person also being responsible now it didn't necessarily and and the and the Trayvon Martin case\nYou had you know what the physical evidence was was ... and then that's what the jury found and we we don't have\nWe don't have a everything the jury saw no no but in the Michael Brown situation\nWith officer will Wilson on the scene I'm you know the the family uh was the first to commission an autopsy and that autopsies the one that showed the hands up don't shoot member narrative was alive\nIt's still being used today yes as a rallying cry that never happened\nOr that is unacceptable in America right you know we we talk about the Democrats are always talking about\nThe fascist on the right or if you listen to what we believe mhm and what we believe about the presumption of innocence whether it's a criminal trial a civil trial or just public opinion in general or a political trial still it's the same thing you judge these cases\nYou judge cases and you'd\nAnd and you judge the guilt or innocence based on the evidence that exist not just an allegation\nAlone and\nAnd the thing is I'm saying this with passion but I really don't have to because every single Democrat listening right now\nEvery single liberal and democratic protesting yesterday and they all know it but they are willing to throw it overboard mhm you know how they know it because of the first ones\nMany of those who are in a you know who ah were arrested yesterday\nA will would demand due process under you know due process under the law and but the fact is they know it but they will reject it when it comes to their personal politics\nFascism leads the mindset of fascism leads in them when it's what they want when it comes to how they're going to be treated no you must follow the constitution completely\nBut treating somebody else a constitution be damned the spirit of the constitution be damned the mindset of the presumption of innocence and that evidence is the only thing that leads and should lead is thrown out the window\nBecause we want what we want\nYou know when it comes down to I was following a case here in Texas where a man had been wrongly found guilty of murder and all that and you have a Nineteen years in prison\nAnd got out and twenty six team they want him to be fully exonerated was working to that end and finally it happened it was full exonerated so that's a total of Twenty one years\nWhere he was either behind bars are having as you know his name essentially associated with a murder that happened that he was not responsible for so I was doing some research just to try and

it's running radio and he is Eric\nHardy non Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or a road I think one of the last caller is referring to the letter a Chuck Grassley Sunday a letter to the lawyers\nOf a doctor for it and it said I'm a I'm writing in response to your letter dated October second you said Dr Ford is was yesterday so you said Dr Ford is going to turn over her documents\nTo the FBI but my request to view was not the documents to be turned over to the FBI actually to provide the documents the Senate\nJudiciary Committee your response on behalf of the client\nIs a non secular the constitution charges the Senate with the ... and the president and his nomination senators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the president's nominees are obligation as unrelated to anything the FBI does that's why we just don't vote on nominees after the president loans us\nOr the FBI background investigation we have to make our own assessment the U.S Senate does not control the FBI if you have an objection of how the FBI conduct investigations take it up with director re\nBut don't raise that objection is a reason not to respond to this committee's demand for relevant evidence yet the eyes investigative decisions aren't our concern even at the FBI never interviewed Dr Porter interviews or ten times this committee is a constitutional obligation\nTo investigate Dr Ford's allegations and that's what we've been doing since we became aware of or allegations it's not even clear to me what purpose tornado do over those materials to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that over ... over\nTo watch yet as we just said does we stopped that's the only purpose the FBI search that's always that's always stop the last caller says well their ... their political did nothing investigation by political the the ... the\nThe FBI only facilitates the interviews they conduct the interviews because they have the resources and the training that it's that\nSimple right\nAnd and so it doesn't make it again this this is where her lawyers are bringing up something that isn't even relevant to the investigation to begin with because\nFor the million high there is no FBI investigation the only investigation that's been going on is the Senate Judiciary investigation what because it it\nAre the the lawyers for Dr Ford or either completely clueless or they didn't want those notes to come out because had they been given to the FBI again assume the FBI decided to respond to them and take the\nThere's no those therapists notes they would have been part of the report they wouldn't they wouldn't have seen the light of day beyond the eyes of a hundred people\nA it's not even and by the way emerges from my phone because I just happened to go on Twitter industry that Mollie Hemingway was on it it's not even clear what purpose turning those materials over to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that evidence over to the Senate\nAnd that is precisely the outcome that I think with this request is to get the information right you have claimed repeatedly that the evidence I requested supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh she even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second here as I have to go to a to a national media indeed if the evidence\nOr supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way

[noise] so [laughter] [noise] and what I Am radio eight six six Ninety\nRight I I'm a news here\nAre are but I guess you could say sort of breaking news uh center Steve Gaines of Montana told Fox News exclusively on Thursday night that although he will\nWalk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding Saturday his plans will not affect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote\nScheduled for the same day ... speaking to Shannon brain which means decided to be late last night right a and a Fox News ... said he personally called cabin up Thursday evening and told him I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed so that isn't going to delay anything you know because you said\nWell you know it wears his daughter getting married and in Montana it legit you inside right I don't think he wants anybody you know\nProbably doesn't want anyone to know and because and that really spells out how crazy\nThis thing is a and has become the left believes going direct especially after confronting a Jeff Flake that it's working that they're you know the the the tactic is not only working but acceptable\nAnd we'll shame you out of a restaurant will uh will confront you on the elevator will anywhere and everywhere\nAs directed or I guess they encourage further encouraged by Maxine Waters anywhere and everywhere it doesn't matter where you\nAre getting their face well that becomes dangerous because it's impossible for somebody to be able to such a threat just imagine\nIn your everyday life and you're not a lawmaker\nUh unless we have lawmakers listening which we often do and we thank you for that but you're not included you you're\nYou're just walking around grocery store [laughter] thank you or the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for listening and and also Senator Lindsey Graham for years like this I guess and probably ramble although he's screaming know all the time um but\nWe actually love rental but if you're walking around you know in public the average person and someone just ran up to you and started screaming your face\nYou wouldn't know what they're doing you know you don't you don't know what the threat level is and and and certainly it's it's different when you were just like when you're confronted in the way he was and you you you know why they're in your face but you can't assess the threat level in public you can't you just cannot\nYou don't know what the person who is capable of doing if they're good you know there to physically harm you um it's it's impossible to\nAssess that so that's such security has been wrapped up\nA tremendous uh the restaurant in fact the where Ted Cruz was shamed out of the restaurant a first of all kudos to the restaurants saying you know because you can hear a person in the background on that video saying look you can't you know telling the protestors but you can't be in here this is a private you know business\nSo you saw the letter writer or that Rand Paul's wife wrote to CNN ... and and challenge Cory Booker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other thing is just looking here at the wall Street Journal from yesterday about\nWhat ... said here's a quote they have I'm Still reviewing the information but we've seen do additional information yet no additional cooperating information as to flake said Susan Collins praise the FBI for a complete very thorough investigation\nSo it comes down to those ... we'll call them the final four but those were the before the meeting or after the hearing a week ago yesterday right a hearings so after the hearings four of them just like a Susan Collins\nA Murkowski and mansion\nWent into a room and had a meeting we don't know what was discussed but\nIt appears that it's really coming down to those now because you have essentially Heitkamp is said she's no so essentially right now the only Democrat it looks like you might be able to count on is Joe Manchin\n\nSo if you've got every Republican on board assuming that Jeff Flake is a yes then that gets you to fifty two\nIf Jeff Flake is a no you're still on the soft headcount you're still at fifty one with mansion with match\nIf for some reason Manchin pulls out or Murkowski\nOr it doesn't appear the columns will if Collins had a concern she would have issued that concerned about the report saying I'm not sure we got everything at the very least she would've question something praising the report tells me you can count on never\nSo right now you're looking at I mean I think at the very least fifty with vice president being the cyber at fifty one\nOr the word from and and there was another story in the in the wall Street Journal that the you know the GOP right now is a is really upbeat about the confirmation process they you know they it's a if you look at it that the the talk right now\nIs that they're confident\nOr so you get through a a culture which will happen sometime during the day on friday as you mentioned Gary the process will start mid morning um but then the actual vote may not happen until later in the afternoon\nWhen by the time to get through the procedure one with the actual vote take place and then there were the third and they've already our lives the clocks stop starts at that\nPoint yet up and they can take up to thirty hours it may not take thirty hours they could end the debate before thirty hours but assuming they'll use the entire thirty hours\nAnd they might ah especially on a Saturday the media might give them the the news media cable news might give them you know all the time of the world uh so do you look at the the so called hopefuls for twenty twenty your usual suspects\nOr a warrant and all of them looking to get cameras time or the debate might you know go on the full thirty just assume that it will go well\nThat's why you've got the rule assumed that it will so that puts it late into Saturday Night as you mentioned earlier Gary depending on where they landed on the uh the the clock lands on the cultural wrote maybe into early Sunday Morning\nBut that gives the there's the I guess the wiggle room or the enough room for senator Danes to get you know home from the wedding I guess or or back to work for the wedding\nAnd ah as daughter's wedding and we wish your daughter and her\nSoon to be husband all the best\nUh but they'll he'll get back he's saying he'll get back in time for the vote so that tells us it's probably going to be a late Saturday Night but\nYou know I I I think about all the and I'm just sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the all the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain\nThings you know a a when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on\nAnd if you look over the last eight years and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street you know all all that that that ah that went on all the the the occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that\nYou have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be quite intimidating but here's the question is it effective\nFor them right has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration I mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh the Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas ... nothing like that mhm\nSo you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing\nAnd you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened when the police tried to push them off but at this is almost the exclusive domain of the left and therefore the Democrats sure yeah\nAnd you think about the run that they have had since all of this you know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street as just the beginning of of this portion of it\nHas it been effective for them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation\nTactics will actually work and change for example they're not you know you you you could see\nIf they might be a you know threatening a just a a you know the the senators that are on you know ... you know on the edge right now right okay on the margins\nBut they're not they're going after everybody mhm ... whether it's Grassley doesn't care with McConnell what do they really think that that's affected or is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage\nBecause that's what it is it's just insane rage that they're filled with right yeah just anger and and and rage\nIs it just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that it does affect if I just I I really wonder and [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this I'd love to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible [laughter]\nSo I'm never going to find out because I'm never going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is that right well I I I think\nAfter the like a thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective to some extent but I think it's probably a lot of I was going to say a little of both I think there's a lot of both actually that they believe\nAfter confronting mansion and after you know the behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that Gary that youre not protesters in a restaurant\nYou work there it's your job\nAnd you refuse in one case to do it\n... because Sarah Huckabee Sanders is eating the food you're going to prepare and serve can you imagine that can you imagine being in that ...\nKnow\nIf I worked in a restaurant I don't care what I was doing in that restaurant\nBar rock Obama and his family came in\nThe last thing that I Would do is refused to do my job me not doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagreed with that he did\nAnd that's the mentality but that's where they that's where they live we go back to the one restaurant where you\nHad a man happened to be African American wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd the staff was shaming him at a stable to the point that his companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up I Can't imagine I cannot imagine\nI wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something so despicable\nJust shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS as long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against\nAnd I remember it was about you know we've talked about it before is probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm
