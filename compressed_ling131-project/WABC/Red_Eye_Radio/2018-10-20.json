write him about heart that my shoulder and after three weeks of this I could put my right hand broke my hip it's getting easier with the delicate nature I haven't seen anything work as well as the U.S\nWelcome back to our show we just heard our top success stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in an eight hundred two four six eight seven\nFive one eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one next we'll listen to an interview that I had was Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or of balance\nWorked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your lives the surgery but they're rude and mean then you don't really feel real great and you might go home still depressed or whatever it is\nMore depressed or more depressed and more fearful had yeah that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when\nWhen we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education ... means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the house Chad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health costs when you're working with people and sometimes they decided they helped ... ad that people can't face you know they're just\nThey been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm\nGiven up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I Can't do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so I that you had trained the health coaches that if you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes out naturally on its own\nSo we just say okay let's set aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve than they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them so you have a health coach that takes a customer\nOr through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or\n... how much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fills when they start taking balance of nature well\nThe main role of a health coach is because we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results\nOr you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human ... if you'd just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you feel it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of not using names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man\nAnd um and in relation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of health and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's health is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it\nBecause we're based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything is based upon\nThe raw materials of new up of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's ... at the mental spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things\nThat's one side of your health tryout\nAnd so we work on goals on all three of those sites to help people really see the greatest benefit\nAnd for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah as I was talking with him he's a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person and you could just see it in him and fill it from him and finally I looked at me you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear because fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out\nAnd so with tears he finally said you're right I don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides and we had some other goals of walking and being active and\nAnd and obviously was with nutrition we had a several several goals but 'til we found that one he wasn't a change person he will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard answers and Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nIt really does work I've had a great respect and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff in the spring and fall and I attribute it to that because I like shut down\nA ice actually stop the my vitamins that I Would take you know taking a regiment of vitamins and I basically stopped all of them and then went on to this and this seems to be beneficial for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you have to know at my age if I can keep up with all the animals something has to work I\nIt just helped me feel good I just think the products are wonderful and I take them every day at work [laughter]\nFor a limited time use discount code W.

A. B. C.\nWelcome back to the balance of nature show I'm your host Laura Smith and we are talking about why whole foods or the answer to many health\nProblems versus taking supplements that have vitamins I'm with the founder and formulate or a balance of nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard Dr Howard is a medical doctor had real practical Dr\nResearcher and specialist in fighter nutrients Dr Howard what is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nDo what you are learning it even more and more as the results come into the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nKnow what's beautiful a balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and that's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving of how and why does it work but the beauty of it is\nWe don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make it special a new because the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing added and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce it took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with\nWith the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that\nAnd around like pacman going you know to to eat the the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond as immune studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out where it needed and also even studies about the discuss it either blood or in other words\nThe thickness of the blood how flows the beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels all of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and fifty different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself when damaged those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature\nWhen I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature have made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits at the fruits and veggies from a fire inside the whole health system\nAnd just so much about what the nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today thank you it's great to be I think Eli\nProgram was sponsored by balance of nature of use expressed by the preceding ... those are the laws are not necessarily the opinions of Seventy seven WABC or cumulus media [noise]\nSo anyway we thank\nYou me but supposedly ... Moreno that's really great so you put it on your system then you'll become a biology class you should tell you yeah you can ... and then it multiplies\nWell now apparently a small enough in your brain make it ended up in any way like flesh eating virus ... it sounds so good\nThree flashy force on my\nSo most people don't want to spend Seventy thousand dollars if you can do the same thing for a few thousand dollars and yet most doctors and hospitals and patients and families never talk about the dumber talk about the fact that if you want the best value and a are paid\nHas recently said that for a radiology services the best value is to go to an independent free standing radiology center sign my words they settled down or magazine I read it myself you confided they're also if you wish [noise]\nSo we're going to jump right in and if you have questions please give us a call one eight hundred three two one zero seven ten\nWe are live this hour that's the number for the radio station what eight hundred three two one zero seven ten [noise]\nIf you're very shy you can always send me an email day or night seven days a week and sent me an email my emails guild GI yell at our as and why dot org Gail geo at bar as and wide dot org\nOr or G. R. S. and why stands for radio surgery New York dot org they want to jump in and talk about first of all is Ninety three year old woman that she's very spry beautiful woman\nMy son says I shouldn't talks say beautiful about women but ah she's a beautiful woman she's a beautiful she's maintained her so she has her mind and body and uh\nShe's ... six children she lives in a nearby states her daughter flew in from Austin, Texas to be with her to meet me\nAnd her story is something like this river she's Ninety three years old she's widowed has six children and about fourteen years ago ... colon cancer and did surgery at one of the big hospitals and doctors wanted her to to do standard radiation and chemo and she refused to should have been about\nSeventy eight years old and ... maybe she thought she was going to die sooner or something but she didn't die she's Ninety three\nAnd then about nine years ago she had another cancer totally unrelated cancer and the ... trio cancer end though means inside it'd be ... another word for the uterus cancer of the inside of the lining of the universal any other universes what in a men's starting woman comes out every month that's aligning that prepares a woman to a\nTo a ... child so she had this cancer the and the me too I'm nine years ago and again she had radical surgery on her uterus they cut out her uterus and shed no additional treatment\nAnother teaching point Dr suck about ads adjunct means additional so for example they cut out the cancer and then possibly give ads of it or additional she well she had these two surgeries and ... no complications and she's been followed by or doctors cancer doctors gastroenterologist\nNow for nine years and for a while the doctor was doing MRIs and\nScans everything was okay and then recently this doctor wanted to examine her under anesthesia that's sometimes done for women especially with pelvic\nTumors and they're afraid they're going to cause pain to the woman and so they put the woman to sleep and examine them well she declined that and she has any testing in the last two years\nAnd she is now coming in with a change in their ... which is always worries persistent change in the bowels as always worrisome she's had diarrhea\nAnd she has an urge an urgency to decay four months [noise] so it suggests the fact that one of these two cancers use of the colon cancer or the WTO cancer or something else has come back and it's causing crush or inter pelvis causing this diarrhea\nAnd this urge to decay an urgency and she's lost wages going from one thirty one twenty pounds she's five foot four\nShe never smoke she has an occasional coffee has also pain in the EPA gas methane gas there was another teaching point it's a area of the abdomen just below the starting themself you feel you're starting them and then go down a little lower the EPA gas to him as a point and she\nJust bothers there and she also has difficulties swallowing so she has lots of symptoms and she went to a doctor and her doctor\nDidn't do anything and I suspect that maybe because you know listen to her\nOr maybe because she's Ninety three we do things differently here at radio surgery New York because we believe every human being has important value every human being of course is unique and every human being deserves care\nAnd so I saw her and we arrange some tests those women came in on friday and the daughter came out on friday with her and she's going back to Austin, Texas Monday afternoon and so we tried to arrange tests of our whole body also I should tell you that\nIt was falling and her doctor didn't tester out for the following or neurologic issues I tried to arrange for a scan of her had scattered pelvis another scandal the rest of the body all in one day to get it done and we offered it but then the daughter to them because of prejudice in Missouri flight\nAnd so we're going to do it another day during the week but most likely she has a recurrence of her one of two cancers [noise] so how do we do it while we see many people with cancers are suspected cancers are previously tradition cancers who aren't satisfied\nAnd they can tell you there are so many people feel like the doctors just don't listen or do care\nThere's so much is that no care for two years now and she's getting worse and worse the vowels difficulties swallowing the urge suffocate the following episodes and so here we are getting cancer markers on her with testicular cancer markers\nProtesting or had her body and then we'll report back to her on the same day which is so different than most facilities and most doctors are able to get the test and\nGet her back to the same day and give her the pictures that give her the scans and talk about how to make her better\nThan the beautiful thing if God Forbid she has a recurrence of the cancer if God Forbid that happens and she's interested in non invasive treatment our treatment suits the bill to a large degree why because radio surgeries noninvasive presidents lays on the table [noise]\nThere's no coddling and there's no bleeding and there's no incision there's no anesthesia there was no hospitals stay there is no claustrophobia we computerize the patient's body we find the cancer and then sending thousands of beams to attack the cancer from thousands of NGOs\nAnd this is what we do and we're able to treat new or recurrent cancers throw a large degree with high success rates on average Ninety percent success rates\nMany people could that meat when I brought radio surgery first in America first in the western hemisphere with stereotype tactic body radio surgery\nAnd I can tell you that there's a big need for work and that's why so many people come to us because so many people just don't want to have cutting and bleeding in the south Asia and chemo and standard radiation\nAnd many people call her office at two and two choices to one to two four six forty two thirty seven to one to two four six four to three seven and get a book with get our DVD could also get an appointment or if you want to accept most insurances Medicare Medicaid\nWere located at Thirteen eighty four Broadway won

told you four years ago she had there were years removed and she had chemo and this pelvic just a vegetable radiation well they gave her chemotherapy then the cancer came back\nWell what came out did the same doctor give this same patient he gave her the same chemo that came out that didn't work remember that came out when she was diagnosed introduce surgery he gave her chemo it didn't work the cancer came back and then\nThree years later he gives them more at the same chemo well if it didn't work the first time do you think it's going to work the second time and it didn't work and it's a

not giving me the best radiation is the president going to say that or ... on the side Dr ... doctor acts\nYou gave me chemotherapy doesn't work before why did you give me the same chemotherapy and as

informative booklet and\nDVD hey Dr Lederman we're back\nWe are back I was I bought an amazing a medical issue and really amazing difficult medical issue a man who came to us\nJust a couple of days ago Seventy two years old he's married he's got one daughter\nAnd last summer he had a disease of the bone marrow he had my little dysplasia where his bone marrow is stopping to produce blood cells well\nMost of us don't think too much about her bone marrow because it's just there and it's working for most of us so they can read cells to bring oxygen that can white cells different factions we could play it let's to stop bleeding\nAs working tick tock tick tock like your heart's working you don't think very much about it well you\nDon't think very much about it until it stops working and this man it has stopped working and so it's operating on less than half speed normal hemoglobin is about Fifteen sixteen and the man has him a globe and Rob ran down to about eight\nAnd that was last summer there was not very good treatment and sometimes these conditions even get worse well his got worse a different kind of way a few weeks ago we started having black Tariq stools is ... movements looked like road tar and it said the other teaching point\nBlackberry stools usually are blood it's just a blood and this man Scott week and a week and he started to every this road tires tools and he went to the doctor and he got or it up\nAnd it was found to have a pancreas cancer cancer spread to the liver and dispense ... cancer was growing up through the water them which is part of the intestine just next door\nBleeding he was bleeding losing out from this pancreas cancer losing out from the warden them with cancer that spread as normal him a globe number minor normal person is about Fifteen sixteen him a global\nHis was down to eight because of the problem with the bone marrow and now is ... is he the globe and went down to five point to him a global\nWith this mess eating through the ... he's got low platelets what low white count low hemoglobin he cannot have surgery even though the cancers eating through would probably never survive because number one is in terrible condition is no reserve is noble Merrill reserve\nMost likely sort of those were caught and start bleeding and start bleeding wherever they caught or touch and probably he would bleed to death\nAnd for pancreas cancer as well came all came all by itself number one chemo usually causes more damage to the bone marrow and we know the chemo doesn't cure anybody with pancreas cancer\nAnd he was basically sent home from one of the super duper hospitals to diet an added no carcinoma had a biopsy of the pancreas\nEating through the door on them and then it came to me who came to me and while we stage them up for\nA got a PET scan of him immediately to see how extensive the cancer was and we found that it has extensive cancer in different parts of the body but the worst was his cancer eating through the pancreas and ...\nWe spoke about all the options and he asked me if he could be treated immediately and we of course said yes and within a short period of time really hours\nHe got mapped out like you're from the other patient we made a mold of his body computerized everything in the body\nWe've mapped out thousands of beams to attack the cancer that the one the catch was eating through the in past and caused him\nTo bleed out and treated him and we treated him last night within hours of them coming to us\nAnd we did it why to help them to help stop the bleeding try to extend his life and to try to avoid this terrible calamity from be following this man\nAnd this is the work we do we see offered patience with newly diagnosed cancers like him in the most difficult circumstances see what else where he went all over the place and he had no solution other than being told to go home to die\nAnd we talked about so many patients like him today with his laboratory

called two one two ... two one two choices\nWas sponsored by radio surgery New York to abuse expressed by the preceding ... those are the sponsor and not necessarily the opinions of Seventy seven WABC your\nDiet dot officer\nThey're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's the natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to them maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefit\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering the test the problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research and then you have to go and have the blood tests done\nAnd then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way other symptoms I could look for that would tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for yes\nNot having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic feel will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week or talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health\nThose are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they'd been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think\nAnd then we move is normal yeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\n[noise] well more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient of course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about ... half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking the ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and if you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nLet me ask you this when when people started supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference and they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\nYeah that's probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by wellbeing I I just mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month to month to month where you you know you get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low and and that's one of the first thing that\nAnd the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move to a very similar to the closed we had for heart health are going to talk about that later but but people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun so the higher the altitude you live at the better your mode\nAnd mood improved in the summertime so mood improved in the summertime and worse than in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this that and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people\nThis is what they found they found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven times eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold beach at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life\nTo make you feel a difference when they start to supplement Ropper language she takes about a month I let me let me get this special offer because I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you got the vitamin D the recommended dosage the five thousand I use per day\nYou've also asked them to combine it with their omega three fish oils and there's a reason for that I Want you to explain that the sooner you get they seem to make each other even work better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good for you pay for shipping the shipping deals pretty good\nYeah when I approached purity I said you know vitamin D needs again at the special form of vitamin K ... expensive foreign vitamin K to it needs that bore on and I want it to be the patented bore on and it needs magnesium and it needs think\nAnd we'll talk about why that's important but then I said it also needs fish oil there to work together synergistic play\nAnd this is what I Want you to do I want you to give away a bottle of vitamin D a month's supply that sixty capsules and a bottle of molecularly distilled ultra pure Fisher what I Want you to give it away for free and they kind of laughed and they said okay I Will do it then\nAnd they asked me why and I said because in a month most people will feel the difference and they'll come back for more but then I said you know I don't want\nAny Nineteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want any fourteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want even a nine Ninety five shipping and handling what did you get\nLess than five dollars they agreed to a shipping and handling charge you for Ninety five to four Ninety five you get a free bottle of vitamin D a month's supply of the complete formula one you can't buy anywhere else in a month's supply of fish oil\nWhat are you going to lose right right what do you have to lose and the reason the purity agree to do this is because the executives there now themselves have been on this formula and they themselves know that you'll feel so much better after a month that you'll come back for more\nOne thing I like about the early ...\nPreceding program was paid for by purity process Lisa ... following program is the poor maturity products\nFollowing me the advertisement my journey products he's not in a way to the ages of ... not intend to design those trees cure all for any diseases pillows welcome once again to help lines like your brothers your host marks the most so glad\nYou could join us today it's a power plant program in fact er story originally Fifteen Years ago when there were known TV show sixty minutes captivated\nAudiences around North America with a special segment on the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says red wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best\nActivates genes that control our weight or energy healthy aging and even longevity the holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was the ritual yes resume its role the active ingredient found\nIn that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nNow yesterday says that's just half the story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce Robert Twenty years Dr precedent as an institution in New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime products formulated and high level advisor for purity products that your freshman welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's touch and this was also nominate on those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is was very ... why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine that's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even bounding peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested in resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when ... was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest that the early studies showed that resveratrol\nSeemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms that even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists absolutely well\nWell by two thousand six Italian scientists discovered that resveratrol extended the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex and here's what really got them interested\nA Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that resveratrol counter active the negative effect of a high fat diet in mice bite thirty percent now given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet this\nWas pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seemed to protect the intestines and the colon it definitely supported normal and cinematic activity in the body it improved indoor ends\nThere was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity and an even proved to support brain function great\nStudy from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent well whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity genes and your body it switches on a sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a secular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coat dramatically changes as a major\nPositive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the tape according to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard now this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years under co Q. formulas but now they speak to your co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as reservists role especially for your heart healthy and you also say in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten ... what exactly is it good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peek a what a co enzyme is\nA co enzyme if any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy\nWow that's amazing yeah well that's what it's all about not only\nThat but it's a very powerful anti oxen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's a while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point and that is is Nineteen sixty three\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heartbeat they were literally looking at heart and saying\nWhat is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell\nWins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten so we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of coke you ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten\nYou're living in what we call an energy deficient stay your heart needs co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle your brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system\nIt supplies energy to your lungs to your liver so needless to say we all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou've got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten ...\nYour body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential I mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts we're co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I understand that you told purity after quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two agrees the co Q. ten and the research will know why are you surprised is cutting edge combination purity cause of their co Q. super boost formula what can actually do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called it the advantage I like that so I adopted the term it's combining to amazing nutrients under themselves which a spectacular\nBut when you combine them indeed this spectacular in this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage the cardiovascular benefits benefits to your brain function and cognitive performance\nIt even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and endurance and aerobic capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on beat a boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nThat's interesting we're talking with Dr Alan ... know that the person who tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten deficient\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class for a while ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for tea you know I hear I'm running out of gas I got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "20"}
