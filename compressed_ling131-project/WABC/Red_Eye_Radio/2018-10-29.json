presence of ember several it was earlier this year we don't get the call was my last year I've been living\nWith yeah time flies a but but it ... it was last year because we we get this call from Brazil and this nice person says listen we would you know I just want to tell you from my perspective we\nWere suffering right now our nation is suffering because of socialism because of a number of things and he went through a couple of specific items of what was going on and he said look at it can't it's not sustainable this camp hole\nAnd so what you see here's this shift in power or at least for the moment to the right I'm In Brazil I don't know where I ... you know there's going to be I guess a a ton of work to be done to to bring their economy back to where it was\nA I don't know how you do that but certainly this was a reaction to what has gone on in recent years\nI I it might have been if we were talking about the impact of the Tea Party and I believe he called to talk about the fact that there was a movement that people in Brazil\nWe're looking at what was going on in in the United states and when they see what's going on in the in in the United states\nThat helps you know in inspire other countries like Brazil and uh and with a bow and arrow winning the presidency ah he you know part of his platform is to\nPrivatize state companies liberalize gun ownership and mine the rain forest\nSo go after ... natural resources give people the right to defend themselves and get the government out of business yet\n\nSo we'll get to that coming up here will tell you about the

[laughter]\nI just burst out laughing because\nI Will what happened to the left screaming about white males but bait so is the is the new guy you know white males need you Hirono need to shut up yeah what happened to that\nWell you know this this gets into the whole conversation of\nOf where we are you know as a country right now we've seen you know the the the blame game especially from the left the last couple of days\nOr not that his ... up to the left but the vast majority on social social media and in the media in general is the left attempting to blame Trump whether it's a synagogue shooting\nOr whether it's the you know the the the mail bomb\nOr a ... year I I mean the the piling on is just incredible I mean we live in a society where the left and I think it's very important you have to understand that that they don't have anything else to go on people\nDon't I I heard Bill Maher said that uh that uh people support the the Democrats and where they stand on friday I just saw the headline that's incorrect they don't if you look at the major tenants that the\nDemocratic Party supports the American people do not the American people do not support sanctuary cities the American people do not support\nA open borders the American people do not support the amount of gun control that the left would want a ... in in this nation they don't or they do have\nWhat they do have an advantage of by the way I I just love to see that some of the Democrats are not coming out against the debt mhm and you know that's that's beautiful except the fact that if you see the plans that they are putting in\nIf you if you see what color Harrison Cory Booker and everybody is talking about free health care well forget about it you're never going to pay for it because you can't tax everything that the rich has to pay for everything that you want from it but it's interesting because we're bringing up the deficit and the debt and look you know liquid trucks on the debt\nAnd we've all up and said this for a ... you and I've been doing the show for Thirteen Years so we were there for the last few years with the Bush administration ... where we had Democrats constantly calling St Bush were spending too much\nAnd we said well we hope you're here when Obama is is back in in in ... when Obama was in power now by the way we criticized Bush on his spit yes we did we absolutely did yes\nAh and we [laughter] we create criticized one of the images of of Texas a conservatism\nTom DeLay and when he told a conservatives to shut up because we cut just about everything we kind of the budget we said you're full of crap and so we have no problem if you listen to the show you know we have no problem taking on a Republicans when they claimed to be conservative but they are not and so we invited all those people\nBack then that should be between two thousand five and two thousand eight and we said look the Democrats takes it in two thousand eight we expect you to come back when they sky rocket the debt how many calls we have from Democrats in the eight years\nOn the debt on the deficit or ... years of Obama I Can't remember one zero\nSo I mean that's they they have no credibility of that and and people don't care that's you're doing to people of ... more Republicans used to screen the debt and they realize people don't care now the Democrats are screaming that people don't care\nThey they they just don't I run a couple of things over the weekend where people are saying you gotta understand the country is and I think I mentioned this last friday to this country is really going\nAh we're really going right we're really only right we're really going right in some areas we are ... physically were not no not even a close eye on on economic issues we're moving to the left\nWell independence and the Republican Party is moving to the lab yeah and\nYou if you look at the uh the the the major threat from capital to capitalism and freedom more importantly\nA it is that debt or because if we're not going to if we don't care about it now\nThan we're willing to let him go over the edge and at that point you can't turn back which means you have government take over control of industry when industry goes south or if there's a program that goes south or you're going to have what\nI get a ... imagine a scenario forget about cutting you know we talked about the whole hair cut thing you know to to present five percent ten percent but the problem was is that\nNow you can't talk about a one percent cut\nYou can't talk about a one percent increase snow\nYou can't you can't live with your increase to one percent so there's there's just no way you would have\nRiots in the street remember in Europe when they were cutting or some of the social benefits and there were then and there were riots by young people you know there were they were talking about the especially like retirement benefits and everything else and the young people were writing there were setting cars on fire how dare you take away all of our free stuff\nWell imagine you know an economy our size and we get to the point that we can't service that that anymore\nI don't remember\nIt was wide open that door it was the jet I mind trick of Brock Obama as president but that's not a problem well today the the economy isn't collapsing but it will and I compare to saying well you're bedrooms on fire but you're in the kitchen and everything is fine\nOn an economics on on the tax cuts yeah the Republican Party is moving more conservative on on spending uh on on a on tariffs and we're not talking about China we're talking about the other ones and no we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right\nA a a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers\nAnd a half of the increase we talk about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending mhm not not the private market booming now half\nOf it is the private market and preventing and we agree with that but we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go\nBut to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs to get and you've got is as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic mind Mm because you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased\nMost respected us force on these\nDays\n...\nFamous [noise]\n[noise]\nHi it's Rena Cosby from Curtis and Cosby did you

it's gotten past that at least before we were discussing what John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and we're going at it about their entire lives that made them fierce political enemies\nIt was about under the constitution that we have what should the role the federal government be\nThat's not the debate anymore it has been the debate even up to you know ten Fifteen Twenty years ago but the debate has changed as you just brought up\nRight before the top of the hour the political divide now is we don't believe in America yes we don't believe in the first amendment to the constitution\nAnd\nThis goes to the point of how you sell taking away people's rights we talked about McCain Feingold\nThat really started in the late Nineteen nineties\nWhich was we need to get money out of politics which was always the dumbest thing in the world Democrats aren't talking about that are they especially with better when Texas nowhere in fact they were applauding better do for getting you know tens of millions of dollars raised right so taking the money out was dumped ... was was a concept of what you're going to happen to begin with\nBut it got to the point is we know McCain Feingold we need to limit speech of groups groups shouldn't be advertising because there might be able to influence an election where they're supposed to be that's where we got to the point of the dumbest\n... the slogan ever from the left corporations are people nobody said there were\n\nOf course corporations aren't people corporation is a set of laws set up by government\nTo regulate business if you're a citizen or a group of citizens that gets involved in that you don't lose your free speech rights and the story that's when I looked at it and said wow it's that's an easy sell because you had McCain that agreed with it and then you had George W.\nBush sign at you and I both have the same opinion back then what are you doing you don't get to dictate who was free speech and who does it oh you are defending the corporations I'm not defending anybody I'm defending free speech either we have it or we don't\nThat to me going back to and that's why I say roughly Twenty years ago that to me was the beginning of the push to say that the constitution had it wrong where we see now are free speech as a as has gone to write\nWe we've seen the beginnings of it\nNew York city human or New York city human rights council or you don't use the right gender pronoun or\nWill find you what a business California well yeah OK jailed times in the law or you're not going to actually put him and I'm sure they don't let it go to the law it was going to put it in in in in the law and so we talked about you know that we've talked about\nThe first time we talked about free speech the left does not believe in free speech they don't believe in freedom of religion we've talked about the different you know a Baker cases forced cases are out there\nAnd as most people in America believe look don't you want to do\nBehind closed doors but don't care what you want to do with your life don't force me to believe it now the left wants you wants to force you to do it remember when Obama became president oh no no no come on I mean Obama Care now this is going to be fine no we're not going to force\nOr anybody who is religious to do anything against what they wish to what to do all ... perceptions contraceptives yeah\nWe're going to force you to do this\nWe knew it all along so you look at freedom of the first amendment they don't believe in that anymore they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion Second Amendment they want gone they believe is antiquated\nAnd as we as seen now\nAnd this comes from the identity politics ... created and nurtured by the Democrat Party\nAre there to the point now of as we saw during Cavanaugh a woman is always to be believed due process doesn't matter when a woman makes the allegation\nEverybody knows that's total garbage every case is on the evidence if you came out and said you believe no there should be a presumption of innocence and we should have due process\nYou were called every name in the book you were called a gang rape enabler and\nThat's where the political divide is in this country then we go even further with the election of Trump and the ... and and what happened with cabinet\nThat now the leftist promoting and we're seeing the beginning of this and it's and it's spreading now go to social media and see how many people on the left are picking it up\nWell you know yeah the electro college is wrong and now so is the Senate the Senate is wrong we shouldn't have it set it anymore\nAnd we shouldn't have the electoral college which again to me there's no compromise on those issues why because I understand why they were created they were created to protect individual rights that the left used to care about\nWe've often talked about the ignorance of the people in this country especially on the left when it comes to understanding the constitution which they don't even want it seemed to understand whatsoever\nBut we live in a constitutional republic not a direct democracy and there was a reason for it\nIt was sold the majority could not rule over the minority it was so individual rights could be protected that the majority could not rural your constitutional rights invalid that's why we live in a constitutional republic\nThey don't care and so now the political divide is not how much a government should provide to everybody or how much the transfer of wealth should\nBe\nNow the left has moved into the political divide is then we don't believe in the United states we don't believe in individual rights we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the second amendment we don't believe in due process\nUnder the law we only care about what we want and how ever we attain it including tearing down the constitution of the United states if we had the power to do so where's the compromise\nIf you sit in our seats where's the compromise on that\nWell there isn't any there isn't any so there's going to be a political divide and it's going to be fierce and it's going to be passionate\nWell and that's always going to be the case and and right now the reason that it is a the the debate is so fears is because of the importance of those items\nThis is why you seen the Republican Party I think Joe this especially since the cabinet thing but I think the the Kavanaugh thing was was not just about the cabinet process or the lack of respect for the process\nI think it was an eye opener for a lot of those that were in the middle\nI think it was an eye opener for Lindsey Graham\nBecause\nYou and I had a one time during a pre show meeting during all of that after it happened we were like I said wow who knew Lindsey Graham huh but you had Lindsey Graham actually say during that are passionate speech talk about\nThe process during Sotomayor and Elena Kagan's confirmation\nAnd what the discussion was about\nBut I think for a lot of them they live inside the bubble they don't see it as we see it every single day they followed the rhetoric but they don't follow it like we do certainly they they fear things and they see things but now they were ... people were getting in their face\nNow it had come to their table\nRight there on the committee or if they start with a Senate majority leader basically being chased down in an airport they saw it with with Ted Cruz and it wasn't just protester groups\nThat kind of behavior had reached the Senate chambers\nAnd I think it was an eye opener for them to put it on perspective and say well yeah of course it was bound to reach our table it was bound to get here ultimately and it has and that was the real threat because\nForget about the the the the protesters\n\nHi it's Rena Cosby from Curtis and Cosby did you know the best time to both of your family\nAnd group holiday travel is now\nFor all of

... currently and generally my camera on ... radio what\nWhat somebody\nThat we have all these\nAre currently I'm Gary Mac emerge so just having a discussion on the\nPolitical divide from our point of view and and why it exists today and and it's just it's a reality of what we what we live with a we're not the first ones to live the political divide in this country and we won't be\nThe last the only difference in the political divide now\nIs it's not a political divide anymore as I can see it based on the fact that we as a nation need to provide more to the people with a bigger federal government under the constitution\nBut now it's a belief on the left that the laws and the constitution that we have to protect individual rights and the minority don't matter anymore\nAnd so you know we we've talked about capping off the caravan also brings not just illegal immigration\nOr into the forefront but it brings in the concept of sanctuary cities mhm and I still believe that the Republicans have failed miserably to capitalize on this because yeah science or you think about sanctuary cities just the belief\nThat in a legal immigrant criminal and their freedom is more important than the rights and security of American citizens that's the point that it's been brought up enough\nWhat you hear is sanctuary cities well we need to protect\nThese people but what are you doing you're not protecting just illegal immigrant you're protecting the illegal immigrant criminal that's act by the way that's actually why it's news\nYeah\nYeah it's it is not you know this is the ... you I think the the situation in California where you had a city's come out and and go after the state for centuries state polls\nAnd\nThe the concerns that were issued at those all those events surrounding that and it's still going on there will be in that will be an interesting legal battle by the way to watch in the coming years um\nBut that threat is is very real when you talk about your cities' leaders are your county or your state leaders saying we're not here to protect you\nI mean that goes beyond think about the empty political ... the political process the promises over the years we're going to be tough on crime we're really going to work to improve things that some people actually were able to get it done\nBut those empty political promises people usually scoff at this is quite the opposite it's not just a political promise it's an in your face action by the government that says we\nAre not here to serve you and your safety interests were here to serve the safety interests of someone who doesn't belong here who was not a citizen\nAnd so I think it's important where the political debate has because many people are falling into the political debate has become the back and forth on social media every tweet let's analyze it back and forth who had the\nDidn't solve who made who who who made a the the social media statement that could be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violence and even if they were getting around and we're like let's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about\nWhat is the substance of the political divide right and I believe from my point of view that's that's what I fear\nTo excuses\nAnd yet we still need\nAnd I W J Barnabas how\nWe offered

Radio Welcome to the show Hi Randy\nThank you sir\nI my my opinion as it is that the lay offs just trying to take us to the United states to the point of failure and I believe that the United states files\nThat you know where's the rest of the world around the stadium where the where the savior of the world if it were not better page a problem happens in the world we are there what happens\nYou know you you make a a you make a great point and uh I remember when from first started running for president people wonder if you'd be in isolation mhm he wants to back off he doesn't want to get involved he's been president United States now\nHe probably has projected us power without you know any type of major war better than any president I Know yeah in in in my lifetime ...\nYou know projecting if I guess maybe you can make a case for Reagan because of the the the Cold War or a different thing Reagan ... post Cold War say let's go post okay sure but if it's I don't think it's unfair because that or was totally different situation when you were going to the Cold War that exist there but post Cold War\nUh I I think he's actually he hasn't been an isolationist I think he understands that\nEven though we don't want to get involved in everybody's business you've got to project American power and I believe that he has\nWhy they want to do what is an interesting case I Do think that you have for example you have left us professors that are sitting there and they're think tanks and talking about how we need to be you know global citizens and how the United states needs to you know needs to go away and to become part of\nA Europe or whatever but I think when it comes to comes down to the average person it's not that complicated\nI think they're not getting into theoretical political discussion leftist discussions I think it's about the fact that they get into their tunnel vision and say oh we didn't ... Kavanaugh's in we can't have Gavin I'll get rid of the Senate\nWell uh it's Harvard ... presidents probably would get rid of the presidency um get rid of the electoral college at remedy we get rid of the electoral college we can't have a ... if we lose the electoral vote\nAnd win the popular vote we can't have that and and and it is pretty much the solution to everything from the white oh that didn't go away we'll get rid of that\nSo I don't I don't know if I don't believe that the average liberal running around who was outside of university [laughter] [laughter] or liberal think tank\nIs going through that process of saying we wish to all be global citizens I Know that's promoted but you see the most will do those kinds of comments mostly come from university ah type people I think it's the average liberal politician out their\nSit there and says I Want to win the election next election what can get it for me open borders well I really don't want to open borders but I'm One of many illegal immigrants to come in because if we claim that if we claim that we care about them than if they can get citizenship will get their vote\nWell and that's it it it's you know if we can it if we can uh pose as people as the side that cares the fact of the matter is is they only care about again their side the things that they want they want to completely do away\nWith the foundation of the nation they want to do away with this with the with anybody who disagrees with oh we want free speech but only free speech\nFor the things we agree with her uh [noise] well that's not what free speech is about [noise] free speech\nThe stuff you don't agree [noise]\n\n\n... radio\nOn Westwood One be a part of the\nImagining of better bank starts with looking at the savings rates most banks offer and saying\nReally capital one is building something better you can open a capital one savings account with one of the nation's best savings rates from anywhere like here for here\nOne of the nation's best savings rates opened on line at a capital one location or from anywhere that's banking re imagined what's in your wallet for consumers only offered by capital one and a member FDIC copyright twenty eight and capital one\nShoe militia York is always looking for qualified individuals to fill open job positions if you're interested in becoming part\nOf our team at Seventy seven WABC or sister stations Ninety five five field Jay\nNash FM Ninety four seven and radio one of the three nine call us today and she went to six one three three hundred and asked about current full and part time openings that's two one two six one three thirty eight hundred to one to six one three thirty eight hundred or does it WABC radio dot com and energy where\nJobs college internships available to Julie let's just an equal opportunity employer\nHey buddy how does a brand new superhero sound you sound fantastic I Love those costs well like the perfect ... what does that only consider us through by no I got the perfect ... two thousand Nineteen superhero story has arrived well tell me a little more said I Love these cars Rabbani it's super connected get stream apple playing or enjoy audio\nCan I listen to a CD R or love AC DC you bet you can great it's also got Bernie why by hotspot now I Love being connected to the life I have you ever got something better blind spot ... eyesight driver us this morning ... outside Julie law that technology\nAt age confidence to every threat really does for a leaf up with just two hundred and thirty five dollars a month for forty two months and only twenty nine sixty to cash\nFor trade deal what scientists call a day five ... five forty one twenty five released details will visit Randy super dot net to see the all new twenty Nineteen forest\nTo offer veiled qualified buyer subject to primary letter approval to include all costs to be paid by consumer except for licensing registration its axis cage for one zero six five seven motto kept me sale is ten thirty one Eighteen\nNo it is often said that the suit makes them in and I've been making my sits in America and the very same New England factories since Nineteen eighty seven when they launch my first collection for over Thirty years my goal has been to help American men look and feel better when it comes to their own sense of style\nNow I've created my luxury flagship store in the heart of Manhattan\nThat forty nights and Madison to do just that\nI'm Joe civil booed and I have always believed in the quality in service of the great men specialty stores of the past\nYou can experience that first hand with distinctive one of a ... shootings impeccable tailoring and luxurious fabrics from the finest Italian meals and while you're at it be the man who makes the suit and try our custom made offerings of tuxedos suits and cashmere jackets from our black label collection\nEleven B.

Bush was he\nDid you hear the way that he talks is our rap artist but the fact was he was called everything in the book from a mental case\nTo Uncle Tom and he has to be by the ... if you come from their point of view he has to be to hear how we ... started the black ... ... yeah [laughter]\nAh you had the the group of a of a black Trump supporters last week hundreds of the meat ...\nNow I don't know I don't know whether he's got it you know whether the in the midterms you'll get a couple more percentage of blacks black still overwhelmingly vote for Democrats we all know that\nBut the fact is imagery the imagery and it's growing each and every day whether it's Kanye West coming out or\nOr some of the biggest conservatives supporters right now and Trump supporters in this country are blacks it may not be a world wouldn't have changed at the moment\nBut the fact is they're getting media coverage\nAnd the more that comes out more the more blacks to stand up and say I like Trump and I don't believe he is a racist they can't have that on the left that is not permissible\nYou and I've always said on um you know proper racist how many years as anybody ever have an allegation of him\nA racist in business ever know anybody who's ever worked for ... you know you saw a number of people that were in fact he was at a resort or when he was campaigning twenty sixteen and you had people that stood up\nYou know from all ethnic backgrounds that said who's to credit\nThe work for\nNo they they praised him until he became a threat\nIn ... until he started working you know for things\nHow many how many and see a A N double ACP awards did he went\nRight now he was praised across the board the liberal left love Donald Trump\nUp until the time he decided to run for president and promote things like tightening the borders lowering taxes\nYeah no they loved him\nBut he was well and still is\nOn most everything that he's done these well within the mainstream of American politics as you pointed out many times but that doesn't that doesn't matter no he's an extremist and we must label them as such\n\nThis will be the tactic for you know it hasn't been the tactic by the left or for many years on presidential candidates but it's going to be the ... it's the tactic by the left on on pretty much everything now\nAnd we address this last week I don't like a lot of Trump's rhetoric and I don't think it's needed\nI don't think it's needed to win but I Know it's part of his personality\nI hate to say it but as ... as the great conservative political\nShots you said\n... remember during the campaign or was it after the campaign flu is after the campaign loves messing with people's heads yeah we're from queens we mess with people right now I don't like it because I think that on so many issues he has the wind\nAnd he doesn't have to get personal well and ... in ... in a lot of the rhetoric right order in order to get the when we've talked about this in great depth last week got some complaints on it that's fine [laughter] welcome to talk radio but it's not needed the\nInstant satisfaction of somebody on their side was mean so you can be mean back and you get that instant enjoyment stop but we don't need\nEspecially with the winds that this president is getting that the other Republicans haven't been able to get or weren't willing to take on in years right\n\nBut the wins do the talking\nBut I understand but I've come to realization of of who he is although I did see some I did a some social media are posted well you can no longer look at them and say that the rhetoric is acceptable because he has good policy\nWell no\nActually you can and you can also say for all of his rhetoric um [noise] look at the opposition mhm look what the choice was what was the choice mhm the angel\nHillary yeah my name's ...\nDes ... was it like I said it's [laughter] about that that rhetoric [laughter]\nLike the grim reaper [laughter]\nBy the way she said she would like or to be president but she isn't going to run in two years on I saw that headline over the week yeah mainly because she knows that the the left is going to call her up look they're done with her they're done with\nThe establishment left or whatever you want to call it\nNo no no how much else it won't be long before possibly but it won't be long before they're done with oh Casio
