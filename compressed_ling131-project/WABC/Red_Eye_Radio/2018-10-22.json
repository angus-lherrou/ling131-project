if you went out and bought the Korea pure cruelty and that's a curious to find this pre teen from Europe if you brought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D\nAnd it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not going to spend that today and that was purely products and your name going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today\nIt's for your job is to be one of the first thousand callers\nAnd take it seriously this stuff flies out the door and the big radio stations be one of the first thousand cause you could you be twelve and ... and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you know\nWe want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it\nTry it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing Sherry Barry powder so how do you like to take you to give people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottom today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at days are days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing has become a very big these days so if you're doing something like that to a jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDump it right into your juice dump it into your protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about the study the purity did on the ever strong powdered they tested golfers and

restaurant powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong powder for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further ... not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey get older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job but you had five hundred dollars on a driver up five yards right this is bored team\nYards pat people shouldn't just how how about this or your about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more

example these people shouldn't vote according to a recent survey seven percent of Americans believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows seven present yes okay the survey was conducted by the innovation center will not done yet the innovation center of the u._s. dairy in April yeah a thousand adults Eighteen and over ask\nQuestions about the role that milk plays in their daily lives the

or you know on your local TV you know and make sure you wear a big jacket today but nobody says hey make sure you wear\nPants today they should say that every day or you know we we laugh at that and now we're getting into that time of the you don't get a B for the kids leave the house today make sure you put on their winter jacket yeah most of us say stop it right just stop and stuff\nAnd now we have to realize no those are valuable instructions for many people that exist today well yeah I don't know that when it gets cold you need to put a jacket on we\nGotta we gotta apologized to all of our friends who who work at these TV stations who are way ahead of the stupid curve and I do mean stupid\nBecause there was a stupid curve here look\nWe know our audience the critical thinkers we ... we but but we're all going to have to like I don't know built afford let's just call it Texas and we're going to have to guard against this kind of stupidity but I don't know how you do that\nYou know or who was it a Ron White you can't fix stupid but I I don't know how you repair this\nI don't know how ya doing that back that's not even funny anymore no no that's actually [laughter] I ... I Know that's a comment like if he if Ron White just\nYou know had his own show on Fox News or something that would be just as serious comment you know you can fix stupid 'cause you can't I don't know how we do that so what you need to do you stock up on you know Dr rice and and dried beans and hoping that you're going to need because of the stupid apocalypse is on its way\nIt's it's not far off not far off we don't know if if we have a significant number of people forty eight percent who aren't sure we're chocolate milk comes from\nWe're not going to need a purge no no no no no no people just sort of no see that's the thing that sort of just running around in circles that's just sort of fade away because yeah it's like they can't they can't\nSurvive on it reminds me of the the old magnetic football thing again you just turn it on that just all go in circles and that's why I had\nNo idea that when I got frustrated that a game as a kid\nCome on kids you guys wrong [laughter] just wandering around in circles little felt football the one guy was old enough to\nRemember they had the little kicker and you tried to get fat but might never it never wear it never got past the center\n[laughter] over and the kicker kicks it all went to their own already had again and that and that's why we all instead of\nPlaying the the you know the electric football we all put the penny and remember you put the penny underneath the finger and they after your thought on your finger and you're like ... yeah enough in the air and the other one held the gold price right and they're like this is more satisfying for football right exactly I had no idea how we got to electric football from ... already not women Elizabeth Warren in one one thousand twenty\nWell what does all of the stupid people who are running around like the little electric football players these days it's what they look just running around in circles\nSo getting back originally by the way this is going to be most of the show [laughter] you just heard here in the first segment yeah by the way I question another\nQuestion we've gotten a lot a lot of questions from vacation is it a caravan or a mob\nI Will say this ... I think putting on our ... and we're going to be like we always do we put on our our substance had which is looking at the issues and basing it on the substance in our political had put it on my political had I thought that\nWhat came out of the the the campaign from the Republicans and Democrats I thought the best\nCampaign slogan actually came from Trump that was jobs not mobs\nVery a very easy to understand and but very quickly on the the caravan here 'cause we had a lot to talk about today and uh it it's funny\nSometimes I just wonder how do people think and this is comes from from the uh people that support Trump but this this was about profit it's about to get to Trump but I'm thinking to myself and you at the same thought\nThink people this is for him this works for him we're moving towards election day and the closer the caravan comes\nTo the U.S border is going to help Republicans and help Trump but I'd rather him say it took ... what is this is because this ... this is a conspiracy sources behind it and and they're doing this in order to win the election well then try and spend more money to win the election in a more caravans command\nIf they believe that that's an effective way to win an election because it's not\nIt's not it it the we set it and it was the time and everything going on in twenty sixteen But Trump's own immigration illegal immigration if you want if he if he is to get back on track to get funding for the wall this will be part of\nIt is five you and I were talking about if there is a conspiracy yeah it would be the truck\nBehind all of us [laughter] than a billion\nDollars to make it happen because it's working for him right there is any conspiracy politically that would be called brilliant or affective in terms of a positive for one side of the other they would be him behind the conspiracy because\nThis works for the president and Republicans if you've got five ... this is what we saw a few years ago years back or when you had an influx not\nQuite like the care of him mob or whatever you want to call it um but but pretty much the same effect right there are about to reach the border and you had people\nYou had Democrats who had rank and file Democrats saying no no no no no no we're spending people on those ... spending money government money on people who aren't citizens and we're not spending enough in in the cities in in our town them on our kids\nAnd that's the way that went and uh that was before Trump was president ah if you think this is a conspiracy let them try it it does not work for the left\nComing up on the show first the one over one thousand and twenty four we will we will get to because still I was with you and I both on vacation very rainy vacation whether I was in New York or whether I was here didn't matter ...\nIt just it rained it was a complete the ... wash out and in fact the most the the biggest thing that I accomplished was I got three room steam cleaned in my house\nAre brought up the steam cleaner and did a three rooms and have four more to go a so that was really what I did over ... ... you know vacation oh by the way very quickly\nAnd happy sixty seven wedding anniversary to my parents as sub Saturday oh we'll have the ending was the seven yeah\nI've had a ... a ... a but we'll we'll get to that coming up because\nI just when I saw that I went when I first saw that I said she is she dumber what how dumb ... she ...\nYou know for doing that and she came out yesterday and said that she did it because the world needs transparency and she was attempting to be transparent to a high a also coming up on the show Hillary is just like Mike Myers from Halloween she just won't go away or should I say Michael Meyers yeah Michael Meyers Michael Meyers is pretty funny right All right in ...\nUh the uh the the jobs not mobs political slogan that came out while we were on vacation and the Democrats platform is what we thought it was going to be\nWhich is part of hacks on Kavanaugh to those Democrats upset about the ... a ... death where were you on Benghazi right\nWhere were you on ... because the criticism of the administration luck none of us know everybody becomes an expert on these things oh here's what happened you have no clue what happened and maybe somebody in the CIA knows what happened maybe Trump knows what happens maybe somebody some of them in the

appropriating a culture and the thing I liked his wouldn't even came up with a one sixty fourth while she could be one sixty fourth or could be won over five hundred and twenty or one over one thousand two hundred and twenty four\nAnd it was like yeah but the one or even if it's the one over sixty four and I don't even know whether this is true or not but somebody pointed out they said when all the average American is one point eight percent Native Americans who doesn't even meet\nWhat the average American is at that particular point so without question this is ... ... you know cultural appropriation right the the the second thing was\nYou want white privilege white privilege is a white person claiming that they can be whatever they wish to be whatever minority they wish to be that they can be whatever minority they wish to be\nThe other thing was the media jumping on this is it as if this legitimize\n[laughter] yeah that was ever veto you're right I Know that that that was yeah that that ... that was it\nBecause there were some here's what was I think great about the whole scenario I don't know that was planning on the part of the president I don't think it was it was just basic basically it was his rhetoric on his side right\nBut remember back in twenty sixteen we were saying okay when you're on a stage with Hillary and you're you're debating just throw the facts out or you know she lied about being ... she you know uh the she broke the law but it came to her email server all these things just throw the facts out and have them ...\nWell they ended up back checking Elizabeth [laughter] and the ones with warm people basically doing that and then they come back as if it's legitimate\nRight but then they remember they kept changing it that well the ... the ... was the Boston Globe yeah I Know why we made us take care of and we made a mistake\nAgain any time you know it just got to the point of being the most was saying yeah right and I'm thinking to myself wow\nHow bad are in seriously now you when I Need to reconsider ... we need to get out of this radio thing and get into political consulting oh yeah I Would totally do that and just say you idiot\nYeah what do you think they're going to work well\nIf you're going to waste your money waste your money on us give us a million dollars and we can be a lot better political\nConsultants for whoever you're using right because remember this means that Elizabeth Warren got together with all of her aides and they sat in a room and said okay here's our plan to counter Trump mhm yeah and everybody shook their heads going\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha that's going to do with that you think there was one guy or gal in the room that said\nNo no [laughter] but they all have that all there was an overriding vote sorry we all voted you were deciding to go with it because [laughter] where do just that tactic become a good idea\nAnd and but this is not this is the mainstream remember when you have the Kavanaugh hearings the first Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd it was the first day and remember that whole weekend the Democrats on the committee had decided whether or not they were going to do a

with\nAnd it looks like\nThey had that meaning they met all weekend about it okay would get up and walk out [laughter] which ultimately\nAgain why didn't want us to write the alphabet you know if I

got that the other thing that you have which could be a\nHuge political gift is the fact that immigration up until maybe a month ago the poll showed immigration was still illegal immigration which still be the number one topic out there\nWhere you want to bring everything that we have just brought to you\nAnd then take it where immigration is now\nOver the next two weeks before election day as a caravan\nOf illegal immigrants\nThat I'm sure the president will call a mob at some point you know and people look at that and say here they come\nAnd the you know this was something that the Democrats are doing in order to win the election and we've said well wait a minute is probably have the opposite effect and it will have the opposite effect that leading up to election day you have a ... and I saw anywhere between five and ten thousand people\nHeading to the U.S border just warm over the border\nI don't know of a mid term election where a political party that has been in power\nThat wouldn't normally lose seats that has been so well prepared with the not only the issues by their side but the motion by their side because\nThe emotion of the Republicans is extremely recent it's not the hatred of Trump that's simmered for the last two and a half years\nAnd that's been there for two and a half years this is stuff that is fresh in people's minds I don't know what's gonna happen in the election it looks like right now that they're going to ah keep hold of the Senate or the house I just I just don't know and uh I don't think when you look back at Ninety four\nAnd Ninety four and nobody really got a good read it that nobody saw that wave coming in the house nobody saw it coming right\nAnd and so I don't know about the house is it a possibility that Republicans could hold onto it yeah uh I don't know how in the mid term like this you can determine\nA extrapolate what the turnout\nIs going to be all I can tell you is I understand that in a in a midterm election the party not empower normally gain seats and the excitement level is normally with them\nNot seen that there isn't doesn't excite voted voted Seidemann level and the Democrats I just see an unprecedented in\nA mid term at least in recent times\nWhere there has been so much motivation\nFrom the party in power which is the Republicans\nNot to lose that I saw out of the interview that was that was done with a a bait or work Robert Francis ... over the weekend said if you truly are a rock star and I looked at you and I said I heard that over the weekend and I thought well no and you and I hate that term to begin with for politicians or what does it mean we we don't like to practice and political I dollar tree but since\nThat has been made I looked through and I said look look at what Trump is doing\nTrump still out there filling huge arenas two years later and he's doing stuff now bomb it into the same thing I don't think Obama could have done that two years later\n... well that was not at the same excitement well because ... and we warned in fact if you look at what happened in two thousand eight ah than the for you that was there after that uh the inauguration and two thousand nine and then you saw what\nThe Tea Party the birth of the the modern day Tea Party or or the game I guess in terms of the the momentum of that Tea Party and ... ... and early ah two thousand nine and ... and it kind of carried over\nBut ultimately the rock star thing was over and we warn between election day two thousand page and an observation day two thousand nine for Obama we said okay for people that wanted the rock star keep in mind he's going to have to do things that are presidential\nAnd those things are not going to work for you by the way that ... or so and years ago because [laughter] ... lead off the charts now\nAh to the fact that you know to the point that in fact a beta does not need the former president's campaigning in Texas um but but\nThe that that didn't carry over\nThe ... the Trump momentum is built on a number of things and real things\nIt's not rock stardom but if you want to talk about a political rockstar and that would be somebody in my opinion that that that performs gets things done\nOn his agenda not not that Obama didn't get things done on his agenda they got Obama carried through you know they had to lie about it but they got it through a this president got affect them things done on the economy\nThis president got in and created more jobs is president got in and work with Republicans to bring taxes down\nAnd I don't think we've had this conversation we don't think he could have that anyone else could have done that Republicans are alone could have gotten the down on the corporate rate to Twenty one percent but you look at those accomplishments that's where the following that's where the ... it's\nThat's where it's built and then as you mentioned the Kavanaugh thing is something new to the water to do it woke up conservatives it woke up the maybe some other rhinos who had abandoned too many conservative principles\nAnd had them read look I guess we examine the threat to democracy the constitution then everything our entire system and process in place during that Kavanaugh debacle that whole thing so\nThat threat became real this is not some kind of rock stardom oh we think looks great or we think he's cool or we like the way he tweets\nIt's based on real things there's a big difference\nBetween skateboarding Rwanda burger parking lot and getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one percent\nWhile you know you and I were talking about this said that if there is a\nIs there and we had mentioned you know better work here in uh in in Texas that that is viewed as the rock star mhm well uh Bud Kennedy of the star telegram and waited out the other day and I just read the article that he wrote based on the tweet yeah there's a\nPlace called the originally theater molds like three to five hundred people that's it couldn't fill it couldn't fill\nUp\nThat it was three quarters cornered Bud Kennedy was three ... you know three quarters\nFull and did an article as beta burnout already here and so when you talk about it ever existed or the life ever really right did did it ever really exist or was it hype just what was it was it hype and the rank and file or hide it in the media right right but it is you know is it is the point so\nIf you look at the excitement factor or and again I don't look at crowds just going to visit a candidate a you know see a candidate\nAs the the be all end all as as to whether people will go out and vote or not all I Know is this that on the issues right now on the economy it's a plus for the Republicans\nOn on exposing what the Democrats really really want\nAnd and what they really believe when it comes to this country and they do they even believe in the constitutions do they believe in free speech that they believe in Second Amendment do they believe in due process under the law and we're finding out no they don't actually don't believe in the tenets of this country right right and those are pretty simple things to understand\nMaybe the separation of powers you don't understand maybe exactly what the role of the Supreme Court you don't understand but you do understand due process\nYeah\nYou need and you do understand the second amendment\nAnd most people do understand free speech and maybe not everything that's in the first amendment\nBut they do understand the free speech everything that the Democrats now do not believe in and are bragging that they don't believe in in those particular things and then\nYou have a caravan of illegal immigrants that are promoting it and the media is giving them as much publicity as possible they're going to show up Trump's they're coming to the border to crash the border has the mid term elections\nAre just Fifteen days away and it would take them I read one thing that to go what is it the eight hundred miles right I've heard you would take them five hundred and forty seven hours\nWhich means okay so should they should be closing in on the border come election day ... probably not something the Democrats want to be promoting as much as are promoting it right or the media is promoting as much as they are going to promoted\nBecause until I think Kavanaugh illegal immigration would still the number one issue of concern for Americans and as you said\nIf there's a conspiracy out there and our pre sold meeting and from it in order to get to build the wall right Trump is funded this whole thing because if I got to have a lot of conspiracy theory that just because boom\nMhm [noise]\nBalance of them\nHave already how does a brand new superhero sound you sound fantastic I Love those cars

I'm I'm Talking about the fact of what is hurt the Democrat Party\nAnd the fact that if you're a newbie coming along you've got to offer something different ... you've got to start you've got to start addressing I Believe what Tim Ryan who ran against Nancy Pelosi of Ohio set and\nYou've got to stop talking about identity politics and you've got to get in the real world you got to talk about the real thing and I saw this week and yesterday somebody who's making an analysis of prompt they said look Trump's popularity is still there because Trump's popularity is still with the average person right\nThat he's you know he's with he's with the average person who looks at the elite and they don't look at him as as part of the you know the elite in Washington but they look at the elite they look at the I'm\nA ... of ... what do they call it the um oh what we could not what we know ... what we called deep state the the establishment what do they call it the swamp the swat swat yeah\nWhen when we when we we look at the ... the great and they view that the Trump that Trump ... and his opinions are the the opinions of the average man there is a relation of the average person\nTo Donald Trump right part of it was well he's also anti elite intellectual and I thought about that I go well I'm not anti intellectual I mean that's not what attracts me to Trump would\nWould attract me to Trump is the part of his intellect where he actually has the right answers and so yeah I I don't know who actually wrote bad weather came from somebody who is more\nA liberal just say you know anti intellectual or whether it is that mindset that exist with the populists were against anybody that use themselves as an intellectual because intellectuals are always wrong ... ah I'm not sure where that was but the fact is she relates to the average person out there and he speaks like the average person to mhm\nUh but the fact is he actually has intellect\nThat solves a heck of a lot of problems and a blood this of the reality\nOf things that we actually face or in the world would still a willingness to negotiate you can look at North Korea again that's still on you know that's still a great unknown as to what's gonna happen there you can look at Saudi or you know Saudi Arabia you can look at\nUm a a China and what's going on with the with China right now we think the president has said great successes we also think that he's made some\nSome errors especially in dealing with Canada and Mexico for example in trade we don't believe that we ... I ... if you're a Trump supporter on trade what he was talking about when he ran for office and what he actually\nThere were two totally different ballgame completely yeah and what he was talking about on the campaign compared to what he was what he actually got and promoted the good at what he got was completely different than when he was running for his campaign and as we've said\nIf his most loyal if the always Trump hers want to support it and go with it we're fine with that because all we care about is the actual substance what did you actually get and doesn't promote more free trade to promote\nA more more good things but the ultimate thing that he promoted\nWhich actually negative it raises the cost of cars in the United states Canada and Mexico and that's a bad thing mhm and now I think the average person who understands economics who is in caught up in the political I dollar tree will admit\nThat's a bad part of the deal the always Trump or his just ignore it they ignored as if it doesn't exist were not just going to go there he got the deal he said he was going to redo NAFTA he did after what was the NAFTA I don't care don't want to know and that's fine\nThat's part of a demographic that's going to vote for every president that exists sure but that's not the only demographic they voted for Trump we broke it down to eight different demographics\nAbout six months after the election\nAnd there's a ton of people that in that eight demographics is more now more United and you can even at a ninth in there which are the never Trump ... which have now come aboard mhm so Trump for all of the good and the bad has United\nWith the help of Kavanaugh\nAnd the help of the Democrats and then speaking bluntly about what they want this country to become a have United around Trump and they do look at Trump he is that they had that isn't them right\nAnd and I think\nYou look at the end\nAnd you said this earlier if you want to look at the ... the the real rock star look at the terms in terms of performance in terms of getting things done Trump over they come on and I'm close because\nOne thing that that is going to always resonate with American people is a good economy\n\nIt's going to be a man I'm uh doing okay everybody in my family seems to be doing okay\nA job status doing OK and or getting better\nYou look at the unemployment numbers in and these kittens were the liberal media can't argue any of those points anymore they can't break down because you you just simply can't those numbers\nNow they can be manipulated but in breaking them down in terms of the performance as as long as we've used the same standard standard with the same standard of approach basically on those numbers\nYou cannot have a debate about the unemployment or the GDP or anything else because the last president was judged by the same exact standards all of this basically wraps up into one thing\nWhat is it that the other side wants to do and is that a threat to this existing ... you know economy right now in other words a you know I'm really I'm I Am doing a little bit better you know my jobs doing better\nOr making a little more whatever it might be I'm I'm checking home a little more taxes are lower\nNot only that but I remember you know we said this and I don't know if anybody's ever used the exact same words that we used and I think we used to probably\nUh I think this was early in the primaries and we continue to say it all the way through the election\nAnd we and and the media has completely missed this totally ... but it's not just that the analysis that I was telling you that I read yesterday the Trump is the\nAverage ... an average person the average person looks at them as the average person what does that entail the average person if you cause that to me doesn't describe the the the substance at just that's labeling people I use an average person therefore he likes Trump's because Trump relates to the average person because they believe he's like the average person what does that me\nAnd you and I actually use the L Word back way back in the in in the campaign I Believe that and and I believe this too but I Believe the Trump loves America ... and I believe he loves Americans and he loves Americans first\nUm\nBut he loves Americans and I think the people that support him I think part of the political I dollar tree which is different than Obama's political I dollar tree\nIs it they look at him and they say here's a guy that truly loves America and he loves to me he cares about me yeah he's rude and yeah he screwed but when it gets down to with a law that comes from the anger that we believe that he shares with us that these other people don't love America\nMhm and we love America and how do we love it and now the left in the middle east would get insulted we love America no you don't you don't believe in due process yeah both Cuomo America has never been great right ... ... exactly mhm you you really you really don't you don't really believe in the first amendment you don't really believe in the second amendment\nYou don't know believe in due process you don't believe in a presumption of innocence what do you really love about America you and I had brought this up\nFor over ten years when we've gone through certain issues and said what if you don't care about this and you don't care about the constitution\n'cause what makes us Americans do we live in the same geographical place oh no it's we share an idea and what is that idea the ideas the

radical views\nAs you see maybe a little more right now I don't know how many Democrats rank and file actually hold the views\nOf not believing in due process as the mainstream of the Democrat leadership now done right when I have I've seen to see where it is there a big just right now now\nWe we know that on many of the issues the ... if you if you actually polled Democrats on all the major issues out there as to what they would want\nYou would see as we saw back in and we noted back in a a twenty twelve especially when on the issues the majority of the public agreed with a Romney yeah it'll bomb Ryan yeah on the issues they aren't read with ... and if you take a ton\nOf the issues that rank and file Democrats believe they disagree with\nWhat the people they vote for or does and I think to a much greater extent than any Republican\nVoting for a Republican president directs right yeah yeah because you think about this if you think about the conservative never Trump per se the vast majority of the issues that they disagree with Trump on is his tone yes\nWhich is it similar to what they are a lot of the left criticizes him for his words and it's tough\nAnd it's not so much the job that he's done\nYou know they may pick apart you know whatever it is the terror of babies [laughter] by the way we're the original ... babies um but but but they may become part these things or this or that but ultimately if you got down and you were to ask the never Trump or is it conservative never Trump has\nA well okay the corporate tax rate Twenty one percent did you think that was going to happen or do you applaud that do agree with that um the unemployment rate the GDP where we are right now uh do you think we're moving in a\nGood direction in the president's not a good job on a number of items I don't know how you would do it even as a number of trying and I\nI Believe the president should fight more when it comes to the debt he's taking little victories was I'm cutting the federal government that much\nBut it's doing nothing to solve the budget problem whether he ... he throws those he throws that out but the fact is he knows he's not the legislative branch and yes he knows he won what power ... this isn't this isn't the president alone that has you know created this deficit spending\nThese other Republicans in Congress including a significant

well how does it get taxes done Roy Moore last yeah and they realized oh my gosh we got to get things done because we may lose the Senate at some point we've got this slim\nYou know victory here are slim margin now and it they didn't have the Republicans in the Senate didn't get it done until after that lost the president had been working toward that but again this answer tight if they're not going to do anything\nRight I think the president should still work harder and still talk about more which he does not ... you probably and and I I'm thinking the probably the White House says look we can't win this because our own party doesn't care any more about the debt well you\nKnow what's what's really disappointing I guess the downside of the capital of the thing or what have may have motivated a lot of people\nOr whether it's the never Trump or his or or the the moderate Republicans a coup now are standing up and for conservative principles again it could be too little too late not not in the Senate but in the house\nAnd the president and the Republicans if the just imagine that that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate the motivation to get things left
