British navy was\nTerminated the British told him that if they didn't they didn't find a way to contain the ... war\nAnd they were convinced that they were on the air on the road\nRight there with the Germans and it was just about ... they had to find\nA way to sort of a decision then was to star Britain and both sides would start wouldn't lift the famine in Germany a start on rent no no no they were both they both got high command the the governments were making this decision\nTo race to gather to let their population star that's the risk ooh star search to call them first and if I directly and if I'm if I read correctly\nOr by the time the Americans that the Americans declare war April Nineteen Seventeen we don't really get our contingent of soldiers there until Nineteen Eighteen he takes a lot of shutting yes right did the Germans believe they can sink the transport ship\nThat's right they they thought they were their claim was a navy guarantee them not an American troops will make it\nTo you but that's nonsense that's nonsense did end up in Bergen ... recognize that it was nonsense by the by the winter of ... Eighteen it was clear that the Americans were gathering in great numbers\nBut in Nineteen Seventy it made sense to them to the border they were when they converted the boy started to you one part five\nThey those seven votes became political you cruisers very ... rights\nAnd the Americans are door and the Germans had already built some some purpose built you cruisers that old division goal you cruiser division that we went to the ... when the United states\nAnd out there that part of the ocean there was no so anti submarine warfare and done it less you count the convoys while they threw him most of the troops ships we ran didn't run in ... because we thought they were faster\nThat were there were about ... and had the Germans\nDone with what they should have done in World War one yeah they probably would have been addicted to the American\nSubmarine the long range submarines were not capable of chasing down at corruption that it was in ... they have the fat white I couldn't run it bad and they were too slow\nExactly but you see their advantage to see a recommendation and in Nineteen Seventeen when the early seventies Jay river where the Germans started to convert their boats these big\nCargo boats in ice cruisers there was this said look let's let's make these things radio stations and ... and ... they didn't call wolf packs they just call it a tax groups and um will they'll monitor the radio traffic and they'll direct these packs of U boats into the lines\nOf the ... with ... with science fiction and why to all of this was science fiction they were proposing he could weapons or new weapons systems that we're going to solve this and yet they knew\nEventually as we did that the French Army quit fighting after Seventeen I mean they just they just didn't want to launch any more offensive they'd lost too much the British Army was also exhausted and out of people to launch attacks\nUntil the American army arrives and reinforces the front in the Nineteen eighties right so the Germans can ... the Germans created with their submarine warfare the conditions to lose the war\nExactly exactly and that's what so that's been ... been saying for years if you do this you're going to bring the United states ... sleeping giant you're going to bring the United states into the war and they they will overwhelm is\nDwight met them and Dwight met them or tells the the thrilling but at the same time extremely upsetting story of the Baltimore sabotage cell German agents American traders ... during World War one why isn't on upsetting because the famine that

Denver and bite me Whitey site now I'm talent Amazon dot com white is a team and then folks dot com to\nI chose personally I chose Bernie Sanders because I thought he seems to me like you might be a pleasant fellow next year I'm ahead of what's her name of ... see I always say the wrong and what's her name or ... something Cortez yeah Cortez she doesn't even ... and the latest ... who says\nThat they asked her about whether they would support whether she would support the Bernie for the presidential nomination and said oh we'll have to wait how communications directors will wait and see what happens on a lot of loyalty there huh\nAfter he uh you know certainly a is campaigning with her now nothing else\nAnd but I felt Bernie would it be interesting because we both talk about our childhoods in Brooklyn I I'm pretty sure he's from Brooklyn and our attendance I think he went to Brooklyn College I did I'm not sure he did\nA but only difference between us I graduated from left as him and he never did he kept up with them you're supposed to grow up and figure out you know that hey that's that's craziness\nLast night I jumped off from the story about the caravan of illegals where we're going to talk about that tonight 'cause that's becoming a this morning much more of a problem with a with a guest on about that ah you know they're coming from Honduras to talk about\nUm ... you know that as they travel through the different countries there's some news tonight that Mexico's made some arrangements with the United states to if they don't have a passport or whatever they're going to stop them or send them back or something ah and of course President Trump has threatened to close the border\nUh or at least take away money from these countries which I think actually the caller suggests that there's nothing like being strong as president of the unlike a that when we had beforehand or when people realize you you say things and you're going to back up and you meet people act they move\nIn essence I don't buy the way more than one caller was suspicious you guys were good\nOf who was paying for this journey right they need a place to sleep they need a place to eat and they need food they you know how are they are they walk in the whole business of maybe they are I Know I think I saw them on trucks and stuff um bought the\nThat was that was interesting you guys you know we're asking the right questions I suggested maybe was George Soros paying for all this one way or another and sure enough\nPeople are talking about that today so I may have been right about that\nBut I certainly become more cynical about what is going on and this one seems clear to me I think they're timing it so that they are\nSeveral at our border it's time to her President Trump and Republicans in the upcoming elections whoever's paying for it\nUh doesn't matter I think that's what they're up to\nSo I think they don't ask me of course to consult with them but I think the Democrats are once again misreading things as they didn't ... with the judge Kevin to\nWhere they clearly overplay their hand and showed you know the even the independent voters remember most people don't follow the news like the those who are listening to talk to you guys are active involved and you know what's going on most average people don't even know what's going on [noise]\nUh but they showed their mission to ruin a judge Kavanaugh's reputation in his life and I think most people could see that whether or not\nHer evidence she had to wear a sweater her testimony was credible or not even\nIf they felt sorry for her I think they thought the Democrats were going overboard and I think that's going to hurt them and the election so I think most Americans saw through their surfers and now\nThey want the American people will see crying children right\nSo is the children and distraught mothers at the border with a willing press reporting how heartless Republicans are to allow such suffering to take place they just you ever notice it's always the children's ... rather because people's fears feel sorry for children it doesn't matter if they're manipulated by the way\nYou know if it's if someone's kid a tan or eight or whatever that when they spouse certain points of view you know they've been indoctrinated by the parents\nEven if they're precocious as some of the things that come out with you know the parents have just using their own kids by the way not unlike the Democrats use you know a Ford there\nAnd they're all the usual spin I owe the slime drives me crazy that this is not who we are as people are not who we are as Americans as if we're not allowed to defend our sovereignty and our values that we are in effect basically what they're saying we're stupid people\nThat would let all kinds of people come through our border on their word alone now I Want asylum whatever you don't know if they're terrorists or you don't know if they have contagious diseases which is happening more and more\nPeople have not been vetted in any way that that we are not those kind of people either that can't we be smart enough to\nHave some you know the rules and procedures about how people come into this country so when they say it just drives me crazy oh this is not who we are as people Hillary set everybody said it you know it just seems like that on the left there we're we're not we're so compassionate we take everybody you know you guys just full of it\nYou want them here for the votes and you didn't care about basically for whatever her name is because of the final analysis you leak that when she didn't want the stuffed leek\nAnd Dianne Feinstein the rest of your time this so do maximum damage you didn't really care about her\nBy is a bigger topic for tonight just like I Believe the Democrats don't really care about minorities that just using them they know they take their votes for granted and whether they help them or not that it's is it relevant they are using them for them to get power [noise]\nSo I Want you to comment to continue to comment on any of those stories that I reviewed tonight at eight six six Ninety red eye and and let me know what you're thinking and I go with where you want to go there is a hot topic uh after our topic I'll go to that pretty quickly\nEight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine is is the same number a digitally\nBut colors also mentioned the reaction of some of their friends this kind of always comes out a little bit some of their friends and family members to or if their political beliefs are on the conservative\nOr you know you call them on the right I guess\nAnd a friend of mine Scott who used to live in California now lives in Colorado I'll leave that his last name because I didn't get permission to use his last name\nSo this is what he posted on Facebook yesterday he was the friend did just because of his political beliefs\nAnd he thought I thought he wrote a thoughtful commentary which I Am going to just read from is pretty quick a and from what I remember by the way he's a moderate Republican not even a conservative like me here's this quote we continue to learn life set lessons in many ways today I had a friend who I've known since high school an friend me\nShe was always ... a nice person in fact I helped her out in school and gave her job to provide her additional Lincoln nothing has changed as far as who I Am but today she in front of me not because I was nasty to her or because I was mean to anyone she knew about the cause I posted a political post\nThat she disagreed with\nKeep in mind that she posts political commentary that I disagree with and some I find very offensive\nShe asked me to never let the other stuff\nAnd yet she comments on mine\nBut sadly there's a way of our politics we can do people for years even all of our lives yet they have no tolerance for a different political view than their own\nIt's so angers them that you have a different opinion that then there's that they will not talk to you anymore personally I find that beyond said today I've only unfriendly to one person mainly because they're noxious and intellectually dishonest\nAs most no I guess people know and I will debate anyone on any issue and I changed my mind and issues and vote had others change their mind yeah I appreciate that too when colors have done that in the past\nAnd you'll see me say sometimes you know that's a good point I didn't consider that but today it just seems that we're starting to forget that the whole of a person is not just measured by their political views and if the ... if you've had a lifetime of friendship that it should be more important than a different view on one area\nHe should have said in one area of your life\nI think I'm more saddened by the fact that my experience today is more symptomatic of what our society's becoming than about losing a Facebook friends if we can find a way to be more civil to each other and then we're in for a bumpy road ahead I actually think he's under doing it\nUh and by the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago so I used to do in a show in Los Angeles with two Democrats two Republicans discussing the issues in the news whatever came up that we can the audience and the guess loved it some of the gifts I they greet each other and a future show and I said how do you know ... oh we became good friends because of your show mark\nUp and I I was really that touched me a despite their differing views they become friends socially and otherwise and kept in touch\nI'd love to reprise that show at some point if I was given the opportunity because of the audience loved that I loved it it it was just a lot of fun we didn't have very professional way you know\nBut one of the guests moved to Tennessee and posted on Facebook was one of the other gets the more you see what he did he posted in on Facebook after Trump won that he was the ... anyone who is evil enough to vote for President Trump your host included obviously well he wouldn't friendly you know you did\nIn all of his appearances on my show he was one of the milder very friendly and plus and guess on the other side any chair he shares vice with me when I was dumb enough to run for office in California which\nYou can imagine for Republicans waste the time so I was pretty surprised when he poses letter saying goodbye to all of us now evil human beings I'm not sure you said the word evil but that's what he was implying\nForget his past interactions with me or others he thought were his friends they thought he was there for his friends so I Want to know from you what has been your experience when people find out your views if you're a Republican or a

Democrats\n[noise] yeah I'm not saying that Republicans going to vote vote Republican regardless of who's doing the president if you had a Democrat or Republican is going to vote Republican and Democrat\nGoing to know just let me let me say what I think ah clarified for you\nThe base you're right about that both sides have a base that would never in a million years Republican vote for Democrats nor Democrats voted for Republican but I Know I have\nA couple of times voted for the Democratic or Republican so bad as an example I couldn't stand Arnold Schwarzenegger so I didn't vote for him I figured out who he was what a phony he was and he was in it for himself\nSo there have been times that I have not voted for the Republican candidate but you're right in general that's what you choose your party 'cause you agree with them for the most part I don't blame people for that what I Do blame is for the incredible hatred for Donald Trump and the fact of tonight's topic which is you disown someone because you disagree with their politics\nThat doesn't make sense to me that's over the type\nThat you're right because like I said it Donald Trump is not a bad job you look at the Korea issue North Korea if the first time in history to the my act the act we got him to ... and ... the the one that rate is doing a really good job that go\nWith the rebate people don't like the way you speak if he was more that you probably would be more ... way but\nLike I think he is but I think he is becoming more presidential I get a question for you are you going to vote for next time\n[laughter] I don't know I've been so frustrated with politics like I said I didn't vote for him the first time I was I was never going to vote for Hillary but I I I\nI like what he's doing and let me tell you that I worked for the government so you know a real happy at what he's doing you know I'm a government or ... or ...\nYou're a good man Anthony I appreciate you and uh hang in there and I I just got to say if you wait a little longer and you say he's on good stuff and you ought to vote for him in a twenty twenty thanks for the call appreciate it very much and let's go to um yeah Teresa in fair play Missouri\nYour honor with mark\nIt and get a martyr good morning and I wanted to say that\nAnd I was raised aircraft I mean my whole family with Democrat lot of them have family still a Democrat and most of my my dad changed parties and during the Reagan Era and kind of took all those kids with me now because he had he had Lehman Brothers and sisters [noise]\nAnd and\nRecently Leanne me and my cousin has gotten kinds of ... in Facebook and\nOne in this coup lately everything was in Haiti everything was negative that Trump or you know everything they put up there and and it and I would make snide remarks of mad you know on his and [noise] and then my other cousin came out and speak spoke with one night\nMy\nOne cousin came out and then apologized to me he goes family more important than politics [noise] and I thought that was really really big I mean I think so much more lean him coming out and we talk\nOn you know on messenger for quite a long time now my other cousin I I had to\nLeave him because everything he had was this negative negative negative now everything he put it on faith a click political [noise] that um\nI my question is is you know I Can't\nVote for something that I Am morally you know against the now whether it's ... Martian or you know all these people coming up here it's not the nominee against immigration that they need the legal and I just can't\nI think our water the red great comes from the news because they are so negative I mean you agree with me 'cause I I think it changes a lot of people's mind\nYou're absolutely right you make a great point thinking Theresa ... the media has changed the name of the game it used to be that there there was a lot of honest journalism and you know you didn't even know where a lot of them stood now they've become advocates\nFor their point of view and that's maybe they learn than journalism school but that's not what they're supposed to do that just spoke to present the news and what's going on and we get to make our own decision\nBut that's totally changed and they influenced people especially young people who don't listen to that much and I'm not big on the young people that is true of older people too and I think of it you know watch the nightly news or whatever they watch and they get a little glimpse of it and half the time they don't even know you know what's really happening\nSo I agree the media has a big play in this and it's a pretty discouraging to see what influence they do have\nAnd you know if you go out and interview people you is very discouraging to see how little Leno right they can name the vice president\nThey have no idea about the three branches of government and of course the bigger point they have no idea what makes this country so special well we have a full board but I'll give you the number anyway eight six six Ninety read I have six six or seven thirty three thirty nine want to know what's happened with your family what's happening with your friends\nAre we here it's been obvious tonight they're gonna be upset with you if you are Republican let alone oh my God if you voted for Donald Trump I mean don't you think I'm Marcus Miller on ... radio [noise]\nOver ... red on red or [noise] be a part of the Congress\nHas arrived and it's time to fall into the health\nAnd body of your life with and Jay diet and Jay diet uses your DNA testing blood work hair saliva personalize formulas to build\nEach program for each patient patients typically lose twenty to fifty thousand only forty days for their contractually obligated to give you money back and Jay diets all natural locations in New Jersey Manhattan Long Island queens and Brooklyn and even now with a new office in white plains New York doctor's supervision provided every seven away call today a five five five and\nJay diet for and Jay diet dot com [noise]\nHey you hit that commercial I probably heard it over a hundred times before I finally picked up the phone call they five five five and Jay diet I'm Tim forty two years old and I've been heavy for most of my adult life\nLike really heavy after a million diet and exercise programs I just gave up figured I'm a big guy and that's that would have to call ... diet had my consultation with Dr ... and now after forty days I'm Down forty two pounds may make the call it changed my life and I'm sure they will change yours\nIf you will any money to the IRS you need to call star star one two three four star star one two three four Uncle Sam has the power to make your life miserable you could stop the IRS collections process right now by calling stars STAR One two three four when you call the tax defense\nCenter you'll get free information on how you can reduce your back taxes including penalties and interest stars STAR One two three four star star one two three four could save you thousands on your back taxes you could also be helped if you have on\nFiled returns attack saline wage garnishment bank levy or if you've entered into a payment plan and can't make the payments it's your hard earned money stop bungled Sam right now make the\nCall that could help you and the worry today stars STAR One two three four that star star one two three four star star one two three four by calling star star one two three four you agree to receive\nA semester MS text messaging standard raped me of life you also have anybody to stretch into state federal or corporate do not call registry\nRations ... infrastructure and our government secrets of the United states has master hackers town\nThat fun at our CIA cyber ... all notion of what a deadly fire looks like invite former intelligence agent ... turning the tables are turned our cyberwar hack Eric ... new novel from Denver and bite\nDry today New York city fifty nine degrees and clear rain late tonight but ending by tomorrow in Chicago we got rain showers in the forecast fifty five the high clearing by tomorrow and Los Angeles California the fire whether watch continues for today the high will be eighty seven\nYour national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\nI'm Mark ...
