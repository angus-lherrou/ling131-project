to say smoke can you update us by\nYeah I should point out that the universe in the mirror is now available in April and it's you know has an update include the uh the two thousand nine repair\nAnd I predicted this kind of stuff happening that book a NASA today released an update on their effort to bring up a lot of safe mode of back into full operation the key here is that they have a gyroscope\n... their water backup gyroscope they've lost by transcripts of the last seven years since last repair mission that down to four gyroscope\nThey they were down to ... they lost one\nAnd so the backup gyroscope is going to bring be brought up in a line if you have three gyroscope she got three dimension no control and you can point the telescope very precisely will they brought up the back back up and it didn't function properly so that leaves them only to working a charter school they're trying to figure out what's wrong with that one bad gyroscope\nThough the backup gyroscope but here's the bottom line they still don't have an answer to that\nBut if they cannot get that job if they can get it fixed just a a Hubble is now they've said they got to go back to full operations as before but if they can't get that fixed they're going to drop down to one gyroscope load which means they will be able to do science\nBut they will not be able to take the same kind of shopping for

this week they released images showing where it traveled on the surface I got that posted on behind the black sea can see where traveled took a lot of close up images\nAnd the bottom line is it would have found is that this surface is crazy than expected there was absolutely no flat spot on the surface everything is apples\nAnd rocks and that might\nTell us why this week\nThe higher boosted team announced that they are to blame the landing up higher boosted to until January they were going to do it later this month that delaying until later January and they said the reason is because the surface of the of our youth group is so Boulder strewn that they don't have any flat spots anyway and they don't want to take a risk\nAnd so what they're going to do is spend more time doing observations from a audit\nAnd uh to do a much closer to study the surface to try to figure out if they can get down to a spot that will have less risks that that's what we stand right now with Bush

solar cycle that just ended\nAnd that is unusual they usually if that week they are\nUm that long and this one was weak and short\nAnd uh once again a less so a sunspot activity usually is associated with colder climates on the earth\nAnd lo and behold we had colder climates the last decade or so or the so called ... and they called the warming is pronounced and real and there's no question to

products that eleven welcome back to the show\nOh it's great to be here with you today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover today packed today we're talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about her new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of Korea teen I Know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea teen it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue\nAs we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nAn amazing story you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single cylinder body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important help maintain\nStrength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had ... stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea teen in our muscles you know the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nHe goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it limbic athletes have been using Korea teen for years to enhance their strength and performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier\nSports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used it body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in space stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan style diet this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nHigh so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teams going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing that folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp stay vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus or like you and me pat in fact let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals okay\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men\nStudy done it several American universities\nOr group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey can we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team they put on four pounds\nOf lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that\nIt shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent they increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationary bike pack this happened in one week when I think that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAll right but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well will it actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies get stronger to\nArabs or ... let's go straight to another study loved the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performances\nOlder women published in the European Journal of applied physiology\nThirty women age fifty to Seventy one the course they could either Korea the inter placebo that's the way they do these things\nAgain a one week study the women on Korea to increase their bench press by almost four pounds they increase their leg press by over ... pounds and they had better balance and agility so fifty to Seventy one year old women\nNot only getting stronger not only getting more powerful\nGetting faster with improved balance patch study after study shows that older books that use Korea Team get amazing results they get great results if they exercise they get great results even if they\nDon't exercise they can lift more weight they get fair after they get stronger they get more powerful their muscles don't fatigue as fast and get this this is very important especially for the ladies ... you know that when women do resistance training their bones get stronger as well right\nNow get this when you resistance training with Korea Team\nYour bones tend to get stronger even faster so they're all around when when every strong is going to help the seniors to feel better feel stronger more energized more powerful faster and it helps protect your phone\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean ... when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right now you're a\nPerson that never heard about this and you're listening to us you would think this sounds too good to be true but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ... strong formula today plus the bonus bottle will be twelve energy melts\nJust by calling us if one eight hundred by eight zero eleven Seventy five you just pay for shipping that's one eight hundred five eight zero eleven Seventy five will give that number out again later in the ... eleven now listeners can only get ever strong this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right\nOh absolutely I Know it combines decree a teen with the vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit ... be more on him for those who don't know talked about how these work so well together there was a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune ...\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure cruelty and that's it purists find this pre teen from Europe if you brought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D and it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month\nBut you're not going to spend that today and that was purely products and your name or going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today\nIt for your job is to be one of the first thousand callers\nAnd take it seriously this stuff flies out the door and the big radio stations be one of the first thousand calls you could you be twelve and is your milk and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you know we want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it\nTry it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take and it gives people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottled today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets her powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at days are days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing is becoming very big these days so if you're doing something like that to be very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDump it right into your juice dump it into your protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallow it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powdered they tested golfers and you're already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFourteen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers call this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula\nThe product we're talking about right now the ever strong powder so double blind placebo controlled studies thirty golfers took the restaurant powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong powder for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further ... not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey get older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job where you can read five hundred dollars on a driver up five yards right this is for teen\nYards ... people shouldn't just how how about this or you're on about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and there's more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board but again\nThese golfers one month on this ever strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine pat you get your bottle of ... you don't tell your buddies take it for a month and you go out and you're banging the both fourteen yards past them they don't know what hit him\nWhile I we just had a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nKnow what pat my one concern with this show is that literally it sounds too good to be true right I like when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up to not possible right you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen\nI almost couldn't believe it I said to myself\nIf it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's just phenomenal and it's as simple as this you're going to get on the strong\nYou're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror\nAnd see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up these studies with a hamster in a lab somewhere we're talking human studies I called stuffed muscle fertilizer it's that great and of course we didn't just a a decree a pure Korea Team we've discussed that we are the fruit XP remember that joined health\nOf the coffee Barry extract that nominal antioxidant that's more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful in the opposite of protection\nI added the vitamin D because it's so important across the board\nRate for bone health but also for seniors vitamin D so important for muscles especially as we get older for strength and coordination so this is a very comprehensive formula again this would easily cost you eighty

I have in the cage ... total kidney failure for eight years I've been on dialysis which is a record\nRelieved that I mean since I've been on balance of nature it's been very easy I mean you you're you're labs are ... are all messed up your electrolytes\n... potassium and phosphorous builds up and you could have a heart attack or stroke all the time\nAnytime and ... because I don't produce any year in a adult because making it you're done so you're always toxic because dialysis only removes two percent of what your kidney would you would daily\nYou know put out and ... products so I'm always toxic and it's been so sick I've been just and then come home and go to bed but now I come home and do whatever I Need to do so it's truly helped me with energy and the my mind in with a peace of mind and knowing that I just feel like I'm human again\nI have more energy I can get up and get going\nBack and do things that can do I can walk in the store instead of ... I can uh clean I can do things I haven't done for eight years since I had the failure and had been on dialysis\nIt's helped me to walk it child needed too heavy laundry to clean my house to feel like I'm not dying and all the time I just gives me a\nHappy I mean it's helped so that I'm not depression sad and worried all the time and mainly it has given like a I'm a new boost in life I Am\nMuch healthier the doctors say on health care they said look better and you can't believe you know the this is really good I tell my dog ... I've got to investigate that\nHe's just so I'm telling everybody that I talked to about it's the first thing I says about the nature you got to get on it it will shave yet\nI just can't [noise]\nTen Dr Howard and now he's brilliant\nWelcome back to our show we just heard our top success stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com\nOr by calling in an eight hundred two\nFour six eight seven five one eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one next to listen to an interview that I had was Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or a balance of nature this is a conversation you don't want to miss as we discuss the variety\nMore depressed or more depressed and more fearful ten yeah that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when\nWhen we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no at bound to nature we use education ... means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the health Chad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing as a health costs when you're working with people and sometimes they decided they helped ... ad that people can't face you know they're just\nThey've been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I Can't do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so I ... the health conscious that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve then they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them\nSo you have a health coach that takes a customer or through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or\nHow much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach sales when they start taking balance of nature well the main role of a health coach is because we are results face company is to make sure that our customers are getting results\nOr you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true with gender research we know that that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human ... if you'd just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you feel it or not the result is their ... and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man\nAnd I'm an in relation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of health and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's health is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it because we're based upon a chemical aspect of help that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything is based upon\nThe raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there's ... at the the mental spiritual emotional side of the ... all one that's not three different things\nThat's one side of your health dry out and so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit\nAnd for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah as I was talking with him is a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and finally I looked at him I mean you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear because fear unsafe cannot coexist you can't have\nThem in the same space one chases the other out and so with tears he finally said you're right I don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life\nAnd he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had a several several goals but until we found that one he wasn't a change person\nHe will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard answers and Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nThat really does work I've had to upgrade the steps and not not getting the little allergy calls and stuff in the spring and in the hall and I attribute it to that because I'm like shut down\nOr ice actually stop the my vitamins that I Would say you know taking a regiment of vitamins and I basically stopped all of them and then went on to this and this things that we've got a fish ultimately for me\nThat made me feel better I mean you didn't know at my age if I can keep up with on the

C.\nSeventy seven have got to do it this way to get knowledge Venus and hands free\nEverybody ... power that it now and it's getting\nHis way to us a hundred and sixty pounds is five foot eight and I examined him and he had a large swollen profit but there's a stage T. one see there was a stage teeth to prostate cancer Gleason six PSA seven an overall are successful in that category it's about Ninety five\nPercent but what happened to this man while this man had archery many laid on the table at pinpoint treatment and non invasive treatment no hospitals low and you know cutting and bleeding well we treated him and his PSA also\nIs zero zero zero zero zero zero\nThat's how he likes it he likes his PSA to be zero and we're talking about uh sixty six year old man from ... to be a woman from Jamaica she's marriage came with her son and she had a colon cancer three years ago she lost weight should call and ask ... calling us could be showed the cancers shed surgery in a neighboring state [noise]\nAnd then she had chemotherapy for a couple of months but she stopped chemotherapy because she was allergic\nShe wasn't offered any other treatment and now it's come to us with back pain and we found cancer up and down the spine up and down the spine so she has stage for cancer she had surgery [noise] it didn't work she had a recent PET scan\nIt showed lymph nodes in the abdomen masses along the threats ... fine\nAnd we offered to treat her to eliminate the pain and the\nCancer that's a beautiful thing about radio surgery is of as a\nHigh success rate in treating cancer high success rate in eliminating the pain and this is what we do so many patients come to us with pain so many came all doctors have patience with pain and they just keep on giving chemo frequently are giving narcotics and came up\nAnd yet not send the patient here when we know that our treatment can focus on the cancer that's causing the pain and by doing that we can help get rid of the cancer and the pain simultaneously and this is the work that we do every day\nAnd we'll speak about sixty six year old black woman and I say that because of the black community\nThe death rate from ... from breast cancer is twice it's twice as high this woman's a corrections officer she's single she has a son she has left breast cancer [noise] she was diagnosed a year ago\nShe was sad that it three years ago showed an abnormal mammogram but nothing was done about that she was an seen by a throat doctor because of lymph nodes and the next year the biopsy which is suspicious for cancer\nAnd she went to another facility another biopsy and started chemotherapy became old doesn't work the breast cancer kept on growing\nShed marked progression of the cancer in multiple sites the chemo did work I mean do chemo for breast cancer only works temporarily the cancer kept growing in the bone lymph node elsewhere ushers can play of left hip pain shed fatigue\nShe came to me weighing a hundred and thirty five pounds two years ago she was a hundred and sixty pounds she lost twenty\nFive pounds she's five foot three to shed terrible pain I examined her on the left side shut multiple lymph nodes and the Mac and the Supreme Court Vicki what that's the area super as a Latin word means above above the cloud call and then the lymph nodes of the neck\nThere was a four ... almost two inches under the armpit on the left side and she had a seven centimeter mass in the breast in the upper portion of the left for us towards the armpit the right side was perfectly fine so she had stage for cancer\nShed chemo it just doesn't work that mammograms years ago they didn't tell her about it and now I can\nTell that you came to me eight weeks ago\nAnd she came for follow up and the cancer pain is gone [noise] so that's what happens with most patients who come to us they're quick relief of the pain and suffering and often very quick relief of the cancer itself\nThat usually goes hand in hand with the cancer so lots of good news for this woman in a difficult situation when chemo doesn't work the mammogram didn't seem to help her she came to us was treated and there's now pain free doing well pleased with their progress\nFor the first time pleased with her progress and this is the work we do exactly the work we do for the man who came from Egypt he's sixty four years old\nHe has four children at a throat cancer and he now has a prostate cancer\nPS safe for Gleason six had a CAT scan that was negative\nAnd he came I examined him he had the largest prostate tea once\nSee so he had a Gleason six PSA for tea wants the prostate cancer and we discussed all the options and just see once our treatment because we have a nine to five percent success rate\nAt our success rate is very high and with us most likely his quality of life and you know what that means would be very very very favorable\nWhen I'm such a leader among cancer doctor workers searching for Broadway Broadway at thirtieth street

he was the first in New York for ... native brain radio surgery and he's the first in America\nAnd in the western hemisphere puts body radio surgery you can also call Dr Lederman at two and two choices for a free informative booklet and DVD hey Dr Lederman or back\nIf Dr Lederman with Kurdish we were talking about prostate cancer and he's the man who's lived the life\nAnd not only live the life but didn't take my own advice when I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion from Dr Gilead him in because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear fried and hysteria set in they said oh you got to get that planned out the control so much of what a man does in his life robotic surgery as your answer\nAnd I've been kicking myself in a took his ever since maybe the\nDome his decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow you've been shot up with hollow show bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat five times with ... someone was trying to kill ya oh yeah and they almost succeeded but when you had that robotic surgery\nYou said oh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of depends with my\nBody liquids and I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trousers I feel like a little infant who can't leave the crib and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt like wow what an idiot I was not to go to you Dr Gilead\nI'm In and get that second opinion now you were shot up ... show bullets but the complications what was worse actually the removal of that prostate gland that control so much of what a man doesn't is like from simply going to the bathroom\nAnd urinating it was at times impossible to stop and other times it was impossible your date and then\nTo try to have the urge to emerge forget about it it was Mike I might as well as many unit was input tent\nA C a one to five which is used for a lot of garlic logic cancers and she was found to have the cancer growing right back in the pelvis and there's growing back right back in the pelvic side wall and growing up into the lymph nodes retro prior to know liberals one big mess like a big mess a bread from the public sidewalk\nUp into the retro parents you know notes\nAnd it was ... it was positive trip back to the same hospital were shut all that other standard treatment of chemo and radiation and surgery and then she had more chemo\nAnd the cancer kept on growing and then they kept on giving or more of the same chemo even though it wasn't working and they started a new cases and our third cable shut chemo the original time\nAnd then when the cancer came back and then the cancer kept on growing that came up at work and now another came up and the pain is getting worse and worse than we staged her up she came here\nBecause again she was very disappointed with the big hospital super\nSuper ... for the cave or chemo and radiation and surgery ... everything was asked tougher but the cancer came back and she was left in pain and suffering and then kept on getting came on that wasn't working\nAnd so we saw her I saw her and explain to her and her husband what this means and the fact that came out even if chemo works for a dummy throat cancer and it doesn't work that much even if it works is only work temporarily\n\nCannot have surgery because as up against the public side wall there's no way and she saw surgeons there's no way that certainly can removing so they're giving came out just to give came up with the chemo was not working so what good is that it's great for the cable company it's good for the chemo doctor it's great for the chemo hospital but we're here for the patient\nAnd became a doctor and the Kamal surgeon that came up company and they never told her about all the options and never told her hey man you can go see Dr Lederman and most likely he can help you most likely a country\nThat big massive cancer and the public sidewalk going into lymph nodes this is the work that we do every day or a pioneering work the original work\nThe original radio surgery why seeing and imitation you don't have to send him to imitation you can see the real doctor who first in America with body radio surgery this is what we do and this is what we did we\nAnd the cats are came right back the melanoma came right back where it was growing\nAnd she has also a mess in the growing so the cancers traveled from the leg to the growing so it's about a static melanoma\nHow do I know that well we arranged for a biopsy put a tiny little needle and and that's something she wanted to know she wanted to know what was in the groin shit an ultrasound biopsy and his cancer to travel to the growing\nShe has refused more surgery she already had multiple surgeries on her leg up just doesn't work that cancer kept growing back and back and back so we treated both the growing and the leg with focused radiation she declined\nAnd the other kind of treatment only hours and I saw her this week I saw her after treatment we've treated or the past and both sides are in remission and she's doing very well I Want to talk about a man who came to us with prostate cancer at a PSA five point seven squeeze six\nHe came with cancer is biopsy positive and we saw him actually saw him ... years ago and now his PSA is zero with good quality of life good function\nHappy came to us happy avoided surgery happy he had no surgery no robotic surgery only our treatment is cancer free there is no spread of the cancers ... say is zero\nUnless you can get a sixty eight year old woman married she came she has a positive family histories or\nMaternal grandmother had breast cancer her mother had breast cancer maternal anti had breast cancer sister had breast cancer\nAnd well a year ago she felt a lump in the breast and the left for us the upper inner part of the breast that was almost to the answer about two and a half centimeters she never had a mammogram can you believe that sixty eight years old almost all the women in her family had breast cancer and she never got a mammogram\nSo finally with his mask the brass you saw a doctor at a mammogram as a biopsy\nAnd they removed the lump and to lymph nodes she had a PET scan and the ... and told her we got it all out and the Shia then analyzed or reason to get chemotherapy and she'd declined all treatment\nWell we saw her I saw her and she came for a second opinion should never seen the radiation Dr ... came to the doctor wanted to give her came up\nBut you saw that the benefit of chemo was small\nAnd then she went home and she said nothing about it even though the cancer was left behind when the doctor the surgeon did lumpectomy that's removing the lump of cancer he laughed positive marches margins means there was cancer left where the surgeon cut\nSo where the surgeon cut their was cancer left on the other side of his life was left to their body\nAnd that's how she came to me she had positive margins poster margins were positive superior margins are positive inter margins were positive should live for vascular involvement\nThat she came to me she came to me for this evaluation for this advanced cancer that was left with positive margins they left cancer behind while she also had to lymph nodes involved\nSo she had stage three cancer I met with her we reach stage or we found lucky for her no cancer I asked her if she wanted to remove war tissue in Nebraska said no I asked her if she wanted chemo she said no I\nSaid you know the best treatment for you you should have some treatment because there's cancer in your body and she chose to have our treatment we treated our last year\nAnd examine tour and I saw her got new scans and she is in remission no evidence of cancer any where in her body even though she had an advanced cancers stage three cancer\nLeft with cancer in her body after the surgeon did is surgery\nSo there's lots of reasons to come for us fresh second opinion many many people do come for a second opinion why well like for her to try to save her life\nAnd because of saving lives so we're talking about uh sixty seven year old man\nYou came with his sister he sat club for these suffered from club feet are terrible deformed feed his PSA was four and a Gleason seven and he went to one of the most famous surgeon surround as soon as that I can take care of your ... robotic surgery at the fish that bleeding\nAny required multiple units of blood after surgery for prostate cancer at six units of blood transfused while six units of blood\nAfter robotic surgery by one of the most famous doctors are the most famous hospitals he's been leaking urine ever since it's been four years he never had erections after the surgery he required those six units of transfusions\nAnd then there's PSA started rising and the surgeon should have known that rising PSA means the cancers coming back\nAnd the patient has one chance to be cancer free and that's with\nFocused radiation like us the surgeon should have sent him for focused radiation but he did it he gave him some hormone pills for a few months to PSA went down temporarily that doesn't care anybody that's a waste of time and then they hate it\nHe could have been should have sent the man for focused radiation and did it for years later is still did and\nAnd now the patient and family came here because why because I treated the aunt or the terrible breast cancer and the answer is doing well in ... the patient came and society if you have prostate cancer give us a

adequate supply of co Q. ten\nYou're living in what we call an energy deficient stay your heart needs co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system\nIt supplies energy to your lungs to your liver so needless to say we all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential I mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts we're co Q. ten comes from but\nIt's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I understood you told Tierney that'd be quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two agrees co Q. ten and the research will know why he's proud of this cutting edge combination purity caused their co Q. super boost formula what can actually do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I like that so I adopted the term\nIt's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which spectacular\nBut when you combine them indeed this spectacular ... if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage the cardiovascular benefits\nBenefits to your brain function and cognitive performance it even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function is great for your skin it's great for energy and enduring and a robot capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on beat a boat and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nBut it's interesting we're talking with Dr Alan ... know that you tell me more about the consequences of being co Q. ten decision\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions will be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for the you know I hear I'm running out of gas\nI've got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is that Cain nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a pencil and paper in a unity of you're listening we're going to give out a phone number here in just a few minutes purity products is a tremendous offer on their new hope cute with was very twelve formula\nAnd I'm going to give out that information to a few minutes we'll get a pencil or pen ready right now let's continue our discussion with Dr Alan ... no ... you used an recommended cook you tend to patients your patients for decades you practice but no story gets better\nWe see an abundance of research merging onto a spiritual Harvard research and was virtual for them into the jurors healthy aging so you don't need to combine there was a miracle blended with the co Q. ten you hope you do you want them to give away a full\nSize bottles for free and they finally agreed to that but how would you distill the benefits of you had to list maybe the top three or four reasons to take this formula what would they be\nWhoa you know I don't know if I could do three of four mocked but how about ten or twelve\nReasons that wants to know\nNumber one without doubt the energy the indoor ends the stamina I mean just stopping there my gosh I Love that you know I mean who wouldn't love energy endurance and stamina\nBut there's more physical performance cardiovascular protection cardiovascular benefits but as we go down the list I'm going to talk about immune support I'm going to talk about increasing anti oxygen levels in your body\nHow would protect cell membranes and end some addict function\nAnd there was just an amazing article on co Q. ten ability to decrease the rough innocent fine wrinkles in your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you three I gave you a little bit more than that small\nRight even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very tall blimp purely products how many glasses to read one is equivalent to how many would I have to drink a day to get the same boat as it\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day and that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet yeah that's what you see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you could well I don't know but I but you'd have to drink to the glasses of red wine a day\nYeah to me about how many capsules I've got to take when they do take multi vitamins I take a short\nWhile you just need to take too soft gels a day and that's really easy to take and the best time to take them as writing a book for a meal so you can take you know one before breakfast one before lunch or you could take them together but what do you have to do is take too small soft gels right before a meal\nLord no
