I don't remember the goose being in the movie but the died in ... I think so\nIt's it's a wonderful see what simple enough our our our ... our two heroes of a steal it goes from a amassed a dog who wants to kill them or stop them from doing that goes but they got away and they spent all night cooking it\nOr they enjoy it they eat their fell and then they take what's left over to a friend of theirs right someone who's being held in in a garden\nAnd obviously he's he's delighted so but I mean it's so so what's what's wonderful is the description of the smells and [noise]\nYou know they're having you know they just wanted to fool Mayo which is something obviously that they've done very often of late um sadly [noise] you know on the battlefield so you know it has all that sort of\nUm you know head in this take pleasure of a Shia good Mayo and that's I think that's what's great about the book is it going to change register so so rapidly and go from one to the other\nTwo stories or I'm going to mention here John Goldsworthy the gifted and James Hand lays eyes are under a comrade are both are included here struck me Pete as stories that war and the war is not going to and they didn't know that at the time I understand that Goldsworthy\nBelieve that a generation had been wiped out not ... not necessarily just his generation alone because he was an older man when he went to the front I think he\nHe was in his near fifty when he was there at the James handling these I'll set the scene to men are ... working class one Irishman one Englishman are in a shell hole and they're surrounded by a fog they don't know where they are they can't get out and suddenly a very young\nAnd frightened German soldier surrenders to them comrade and they grow angry with him they grow enraged with him and they murder him in the course of the short story\nAnd it's a scene that could be on stage that's how I saw this as if there is a one act play a off Broadway in New York or in these tend to in London but the horror of it is that these men are driven Matt Bai\nThe fact that they're doomed and soon enough they die too and I felt like I was reading the first war the second war the Korean War the Vietnam War it felt timeless how did it to you when you first came on it be\nWell I mean obviously it it has a very sort of underground existence and it's you know it's been out of print it was it occasionally it's reprinted I found it in a very shocking and I want to [noise]\nYou know I'm not surprised that you know it it it hasn't been available um and it's something which\nYou know given you know what we know about you know was today and and soldiers and much raised and everything it's obviously but have there which is unfortunately you know all too familiar\nRight one war is madness and the behavior is not it is ... ... and and and the savagery itself is self despairing because it's aware that it if they have they have ... they have knowledge of that they've gone too far and they don't want to but they they don't want to die either it's awful\nBut there's also I mean this was sort of you know ... like quality of ... by law gets very it's almost surreal um [noise]\nLet ... let me I'm John Goldsworthy the given this is a dream he dreams that he's wondering in a landscape and there are men hang demand ghost hangs skeletons and young women with pale faces or dancing around them\nI this is John Goldsworthy of the foresight Sacco who I'd always I'd always regarded him as a nineteenth century Victoria and class to a class conscious a satirist and this is as ruling a read as I've ever had about war how did it strike you\nAs well I mean you know I agree with you obviously I was a you know it was a I mean you know I just read his writing I mean you know he did write\nQuite a lot from the wall and he was very very involved in you know campaigning against it off to it so you know I was interested to read it and if I\nDid it feel like he'd had a a complete change of heart from the foresight saga there's nothing of this readiness and there\nAre yeah yeah no I agree but also I mean he obviously you know it was [noise] he was\nYou know cold top and the sort of you know hatred and ... you know the time I mean I think [noise] you know it's it's difficult to sort of imagine you know the sort of passionate feelings that people had on either side of a you know at the end of the war\nI Wonder if he had the weight to push back I don't know he died in Nineteen thirty two and then he won the Nobel Prize for literature Nineteen thirty two and he died soon afterwards but he was illiterate giant the time he serves very in in the war but he's an older person so he doesn't serve actively at the\nFront he's a hospital orderly uh certainly worth\nReviewing your opinion of Goldsworthy when you read that piece the book is no man's land fiction from a World War Nineteen fourteen to Nineteen Eighteen there are many other choices to go the good soldiers back the we've not touched on but it's a very famous book and I recommend it will make you laugh\nUh Peter ... is the author I'm John ... this is the John ... is um\nHow many times has it happens you drive away from home turn the corner and then wonder that

officer shot\n[noise]\nCame\nA source live stream surgery on my way of princes a postal facility in Florida and I'm a focus of the pipe bombs mailed to several high profile Democrats across the country and CNN the FBI warning of additional packages after three more bombs were located Thursday corresponded Caitlin tones\nAnd then I went to the wall Street Journal today and used to go go to the the first a sentence investigators were hunting for the terrorists behind ten suspected bombs so now they're back to suspected bombs and you know and and there it is a investigators believe some of the ten suspicious packages\nCentral prominent Democrats and Trump were mailed from Florida so that information is coming out there were mailed from ah from Florida I saw the story that that the uh sources are saying that the whole uh ISIS flag thing that authorities believe was to throw them off and they don't believe it had anything to do with\nA a a a ISIS they below earlier the cable guy or alerted the cable guy right I think it was something just to to throw them off and so we're getting all these different stories and meanwhile all day yesterday my question is\nWhere they live bombs where they ready to go walk right not rise that makes that makes a difference if you're giving out all this other information all this other information\nIs being leaked out there why isn't anyone why ... why isn't any media outlet\nIn really insistent in asking those questions for me it was quite frustrating yesterday and then\nAh was ah was busy a lot of the day uh yesterday and and went to sleep and and woke up late\nWhen I woke up light that's the first thing and I saw like five hours I woke up right\nJust about two hours ago and and this was I woke up I ... you know okay there's got to be the new story out there whether was allied bomb or not and the same thing right like wait a minute this is not for days since the first you know since the first bomb right you know what what is it why can't why can't we get a straight answer when you when you talk about\nAustin Austin a bomb went off Mm So at that point you knew that they were lied bomb here no bomb has gone off so the question would raise just for public safety or public knowledge are the bombs live or not\nAnd still referring to them as you know suspected of you know the devices potentially dangerous devices potentially dangerous devices that are you know that are dangerous mhm well why would they be dangerous does that mean because this will be the question I Would have\nDoes that mean that some contain gunpowder right et cetera and tainted explosive device but there was no detonator in them right so they would be a potentially suspected of you know\nA bomb a with a you know explosive material but the explosive material\nWasn't going to go off and it wasn't a danger to anybody unless you took a match and put it to the gunpowder\nRight right yeah just simply by\nHandling the package itself it wouldn't be necessarily a dangerous in the way that a live bomb would be but but but again ah you know that this is something where you know not not fearing at all or it has been and and there is no nothing wrong with an over abundance of caution\nBy anyone and you know in the scenario\nExcept for the fact that you don't have something for I guess that the public if they were armed\nOr those bombs were ready to go off in transit that's something I think that would be warnings all over from authorities saying that you wherever you might be anyone could potentially encounter one of these devices\nAnd that kind of warning I'm not I'm not hearing so\nAnd I was when you get to the press coverage of calling them bombs yeah which is if you know if the Saudis have not said that they were lied bombs why are we calling them bombs right what is the purpose of of doing that is that\nAccurate reporting if they are not bombs were telling you when the real time the frustration that we have right right and we think it's important to point out the frustration unless there's a reason for you know unless there's eight investigative reason for for doing so except the fact is the people that\nAre the person or people that mail the bomb they know whether they were alive or not and they know the authorities already know right so what what would be the investigative purpose for doing it is beyond\nIs is beyond me and so when I finally saw some frustration because it got to be a little frustrating yesterday when you're trying to figure it out or they lie bumps or not and would they have gone off was it just some explosive material but they wouldn't have gone off right because that that one of the reasons that look the leaks are happening they give out information\nBecause you see it all over the place I saw the the the ... people re tweeting it if you know anything about it\nAnd now here's some of the information some of the information we believe you know it's it's the authorities now or be directed to Florida well leaks come out for recent\nLeaks from investigative agencies come out for a reason so why are all these other things leaking and being told to the public by the media but not the one question that I think most people would want to know with with with the er they live where they live or were they not lied bond right\n\nSo there's where we are so we'll get to that like a more of that coming up here I Chelsea Clinton I'd consider running for office\nMhm I just had to throw that in there yeah it's a friday why not\nAnybody's shock no well you know she has experienced that NBC so [laughter]\n... who was it who wasn't on NBC\nI Can't remember who was the I think it was Brian Williams was it Brian Williams okay she's well traveled that's how he described it ... the\nYou mean she's been on a plane I that was the first daughter of course she's well traveled you know when I Will never forget him that night we I Know we played it on the air yeah but that was just unbelievable yeah it was like gosh in over the fact right the Chelsea Clinton was not working for NBC Brian ...\nIs that when when when uh George Bush's daughter went to work for NBC not so much that there were a couple of articles you know but yeah but but not\nNo gushing no you're not using is what I was referring you did you did cause the news ... as white as it was like OK we'll let her in for now [laughter]\n\nI did a great job it's like Megan Kelly exits stage left but once the entire contract and I looked at\nYou and I during an appreciable meeting and said and does it seem like that NBC went oh wait a minute oh\nWe can make this call is it not ... uh she's already making too much trouble she hasn't made that kind of money she has been pulled in that kind of revenue\nYeah or so this is an opportunity to get rid of her now right well because\nThe ratings I'm I'm guessing word stellar\nUm and in in a good excuse right I yeah we're going to let you go\nSo uh Megan Kelly and who knows will she be back on friday but it looks like she's going to be off the air for at least a while and she lost so here's here's how it went down she made the blackface comment I I don't know when that was Monday or Tuesday and then by Wednesday she had lost her agent\nYes they parted ways and now it's basically it looks like there won't be any any you know coming back to to say goodbye or or sign off or anything else that looks like it's pretty much done\nAnd you wonder if you you just wonder okay that was the old saying that escalated quickly um she came out on\nWednesday and did some kind of apology and they said the audience you know that was their gave her a standing ovation I I'm not sure why an apology it deserves a standing ovation [laughter]\nNot like some kind of great performance that social side of the ... well yeah yeah\nUh but they gave her a standing ovation\nUh and then later on that day and just kind of went down from there and that's when the agency that she was with atomic agency I decided to part ways whether there was some celebrities that we're going to appear on the show that after the comments on black face they weren't going to appear and they decided you know the cancelled so\nAh but the likely comes down to the fact that the ratings weren't great you know is it the worst thing ... anybody has ever said\nAh no\nNo but ... but asked Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr that situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood than what Megan Kelly said I I don't know I ... I don't know I my two my two conspiracy\nTheories and that once you know initially they weren't going to initially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans are with initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it as you said in our personal meaning you figured\nOut they'd suspended until after Halloween yeah ... come back after Halloween but but then they went on wait a minute hold it she's not producing yeah don't wait a minute rating we can get out of his contract we can we wow one of the lawyer said you know this could be caused and if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off or contract\nThat's one side of it the other side of it as my other conspiracy theory is making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks but I Want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough for them to justifiably fire me for cause [laughter]\nWell but I mean and if they try I can still collect\nHere's the difference Megan Kelly saying that on her old show on Fox News would have just been another night of making ...\nYou wouldn't have heard complaints may be I mean on social media you would've yes\nLately it seems like everything we use every day is getting an upgrade when the bad we sleep in to the raise that we use when we wake up that we've neglected one of the more impulsive products and daily routine that old worn out toothbrush I'm Simon ... and I'm a product designer after I learned how important brushing our teeth is overall health\nI was with a dentist to craft that sort of a toothbrush and makes brushing most simple affordable and surprisingly enjoyable quip sensitive suddenly vibrations that a gentle on your gums and built in time at that pulses the guy do around your mouth\nAll packed into a beautifully slim and dies Eli medium design we also to live a fresh brush heads on a dentist recommended schedule just five dollars for three shipping attention to the section on quip the time magazine distinction of one of the best intentions of the upgrade your cat and stop brushing better with quit\nQuit start suggests twenty five dollars and it's guaranteed for life with a refill planned sign up now I'd get quip dot com slash W W O and you'll receive your first refill pack free with a quip electric toothbrush that's your first refill pack free at G.

Fox News so I just wanted to throw that Katherine Harris wrote that with explosive material and that's another thing that we have heard right which is and we mentioned this uh in the last segment\nThat we've heard explosive material and we heard a pipe bomb potentially wrote dangerous potentially explosive devices a but we haven't heard actually lied bombs and so we're we're that's the question that we\nAre asking that would they have it all from what we know\nAll ten of the explosive devices and uh\nWent to the u._s. postal system right which means they were handled so it wasn't us a question that it wasn't touching it or in in any way that it seems would have set off the bomb so were they timers and would they have gone off at any time or were they just\n... did you have some explosive materials but they would have never detonated unless they might have been in a fire right\nUh and so those are the questions to understand the motivation of the person who was sending it that's why you like to get to that point\nBut now four days into this and we still don't know whether they were alive bombs are not authorities have been set and so you ask the question why but\nPostal markings on those packages sent a two prominent Democrats have helped federal investigators were find their focus of your investigation with Florida described as a region of interest to sources told Fox News on Thursday the investigators have not said whether they believe the suspect or suspects are in Florida\nOr fall the packages were mailed from the state\nNew York and Maryland are also in focus Fox learned a government official noted what appeared to be thick dark electricians tape on the pipe bomb sent\nTo former CIA director John Brennan now that's where they used the term pipe bomb there mhm so Fox uses the term pipe bomb was that a pipe bomb right because what's the definition of a bomb bomb is something that will go walk mhm\nYou have a detonator in it which is going to set it off one way or another number be various ways to set it up so was it a pipe bomb or nobody said it was allied pipe bomb at this moment but\nAh the official sudden investigators are hopeful that the black tape capture DNA fibers and fingerprints on the mock ISIS style logo on the one mailing to government official sudden investigators believed\nIt was designed to create confusion not to indicate a connection to a known terrorist group right\nA Miami Dade police announced\nWas working with investigators essay precautionary measure bomb squad and canine units are currently

an upgrade when the bed we sleep in to the raise that we use when we wake up\nBut we've neglected one of the more impulsive products and the daily routine that old worn out toothbrush\nSo I wanted to play that now they're moving off into a little different tangent with the you know as with the midterms coming up here in the middle of the midterms because early voting all over the country ... ah Anderson Cooper and CNN went to Florida to talk to a panel of democratic voters\nAbout Hillary Clinton\nAnd should be a part of the campaign for Gil ... interesting crush what what do ... now do you remember these are all Democrats right so you may not agree with everything that they are saying uh but uh this is this is about Hillary Clinton\nAnd here are just a moment of the the panel\nShelf hand how many of you think overall Hillary Clinton is more of a liability than an asset to the gallon campaign that six out of the southern people's coliseum than\nHillary Clinton is seen as this kind of figure that the right rails against they go to rallies and they say lock her up\nHillary Clinton a rallying point for the right may use that messaging against Hillary Clinton to drive out their vote so I think you could end up seeing huge boost their numbers because you you're you have Hillary Clinton now and the other side being associated yeah deal I'm so close what\nConcerns you about the baggage and scandals that she was associated with 'em and how that might impact the gallon campaign her\nHer post presidential sort of\nYou know demeanor or platform it's been very sort of self indulgent and very much about we're litigating what happened in twenty sixteen in our generation my generation doesn't really respond to you know this ... pointing sixteen and I want to call it whining but like at this point is kind of what it feels like\nI Am concerned and I'm as a young person um he he nailed that we're going forward progressive movements progressive policies and we're looking ahead and I think she represents an old Democratic Party\nDoes anyone think that Hillary Clinton can be helpful to the gallon campaign\nI Do I think she can be financially helpful because she has a history of fabulous fundraising and I think that's where she should say\nAs far as I Know going out and making speeches for ... I don't think so what is it specifically\nThink that how might Hillary Clinton harmed the gallon campaigned think\nBad ... bad credit pivotal trust her no one trusts or ... I I the reality is I I voted for her [noise] um I supported her\nBut she does things that um\nShe tripped over herself and she makes a big mistakes eloquent there you go\nWhat you're saying is she shouldn't run in twenty [laughter]\nAbout Gillum we're clear on that what about twenty twenty you know because here's the thing you know the bubble that the Clintons have always lived in ... many people live in inside the beltway or inside of the ... beltway um\nThe ... they they\nWhen they when they go on the you know a speech tour or you know um if they if they go out and just do some rallies right or it is the case for any of them right or left\nThat those rallies are filled with Friendly's for the most part I mean except for outside on the sidewalk they're filled with friendly in other words the the Clintons have been surrounded by people who have been telling them they're the greatest for a long long time\nWhen you step outside that you step away from it a bit I think Hillary got some of this even when she was running and twenty sixteen remember the reporters\nThat approached her during that campaign season\nAnd started asking questions about bill\nThen they had to pretty much at that point\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz was hiding Hillary [laughter]\nWhere's Hillary was the question and you ... the ... they had to create that while they had to build a wall around Hillary so that they you know she was not approachable so she's been told by a lot of people oh you should run again you should run again you should run again\nBut it really will be their own internal that will tell them you know our millennials on board now that's a very different question as to whether or not she should go on and endorse or she could she helped Gillum or any other candidate right now in the left\nIt is a very different question in terms of what she run or or should she run or would you vote for her and twenty twenty many of those same people that just criticized for maybe a few of them might vote for her\nBut I don't know that for sure because by the time we get to twenty twenty I don't know that you're millennials going to look at that and go yeah she's just not the ... and we need somebody new and fresh or gentleman besides her\nJust you know because I was actually watching the the the video over here so you didn't have access you weren't looking at the video but the woman who said\nThat she should be there just for fundraising and she was older I'm going to get she yeah she was fifty plus I'm guessing she was the same woman or who said we don't trust her right that she's not trustworthy and that's interesting because that somebody who's experience Hillary Clinton\nThe other two were younger there they were probably in their thirties so they probably don't go all the way back to\nAs many of us do Hillary Clinton and Hillary care way back when\nWhen uh you know she was in charge of of putting together a you know some type of single payer healthcare system\nIn America in the early nineties uh so I thought that was really interesting yeah she can raise money but then we don't want to hear from or we don't want her image around we don't want her people don't people don't trust her and what she means as Democrats don't trust her she didn't trust her right and I when I found that just to be\nI I found that to be really really really interesting one other point that I Want to make her because we hear this all the time and we've addressed it before but it came up again the media this week is that Trump's rallies when they talked about Hillary in lock her up that that is it that's it you know instability that that is\nLook you're talking about a political rally and you're also talking about you know why why are they saying lock her up you have to go back to you know what's it about just because she exist\nAnd she opposed you lock her up no that goes back to what that goes back to the whole email scandal where people can identify what the crime was you can look at the law and say this is the crime that she broke and many other people who did this anybody else who did this\nAny normal person who allowed top secrets you know to be so accessible and broke the law and she did would end up in jail that's what that's based on\nNot just based on the on what the left is attempting to portray as just pure instability they don't like her so they want to put her in jail no it's based\nOn her behavior what she did and the fact that Republicans have looked at it and said and and many have looked at it even not just Republicans conservatives without a libertarian since they are actually broke the law right she put the server in her house that's breaking the law she knew\nThat people were going to have you know at that at that level as secretary of state that every foreign government is every\nUh unfriendly and probably friendly foreign government is looking to tap into anything they possibly can to find out what you're doing as secretary of state by you doing that on Friendly's where we were able to get into some of our top secrets you knew it and you did it\nSo you could hide emails from the freedom of Information Act that's a crime yup there's two crimes they're the Espionage Act and trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act\nThat's what it's about now you might say well but she never went to court it doesn't take away the fact that nobody disagrees with what the law is or what she actually did well it's\nDifferent than the chant by Rosie O'Donnell\nOn the white or in front of a White House you know that is based on nothing it's based on false which you know saying that this the current president\nIs an agent of the of of Russia a and that uh and you know again implying that and sang in some cases that he got there or to the White House illegally\nIn the ... in the case of lock her up it's based on a crime but nobody debates was broken by her\n... that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know we can point to it now again it is rhetoric but it's if the people what they're what the point that they're making is she should be in jail she's not above the law\nRight and it's also the fact that the system you know lock her up is also an attack of the system and the FBI and the department of justice at that time for not following the law right\nSo that isn't that isn't a a again\nThe same as in any way justifying\nViolence ... and that's what\nIs being portrayed I just wanted to hit that 'cause we hit that before when when the uh the you know they were being criticized at the rallies were saying that\nAnd when you would read the articles that would say it was horrible they they didn't even understand what the point was that even know why the people were saying right they didn't even address that particular point so if you're just you're lock her up lock her up and you have no clue as the majority of Americans don't understand the constitution if you have no clue what happened\nBut when they try and crossed into the U.S there was a job to do by those border patrol agents and the story and the fact of the cameras have been on them and the media it's been on them for all this time means that it will actually not that it's going to be\nEasier would just simply because of so many people involved but they will know exactly where they're coming in there so I don't know again\nWhere this goes with the caravan between now certainly won't be before election day when they arrive [noise]\n\nDo you\nI don't drink I don't

want to get it we do have a line open in so much to us to talk about but I just wanted to address something\nThat you that you had said during the bottom of the hour and it was you know when we were talking a it was from an earlier conversation and talking about but you know the heated rhetoric of you know calling\nA Trump Hitler that you know I ... and going back because we brought this up months and months and months ago\nI I don't even know it might have been after the school shooting much I'm not really sure but when we talked about\nLook heated rhetoric out there and what it means you know what you're communicating now we've never been one that have drawn the heated rhetoric and blamed the people have heated rhetoric for somebody who's ... kill somebody we didn't blame Bernie Sanders or anybody else no when ... after the ... shooting we didn't we didn't do that but uh we brought up you know just\nHow inflammatory that kind of rhetoric is\nBecause what you're saying as Trump is the same as a guy who committed you know a genocide of six million Jews ... which of course is just the most bizarre statement you could ever make and the only reason you do that is to inflame\nA rage in people that's why you do it mhm because you believe that they'll actually by that and they'll be in theory aided\nOr with it and then you've gotta you've completed the brainwashing by doing that\nYou and I remember that during the Obama administration you brought this up uh uh to me just now when he was being called dictator right we had to get on the air and say guy stopped that right went on the issues is not a dictator he want he want\nHe was voted in by the people the United states conservatives and Republicans my father distasteful but he's not a dictator well and\nThey would talk about the you know they want the the idea of right the idea of a him acting uh you know again using the executive Penn\nInstead of going to Congress every president has that power we don't agree with that method right but every president has that power um and and you know it was about you know cap and trade and things like that that that he was essentially apple made implementing\nA through uh the EPA every president has that power didn't have the power for a recess appointments land lead civil court stopped\nHe lost and right I I think you can find every president eventually you know when they served their their terms of been rejected by the courts in some executive order that they have ... up you know above put out do they try to stretch the power that they have yeah you have to make them dictators no no a dictator would be somebody who was not elected\nEnd result was duly elected and and the other part of that as we need to remind you that that's how people vote whether it was two thousand eight two thousand twelve\nThis is how the people voted uh you don't look the Democrats want you to believe that it's not how the people who voted um or there or we shouldn't have the ... like they may every excuse in the book it was the Russians\nAre we got to get rid of the electoral college that's the problem um the uh the the majority of the people didn't vote for him well this is what it comes down to this is the process we haven't place\nWe habit or reason and we respect the constitution and that process but I think it's very important as we've talked about before for\nA ... and we we spent quite a bit of time on this this week is for us not to be that don't argue like them right\nRight they have lost because of the way that they have argued ... so even though it may satisfy your primal urge or instinct\nTo rage out at somebody like they're doing to you and you get a moment of satisfaction out of it it's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times when he was true mhm and when you look at the things that we believe they work mhm that's why we promote that\nThat's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down to the issues that had and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right that want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the high\nYou know you and I ... and that's why we you talked about dictator remember when uh we'd we'd sit here Obama's Muslim and we said where's the evidence right well his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes\nWhat does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm which wasn't preaching you know Islam but was preaching hey\nFor a limited time use discount code W.

justifies the conclusion we saw it on social media yesterday you and I talked about that in our pre show meeting ...\nThat you see well Trump needs were apologize because we know it's somebody that you know who supports him who did this and then we saw the false flag it's the falls flat thing you saw the means out they're\nDemocrats were sending bombs to themselves and everything else on social media\nAnd nobody knows but this is a nation that we live and and that's part of the discussion that we had last hour\nWe've had a significant discussion on it the ... this week we want to believe the narrative before we even know what the truth was you and I dealt with this also because we talk of other instances of last hour that we dealt with this we dealt with the Trayvon Martin ... to this day I have no idea what happens now because you have that you have that\nTime span of I forgot the exact I was between two and four minutes where nobody knows what happened right we don't know what happened nobody and people were taking sides on that\nWe criticize former President Obama for taking sides remember the beer summit he had no idea\nOf ... the former president when it came to police officers\nAre involved in suspects shootings always took the side of the alleged victim not knowing whether the alleged victim was actually a victim or not that's wrong to do so we said it and ... and it was wrong for the president and the former attorney general Eric Holder to take sides in that\nAnd they took sides early on and then hold his own Justice Department found out that the whole hands up don't shoot was ally when the FBI did the investigation or are there and they talked about the conspiracy\nThe in the neighborhood to keep the truth from coming out\nHands up don't shoot is still used today mhm when neither side does that it's wrong\nWe should be basing our opinions on facts not speculation but we don't do that there is something I don't know what it is maybe it's social media where people believe that okay I have an audience now and so just like the media there's this thirst that\nI'm going to be first and if I\nGuess the rights conspiracy theory if I can guess what happened before the facts comes out somehow that gives me some type of journalistic legitimacy\nYeah it's um you know it it because it would be one thing if you had sources right and you were putting together a puzzle but then\nThat's not what it says it's speculation pure speculation\nPure speculation based on zero evidence\nBased on nothing you know if a Catherine heritage\nOr says look what it is possible based on the leaks that are coming out a that it is but that somebody who would put pieces of a puzzle together a think she's done some still work on a number of stories or over the years but what are you doing you're going to people that have\nSomething for you and then ultimately you see if\nThat peace bits in to the puzzle\nOr how the narrative starts to build out or how the how the truth I guess starts to come together that's all that is it's called journalists\nFor those under sixty journalism was very important you go to our nation and its rarely practice true journalism today because what you have is people wanting to\n'em and they believe they're right in doing so\nHaving opinion and have their work\nJustify their opinion\nOr their behavior their words they believe that they're right we talked about this earlier this week about how the the biased media you know operates because they believe they're right they don't believe that they're biased they believe it's the right thing to do activism\nIn place of journalism\nIs what we see today more often than not and you when you look at a story especially one like this and still unfolding and and the public we don't we simply don't know all we know it was one has been found that's it\nWe have no idea and were aligned it and and what the mode and we're still not sure what has been found and we're still not sure

Newt Gingrich did that\nFor sure I'm not sure about Henry specifically 'cause it yeah but in general I ... I think a poll she was first\nOf all why or how do you know that that would scare independence from voting if independence right now are leaning more conservative as the polls sense that they do that would actually encourage independents who leave conservative to me to actually go out and vote\nMaybe well that can be at a point to maybe that was\nAs you point cushy I look I when when you're talking about political operatives who you know you'd have to ask them what their motivation was and they probably will be more willing to tell you after election\nYou know why they why they did what they what they did and again we have looked at some of the polls out there and we have a question you don't need silver for example we still question\nYou know how how legitimate you know how you can look at all these house races and make these determinations we still have a ton of of questions but when you look at it overall I think the consensus is more that the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house and a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate\nI think you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with republic\nYeah in fact I saw something today uh that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it it was it was the headline was directed more at the Republican candidates in those races or republic Republicans in in general believing that they were going to keep the Senate\nOr where the houses going I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even ripples but if you do it strictly by the polls right now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats would take the house that would not be shocking\nA when you talk about a first term presidents are often that first midterm\nIs is something where the that shift of power happens that happened with a bronco bomber in two thousand ... right\nAnd so you could look at at at history that dictates says now do we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yeah trend in that area yeah Trump cabinet and that's\nWhat I was saying about the polls have you go by the polls in history than than you could look out and go okay about Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate\nAnd then you look at Nineteen Ninety four I did that happen right I was only\nYour national forecast from red eye radio on meteorologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\n\n\n\n\nReason we invented things like same day delivery and ... and the same jar we love convenience and which is what makes their permanent taste so special we offer health care in coverage together rather than having your doctor over here and your insurer there we provide quality health care in coverage under one roof and\nBring you up for other important tasks like making a sandwich Kaiser Permanente together we thrive in Haiti dot org slash integrated customers and hopefully that I mean when it comes to ... when when when he ... onto that we'd like to\nYou\nThe only way they see is home to\n... the New York city's premier they want to get tickets for lucent interview live music entertainment space SARS Asia Macy Seventeen to see past performance H.

show you know are going back in different incarnations all the way back to Nineteen sixty nine\nOr ... and our dealings with the transportation industry as always uh had that particular issue bent on economics and so when I saw this today I said okay this is something that we have to bring up so people can understand\nAbout the economy at large was the wall Street Journal's analysis\nOf Commerce Department statistics out on why we're doing better what is driving the increase in the gross in the GDP in the increase in economic growth what is you know what is driving and their analysis is almost half\nOf the increase from April of twenty Seventeen\nFrom last year until this year now new numbers are coming out this morning but based on the numbers that are that came out from last month's almost half\nOf the increase in our economy is due to increased government spending and they looked at you know really from the majority of the Obama administration where the uh economic uh growth was the average GDP was to point two percent\nAnd compared it to the two point nine percent\nEconomic growth that we've had since April twenty Seventeen just under three percent which is as you know we know is it is a good thing a defense spending has increased drastically that's one of the major reasons and increased government spending\nThat has helped the the GDP a defense spending was can rapid at an annual rate get this Eric a to point one percent from two thousand nine to twenty Seventy\n...\nAnd they really go back to you know the president's real you know the really the first budget when he had no influence on his when looking right or to growing at a two point nine percent\nSince April twenty Seventeen so it was a huge difference in defense spending that turnaround added a point to one percentage points to the ... on average to the nation's overall economic growth rate according to the Commerce Department\nWhen a including faster spending on non defense items and spending at state and local levels increased government spending\nAccounted for a point three four percentage point of the point seven percent point increase in the growth rate since April twenty Seventeen which means uh the economy has grown a two point nine percent\nUh since April of twenty Seventeen the last quarter was what for for one was ... right or was it was a very good courtroom uh almost half of that has been because of government spending\nNow it has also increased other factors are at play faster business investment due in part to energy investing contributed point contributed points three percentage points to the growth rate faster consumer spending accounts for about a third of the pick up a slowdown in home building has some attracted\nTwo percentage points from that growth rate the concern is as we've said before is once the government spending moderate than that increase goes away and as we said before the true grow and if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democratic president\nOr the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way it's never been the most are accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way\nAs private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts the actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018",
