Americans might have been more tenacious it's hard to say but it was a constant complaint even with the second division as well so and\nSay well I've wondered about the rock and the ... for example this took place in July the Americans just didn't run away and the French ran away the first the Germans ... at the moment Germans guns run a opened up they run away and the Americans were unfamiliar with the idea that you run away when the Germans started shooting\nWell like I say that might have been a morale issue um it's hard to say uh yeah they were anyway the\nThe the story as they were supposed to come up on the Marines left and there was a there was a readout at the bottom of it this is the editor and hook as it was very well fortified\nMachine guns they the French could not take it could not take it they finally said to fit a regiment was trailing six regimen to the left and they they took it\nThen they left and they gave it to French and the Germans we took it so it's just yeah it was a it was a bad thing so basically gates and his men are uh it's about a mile at let's say about a mile up the hill let's say and they're towards the top levels right at the top of their their their banned in Germany trenches they're taking it\nBut they're left as exposed a case at one point looked over for about eight hundred German said that his way he went back and they they have tanks\nWith the for support with the salt and he called tank silver and basically in the Marines just started blasting away at him and he said that you know that that broke up\nThat attack really well um then they get to the top fifth regiment followed them up basically like you say the kind of like an on an island or left is in the air as it used to say about the flying and it's night following and they're just wondering\nWhat's gonna happen I'm going to have some big German a counterattack force down the hill or what but they survive 'til the morning and then uh the fifth regiment was ordered to attack which they did and then they got caught by that afternoon in front of the villages that chant\nMassive German force I'm just artillery machine guns could not advance any further and that base that basically became the battle for the next ten days was just by inches degrees\nUntil finally uh they were able to take to the village of Sandia Chen and then the thirty six divisions took over\nThere was a lot of action left between October and November eleventh however part of the discovery of cliff Kate says that we're going to leave Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd we're going to travel quickly to August and September Nineteen forty two where are we were on Guadalcanal cliff case is now a marine veteran he's a colonel commanding on Guadalcanal and the Japanese are sending wave after wave of the top teams and bring them down\nPlot the U.S navy as bugged out is left the Marines all by themselves and it reminded me as I got some of the chapters gym just like a month or just like black mall that I've Kate's again and the Marines were left to fight it out of ... and surrounded and they survived\nYeah exactly and others one battle in particular I Believe it was about August twenty first a battle of the ... river where the Marines had dug in there was a colonel a cheeky brought up a force of about a thousand then down the beach towards them and attack them in the middle of the night and actually they\nKilled quite a few Marines but they never broke the line um and then in the morning gates came up to the front the was it was the first marine regiment a that he was commanding\nAnd they sent takes in and basically uh pretty much kill that'd be less a Japan Japanese warrior a so that was broken up at his job vicious fighting then they moved on to take the rest of their portion of the Ayelet they're supposed to take and hold hundreds and feel these got things\nOh it tastes weeks though the battle goes on until Nineteen forty three and chaos at this point is he in his diary than his letters twenty four years later is he reflective on his ability to survive being surrounded and cut off to the talk about it to do is to his route to his relatives or friends\nNot you know what he was a very matter of fact guy uh yeah I think it would have made a good attorney wonderfully light if he should've gone back to being an attorney instead of staying with the marine corps I think he was his mind was just it was a guy\nWho is best under action went away and pick up actions when he is the clearest and that's what makes them a great combat leader or a great leader in general um he didn't really reflect it was not a self reflective person not bad introspective that I kept I picked up a name was letters but he was happy\nI did this up most given what happened in first world war to keep us casualties down and Second World war of course they had better equipment by then too\nBut he was very mindful of the waste that are going on in the first World War and he wanted that not to happen uh at Guadalcanal and later although it was it more difficult path to keep casualties down and he will Jima he did what he could there too but that was just a bitter bitter fight\nA one detail that are made me like him he had a friend who went back for supplies I think it was a fellow would I think it was very early and he never saw him again did they find his body and did they bury it\nOh yeah he was looking for the third battalion right before the assault on Russia's yeah and uh I was walking away with a cigarette in his mouth and they and then he went out looking for the body on the day that the severe gas attack or they did find his body\nYes they did then he's buried at ... at the at the cemetery their\nFellow I Believe he is I Believe he is very there and where his case bearing rate Arlington\nWell that's a that's appropriate and ... and cases people remembered him until they all left us and I wonder if\nYou know I guess the Marines from gum canal are going now to two wars of veterans remembering case the name is the book is I Will hold the story of United States Marine Corps legend Clifton B.

degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nWhich means you could be anywhere from one sixty fourth to one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American which incidentally maybe lower than many other Europeans are Hispanics are black Americans in terms of being related if you go back six to ten generations\nSo instead of putting the Fisher to bed it may have just strokes and stoke the fires\nAnd in fact you may have heard the Cherokee Nation reported a response to the results of protest arguing quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nResponse came after the Democratic center revealed that based on tests is Native American ancestry as I sit in the range of six and a generation ago so the Cherokee Nation secretary of state said at a press release current DNA test and not even distinguish where the person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nAnd they set their own legal requirements for citizenship and DNA test while they can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual he said it's not evidence for tribal affiliations\nUsing a DNA test just doesn't do it and that wasn't enough\nA President Obama's former campaign manager Monday sharply criticized or for releasing the results of this test back in her claims that she's has Native American ancestry he claimed she was thrown her party off message just weeks before November's critical midterm elections you did it wasn't a smart move\nHe said there's a quote from the Democrats argue the substance all you want but why twenty two days before a crucial election where we must win a house and Senate save America why did center war and have to do her announcement no that was former president ... two thousand twelve campaign manager Jim Messina\nWhy can Democrats ever stay focused Adams the news also served as deputy White House chief of staff\nSo Warren likely twenty twenty presidential can a contender is an overwhelming favorite to win re election in Massachusetts in November or when it first became widely known you may remember she was running against Scott Brown in a tight Senate campaign but most voters didn't seem to care\nWell now it looks like they are the care because talk about shooting yourself in the foot the Indians do that I don't think so I'm\nMelvin asked to him and MSNBC anchor MSNBC Hank you're not Fox News also Penn Warren's decision to release or DNA results on your Monday during an interview with the Boston Globe\nAnd here's a quote did warn gain anything about putting up the DNA test results Melvin us the best I can gather\nInto the paper's reporting she's one one ... something like that I think I might just be as Native American she is and he goes on I don't know who my great great great great grandmother grandfather is\nA this guy responded noting that warns clean heritage was pretty far back meanwhile New York times New York times reporter wrote sarcastically on Twitter President Trump is sure to stop mocking Senator Warren about her ancestry now that she's provided defended improve\nCan you say stepping into further instead of putting this behind her she may have put it out front how many of you if you did this can go back that many generations and maybe you'll find I don't know if you're an ancestor of Abraham Lincoln or George Washington own who knows what else\nDo you realize what that means to go back six generations\nLet me know if you think she just eliminate herself from the twenty twenty race I I think this was huge you remember when Ted Kennedy a it was the favorite to run for president and then they asked him why are you running for president in his answer was no answer you couldn't think of it hadn't thought about that yeah it was just next in line he was the Kennedy\nSo let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eyed and speaking people have\nLost uh a month or catch up on this to Michael ... has lost another one so used to her that yes they Stormy Daniels live a lawsuit over tweet by Trump accusing her of a total con job was thrown out by judge you said the president was engaging in free speech\nThe adult film star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford claim she was threatened by no no men in the Las Vegas parking lot of two thousand eleven for agreeing to cooperate with a magazine article about a trip she said she had with Trump in two thousand six\nAfter a lawyer released a composite sketching them and Trump accused Clifford in a tweet of a total time job concerning uh non existent man and the ... court so we agree with Mr Trump's argument because the tweet and questioned constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associate with politics in public discourse\nSo Trump's lawyer said this was a total when put against ... this this guy never gives up oh we're going to appeal\nYou remember if if you don't remember he's the one that I think her name was sweating except she accused Kavanaugh's being part of a a ring that allowed a gang rape I think by people and even the New York times didn't print that because there was no evidence\nSo you could see where I may be headed I I Want to know who you wait on both sides who you'd like to see to be your nominee if you're a Democrat and I've been on the other side who would you like to see to be the nominee because you think it would help them so much\nSo let me throw before I for some names out\nDid you hear that great phony Kamala Harris his book the first twenty twenty ticket to Iowa by the way I think\nThat Warren did that because she's so afraid of all the publicity others like Kamala Harris and Spartacus book or that's what I call now you know you have the Spartacus moment which wasn't even correct of course because the Senate if you remember had already printed the information\nBut I think she's so afraid of these people that you figured I'll I'll put this behind me and I'll be ready to really know she'd the just the opposite\nAnyway Kamala Harris will travel for the first time this year the first in the nation caucus\nOn October twenty ... twenty third as she prepares for a potential president Shawn Harris a California Democrat will make appearances in Des Moines in Cedar Rapids with all the stops to follow up and then South Carolina so following the visits Harris will appear to three or four early primary states this election cycle\nSo here's the names here are the names you can put out anything you want\nYour the names that I was thinking about uh the Spartacus Booker Cory Booker if you don't know if I'm referring to former attorney general Eric Holder did you see over the weekend he said I'm a Michelle Obama has said that when they when we meaning people on my side go ... or low they go higher\nAnd uh what Eric Holder said no that's just the opposite we we we we go down to we fight and we should whatever you say\nAnd of course is Bernie Sanders young Bernie Sanders he'll he'll be running again he's a favorite of any\nSenator Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren now vice president Joe Biden in poll shows that he's kind of the leader up there maybe you know often in politics its name recognition more than anything else\nYou got New York Sen Kirsten Gillibrand who either there's a winner as she loved Bill Clinton and thought he was terrific until he was maybe someone you didn't want to mention that for me too movement so there there's someone you know don't trust her watch your back of your own her Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy I didn't even know he was running\nThat ... is a good sign if I'm a talk show host\nFormer Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and he doesn't have much of a chance but we know who he is former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick by the way you know why a lot of these people run and run because then they're speaking fees go up usually I remember after Jack Kemp ran for vice president is speaking fees and I want everybody in the staff here this\nBecame fifty thousand dollars a speech so if you wonder why these people run their huge benefits even if they don't win\nOhio Senator Sherrod brown\nActually what about cases like he's really a Democrat and wonder why he's not running on that side New York governor Andrew Cuomo right you know him\nAnd there's another one I did I mean I Know his name I Can't imagine what chance he thinks she has New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu um LA mayor that's mine there Eric our city people have allusions delusions of grant or I mean you know come on mayor your mayor of Los Angeles the homeless situation is is just awful\nI I don't know what he's thing except he wants the publicity that the power and of course you heard about Oprah Winfrey but it doesn't look like she's running but with her name recognition in all the others will have to take a ...\nLawyer Michael ... or is Tucker Carlson from Fox calls them ... the sleazy porn full as time goes on I came up with a good one there and I bet you didn't know this one Montana governor Steve bullock Mm I don't think I Know\nWho's your pick like you I never heard of some of these but heck they as I said that could increase their speaking fees\nAnd if you're on the other side who would you like to face if you're on my side let me know an eight six six Ninety red eye that is eight six six nine o seven three three three nine it's time to visit this there are already running and we haven't even gotten through the ... elections for house and Senate but that's coming up in a few weeks\nBut by the way as I said last night in the ...\nAnd altogether I think they're all wasting their time they're delusional President Trump is going to be reelected they're going to be so surprised but again\nIf they get the publicity the name recognition the tower that all that stuff goes to the heads let me know what you think it's more faster sitting in on red on radio\n[noise]

... with them you know we can make that deal\nI'd be willing to let her you know I Know a lot of you would be unhappy with me if I say that but I said you let me know what you think about that too should we reopen the investigation or Clinton or as I Know what you're going to say which is she's not above the law but\nYeah the ... we already have a civil war in this country which is what we discuss the other night you're going to make this stuff work so she above the law you know but certain times it pays to ask what's best for America and let's see what you think Charles in New York City wrong with mark\nYes Hi Mark first I'd like to say the first time that I'm hearing you and that really you sound like you really know what you're talking about the very political voice I Would like to say several days first of all I'm going to predict something which I'm sure\nAlmost all of your listeners are going to be happy to hear it if they believe we're going to say it's gonna happen I predict that the we had written up if you want to forty nine as far as the Senate goes [noise] we're gonna we're gonna gain four seats minimum\nAnd maybe even more but you're fifty five old way up to sixty possibly uh as far as to how to civil trickier because of the suburbs and because of redistricting but we'll see we'll keep the house for sure why do I say that was such that for this or maybe I'm Crazy but I'm not because\nWhat happened last by Douglas sixteen what Trump when\nNobody believed that he would win right everybody was afraid to say it'll it'll go jump show even at the exit polls if I remember correctly they thought that you know it will be want because those that voted for Trump avoided the survey or the law the survey\nNow people are afraid to tell the truth then they want to drum up as far\nAs how can you ... got worse and\nMuch or what they know that they were afraid now the petrified\nThat this is a a you know there were I have noticed nobody afraid to say or voted for Obama or voted for Hillary nobody that right to say that nobody but it's it's amazing to watch all the other one side it's absolutely ridiculous in addition to the cabinet thing is like\nI live by the way it everybody is saying that they're based got bigger waited grounded out excited liberty says another point which you have the people that were on defense they finally had to see\nThat the media it totally in collusion speaking of buff delusion not Trump with Russia but the media with the Democrats\nI think it's a big blow to Kavanaugh became a justice thank God but it's kind of his teeth but you'd be they became justice I think the the left in the media outcry over this as much as they were crying and two thousand sixty when Trump won\nBut it's like people are absolutely petrified also in America and in Israel following politics in both countries very closely the left always the right let me put it this way the ripe old age does three to six percent better than the prediction is\nNinety eight percent it's not a hundred percent always like in Israel that terrorists labor was getting the same thing because the media is extremely left in America like Ninety six percent or something like that the same thing goes is true in Israel\nAnd there's no question we're going to win but what cabin or did over here you have Eric Eric's I think that it was on

know I'd love to see how the ... guys crazy loon Tucker Carlson raised from is not that bad or write a sleazy porn lawyer bought a let me know what you think Andy in New York City you're on was mark Hi Andy\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call [noise]\n[noise] um I just was you know interested why there's such a big I'm such a big talk about Saudi Arabia and what they did [noise] um you know what they did was terrible book\nYou know ... you know even if the to do something small that's all right but it's such a big the making such a big uproar about it on I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it\nWhen it's in our interest you know when when we could prevent you know bigger a human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is defense\nBut in this case I mean she wasn't a US citizen I'm here to green card\nUm mostly if they did it in it isn't our best interest to just you know there are big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran\nSo like whoa you know they they help us out why um what's the big uproar but you know they've done things like\nThis in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all his you know the princes in a hotel for a few months to get to make them pay ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know is not is not your regular guys like\nI'm a stay you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about it\nLook at the ... it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east right the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBut I gotta tell ya just the thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to say the great about him because he was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know the there is their enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt\nOr so I'm not a big fan of what he believes in in that sense wants to go when someone we're be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have a special status when a country has an embassy in another country they there's in their territory their land\nYou lord in there and and then you chop them up when you assassinate him and it just so revolting to people I I think that's what was going on in your right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to find Iran\nIt's very difficult situation for President Trump adjust supply I must have been taught to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with him probably many as\n... yeah but that's you know agree with and the ... getting getting killed like that is horrible I'm\nYeah I mean so ... yeah\n... even though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean do they really want a large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and and ... and I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's a it is a horrible incident but\nFor this alone I don't think you know I'm In the bigger picture you know ... such yeah\nYeah I I I I cringed when using cutting off business I and that's bad in this in this story but um you're right we we need them we need them badly and that's why I say president\nTrump ... isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who's terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey yeah I'm never going there again while in this guys and the princes in power and the and the Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying we we can't allow this to happen\nYou know which is crazy sounds you have to have some\nCivility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out ... even if you can you don't do stuff like that that's why the the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was was so outrageous it to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but I\nI I've followed this stuff and\nUm I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if\nThe Russians were involved the mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not seeing Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved a lot you know there's there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way he ... he was so outrageous by a Obama\nA because he was becoming our friend\nA difficulty yeah so you you get to you it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff do you know I don't want all the different countries and assassinating them go ahead\nI Know I but I Do feel I mean my my impression is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the X. box\nUm I'm sure you know it's probably known you know in Washington is probably like you know known that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure cute and takes out you know he has people going down his political opponents you know here and there it's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon\nYou know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became they ... the public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there\nAnd it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and you say you know if I don't come out and you know here's what you do\nAnd and it just disappeared and they made it worse no we always say that the the if the not even the crime itself but\nThe cover up and they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that was a wad of interrogation that got got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little crazy like well yeah though show they're\nPretty sure they're pretty bad [laughter] if\nYou bet yeah this wasn't a by the way it was mentioned my produced last night just wasn't a job interview going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly you know the credible home I think people even on our side are reacting viscerally and I I don't blame him because I felt the same way you can drop 'em up and when they brought didn't he brings suitcases\nIt's reported it and you know how do they think it's funny I mean I don't want to be gross that way on the air but I I think all of that stuff you may be right just the fact that we knew about there's always espionage there's always dirty stuff going on\nEven in one unified system all with a proven implementation approach and simplify transparent pricing learn more criminal son calm slash compliance criminals workforce innovation that works\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nFun to seven nine six four or five that's F.
