[noise]\nNow back to the John bachelor show [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn ... definitely ... book is a mad catastrophe\nAnd we will follow Conrad with his delusions about how to defeat the Russians\nHe sends for army against the Russians who are overwhelming him from all directions he gives the order\nTo march on ... which is well to the north is is Nordstrom the northern a policy the northern campaign that he's going to launch but he doesn't use the few aircraft he has he doesn't use the cavalry has so he has no idea where the Russians are\nThe way you lay this out uh I follow you very carefully Jeffrey is this or is this well known in Europe that Conrad campaign was ignorance an amateur tourism and he threw himself up against the Russians were any idea where they were\nNot exactly I think that the Austrian surprisingly or get a pass on on most of these things are they're viewed as having fought a gallon little war against the Russians scheme roller and this is to ignore the central reality here which is that\nWe're planning and you know since the seventies in Vienna and Berlin had assumed that the author Hungarians although numerically\nWeaker than Russia I mean remember the population of Austria Hungary in Nineteen fourteen is fifty three million population of Russian I already the it's a hundred and fifty million three times larger\nAs corresponding we larger army cheaply because they can afford it thanks to French financing part of the French strategy to hold off the Germans were bigger richer was to finance real ways and military expansion inside Russia\nSo they knew they were they they'd known since the since the late Eighteen hundreds of they were going to have to fight the Russians at some point it was a strategy to strike it was that the author Hungarians all those smaller would be qualitatively better\nThey would have a faster nimble are harder hitting army better trained\nBetter morale swift or and they would strike quickly into the Russian Empire and they would the real the the the presumably slower Russian mobilization by stray that the north stars you mentioned is pushing the low blame the idea that\nBlow this northern blow that would hinge the Russian mobilization create chaos and allow this more efficient ... army to advance deep\nInto Russia and not not defeat the Russian Empire because there's no chance an army of\nForty five forty eight divisions is going to conquer the Russian Empire march all the way to Petersburg but no they could have really ruined the Russians back retarded their mobilization allowed the Germans to win and the west and then allow the Germans to redeploy two million troops to the aid to finish off the Russians and so\nYou know the economist option to the Austrian did okay that they want a couple of frontier battles and it was only because a big Russian number\nThere are thrown back but in fact they knew they were gonna have to cope with the Russian numbers and those frontier battles that they are celebrated for having one home are often crossing were minor victory speaking in fact I argue in the book they aren't really victory as I say\nIt's like a a boxer who wins on points in the first round but then get knocked out in the second round claiming that he wasn't about you know in fact\nThey win these battles these early ballots but then at the Russians pullback regroup and then a counterattack and destroy I mean literally destroy the author Hungarian\nBecause of the arrogance of the Austrian Empire they believe they always had to attack so they were out numbered and the Russians learned to survive\nBy digging in a shooting and then there's the ... as the Austrian fact close to ... the Russians would run away and reposition themselves for the next\nFor the next contact and the Austrians never had anything to shoot at now that was just Austrian style it it they'll they come off as if they're too arrogant to be in the battle they don't believe the Russians should oppose them\nWell you know it I ... some of them some of them were certainly arrogant or the officers you know ... in the book I have anecdotes robbers will say to them and oh just advanced the Russians are hiding in their trenches there's nothing to fear from them there's some arrogance there certainly\nBut the office of tactics the bullet the gate tactics charging a Russian gun lines in trenches\nReally had more to do with the national in linguistics problems in the army there was just no way to get these multilingual true forward and any with any kind of precision if they'd been spread out and open order\nSo the the the solution with the math them in the storm calm the ban it charges much like those used by Napoleon at the beginning of the nineteenth century and send these massive storm called that the Russian trenches and this was absolute suicide\nThe casualties were horrendous and the and the Russians were stupid fight there were like\nWhat army fight this negligent ally and foolishly then not only were they attacking with these mass to ban it charges in the trenches\nThat were bristling with quick firing artillery machine guns and magazine rifles but they were doing it without any artillery support and without\nIn with one machine gun per battalion\nAnd the machine is often didn't work because of the point out in the book the troops to try to waterproof them smeared than with lard alarm clock the machine gun machine gun couldn't fire safety card reports quickly and a lot of the machine guns and they're not working but they didn't have you know they only had lights or they had no heavy artillery\nAnd uh so that the the the Austrian attacks\nAre slaughters absolute spot in his pictures in the book to be shaped up bloated black doctor in court says after every after every engagement\nThe two army than the one against the Serbs in the south pole T. R. ex army is turned back smashed back it will go back again and again and again but it smashed back and the army for Conrad going to the north runs into the Russians and his overwhelmed\nAnd when we return we'll be tough how Austrian explains itself because one of the things about Conrad and one of the things about ... is that they're always hurting the rationalization for their memoirs each time they lose the battle the book is a mad catastrophe the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the hops\nFor ... ... an empire Jeffrey Warren is the author I'm John Donvan and this is the John ...

three four that star star one two three four star star one two three four\nSo they are much better at the finding the terms and using language to their benefit here here's another one pro choice now how could\nA conservative be against you having choices so the other side had a you know came up with pro life but there's the battle right because you look pretty bad if you say you're from women having choices and then you say no they can have a choice\nOf course it helps in all of us have the media on your side perpetuating these faucets I recognize that that's huge and one of the other callers pointed that out mark you can't leave out the media so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they are explaining the obvious\nBy the way one of the other things I mentioned last night the left is very good at slogans right so hoping change right above my head open changed how could you argue with hope and change\nYou have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second or you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know where you're happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change or how about a change you know the taken away your car\nNot every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're playing the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why mentioning 'cause it's happening now but I'll get to the minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's now but the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages\nNever mind that this was started under the bottom ministry Russian President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but you're hardly ever heard of the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue\nNo one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty\nAnd to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes\nThis was so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again there's a simple right how can you you know you're ripping away from the parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having\nIt's plain things like what is it coming here legally means why that's not acceptable but the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to just set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning that with comments like I'm throwing out there that you would\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal\nAnd they were hauled off to jail\nTheir children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one\nThat's a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these condors or Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen very shortly whenever they get here\nYou never get to stay with your kid you could you could use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and put our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them\nWhy isn't it sad and I was just indicate the latest reincarnation of this conflict\nIs is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum so again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders\nAnd the media will again show crying children and distraught mothers you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obviously too it seems to me to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our open border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to know\nOr ... well you can't if they come here and Russian or even for that matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values and just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense the Democrats won more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers\nAnd the country club Republicans for lack of better name they want cheap labor\nSo you have or newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and it would talk about immigration in the title and then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and somewhere in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been a great for America over the years how could you you're in Iowa list\nRight how could you oppose this this is insane\nBut they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration\nIn the title of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than McDonalds during that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like\nBoy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\n... Lawson politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption\nMost illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for and by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice\nBetween Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they need us so who these people don't vote for it's not that hard to figure out and if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish base it is clear that we need to control the border not to mention fairness\nWhat do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but it has to undergo long waits and says some paperwork to even have a hope of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not which is why a border wall makes sense among other tools not the only thing but it's one of the tools\nSo one color of this week and if you didn't hear suggests that border walls don't work in the long run and I said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run while we tried to clean this mess up and\nHave an orderly procedure coming to our country if to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like hates finally use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera 'cause I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise in lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage isn't that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas from murdering Israel's Israelis is working on the front room\nOf logic these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words the terms I more to say to you but I Know you have to go to a break shortly but let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more in six six Ninety red eyes\nAnd that's the same as eight six six nine seven three three three nine so example\nHow can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor\nIf you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended were sent home\nSo that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them but how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they do these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free healthcare and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home run the actually had a right\nTo use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\n\n\nIf you will

and help out South Africa because uh they're digging themselves into over right now so\nI hear your Saudi has in the middle of June ... yeah I I Do hear by the way you bring up a new story I don't know if it's a lot of people know about South Africa's expert breeding the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggle and I had a lot of them are going to resist right with the force\nAbsolutely yeah\nWe well it was you know when in fact recall when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but like we did so after you got to be

you've gotten instead of the shah\nI ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that you might say Russia or China but certainly the the ... biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens so it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking of Gadhafi in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that\nWhat is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right\nIn being gossipy you you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with somebody you're now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion needed stone assassinate people like that and go inside chop them up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business\nBut the other side and President Trump's got a huge problem now\nIs they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israeli and trying to do work against Iran cause Iran's their threat to this world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose sides sometimes they may

actually observe what's actually going on and some of these cities if that's a science your your readers finding the work\nYeah no you make a great point and bringing up the thing with an act of love and then I think Rick Perry got himself in trouble thing you have no are you guys don't understand they don't live in the ... you know like we do they're not paying the price the mean an\nAct of love to defend your borders and to think there's something special about the country you live in and you're not saying\nThat at least I'm not saying that immigrants can't come in I I agree immigration has been a boon to the United states overall one was an orderly process to make sure you have no diseases and make sure you're not a terrorist how about that one to make sure that your share some of our values or maybe you speak the language you mean that's\nThat's so outrageous that you want those things and we're called names on ... or whatever else they call you can't even think of it because we just want some rules and procedures and the we want people to follow that why we wrote that are evil yeah\nYeah but I think at the end of the day the markets that gets a winning issue I think we stick to our guns and don't back down don't you know don't cave to the pressures of the left I think it's a ... absolutely one hundred percent as a winning argument because law and order and stabbed washed\nPrinciples are on our side and I don't see the American public shame you know we want to turn our back on that\nYou know all of a sudden after two hundred and fifty years or you know whatever I ... I Would see this you know process layer your we want to turn the country over to a bunch of radicals who are worth a mob mentality\nAbsolutely well I I great called Bruce I agree with you and you made a lot of great points and we need to protect our country you're absolutely right and I I as I said thanks for calling\nYour picture you too and let's go to AJ in Chicago EJ you're on with mark\nHey what's up man I'm I just want to say that actually the last caller had a lot of\nGreat only um the I think the biggest polling day he had was that a lot of illegal immigrants coming to the United states uh believing that they have the right shows or\nLanding on this country\nUm I think that you know it's a lot more than just be your it's more a contributing\nIf you don't contribute your community the lowest sons or you don't you're not valuable in that sense so if you don't contribute to your country I think that's the highest sense which is what our military\nAnd uh most of our people who served this country at the highest level in say that they do um it's nothing they immigrate King County\nUm so I Would say that I as a ... you should feel that um you come into this country to contribute their absolute smokes on it you don't think you can do that and I don't know what your contribution to this country is I'm\nJust being here is not enough to know what I mean\nYeah I Do in fact I think you're ... something many of them come here and they wind up with an entitlement mentality right\nThey're entitled to serve as the hospitals schools whatever you want to say and and that you know what here's another great point what you give away for free I called a great point 'cause my what you get away for free is usually not value\nWhat you know you give free schools and they don't value the school you'll get free medical care that after a while people think it's coming to them so we even hurting them the the illegals because we're not making them value what we're giving them\nRight right so I I I think I have one final point you might find the owner that uh\nIf if you take away a or given for free and what do you ... you know and if you come here with nothing and they expect the most um\nYou really can view it things so you should take at least a ... in my in my expectations of what I can give and what I can take it always has to do with what my contributions our economy being I gave\nThe least then I Will be doing the worst if I come here and give most I Will be doing the bus there or are you planning\nTo anything whether it's a job\nWhether it's a service position whether it's anything at all\nOr giving your your ... percent or should should dictate and ... percent a tape if you give your salute leaves zero percent you're not going to get anything out of ... so\nI knew in Europe you reminded me of ... ... yeah ... you remind me of the story if I could share with you\nWhen I was teaching younger kids in elementary school when I first started out now I teach adults you know what the kids would do with the free lunch you have any idea what they do that they would throw in and they would take the they would take\nThe green peas and toss them all over the cafeteria because they got it for free and they place no value on it\nSo in any sense yeah in in a funny sense\nEven with the illegals they they not only is an entitlement mentality but we're not even helping them because they didn't earn any for this we're just giving it away from nothing and then we're surprised when they don't even value being in America and they don't share you stake in the community and give it a values in fact\nWe've made it so easy that there are now communities where people don't even learn to speak English because everything's done for them in Spanish and I love this fact people yeah they're they're mostly in my classes that's not the issue so we actually in a funny way\nDone harm to them and the other gentleman the other caller said we\nYou know we should not abandon the fight yeah but you do need someone to express it in a way that the American people and as a winning issue and that's what he said that the American people can sign onto it we're not even helping the illegals yeah you say in the short run they're getting free benefits and stuff not in the long run\nNot in the long run do they value what's so special about being in the United states of America and there are set America One caller challenge me on that\nRecall thanks so much AJ and you have given my\nPre scare you to think you have to\nThank you

embrace that concept and we explain that concept better it would help us further some of the\nIssues the goals that we as conservatives patriots whatever it is\nLabel that you want to put a bomb us this week are trying to further um the beauty of this place is that it is individuals and the federal government was never meant to governor ... it was meant as a facilitator show these common goals that we asked and therefore the state's rights\nThat's why they're so important and that's why the the the I mean we don't have the United states driver license we have a Florida we have a Texas we have a New York's driver's license because again it it in a forces that mentality that\nThe federal government is not meant to be the monster that it is today everybody looks for the federal government so we solve so many issues and I don't think that was the intention of the original founders of the country\nAnd and I think of that concept was a little bit more understood and and and embrace a number one the patriotism and realizing that there is a unique concept and that is has been successful and number two that\nWe need to very much limit and cut down on the authority that we have given the federal government much to the ah ruin of ourselves\nThis Vernon all that you have your show [laughter] I Know\nYou did you you're very articulate the uh there's very little I disagree with and I'm In no way was tuning the idea of the United States Marine getting together and and I teach government among other things\nSo I wasn't on that side I just I mean we we do have a continent by the way it's not called America's called North America I don't mean to be picky there but uh that's what Kennedy's and that's when ... were on the ...\nSouth America as part of a greater America [laughter]\nI don't I don't know I don't see that one I don't buy for me I I think to the I Love the term America America the beautiful is a great song um and so that's all but of course you're absolutely right we came together as a people of states and we didn't want a strong federal government\nAnd the founders were very much opposed to that and that's what made us part of the reason we're so special you were very articulate you a very good so I I don't want one\nActually my first time but I I was I really I I really think\nThat if I really think that if we understood more of the concept of looking at us at us as a union therefore republic as opposed to a democracy\nA ... as a union instead of a country with a single government is single mentality that it would help us to further explain to people some of the causes that we as conservatives as as constitutional is again whatever label you want to use are trying to get people to understand them further\nThat no absolutely I agree with everything you're saying and you did it very well but you're gonna have to be better the second time\nWell darn it mark I tell you when you hear me moral site\n[laughter] well
