board a helicopter Monday President Trump talked about the international crisis created by the killing of journalist ... or ... was there the\nAh she's in the news why because the media's picked up on it now maybe the media is not in this case\nDoing what you as a Democrat would like\nWhen it comes to what you think the media should be promoting or or what their role should be in a you know whether there should be parallel endorsements coming from the Democrats and your media [laughter]\nAt you know at at at the same time but the fact is the media has gone ... over okay so Cortez ... the media has gone\n... uh uh over a Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke get\nIs the media we played it yesterday on this week or this week is a new show and Stephanopoulos goes to the reporter out there in the reporter talks is talking to him as if he's a rock star by saying you're really a rock star\nOh no I'm not no no no you really really you really really are\nAnd you know that's not that's not reporting in any way a political reporters should never be in that type of discussion you know do you know to begin with but the fact is because the media is ... over a work in Cortez they are the ones that have annoying to them as\nThe new leaders in the new faces because the new faces objects media pays attention to especially the new young ones and you know they're looking for new young blood because they look at it and they say Hillary can't when we don't want Bernie remember occasional Cortez came out\nJust over the weekend in wouldn't endorse Bernie Sanders who she endorsed\nBack in in uh in in twenty sixteen so or Hillary as we know everybody\nWell I won't say everybody there are some Democrats or would like her to come back but most Democrats don't want you know her to come back into now you've got the you know the new you know a young guns\nThat are out there and it uh you know ... stadium I don't really care whether we get in Obama's endorsement and I really don't need Obama's endorsement as if look you're the old news and then a case of protest coming out in St Bernie Sanders nine Dorfman twenty sixteen we'll wait to see what happens\nYou know come uh twenty twenty wow yeah and and yet you look at it and you say who will be the uh\nYou know who will be the person who will be the uh you know the nominee for the Democrats are in twenty twenty we got a great show ahead coming up\nOr early voting I started yesterday in Texas has already been done in other states even before taxes that NBC story out there saying that the GOP is all doing the Democrats in the early voting in a bunch of different states will get to that uh the um\nThe widows or there was something else\nWhy you have to oh yeah yeah because I had mentioned uh uh twenty twenty and the Democrats are we told you so Cory bookers plan to give out more cash mhm we talked about this yesterday that what you're going to see from the Democrats is free everything for twenty twenty mhm\nFree everything but we don't believe in the constitution and we hate America that's the new that is the new narrative we don't believe in the constitution we don't believe in due process we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe\nOr in the the the second amendment we don't believe that there should be a Senate we don't believe that there should be a a a a a a electoral college we don't believe\nIn the constitution of the United states but we wish to give you everything they get up to six thousand dollars Camilla Harris now Cory Booker talking about fifty thousand dollars\nThat can be used or by the young poor in this country to buy a house or to get a college education so now they're up to fifty thousand dollars remember back in twenty sixteen to show you that Eric and I are on the cutting edge of where the left is going\nA weird stated look why don't you just come out we need somebody to come out to be the first one to say we're just going to give everybody a hundred thousand dollars well they're not up to a hundred thousand yet but two years after we said that and it was two years right about now mhm 'cause we told Hillary look if you want to get it if you're looking for that last you know to we push\nHundred thousand to everybody should just go all the way yeah Cory Booker not up to fifty thousand dollars\n... that's the other problem we discussed yesterday was Hillary you know with ah with everything you know the the big free and and and all the money you don't forget the free will also\nPay you were going to pay you know the government's going to pay you so you'll get everything for free and we're going to give you money\nWell if you're Hillary there's no way you can't be a moderate in your approach\nNo if she's thinking of running you better take some numbers down they're gonna have to be bigger than what's out there now\nWhat would you well you know the the six thousand really just got blown out of the water just out and ... ... ... men that in a couple of days I now we're up to fifty thousand right and that's not enough\nYou can't buy a house for fifty grand art bunkers got fifty thousand who's got marking on I got a hundred thousand a hundred thousand ... hundred thousand\nWhy don't we just force the home builders to build somebody there ... everybody their dream home ah the grocery stores\nThey can charge you anymore slave healthcare is the right food must be a writer yeah free food as long as it made by the way why isn't anybody\nCome up with that thing about marriage ran for years ... shouldn't that be

supermodels eat everyday\nFood\nBy the way we don't condone just walking into a grocery store and leaving without paying\n[laughter] ... [laughter] wait wait for it\nBut that's this is this is what you have to do [laughter] it will be an option they'll have an option here during the primary for the left\nIt'll just every every instead of debates it'll just be an option that was what a promise his campaign promise auction you've got\nA [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nYou've got Democrats out there saying you know with this one point six billion dollar lottery yeah we've got to start up in the money that we are going to give people be looking at one point six billion\nHow about if we have a let's call it the lottery that everybody when that's right yes how 'bout that the right hand picked by the way somebody should be paying for these ideas you know we we told the Democrats back in ah\nIn twenty sixteen you're young you know just start offering more money right we set a hundred thousand right or a book or self defense days is up to fifty\nWell had that story coming up about the the the fifty ... because it wouldn't go to everybody but they're up to fifty though that's the point it's up to fifty now because it will continue to expand but that's what I'd run on ... if I'm a Democrat\nBut we wish to have is a lottery for everybody where everybody wins well it's\nFunny because you know they focus on in this case young poor people um that includes most young people\nMost young people are poor and here's the law as we've pointed out yesterday too you start promising things and and people will realize well you're not going to be able to afford that for everybody and and they will draw a line\nIt will be for some so in a rising economy and people started making a little more money they're thinking of themselves well wait a minute\nI might not get that that's going to go that free stuff's going to go to somebody else but not me see that's the world we live in the ... by the way that's the world but the Democrats sounds to create ages ago this is where we are forget about\nYou I'm Out for me I'm Out from mine it's all about me so my neighbors gonna get fifty grand I'm not going to get fifty grand\nMeanwhile Eric and Gary have to pay for we have to\nPay for their building you're you're you're building a welfare wall and making us\nPay for it and if you're a first time listeners because even under the Republican tax cut Eric and Eric's taxes in my taxes went up around that's why I went to early voting today and voted straight take a Democrat [laughter]\nI'm proud of that in fact I I Want my money do I\nI Want well about ... [laughter] I told you I mean it's all about\nBlending the Democrats for my vote [laughter] that's not true I didn't do that I haven't voted yet I Am going to get out this week though a spin or we have another beautiful day\nWe yeah we had a beautiful day and and I don't I just new to the first day of early voting is not the time to\nTo uh to go out I didn't check the now the polling places\nYou normally right around the corner from me and they're not it's not there anymore I've got a goal like five six miles to write for early voting for and so I just said nope and I'm thinking Wednesday because let the first two days go by and I give any advice to a friend of mine who lives in Arlington, Texas and that is you know\nVery ... as a Republican town right where the stadium is people probably know that across the country\nAnd uh she told me she heard news reports was thank goodness I didn't go out I got reports over an hour wait yeah for early voting yeah and well the NBC story now is this fake news and then NBC stories saying that the GOP is out doing the Democrats in early voting\nRight it's NBC than obesity is a fake news or ... or or is it is a real news because they're worried and they want a winner and go out and vote a safe fake what's what if they would have the motivation for they they pulled out fake news in order to motivate gather left to get out and vote\nOr another a friend of mine in San Antonio\n\n\n\n\n\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nFun to seven nine six four or five that's F.

C. P. average on that the real clear politics average by the way it's a great website to go to for anybody out there if you never gone to a to look at you know all the latest polls across the board\nOr and but you and I looked at that and Jon Tester the Democrats you know you've you've seen consistently over the last month is up by three well the latest poll that was done there was was September twenty second a dead right and tester was up by four at that particular point in the margin of error was three point seven\nUh and you and I said you know how can you make a ... can you look at that now are cp has it as a toss up right they've they've they've got it as a as a toss up but when you see that you know because we've talked about\nWhat is what is the voter excitement level so you you

entire a capital a confirmation process\nAnd the hearings and then the ultimate confirmation a vote\nIs there anything in that particular race that was that was motivating for one side of the other than what what are the polls saying it's frustrating for me because I I actually asked you during the break\nOr they did they just go on vacation when early voting started the pollsters they don't no

I didn't sit there and I offered grade they just you know white flag the games of ought to be given the referees are out there that you need all colonialists represent what ...\nThere's a penalty there somewhere where I Am sure Fifteen yards for something we're going to get right back to the time out\n[laughter] what what what do you do with that one\nWell it's interesting because I thought to myself well you know I mean I'm ESPN going pretty much full on political oh wait no they're not Oh yes they are no they're not\nUh it's only a matter of time before we go formed political again look we already know with a you know the the fear of injuries and concussions and everything else\nJust take off the pads on the helmets just where the Jersey you know and and go out and sit down at the table or kneel down there was the case may be ... [laughter] and just a protest and\nYou know do that thing or just have your political debate we don't we don't need to play the games see this way there would be no injuries I mean unless a fight breaks out well\nMaybe that ... now ... again ... we we haven't done or update in a while but as you note is there really is no talk it's the same two or three people right right that's yeah ... you know Ninety nine point\nNine percent of the NFL players some are not kneeling right and I still think it's what we thought that it's going to be don't ask don't tell ... and the fact is neither side I knew you needed the players association of the NFL\nIs moving on this because remember how long have they been meeting for you know\nRemember we're going to me to try to come to some resolution and you've been made him perform on yeah it's Naylor don't Neal\nI mean they still have the policy but there won't be a fine there won't be any kind of penalty\nIt's don't ask don't it's don't ask don't tell what they're hoping what they're hoping is is that the players association because ... ... it's tick tick tick tick tick\nAnd the contract negotiations doubt what two and a half years away mhm well but the negotiations could be starting yeah it could be going on right now right right wow and you know a lot of ... okay hold on a second\nBecause we talked about you know how uh the the uh\nThe players association\nCould be saying look we got to go ... coming up that it could have been bad guys were starting talks right now or at least getting into the early stages of these talks and this is affecting it\nWe can't we cannot have ... down TV ratings right uh you know in another year and a half everybody has to be\nEverybody has to be on board go protest wherever you want right of course because all of a sudden these players are saying this could affect my next contract and oh well then hey protests wherever you want a look we made a deal\nUh the NFL's giving to our particular causes so we won that\nBut no like air agreed or Colin Kaepernick it doesn't matter what the deal is struck they just they they view the deal being struck\nAs a you know and and remember the air agreed views the deal being struck\nAnd not Neal and to keep ... out of the you know out of the players association that was going to decide where all that money goes to basically say no capital you're not a part of in a air agreed wants to continue kneeling there's the there's the group or the the there's the one or two\nAre out there that wish to continue kneeling no matter what\nAnd there's the other group saying what we got our cash shut up and yeah and so now there's so many ... so the NFL the owners probably said look don't ask don't tell and it's a liberal it's liberals fighting liberals and it'll eventually blow up in their faces yeah I'm Glad that we and then we can move on\nYeah I mean I I think you're I think you're probably right on it's probably you know unofficially don't ask don't tell for me it's a don't watch don't care\n[laughter] but I wouldn't let me just a thing if there is no reason to watch my team anyway because they're not colonizing\nWell yeah I mean you know my my team attempting to I I just saw the headline tempted to come back you know over the uh the Redskins this past weekend and then you know I couldn't get it done\nBut I I I\nI think of again the bigger picture of the fact that it's not just the protest driving the people what you you you've got two big things to overcome right you got to bring back the people who left because of the protest but you got to bring people back\nWho left because they they're watching other things because they're doing other things I mean that's where I think a lot of the erosion\nIs you've got to create new excitement in the NFL not just end the whole protest thing you've got to create new excitement in the broadcast presentation of the game\nAnd\nThey haven't even started on that I mean\nUh you know the are you seeing a lot of the movement to digital and and we knew that comic there's going to be more of that in the in the in the coming years\nNo doubt but that's about reaching the audience where they are but you know you put a store where the traffic is rights would you put your game your presentation is going to be where the traffic is if it's on digital if a if it's on line and that's where you're going to find that audience but you've also got to change and I think that will help change the presentation of the game\nBut that's something nobody is focusing on right now because they can't get through you know\nThis is even if it's just a handful players if it's making the news it's like you know come on guys it's time to get back to football\nBut you can't get there because these stories still make the news\nThat's the you know it's it's like the left you\nLook at a uh a war and and oh Casio Cortez\nThey don't represent the majority of the uh the the rank and file Democrat out there but they're leading the party if they're making the news and they're driving motivation on the other side\nAs a result of it is a ... ... was a Tim Ryan\nYou know challenge Nancy Pelosi for for his seat and and you know we've got to get away from the identity politics and and everything else\nAnd who else said that a couple of others have said that\nUm but they can't\nBecause it's not making the noise I mean the the I guess being a more moderate Democrat if you could they would still be far left but getting away from you know the identity politics or whatever it is that's driving the far far left\nWell where where do you moderate where do you because that's not making the news that's not making the social media or that's not where the interest is by the mainstream\nMedia it's boring\nSo it's you know this this is this is all you know part of well\nAnd I mean really scrambled equate and and what you see here's what you see happening in the in in the Democratic party where you have victims and the oppressors and\nAnd as we've said this that the identity politics you continue to cut the pie of victims becomes greater but then when the number of victims becomes greater than the number of oppressors\nA must you know must become a greater or you know we've seen it a ... look ... last week you saw the was it the cycling though the women's cycling\nA champion you know the the the the mail one the biological mail one and\nThe female came out and said it was the the two females that are are one of the females that came in like third place she goes this is ridiculous this was a male right\nAnd he is gone crazy stating the bigotry and the intolerance and right and and and and and all that 'cause I Know you're a you know you're a man you're not a woman so that's the debate that goes on and so as we said the feminist up today the ... the old time feminist wish to protest is\nThe new time that the new feminist do not want to protest this but you destroy feminism as we said all along\nThe feminists have now become the oppressors thinking about this did you ever think that the feminist would become the oppressors of\nLiberals right now the feminist the feminist movement this is how insane\nIt is and what you have here is in the in the NFL you of Eric read\nYou know a Malcolm you know Malcolm Jenkins was part of the group that agreed that okay uh the owners are going to give a hundred you know a hundred million dollars for the for the organizations that we wish to give money to\nTo help make racism less mhm okay fine All right we will we agree that we're not going to Neal anymore well\nNow he is viewed by air agreed and Capra Nick as\nThe oppressor he is a Neal colonialist right he's a sellout right because the whole the the real thing is with a capital or a read\nThey don't want a deal no they want to be able to scream oppression so\nSo the victims some of the victims now that we're perceived as the victims here in the NFL or those in the NFL standing up for who they perceive the victims war\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top ... because they have decided that they will negotiate to try to make things better\nThat's the thing that gets to watch yeah somebody had a meeting on yes okay what should we do I know I get a blood test and you know but the DNA nobody stood up

the tactics by the left on immigration work against them by and large the American people stand with\nThe current president on immigration in general the numbers start to change when you talk about actually building a wall or how to enforce or or this but in general\nPeople the majority of people in the U.S or against illegal immigration\n\nEnd up since ... story I Want to play this audio from uh the the view and it starts with the ... and then goes into making McCain as they get into a discussion about this and a Meghan McCain pretty good in this area\nIt's heartbreaking not gotten to the states and there was a young girl that collapses arms from heat exhaustion so I always approached this from that humanity first as just a human being and that's what everyone is really is an immigrant yes somewhere\nWhich is part of my problem with the wife and other things that we all live in the end and nation of immigrants obviously yes through proper legal channeled my problem right now going forward as I thought a lot of time in town halls across the country and let me tell you even going back to that age\nThere was this rumor on the Internet I have an international superhighway immigrants that we're going to come through America up through a on a Canada and that was something that literally my father\nHad to say that's not happening it's not happening and so when you see these images there is\nA conservative fee for dream and I guess in the mid term elections because this is exactly what conservatives think people on the last one to have happen over the country I'm not saying not accepting refugees and not paying not accept the legal immigration what what a lot of people on a lot to say no one on the table is the one open borders and no consequences\nAll I Would I Do wish I wish that the then the people on the right what tell the truth about what's really happening and immigration because the largest number of undocumented his name not telling you know I think people in the right answer right here on the right but I'm not talking about your personal life and I don't think I\nI I'm more extreme on that issue then I think that I think people realize I come from a border said and I think when you hear stories like ... ... ... ... who was shot and killed by an immigrant who is in a a a a in San Francisco which is one of the ... states where you can go at their valve that\nAnd they are saying hey shot and killed sanctuary but let me just say this on your cat\nForty one percent of undocumented immigrants are from Asia from Asia a large majority of of the link to undocumented immigrants from Sweden there from Canada they aren't on that ... and I we label on the right point that out of that always about brown and black\nProblem is by the way I don't I don't want to make this clear it's the left that keeps focusing on the brown\nThe color of the skin or the fact that it would be Central American refugees and it's the left that dust it the right doesn't know know the right looks at it and the right to know either you're here legally or you're here illegally then all the majority of people\nLook at it but they have to use it\nThey have to you that that ... of an opinion comes from the left well the right doesn't want illegal immigrants in the Asians or if you're you don't care about the Asians you're only care about no I don't know any I've never met one conservative\nWhen it comes to a legal immigration that same will know let's let all the all the Asians in here illegally but not the people from Central America probably overheard that\nNo my biggest concern is Canadian\n[laughter]\nWell I mean it's it's not only is the only argument that they have is race so that's the only argument that they can use that can't defend it right and McCain got into sanctuary cities you see how\nQuiet they got mhm they got quite because they understand what the the one thing that I think even though the\nThat people in the media understand is that\nThose in power in the Democratic party actually do believe in open borders that's what they want and they want open they won't reject open borders\nAnd so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign when it should be whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I asked well what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive immigration reform to anybody out there\nWould be okay what we have to do is we get it would be ... to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants that are here in this country that have been here for a significant period of time right and you and I've often said she if you make the offer\nJust see what the response would be from the left if you said okay let's give legal ... let's skip ... permanent legal status but not citizens ship or voting rights to every illegal immigrants that has been in this country since\nYesterday yeah right\nAnd from now on anybody who comes into the country illegally\nA must be sent back and that we will give you everybody who was in this country as of yesterday gets permanent legal status and what do you think the response from the Democrats would be\nWell there's they're not they can't accept that the reason they can't accept that is because now they're at the point of wanting open borders\nIt is not about that because even they realize\nThat the argument doesn't change Twenty years from now assume that we did get politically on Capitol Hill an agreement for that\nAmnesty and then\nStrong enforcement or the borders will Twenty years from now ten years from now five years from now we're still be people hear coming here illegally\nThat will be here that will that will get here and stay here for five years ten years whatever it is and the argument doesn't change so they know well forget about that we just want the open borders we just don't want to have the borders at\nAll come in and stay as long as you're one\nI I have a challenge to the Democratic party\nGet together with the coalition of Democrats and put forth a comprehensive immigration plan we always hear them say that ... but they never explain what it would be ... and they're still saying it\nI'd I'd forgot who just set of recently but I I I burst out laughing what we need is comprehensive immigration reform that would include why tell me what it would include and\nBe very ... the thing that they used to be specific and tell me or at least give our state just the major stages of it that would be effective the major\nAffective stages of your reform plan what would they be\nI think that you probably could go to the Republicans and you could get a comprehensive

right now as we've said no one one of the things you may be the you might be the most loyal Republican the most loyal Trump supporter\nA and supporting the Republican Party now\nSorry they don't care about the debt they don't care about the deficit and nobody does now it is gone\nCaring for the the the the deficit and that goes across whether you're a Trump supporter whether you're a Republican supporter whether you're never Trump conservative\nA few conservatives care about it but as you and I said Eric this this is how quickly this country has changed\nThat in twenty Fifteen the biggest\nIssue remember the establishment and the swamp were who where did that originally come from ...\nThat originally came from the fact that when Paul Ryan became speaker of the house he would not go back and change the budget that they had passed a banner had passed and there was a theory\nAnd the the the whole swamp was created out of the Republican leadership including Paul Ryan that would not control spending\nThat's ... you think about it that was one of the major points in Trump setting himself apart from other Republicans that he labeled them the swamp and said that's unacceptable we have to get spending out of control\nThat was three years ago\nWe had calls left and right we have to get the deficit under control that's why I'm going to vote for Trump that's not even a discussion anymore nope not nobody is having that discussion anymore it is gone\nAs we said when you look at Congress right now you might have is what do we say half a senator or do we take it would take to have some senator yes three age of us right [laughter] because even even if even Rand Paul showed he couldn't do it right\nWhen it came to the Medicaid right when it came to Medicaid spending in his own state\nAnd and so uh it's a ... it it doesn't matter anymore so if there was ever a time for Democrats to roll this out all the free stuff\nIt's now when the Republican Party\nDoesn't even care about deficit anymore and doesn't even care about that anymore Republicans don't care where Republicans don't care this has a much better chance over the next two years of the
