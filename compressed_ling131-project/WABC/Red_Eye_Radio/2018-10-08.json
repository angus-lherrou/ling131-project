Harry according to New York state police and it ran the park Carter restaurants parking lot all Eighteen people inside the limo including the driver were killed according to a deputy superintendent Chris Fiore ... standing nearby\nThe goal is not to convince the left or anything that's not the point the point is to convince those in the middle as we talked about last week when you saw the polling out there when you um when you when foreign people that the three witnesses afford had the three major witnesses\nOr didn't back her up well then they said oh okay well then Ford should be on there they they clearly understood you know they they were able to understand um the the fact of of due process\nAnd a presumption of innocence and so we saw that sixty percent of people at that point said OK confirm you get to sixty percent that means the vast majority you convinced the vast majority of independence and that's what you want to do and in this case it's absolutely clear and they should start they should do it on a consistent basis and promote the fact\nThat we want you know educate people educate people on on the you know not on the left exact impossible but in the great middle\nBecause it makes sense to them clearly independence understand the presumption of innocence\nClearly they understand due process under the law the polls have showed that Democrats may they just wish to ignored because what they want now is more important than anything it is about their day to day politics and so I think it's just important just a little nit picking their and then I Move on food\nGoes ... ... ... if you'd never happy with anything\nNo men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content but we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks well it's a couple\nOf things the um the the whole idea of of this there are two parts of this the political part of it\nAnd the question is is a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center you know the left or you know says there uh since Saturday evening while we're more motor motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that\nUm will look at early voter turnout as we always do but really even with the right I Know I Know the motivation on the right is there we know that\nSo that's not going to go away\nOr the motivation in the middle that's the question and that's where you win the election and so you look at the undecideds\nAnd how many of the key races right now are undecided\nOr have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that group going one way or the other end thrown out is is is the key\nSo beyond that the win at the highest court remains to be seen\nBecause we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice ... rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench it is a victory and that the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey they\nDistorted the process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president ah how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect he ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that it's an odds game\nAs we have been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart ... and his comments do us during the twenty twelve race\nAnd talking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time\nFor for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart the answer was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support of John Roberts Neil Gorsuch\nOr Brett Kavanaugh then through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get\nIts always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect or if that's going to happen or for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will\nBe key in those cases but we'll see how he decides them and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean if what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely all agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about\nA true construction as some and by the way when we talked about remember what was that the or was it the location device the location of ice on the cars\nAre about ... what was the case that everybody has a cell tower two was the ... for everybody where everybody said we're we're especially the never Trump first came out and said said oh you did you see he started with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge mhm\nAnd then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court uh and and the Gorsuch that actually use the Scalia ruling\nA you know Scalia was probably the ... the the most\nConstruction is judge of of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court has a has a has has done Clarence Thomas always is not always a construction right Clarence Thomas will a judge based on at times based on what he views\nAs a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that's up for the legislature to decide to meet is these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the constitution said does it say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda\nRight so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably got a a a Scalia was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent\nJust doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that\nYou have a a you know you have a cabin on that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least a for me on on the ... on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare\nRight do you ... and and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about the greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't a\nA roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you when I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\n\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party\nOr I think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican\nParty fought they they were uh\nI I Will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump per se but\nTo see it in action and to see them look to see the debate points that they were bringing up\nTo see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset\nOf due process the mindset of a a presumption of innocence this stereotyping but at the convenience all women are to believe\nUnless you're deal with those type of woman over there by the way to one of the stories I saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I've thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started a blaming of Eddie and the case if he well wait a minute I thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case that too many holds well that's the whole point that the\n... so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is they're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in double fulfilled their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them\nThey're all over the place on their opinions as their opinions don't ... their opinions on their gold post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left\nAnd them and not just the far left what you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law reject a presumption of innocence\nDot com and enter key word jobs that's W ABC Radio dot com ...

firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nYou know it's a radio studio in a radio show but there is no persons and yeah but we're doing the show yeah yeah yeah I\nKnow but but but but you're not studio yeah but we're the people are you and I really wish that they would go in that direction because then we want to be able to tell anybody that we don't have to pay a property taxes because property\nIsn't a person my house is very lazy ... won't pay its taxes right it won't clean itself up either it ... it was a dumb argument because as\nWe know a a corporation is is a ... an infrastructure that is that is set up it's a\nIt's it's a policy it's a list rules that is set up by the government and its to control what paintball ... so of course corporations aren't people nobody was ever making that case it's the people inside that represent\nThat company and their stock holders that have the same free speech rights as anybody else and and that's what the Supreme Court eventually you know had that you know it came out and said but that was her first attempt\nTo get rid of freedom of speech we now know that the less wishes to get richer rid of freedom of speech\nAnd wishes to use the power of the government to punish you and destroy your life to do that we know that I mean no that's not even debatable anymore when we talked about the first amendment we can look at freedom of religion and the bakery and artistic expression and all that that's going on right now\nAnd the left is again that individual rights\nOf I get to choose you know how I Wish to express of what I you know what I Believe\nSo we've often talked about the fact that the left does not and this is the mainstream of the law does not believe in the first amendment they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion the second amendment it's obvious they don't believe in the second amendment\nThey believe it's antiquated they don't believe in due process or under the law you and I talked about this during\nAh during the uh uh uh during the whole uh uh a Ferguson case ... when you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had the president giving their opinion on it when they didn't know what happened right\nAnd we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know you've got to take each case individually if you're not then you don't believe in due process well we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have her was a political trial yes\nUh it wasn't a civil trial wasn't day it wasn't a a a a criminal trial by many aspects of a real trial were there you're under oh\nMhm and you can be you can go to jail it was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not be a criminal trial or civil trial but it was a trial where many of the enforcement of a trial\nA ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail for that\nAnd they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption\nOf innocence none of that mattered to them then we got to Trump winning the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore now this one when you have a ... and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nOr that are now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you've been listening to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of was the Senate well if you don't want\nSenate if you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is a legislative branch mhm and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment when you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe that the ... in the presumption\nOf innocence\nYou really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about and\nWe understand now on the show we believe that that the majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though\n... close to Seventy five percent does not but if you understand the concept of the are by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it\nYou understand why Great Britain as a house of lords in the house of commons you understand that the founding fathers of the United states\nThey wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most\nScared of was that a ... ... group a particular group of ... a a person a small\nGroup of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or presidency\nThey were scared to death\nThat power could be concentrated in one of those areas\nAnd they they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at\nThe history of the world and seen how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it\nAnd the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and when you look at it the house of representatives or you have I think fifty three house members in California\nOnly one in Wyoming why bigger population and California fewer people in a ... in Wyoming\nBoth of two senators a that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population and by region but the Senate and on and\nAnd by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years\nSo you're closer to the people more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the house of representatives would be closer to mob rule than a Senate [laughter] [laughter] but so they they but\nThey wanted it they wanted the the the Congress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country where you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state\nBecause if you had more population in a bigger state you what more representation in the house but they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have\nSome kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little states that was the reason for it the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why\nSeparation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights and that's why it was done and do things move slower yes\nBut founding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\n\nThey preferred that then mob rule\nThe reason the electoral college exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive\nBranch ... it was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power to knock congregate in one area and as we said when it comes to the bike camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house\nAnd then the Senate which is to per state which is six years so they could be more long term looking at the country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years\nAnd the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership or represents\nI'm most Mm\nFive I daresay that the vast majority of the left have no idea of I think most people I listen to our show do understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or tears to understand I don't think\nThey care about it because what they want is again a and as they often engage in in fantasy they create and there might a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day\nSo the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way\nAnd you know it's interesting because\nYou look at what happened after Trump was elected and you have people on the left you know then that at at that point start talking about uh we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment now they're excuse the point did

P. dot com slash benefit ...\nDiet diagnosed\n\nYou know you it was it was funny because they were Fox News had one of the protesters after the vote had uh they're one of their one of their anchors out there trying to find one of the protesters to talk on camera\nAnd he was walking around the crowd live excuse me are are you here to protest and they were like oh no no I'm not here to protest\nAnd then he has like a second person or a pardon me or are you here to protest and he did not have a a Mike flag identifying it as Fox News I guess it's possible they they knew it was Fox News or knew he was a reporter knew him from Fox News\nBut he did not have anything on no kept seeing Fox News no shirt no Mike flag on the microphone that said Fox News\nHe was just walking around the crowd and I I looked at my dad was watching it with my parents I said you know it's interesting in that entire crowd of protesters he's having\nTrouble finding a protest well no I I don't know if I saw the same thing that you did but I I was watching one of the reporters\nAnd I was going to different channels going around trying to interview and this was\nWhen they went to the Supreme Court building yes right and and so they're honest up an end he's watching on trying to interview when he can't find anybody I wind anybody who's there to ... nobody nobody will do it it's like well no you expect me to have an organized bought no in fact the most organized thought was a guy walked by and he said you want to talk of knowing all of a sudden you're the guy go make America great again [laughter]\n\nYou know it is and and it's it's just because you look at this look these we know that these protests are organized to a great deal it was happening during the Trump rallies in twenty sixteen we know that there was a great organization and money to a certain extent going behind a that was behind and\nDriving a lot of these protests are we know or the left is very good at that but\nThat's that's why\nYou can't find for a lot of them you really can't it's hard to I identify with them and and for most Americans that is\nYou know again the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe people are quick to you know speak out and that if there is a pollster that calls whether it's kneeling in the NFL or\nAny other as you know I Believe people should you know have the right to be heard\nBut how many people actually do it are active\nIn protest most people are not the overwhelming majority or not\nAnd in fact if you didn't have a you know a Soros organization or any or the organization or that I mean we can go back to ... you know ... they authorities\nThey they told they were equipped to tell you look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away and that was clearly organized so when it comes down to\nHow many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven and motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization I'm well we're\nWe're the Facebook crowd opposed recalls oh yeah yeah we'll answer the poll a Facebook there a one click to like buy and we share it we might retweeted\nBut the fact of the matter is is what is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives and when we go back to the poll that you brought up earlier and we we talked about last week that the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing\nTo corroborate claims from this additional background check on Kavanaugh we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent it's not Ninety percent what sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that we step back from the insanity and display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying people aren't going to react to it\nUh you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to\nAnd even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things if they believe it's going to give them political points well it just might in your state of Hawaii or California but if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think ... and and again this is a\nNot a ... analysis of facts like this is just my my gut feeling from what I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just\nGenerally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who have paid attention to this\nAnd even though they do sympathize and because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are more a more conservative was if you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation alone without cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation\nThen you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling rape and our society right well that ticked off a ton of women that I Know\nWho just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what's the thing that you always believe the woman you don't believe anything but evidence\nAnd to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark is\n... ... most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that said we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or Trump pick somebody they don't want him\nBut I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said no you don't always believe the woman you have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always lead anybody gets the evidence that you make the judgment on\nAnd yeah these senators are accusing him of being a rapist without the evidence without the evidence and in fact they're ... and being a gang rape is\nWithout the evidence of of being there they say believe all women or men or women don't tell the truth but it's a majority does it matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that ... Americans understand that they understand\nBasic fairness and\nWhen they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democratic party the mainstream of the party that are arguably has more people supporting it mhm\nNot by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote or when they see that they say\nI don't really wished to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of and and and when you find out that you know that the fact is they're the ones that burned\nDr Ford it was a Dianne Feinstein sheep burn ... the victim Chinese don't want that wouldn't T the anonymity of the victim right it was the ... who leaked it it was the Democrats right it was either find of Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or\nIt was the the the congresswoman mhm\nRight was it was it or her staff that said it had to be one of those do right\nAnd so when you look at it you ... all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief and the presumption of innocence the stereotyping the bigotry\nAll women all need to be believed all white men white men or ... white men can't and people look at this day and age and it's just like stomp it well\nI think you two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a ... this was recent history we don't have to go back and so the Democrats in the sixties recent history\nYou have in it because again\nThe same side that said we're going to stand up for women\nCalled the women who voted for Trump self massage them as they in fact the candidate\nHerself after she lost said well the problem is is that women listen to their husbands the husbands
