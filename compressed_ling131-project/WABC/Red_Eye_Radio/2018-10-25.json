Democrats and CNN Wednesday correspondent Karen king for reports\nAlready said the explosive devices were addressed a high profile figures [noise] one of the packages arrived in the mail room at the time Warner center building which housing CNN's New York bureau really isn't that they're not package was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan he blamed the recent political rhetoric [noise]\nWe need to have stability papal does\nThis suspicious package and I think it's all ... you don't have the evidence and you don't you know idea we have no idea what the evidence\nIs about who did this or why they did this I Believe was Andrew McCarthy in National Review that said look I'm I'm like you said you know you're on social media you can look and you can see that\nThere there are people on the right there were saying okay this would be a perfect thing for the left to set up the Trump Administration you said there's no evidence of that and then he goes to the New York times and writes with ... and such but the New York times is saying\nYou know when you see what they're writing they're basically saying the opposite they're coming out in stating that this is President Trump's fault mhm because of the provocative language president ... we don't know we have no idea we don't we don't know either way so you have these people sitting and this is the thing they can't figure this out\nWhere we can't be divisive what do we do well based on a lack of evidence we must blame one side and we have a complete lack of evidence that they've been involved in this because we know nothing about it\nWe do nothing except these were suspicious packages we had no idea who sent them we have no idea what the political motivation\nIs behind it we still don't know whether these were alive bombs are not Eric as you and I write have brought about when we looked at this by the way the national review also it's we just mentioned Andrew McCarthy's column but the national review had a story last uh last night that said that both the bomb and the powder were harmless than they quoted a social one ... CNN\nYeah the one side to CNN yes the one that was sent to to CNN was um [noise] uh the powder was harmless\nAnd but when you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I are looking at each other's said man you've got a parks everything these days yeah you got to be very careful ... ... it says the powder the outer right will Souder along with the bomb right that was and it\nIt was ... there's ... there's nowhere in the story or any other source that we've seen that says\nThat authorities say that the or any stores says that the a suspicious package that was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device was was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source\nRight at an early in the day the NYPD had bad that the\nUh the the uh the ... there was the the the suspected pipe bomb and another powder right mhm which one\nBecause you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice or would they suspected might be right center you know who knows\nAnd um\nBut it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both Obama and the powder are harmless were harmless and we looked at you know who they source for that which was Associated Press and Associated Press nowhere in their says yeah that the that their sources of the bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bottom was harmless or not because\nFrom what I've seen and what I read the FBI has not come out and said these were bomb no no these were allied bombs ready to go off a suspicious\nIn nature um and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been using the authorities have been used but the media spin using\nBecause for me what is the media do inevitably they bring on as they're covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert and then they look at it except they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be\nAnd and so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here so I suppose it is somebody that supports the president and the Republicans well\nYou just heard the side that you support if ... if that's found out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case then that somebody who just write the less than two weeks before a major election\nYou just hurt their chances and and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a ... and we've said this all along but there was a rush rush in collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigator's point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something\nLike this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say okay or when we find out if they were you know live bombs ... well then you know that\nWithout question was an attempt to kill these people that would end so right you go from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was they find out that none of the bombs were active\nThat none of the bombs had any potential of going off then you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things or if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic\nTo either scare these people or it was political in nature mhm it was meant just a couple of weeks before an election\nTo help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the the motivation here was to help drive an election to a a certain side mhm\nAnd at that point you would look at it and say well it's if they did this to help Trump did to help Trump\nAnd then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's ... like I said it has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about\nWhether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN\nIt going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive comments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive\nThan accusing another side or a person blaming them for something where there is a complete lack of evidence as to the motivation\nOf the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm\nNow see I'm not jumping in China and assigning to something nothing could be nothing could be more divisive so as they sit there on their high horse screaming but your devices they have committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side that it's not possible she shuts the door on that just days ago\nWell look this this is we're we we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason\nUh after Steve Sebelius was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter who's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police\nBut his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and\nNo no no\nAnd none of it's going to all of this is to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made that the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers the media elite ivory towers\nClaiming that they care about civility and they are anti divisive\nThat's what they're about and they hate the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack\nWould they complete lack of evidence to back up their claim there was no evidence of either way there's no rabbit and we may not have it for a long time and the fact is they don't see that\nNo they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack\nUnderstands how obvious it is so not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there's a will there's a again\nA we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm not much you can\nSay the only thing we can report or the the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI or they were sent to you know prominent members or or or uh or backers of the Democrats and so that's all we can\nSay that's it that's all we know about\nThat as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story that we can talk about it\nBut right now about without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was we can't assign it to anything we have no idea absolutely no idea no idea\nAnd\nSo that that's where we stand right when we find out more information we'll give you more information\n\nSo\nABC [noise]\nThere were less veterans are

you know one of the reasons that you know you and I do the kind of show that we've always done is and and and talk about the issues of whether we talk about the issues and talked about the substance

I Want you to know that I Am not that person ...\nBut that that's the point and that's the great point right there yeah it was specifically using the term crazy Democrats I'm Wondering I have used that any Democrat some\nSomeone had to have used that in some kind of feedback\nThat they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats\nNot extreme\nRight I'm not part of the extreme of my party because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal\nPolling because extreme means that you've gone full on one side and in one direction and and to a further extent\nWell no that's not what's going on it it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words\nThat's the only way that happens that's the only way those words end up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy must have appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times and they're\nIn their internal tongue and now you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race ... which means they're doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get in front of you get down to this point here\nAnd you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception of crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there is a buildup\nThat word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ads strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think at recreating a conversation that\nPeople are you know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and and portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going man\nThose Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill\nThat the actual conversation so you have to have you have to counter it with this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt but that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against the attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the things is\nIt's it's tough for anybody ... and and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage\nTo really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in in Missouri raised in many congressional races it's it's really tough because a lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded at you\nOr it each and every day\nBut you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that\nBut Holly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym during work hours which with\nAll heated rhetoric yeah an ad use that show you only thing they can make up your own and that was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well here's the thing\nIt's the same thing oh wait a minute I Wonder if you could pick me up some wine next time he goes because people go to the gym during the day\nAll the time well what's what's the people people run errands all the time\nJust assume OK just to sling right that it's it's it's on company time and it's it's well the the the state time in this case and it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on his time\nThat's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five I'm guessing\n\n\n\nWe have [noise]\nThat Philip brought his

social media uh uh some uh different a conservative Web sites have have picked it up and this is where National Review\nA wrote the article that said the pipe bomb\nOr and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out\nA at nine o nine PM from jak crow at National Review\nAnd the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right into a link to that right they link to his right so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny 'cause during our pre show me when I read it I said oh it's saying it then I read it a second time I said well no it's not saying it because what it says is a law enforcement official such tests of determine\nThat a powder found inside an envelope delivered the CNN\nAlong with a pipe bomb was harmless right\nRoute out your harmless referring to the power though that it that's the indication as the it refers to the powder not a pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stated to start to show off\nThe FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw acted lied bombs that could have gone

looking at the last time I checked Fox News about twenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages\nUh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though actually are calling them mail bombs but not having a quote you know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight\nBut these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are now picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linked him to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package sent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not\nWe don't know if the the uh the the suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story\nAccording to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has referenced and their headlined pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites are picking that up we don't know\nOutside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the sand yeah that's that's the point is that the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they it could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not using those ...\nFrom the AP
