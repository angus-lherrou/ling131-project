[noise]\n\nOn election day millions of Americans will cast their ballots many for the first time it marks the beginning of a new era an era where we proudly participate in ... at\nThe check to check your voter registrations find your polling place or get election information that they had counted down ... at the nonpartisan ... voted on aids or background\nYeah because of a single factor in this back changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime\nAnd ... for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something near levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's the natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to them maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefit\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering the test the problem with\nGetting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right then you have to go and have the blood test done and then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way are the symptoms I could look for the dummy pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for yes\nNot having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic feel will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they'd been deficient\nSo long they think the way they feel and the way they think and then we move is normal yeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health now can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\n[noise] well more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about ... half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking the ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and if you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\n... let me ask you there so when when people start supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference and they're going to know is going to make them feel better\nYeah that's probably the first thing that they'll notice as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by wellbeing I I just mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month to month a month where you you know you're get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low in and that's one of the first thing that\nAnd the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move are very similar to the closed we had for heart health are going to talk about that later but but people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun for the higher the altitude you live at the better your mode\nAnd mood improved\nIn the summertime some mood improved in the summertime and worse than in the wintertime now those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found they found that people with\nThe lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven time eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Reinhold Veit at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life\nAnd they can feel a difference when they start to supplement Ropper language she takes about a month yeah All right let me let me get this special offer because I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you've got the vitamin D at the recommended dosage the five thousand I

better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good for your pain for shipping and the shipping deals pretty good\nYeah when I approached purity I said you know

Mr bill sororities here to explain everything he's an author nutritional advocate a high level advisor purity punished by the way purity celebrating the twenty fifth anniversary and there's even a big surprise you just a few minutes so stand by bill sorority woke\nWelcome and pat our our big story today is magnesium and a special highly observable form of magnesium we're going to be telling the audience about it\nAnd purity products new product it's called Mack vantage and the Mac vantage product is going to be available the audience free you're going to be telling them about that soon but I Believe you have a list of questions you want to fire at me\nAbsolutely a bill you're on a mission to help people correct this issue we're faced with an adequate\nIn teak of magnesium seems like about half of our population\nJust doesn't get enough that means\nMillions of most of the things to do so let me read the list your magnesium does about ten things in the body will simply amaze you a spinal for energy ATP production healthy bones joins healthy heart rhythm and cardio held dopey blood pressure blood sugar managing inflammation promoting circulation sleep mood\nBill how can one middle do so much\nIt does well every cell or the body has magnesium and it and there are lots of things that robbed us of magnesium anything from and assets dire addicts even lots of calcium which competes with magnesium so the more calcium you and take the more net magnesium you need it\nIt's kind of missing from our diets was there a hundred years ago before we use phosphate fertilizers and so we're to fish it and uh we're paying the price for it we can get it back but the problem is dietary supplements\nLoaded with magnesium aren't very absorb a ball and so now we have a little breakthrough in Maggie vantage from purity products magnesium ... what it means is\nThey wonderful magnesium ions combined with ... and amino acids so it's ... and its buffered and it's easy to take and it's highly absorb mobile and we're going to be telling the audience more about it\nBut of course we need it we have to have it for life ... we're not getting it they've fortified the foods out of what's missing but they can't do magnesium it's very bulky in fact he can't get it in multi vitamins and sufficient amount\nSo that's why purity products but they're twenty fifth anniversary make vantage their new product you get to try it for free will tell you about that and just a moment\nYou don't build behind the media loves magnesium I mean the New York post declares magnesium is one of the four blinded means or minerals that everybody should be cheeky and we we saw the famous um\nFramingham study to a January twenty four do you know big meta analysis and here's here's the gist of it magnesium Indy cars associated with the hills the cardio vascular system in healthy arteries too so we love there's a big deal but bill\nMost magnesium people buying the source is the cheap stuff you've teamed up with purity products and today you're debuting a free bottle of may managed them advantage gets it right and just to yeah just to simple tablets it's so easy your parents in these super\n... magnesium ... white can eat and also a little bit as you can find him a deep to talked about this breakthrough formula manage from Judy punished why do you like it so much\nI like it 'cause it's highly observable that's the problem I like it because it has the right dose three hundred and fifty four milligrams\nWhen they said this on label it needs to be the elemental forms the key later the Minsk life in this case\nYou'll see magnesium ... magnesium sulfate make Newseum oxide the last part of that is the key later well here we have this life and ate the issue is is that they frequently given the\nTotal amount not just the elemental magnesium and so this is full three hundred and fifty milligrams of elemental magnesium and it's combined with vitamin D that helps you utilize it better\nAnd of course for on or on his little mineral you just give about three milligrams of it and it tends to maintain Iowa levels of minerals particularly magnesium and so\nWe we it's a normal lives are so we want to have it in their this wonderful co factors that go along with a course this wonderful highly observable bio available form\nOf magnesium and I can just tell you today if you're a showing any of the symptoms and signs all of these things that they're just a long list of issues that go on with us probably every day the list is long\nAnd I'm reading from a journal highly regrettable that the deficiency of such an inexpensive\nLow toxicity new ... you know they're even talking about\nYeah vitamin D one it was the first vitamin that was discovered you know you can't use vitamin B. one if it don't absent magnesium low gastric gas it unique magnesium to make the stomach as such so you can digest better so let's just go the list is on and on and on\nWe tend to accumulate iron and we tend to lose magnesium as we age in our brain that causes all kinds of other issues\nYou know let me let me let me jump in on that one too because you know it's just that wasn't enough as men and women aged guys love magnesium ... with the testosterone in women look the rule the pleasing boom males to do I have that right\nYou've got that right and we need magnesium to make our phones so the calcium makes the calcium crystallize this and so it makes it kind of a heart brittle bone you need to make is in\nThe late in between the calcium so that your phone has flexibility and that's really important we lean on our hip joint we lean and so we need flexibility in our bones in it you get that from magnesium highly important\nDon't you'll be the Washington Post reported on June tenth ...

Eighteen percent bio availability versus just four percent\nFor the cheaper magnesium so more magnesium fewer pills more species you build your joke around with this new ... formula it kind of makes the the old fashioned magnesium formulas journalists and we're going to ... today to explain all that\nWell I can hear the skeptics they're wondering about listen I Know you can get magnesium out of your day you're asking can you do it that way\nWell if you eat a lot of green leafy vegetables like a whole head of lettuce and that won't get you there either and and nuts and whole grains but it's impossible to get there without a supplement 'cause you need this bulky magnesium and that you need a lot of it a lot more ended up a very rich diets had a lot of calcium and\nSo you need more magnesium more than you can get out of your diet which is why we're having our\nOur uh this show today and of course you may think well I just go to the doctor he'll do a blood test and you know

yourself\nHow can better nutrition improve my life Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard thank you so much for joining us today and I just\nWant to ask you I have so many questions about balance of nature I don't even know where to start how you it's great to be here again Hi Laura good to be back I'm very curious as to how\nThey can actually be a product on the market that's nothing but fruits and vegetables with absolutely nothing else in it how in the world can this be life changing and where did you get the idea for it and how did you know which fruits and vegetables to actually select\nFor the product balance of nature\nWhat started out I studied in Russia for several years and while I was there I started seeing the need for nutrition more and more and when I returned back to my practice in the United states\nYou can do all that but at the end of the day is always the body that cures itself bully people who call into the office all calls to record it and we just ask permission to share it that's\nWhere the success stories come from nothing\nNothing that we solicited I'd love to hear from some people who have ordered at taking it and seen results in their lines\nHell are you there yes Hi there Hi there\nHi how you doing this or the hours\nYeah this is Susan nice under Howard how are you\nBy dark I there are great high there fail or we're so glad you called in today to tell us how balance of nature has changed your life\nOh yes done or it's really a I'm a firm believer either saying to one of the girls that I'm a firm believer that God put us on this earth with all we needed to keep us healthy in the wealthy and all of that\nAnd uh and to me it's a it's in the air it's a you know the fruit and vegetables and somehow we got away from that and the pharmaceutical took over and now we're back to fruit and vegetables again and and I think it's the best thing in the world\n[laughter] ... what is the um the good positive side effects um have you experienced from taking balance of nature\nWell I feel good and er you know I just I put forty is in a New York city fire department and I didn't expect to make it past sixty and I\nJust turned Seventy nine and a in September so uh yeah and I've been thinking about some nature for a while and ah [noise]\nA ball for that is to take these smoothies my kids had me taking these movies and and that they were good you know but ah [noise] ah so to try to balance of nature sounds you know and the people on that or give testimonials they're\nVery sincere you can tell their uh you know there it's really help them a lot and it's helped me I mean like I say I'm a I go to the gym three times a week and a and I stay healthy and my dog keeps me or keep me up in the area sleeping\nRight now [laughter] and uh yeah it's a I just feel\nRelatively good the you know for my age and [noise]\nForty isn't FDA at all I did take it's toll can tell you that oh but that I Try to go or is it to the gym three times a week and I take the ballots are nature faithfully and uh so far so good I've lived long enough to see my two great grandchildren\nWow that's a live I\nDied I Survived nine eleven wow and uh I got ... I got the lung cancer from nine eleven from ground zero hours down there for seven months I was in West street commander and are they took it out in two thousand ten and the\nYou know I should be out of the woods right now so everything is a good everything's a grave you know\nDr Howard do you think that there is any\nCorrelation between the fact that ...\nAn eighty years old he's a cancer survivor he's taking\nYou know I didn't say to you know he's in a while you know your nine year down right All right Dr ... the\nSound like you're thirty now so that's a good thing is there any thing Dr Howard that you think that might be a a a reason why he's been able to kick the cancer and also go to the gym three times a week in the great grandchildren with\nThe kind of lifestyle he had being a firefighter just balance of nature help in that way\nWell sure and I don't know if a ... bill how long have you been taking bounce image I'm not sure\nOh for ... or ... several years off you know oh yeah yeah and it's been a I can really say\nThat I've heard you know you can't put your finger right everything but I feel generally I feel good\nGrades and then I Would say yes it's been several years is a part of\nA part of your chemistry it's been a help in in ... kicking those\nBut again we go back to the triads I don't know if they talk to you about that try to help that triangle of the physical part of health the mental emotional spiritual part of health and the nutritional\nAnd you you have mastered some of those other areas that have helped you through this because I Know this because I've talked to fill before and and I I Love his books he's written some books to be able to shed some of his some of his stress and and hardship inside of him he's written it in a book\nAnd those books are wonderful my I tell you what my father was a fireman\nAnd um and he he actually died of effects of being a fireman and um and so still was kind enough to send out the a couple of books to my mother was a gracious note in\nShe loved those we hadn't left family he would be in her room and all of that in the house laughing all to herself in there and I knew she was reading your book [laughter] yes [laughter]\nWell you know I wrote the first book because like you said dark that things are bothering me that and I didn't even realize that I was like the press I was division commander in Brooklyn for uh twelve years\nAnd from Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand one right before nine eleven\nWe lost twenty four guys in a line of duty in my job and a twenty of them were good friends of mine and guys that I worked with ... and it was really getting to me and I didn't even realize it but once I started writing about it and put it on paper\nI it they're out of my mind that didn't have to think about them anymore and I'll talk to people who've outer it's Henri what but uh I don't have to think about it so that's why I started writing the books and then a publishing told me I think you've got two more books and yeah and he was right\n[laughter] and they're great\nThey really weren't ... and the thing is is it it it really supports the whole aspect of\nOf that try to help that spiritual mental emotional side is so important and and that's another part of it and put that with the chemistry and sure it's going to boost up fills the physical side just just just would boost up two sides of it it's going to boost up the third and I and that's just awesome and that and\nThese are the reasons your the reason feel that that I was inspired to do this product I didn't set out to make a product I Love being a doctor but when it when it hit me I thought I Need to do this about like you did you you need to write those books\nRight right and I had to put the first book [noise] the\nTitle of the first brokers laughter tears and muffled drums and I had a port laughter in there because I had to put some funny stuff because they were just too many tears you know\nYes yeah but it was all but I was having a depression and that was before nine eleven and that was the ten\nYears before nine eleven from they it's a Ninety Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand and one then nine eleven hit\nAnd that was like a and I was supposed to work that day I worked in the day before and uh which was my birthday September tenth\nAnd that was relieved by two of my best friend said of course was a battalion chief in my division commander and he was acting deputy that night so I was relieved at six o'clock on Monday Night\nBy dentists and a semi ... Paul who is the captain and a ... road with him because there was no place for him to work every ... every\nEvery unit was covered so when that happens in a captain is aside to work he rise with the deputy chief and that's what happened or that morning that road together and ah I never saw them again\nNow can you just give us the name of the books really quickly and I'm\nSure the first book is a laughter tears in muscle drums the second book is bringing everybody home\nWhich is a chiefs that says fondest wishes to bring everybody home and the third book is the last true hero which is like a homage to er or firefighters\nThank you for your service to New York city on sale that's just where we're beyond grateful to you never pay that back it's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature and talk about the beautiful benefits of the fruits and ... by the whole house\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's like no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today thank you it's great to be I think Eli\nProgram was sponsored by balance of nature of use expressed by the preceding ... those are the sponsor and not necessarily the opinions of Seventy seven WABC or cumulus media [noise]\nMost respected your sports Seventy seven\nDays off the line up and leave us [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd over that period of time has developed and credible pain and that continues to work because of his support his family is only fifty five and he's got young kids as a wife\nHe needs his insurance she needs to work he's got to keep on working even with his cancer Smothers static stage for his terrible pain terrible pain he cannot sleep all night you can not sleep and yet he wakes up in the morning and goes to work every day\nAnd I saw him he had just come from work he come with his wife and his children\nTo meet about what was going on\nAnd like\nMost every patient icy and this is why I Can't see the talk on the radio or talk on the phone about a specific case of Missouri oh Dr lead them to have this what should I Do\nMost times the patient doesn't even know the details the patient doesn't even know what's been excluded the patient doesn't even know the test they never got the patient doesn't even though the cancer marker and this man's a perfect case has had terrible terrible intractable pain you went to super super famous hospital all\nHe was seen by one of the super duper Campbell doctors and Everytime he sees a doctor he tells the doctor I got this terrible pain that can barely work I'm up all night with pain and suffering like a dog and I go to work and I go home and I couldn't sleep and she gives them more chemo\nAnd she gives them more chemo and more chemo and more chemo and more chemo and more chemo\nAnd she tells him well maybe it's time to go on hospice though if you look at this man he's running a restaurant one of the fanciest restaurants these functional he takes care of his family is loved ones is only fifty five years old\nAnd he comes to me one of a radio listener like you and that's why I say listeners save lives and it's true that listeners can\nSave lives and help lives and change lives you can do that you can truly do that and you did it for this man and he came to me about two weeks ago just two weeks I remember he's had for most of the year\nThis terrible pain is getting worse and worse and worse it's going to came all the fancy hospital the pain is getting worse and he says what the doctor would only if you if you do other tasks of Dutch there's no no no we don't do any other tests will just keep on giving your chemo\n... came all the doctors answer is always came ... woman doctor the woman soccer or it's always ... came all the answers always came I got this came all got pain came well it's not working\nAnd he came to me and we got the documents and for the first time\nSomeone went over the documents explain to him\nThat his cancer has been growing for a year is that this came up\nFor a year and three quarters of the year of documents to begin with every test showed the cancers grow it\n[noise] so why would it be taken the chemo if their cancers growing why cancers growing why would you take the chemo the cancer is not responding what's the purpose of chemo the purpose of chemo is to fight the cancer ride what is came up what came out as a kind of poison chemotherapy is a kind of poison that goes in the body\nAnd that is supposed to fight the cancer more than it fights the body\nWell this is Matt and hasn't fought the cancer at all the cancer keeps on growing he has neuropathy as pains in his hands has pains in his feet is damage to his bone marrow and he has this terrible pain and she ignores the pain\nAnd find that come in and he comes to me finally makes a point many calls and sees me and I examined him make over the records and I say you most likely have this terrible nodule cancer that has spread to either to the shoulder an area that's affecting the shoulder\nAnd we can find it and treated and most likely make the pain go away\nAnd remember he's leaving one of the biggest super duper poop or places and\nSometimes patients are afraid to leave their super duper place even if the treatments that working even if it's costing ... cost of that on average America ten thousand dollars a month and some of these super duper places it's much more than that\nHe's already spent a quarter million dollars of his money in your money in my money and everyone's Monday quarter million dollars a money\nIt hasn't helped him pains wars he's up all night to camp can barely function\nAnd he's afraid to leave well why should they be afraid to leave there is no reason to be afraid to leave a super duper place if they're not performing\nLike a football team if they give the quarterback can't make touchdowns\nWhat happens is out the door while the super duper poop or hospital can't solve the problem\nThey're out the door and the patient left and they finally left and he gave up he finally gave up it wasn't so easy for him he felt they were an intimate bond he felt there was an intimate bond between the hospital and the patient with a patient was loyal to the to the hospital the problem was the hospital wasn't loyal to the patient\nThey kept on on giving him came about when I was working years having all the side effects from the chemo the pain was getting worse the bills were getting higher the cancer was growing and they weren't telling him he never had a cancer marker a PET scan with help tell him exactly where the cancer is it would help show him\nIf they're super duper chemo isn't working well he really probably knew the super duper chemo wasn't working because the pain was getting worse and it was losing weight and he was suffering\nAnd yet he and the doctor never had an honest discussion they never had a serious discussion they never had an honest discussion\nBand they never did cancer markers and so for many cancers as markers are simple blood test that show\nWhether or not the cancers responding or not at that place they never did cancer markers because they don't want the patient to know the cancers growing they didn't do a PET scan I Believe because I don't want the patient to know the cancers growing they never did the cancer markers\nBecause they don't want the patient to know the cancers growing they did all the chemo\nBut they never did that test showed that the cancer was growing\nHe

and I could tell you I see so many patients with cancer cancer pain that are suffering unnecessarily\nBecause their doctors never send them to Thirteen eighty four Broadway Dr Lederman to find the cause of the pain\nSo for this man just about eight days ago we saw him\nDiagnosed him he trusted me enough to say okay I'm going to give my trust you I said look we can start if I don't perform if I don't succeed then you can walk away you shouldn't stay with me if I don't do what you want which is to get you better\nWe found the cancer and the Glenn oh it would make\nA mold other body all

but no one was listening\nSo we're attacking the cancer with out removing the body there is no physical cutting and bleeding there's none of that stuff\nAre were work is pin point treatment like a tire success rate is very very high anti came to me actually came to me a year ago and this man is filled with a lot of lessons as a teacher but he has a lot of lessons if you only want to listen to number one of which is\nYou don't have to have surgery and cut off part of your face which I talked about earlier the shop cutting off his cheek he doesn't want to that but she cut off and many cancers are of the nose in the ears and mouth eyes\nSo many people are never told the dermatologist never tell their patients hey you can go to the doctor Lederman non invasive treatment they never hear that\nYou just heard something that most patients are never told is that all you ought to have surgery to remove part of your cheek well\nHe was smart I Believe you came here I saw him I offer them all the options we treated him and his cancer is gone a year later it's gone there's no cancer left it's gone\nAnd that was about a year ago treated him and his cancers Gardasil gone and during that year he had a workout is already out of domino pain he had a scan and they found a mass on his kidney\nAnd well who's a doctor who operates on the kidney is your ... your ... so the doctors saw

urologists was gonna cut out his kidney and the ... pretty smart is a teacher is already already hard a pretty good example of his face\nAnd decided to come to me and I met with him and we've reviewed

us have to kidneys and they were going to remove half of his functioning kidney capacity\nBut I ... I take 'em in the hospital open up his body cut out the kid and the and that was it\nAnd the patient asked me well what are my choices is that Dr Lederman I like what you did for my face what can you do today\n[noise] and they said well for me number one I wouldn't remove my kidney without proof of its cancer I were to remove my kidney anyway unless you know that was the last thing in the world\nI said we can do a biopsy because here radio ushered in New York I Believe in proving things a biopsy of the kidney is easy it's safe it takes a few minutes it's painless as took a tiny little needle in psych outs themselves and you have an answer\nAnd I told him about ten percent of the time people like you like him that I see\nI don't even have cancer the radiologist says well it's cancer but it's not really cancer they figure it looks like cancer\nAnd the urologist wants to cut out the kidney but it's not cancer what do you do if the euro just cuts out your kidney and then the next day the euro destruction or hospital room and say Hi Mr Jones\nHave good news for you you didn't have cancer\nWell\nThinking patient wouldn't even been there but the thing in ... said hey Dr you cut out my
