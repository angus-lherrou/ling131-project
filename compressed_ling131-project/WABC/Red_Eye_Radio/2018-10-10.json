it seems it seems that\nThe media was jumping on this ... immediately in fact who was it was at MSNBC or CNN\nOr somebody who's making the thing while she's out because of the cabinet stuff and it was like yeah come round right right I mean I maybe I saw that on social media that's where I ...\nI don't I don't want to die to anybody who didn't make that statement right right well I Believe I saw that on Twitter ... and and I can't remember who did it because they you know Twitter flies by so quickly but they were just pounded out immediately that oh she's quitting because Kavanaugh is going to be a Supreme Court\nA justice apparently this has been in the works a uh a while and it seems to to be right now\nThat most people really have no idea but they sense that she only wanted to be there for two years because she's staying until the end of the year which means\nShe's been there two years and by the way that happens quite frequently get an administration somebody will come in put in two years get you go in and they they want to move on to something else everybody is is trying to predict what she's going to do whether she's going to run for president\nUh and I liked the you know the uh the scenario that that uh she's out\nOr you know there and what was the scenario all I Know it's just an aerial had had\nUm panic is going to run and twenty twenty ... gonna be the veep it it it it a death no it no [laughter] it ended with Jeff Sessions or you know a a you know being out of a ... of\nBeing attorney general I ... I don't sorts of conspiracy theories we looked at it and say well we'll wait and see we don't really deal with conspiracy theories here right or a you know she she did good I mean she was if you look at one of\nThe people that he brought in early that actually worked out she was one of the few\nYeah well and I think she goes out on a strong note I you know is absolutely a few ah ... anything could happen in the next three months but I don't I don't think it's going to change the demeanor\nAnd uh and and the fortitude of of someone like of Nikki Haley if you listen to her words at you and if you live if you look at a you know her positions are and how how strong she's been for the president\nA that is\nThat is a very unique position to be in for its especially for this particular president who's not afraid to speak his mind and himself I think has been very strong we look at his un speech recently\nAnd I think he ... he did a great job uh and and he's been very clear on his positions or if\nYou look at a having a Michael Bolton a at [laughter] John both of us are not Michael Bolton is not there yet what oh man I\nLove the warm so bad remake [laughter] and the wife passed away [laughter] John Bolton I by the way I'm Michael Bolton could be a a it could be a good national security advisor\nHe would scare a lot of people [laughter] oh so you're a singer not add on debt not the guy from office space or no is there a Michael Bolden from office space yeah that was his member that was oh it was already named ... ... I didn't watch office space\nOh no no no no no you know what I'm thinking I'm thinking the off the office no I'm not a hundred percent I don't know I don't know how far off yes his face to face the movie\nRight the yeah the iconic movie the iconic movie yeah I don't get it out safely today more coffee please yeah okay but if you have John Bolton by ... I don't know if I can agree with you I Know I Know maybe I should have brought booze\nOr but if you have John Bolton by your side is national security advisor if you have a Nikki Haley in places you in the bathroom my question is how do you feel Nikki Haley shoes I Know what you an ambassador and it's\nOne of those um odd jobs where you know you're kind of just basically in this case your the the mouthpiece for the president you're going to you're going to go out to the world to the other nations and you're going to\nI'm a ... advised them as to what the policy is we're going to be but in this scenario where you have a John Bolton and you have a my palm pay of\nDid I get that one right um the [laughter] the strength I think right now of this cabinet and staff\nOr it and and I put Nikki Haley and there\nIs is is right now I mean and and we could maybe in the first year you could go in and you could poke holes and and people did with Tillerson a as secretary of state saying he's not the right guy in alternately he wasn't but\nIf you look at it right now where it's set up and I'm Talking about national security wise and where we are with countries like Iran North Korea\nUh and and and even some of our um you know Saudi Arabia you know the president's stance on the Saudis recently um I think it requires somebody of significance strength I'm not saying there's not anyone there\nWhat it's going to have to be somebody who has that strength that can go to the un and do what you I I don't mean to downplay the importance of the UN ambassador but it is somebody who can if if you're looking for quality mhm you're you're not necessarily looking for\nA a quality of the normal presidential spokesperson ... and and I'm Talking about Sarah Sanders ... I'm Talking about the normal one where you know if you look at all the way you know the the ... the presidential spokespeople over the last you know just like what Twenty years if you look at them and you just said because remember\nTheir their parenting what the administration wants their pare down their message right and\nAnd the thing that made Sarah Sanders how can be so great is she is directed in your face and that is actually the way and and you want to project the image of the president of the United states that you represent mhm so imagery of being able to take what the president says yes\nAnd speak at the un with that same kind of force that she did is what you're looking for and I can't tell you because I haven't seen\nYou know I I really haven't seen in that setting any of the the people that I hear so far maybe up or I've never see them I've never witnessed them\nSpeaking in that particular matter one thing that I wanted to say about a a Nikki Haley though\nUh and and just shows you how\nThe the the mainstream media is just nuts\nBecause they would always ask her and I love this question it rarely is asked to anybody who serves in a Democrat presidents or a cabinet and but\nWell what would you disagree with the president how do you deal with it of course I'm going to disagree with the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes right so of course we're going to have differences but if we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve in\nIt's like you arrive ... one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration is because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job your job is to\n... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with you and I as we've been talk show hosts too long we just we couldn't we'd probably couldn't do that\nOr we will get frustrated that are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're\nA UN ambassador you have to\nYou have you know the national security advisor to be effective in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who is mimicking or or relaying a mess and and Bolton said the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a\nFor the coming days and the foreseeable future at least I Would say over

I mean you talk about the the the destruction\nThat they are storm does and and some of the things I guess if you've never been in the situation that you might not know I have never been through a hurricane I've been through some tornadoes\nIn my life but I've never been to a hurricane so ah especially for those people who may be new to that area I think about you know the area of a ... where there might be a a military personnel\nAre who are there you know a temporarily or or maybe are new to that area a certainly you want to heed the warnings\nIf you've never been through that and even if you have I was watching um a video on\nWhat they call the waffle house index and FEMA looks at that are they going through because waffle houses open twenty four seven uh but if they decided to close those stores they know\nOr that and that it is going to be a bad storm they know what is going to be a bad in that particular area and so that's that's kind of one of the\nUm site notes to the story if you will are into this news is that everyone seems to be taking this very seriously as they should\nAnd anyone that isn't the path of hurricane Michael needs to heed the warnings from uh the national\nUh authorities as well as a especially the local and state authorities in this case as you mentioned John truck\nComing up a little bit later on this hour we will chat with him a ... a last hour when we talk to Tom hale he was talking about incredible storm surge are going to see anywhere you know when you're talking about a ... anywhere in that area where it's going to hit you know near Panama City Florida\nYou know probably going dozens of miles each way right you're talking anywhere between eight and fourteen foot storm surge yes which is extremely extremely dangerous and now being a a category for a they expected to drop a you know right in the the Florida area\nUp to a a you know a foot of uh of rain and and even as you get inland because right now it's going north and it's really interesting to watch this because it's going straight northern at some point it's going to start\nOr it's going to start heading east because it does take I mean if you if you look at it uh it does almost take a forty five degree angle if you're looking at the cone and that Cohen ... you think about it the cone of uncertainty as they call it\nHas been extremely consistent over the last couple of days if you noticed that it really hasn't moved that ... it's almost as if they know whatever that that front is that you know keeping it down you know to the southeastern poor part of the uh United States\nMust be pretty strong because that hasn't changed at all and the track is still the same word cuts\nRight through a you know the the middle of um of uh of Georgia and hit the southeastern part of a of Alabama then cuts right through a Georgia and then South Carolina in the north Carolina and then out to uh to the uh the ocean it will move pretty fast\nBecause it will be by by friday morning it will be really it will be off shore\nOf the of of uh of North Carolina actually a little bit north east of North Carolina but you know they'd been just pounded with the rain and\nAh as a a Tom told us last hour they could expect three inches five inches who really knows you don't know I mean it's so unpredictable you know we ... I I think about yesterday where they said okay we're going to ... a little bit of rain and it just poured here so yeah we\nHave in fact we had to some some flooding just based on on rain\nRight I'm In our area so you think you think of when it's when it's a hurricane and then through that then you know downgrades to a tropical storm but who really knows in what areas how much rain or you're you're going to get but an extremely extremely a dangerous storm now the update or here at uh one am central\nA to a um an eastern time a hurricane Michael now a category for yeah strangely dangerous\nA hurricane now headed are really the bulls eye right now and I don't believe that has changed at all we'll find out a little bit here when we talk to me the meteorologist John trout but right you know heading towards\nPanama City yeah when you when you when you look back on the ... I guess\nThe history of a major hurricanes or there will be names that that that the rise to the top there is no doubt based on what we know about Michael already that in the years to come they will look back on on Michael was one of those again historic storms\nAre based on the size of it and and the amount of damage it's caused a so we'll be following this and we'll talk to leave your while just John trout are later this hour a day and get his take on this and and the latest information that he has\nAnd of course we multitask here on the show on a consistent basis and and one of the things now just a\nLittle less than four weeks before election day is\nAfter the Kavanaugh hearings you know what are the polls doing and you and I really looking forward to what we're going to see a over the next to a couple of days by the time we get to you know this Friday and we start seeing polls from the actual\nConfirmation a vote and Collins speech and and how does that affect certain races out there uh we do have a a a few new polls out there\nAre ... and again it just it we don't we don't believe that there are any absolutes when it comes to polling\nBut it does can give you an idea or at least a snapshot as to what's going on up looking at the Nevada Senate race right a Jacky Rosen the Democrat against a Dean Heller of the ... Republican\nWhere a in of all the previous polls that were done in September\nA Rosen was up ah early ah one poll done in in the early September a she was up by one the gravest poll a mid September she was up by two or by the time the CNN poll came and these are all likely voter polls are\nFrom nine twenty five to nine twenty nine she was up for ... well the latest NBC News ... poll done nine thirty ten three\nSo you're really through all the hearings at that point a again five hundred and Seventy four likely voters\nOr however has no up by two now all of these really are in the margin of error even when she was in the lead mhm so it's all in the margin of error but if you wish to look at it from one poll to another and again they're sampling can be different\nBut you ... what you see is a a six point swing in that particular race still in the margin of error\nBut still we ... what we're looking for is any type of momentum or any type of uh I I think a a change in the polls movement in the polls which could be perceived to be based on the excitement level\nOf people wanting to go out and vote\nRight we're likely voter in these polls would say you know a likely voter who said yeah I'm I'm a likely voter and and I'm fifty percent sure that I'm going to go out and vote this time words I'm going out and I'm voting sure and somehow that that ends up changing the the polls removing it\nOr in another direction so uh that one in Nevada you know you and I were looking at other polls of of other polls\nAre out there um\nWhat what's interesting is looking I was looking at the Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott and if you look at that right now you have a you you've got a couple of the polls at the mercy of the average showing a Nelson up\nA two point four\nBut it really has been a if you look at it a a just a a really a tie because it's well within the margin of\nError a on a number of polls with the exception of one a Quinnipiac poll that had no sum up plus seven but you look at ah other polls here\nA Mason Dixon poll or from nine twenty four to nine twenty seven and Nelson up by one a W see t._v. poll that was\nTaken nine Seventeen to nine thirty which would have included a few days after the uh the the the Senate hearing\nUm it would that has Nelson up by one\nAll within the margin of boom way in the margin of error because of an air bubbles poses is three and a half\nAway and so it it it really is a it really is a dead heat there in Florida and I think you I think it'll be interesting to watch uh where where the where that\nGoes um I I just think that the\nThe polls between over the next few weeks everything from Kavanaugh the Capitol hearing\nA and the vote this is going to settle in and we don't know which side it motivates more doesn't motivate the Democrats to get out more due to try and hold the line on the on the Senate race and and ah ... in order to make an attempt to block Trump\n[laughter]\n\nYou know ... a year losing most of your ... are pretty much all of your ... with the president\nI wouldn't take any more\nI I just was laughing you know the the whole thing had CNN on those people that

meteorologist John ... latest on a hurricane Michael which is now hurricane for\nA you know we talked about on CNN yesterday and it was it was just a useless conversation about defining the word Martin and and all that but but it does get to the uh you know the whole thing of not being civil you know Rand Paul calling Cory Booker machine get up in the face of Congress people and\nRand Paul and his wife remember last week or a running a letter and and and state or an op ed piece in stating you know she sleeps with a gun that remember Rand Paul was attacked ... are actually in his in his yard by\nBy a neighbor and what they're saying what you know and it's coming out and saying look\nYou know what you're what you're doing you're ratcheting up the rhetoric now\nOf of complete and total instability in\nThe end the beautiful part is ... you know just ... are we a month past the the uh of a funeral John McCain right when they were talking about stability in you and I got this isn't gonna laugh\nHillary decided to get involved in it you're ready for this star I ever got Hillary by the way let us know announced Hillary is back\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nLet me ask you this because we we know that the left right now we we we know that ... whether it's Ted Cruz being in a restaurant or whether it's Mitch McConnell being at an at an airport and the mob mentality that exist now let's get a mob and to intimidate people mhm\nDo they believe that's going to be effective yes they believe it's working that's my I guess that would be not my point to ... to begin with\nThat they believe now Hillary of course when it's well established that the instability and mob mentality now exists then she jumps on board oh yeah yeah I'm going to drink I don't really know how many months later right yeah uh and\nShe's going back to the bottom but and I saw this this again is what we we talk about that they believe that that they believe it's going to be affected either they believe there's one or two things either they believe it's going to be effective\nOr they're just so so enraged they have nothing less nothing left of substance to offer the people yeah\nThey just that's the natural I guess outlet is range and get in people's face wherever\nThey are in their own private time whatever ... and what they believe that's going to intimidate\nRepublicans or conservatives and didn't really believe that you really believe if you're on the left you honestly believe oh if we do this then they'll be scared and they'll back off right do you really believe that\nThe do they believe that it's going to change the supporters of Ted Cruz\nNo oh wait wait wait wait it is it's going to further motivate them it's going to take people who might have decided or maybe just to have been sitting on the fence maybe haven't been enthusiastic about getting out and voting\nWeekday mornings before now\nThe\nWhole Seventy seven [noise]\n\nInternet radio I'm hearing from our long there are currently eight six six Ninety run I preferred Cain Michael\nNow upgraded to account for a category for hurricane heading for the coast of Florida let's\nStop and talk with meteorologist John trout about the latest morning John good\nMorning it's amazing when we talked yesterday just twenty four hours ago we had a cat\nOne storm and are moving into a cat two territory where now up to a four with maximum sustained winds at one hundred thirty miles an hour gusts even greater how do we know well those are reconnaissance aircrafts that you know a hurricane hunter aircraft go into the eye of the storm and they measure that data\nSo what are we looking at in terms of a timeline what can the people in the path of hurricane Michael expect from those of first high winds coming in all the way to the Irish English or what should we expect and when\nThis really is the calm before the storm I just did a check on the wind speed of Tallahassee, Florida and we're only looking at about Seventeen miles an hour but from here on out throughout the day today\nWe will see those wind speeds increase we could see landfall as a category for we're kinda splitting hairs though I mean we will see wins in excess of one hundred miles an hour we're talking almost a sustained a tornado here\nFolks from the mid west can appreciate the tornadoes and we're talking about not only a torn addict event but a rain event as well and possibly tornadoes spawned from this system over the next say thirty six hours or so\nWhat is the threat of storm surge and where we're will those areas the highest threat be\n[noise] we're looking at for the highest be a threat to Mexico Beach Florida to ah Keaton beach nine to Thirteen feet now that's just that wall of water that this wind pushes in couple that with high tide and we know a\nTides and those areas can range from between three and six feet depending upon where you are on the coast this water will also push a\nEric and Gary up through rivers and streams and the sloppy areas so we'll see smaller towns inundated we could even see some major highways guy ten affected not only from the flooding but the wind event is going to cause no doubt\nSome power lines down power outages a week out to breathe on roadways from a roofs ripped off of homes are talking about a very potentially catastrophic event here\nWhat time do you see it coming onshore right now\nAh right now we're still looking at the early morning hours today around eight nine AM and uh that's the actual landfall of they say why but until then from now until then anyone listening to me in that region\nOr you've got to take precautions you got to save your life and family and heed the warnings from what the officials had been mentioned it for the past twenty four hours to get out of the way this thing is a potential killer\nA meteorologist John trout and I guess we're expecting another uh update here in just a little over two hours from the national Hurricane Center\nYeah we'll get another one and by then we'll know whether\nIt should arrive as a cat three or cat for but I don't want people to split hairs on bat when we categorize tornadoes we're only talking about the wind speed we saw from Hurricane Florence or a couple of weeks ago and we saw last year from Hurricane Harvey that the category does not\nMatter as much when we're talking about flooding because only the wind speeds or part of the categories one of the things I dislike about this effort Simpson scale the real killer here is never the wind it's always the flooding people things they can't get through the roadways they can they can ride it out but ah [noise]\nThose floodwaters are very destructive very dangerous and very unpredictable\nCertainly a meteorologist a John ah trout we'll be following the story of course and and the storm a in a throughout the day and then uh it it\nHas its path continues inland and by the way what should we expect are we still on target or to see a few inches of rain for those areas in the Carolinas affected by Florence\nA little less than we talked about yesterday I had mentioned or possibly a foot of rain that's been scaled back by a couple inches but Ah yes those areas locally or could see a some a\n... foot rainfall total amounts into Georgia into the Carolinas North Carolina and again don't forget the potential for tornadoes spawn from the system\nAll right John John trapper John ... will actually asked work and uh so he'll be following this information are of course ah throughout the day but as John mentioned that you need to heed the warnings\nAnd any of the directors given by local officials and just keep in mind that the other ... gonna be a number of things that she first responders from getting to you and so that's the point a and also uh at at some point you could lose power\nOr may not be safe to drink water ah from the tap and so there are a number of things that could become extremely problematic\nAnd of course uh the officials and all of us want you to be safe and and to be able to survive this that things can be replaced the people\nYou know and it was just a fifty five minutes ago that the uh the new advisory came out from the national hurricane service on hurricane\nOr a center excuse me on hurricane a Michael the wanting him central time advisory that it was up to a strength for hurricane and ... a maximum sustained winds now a hundred and thirty miles an hour or so it is a\nStrength for hurricane yeah which is extremely dangerous and will be on on modern records the the biggest hurricane ever to hit if it stays that of or I even believe it's a three and maybe the the the biggest ever to hit their the strongest to ever write yeah the pan handle\nMore than ... in terms of the wind and John brings up a great point about those a spin off tornadoes in those areas which can also be destructive as well will follow the story and coming up next our in fact we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale and get an update from him\n[noise]\n\nShe's read on the radio on Westwood One every Jew\nI Am Dr sleeping and I've been performing pro therapy for almost Twenty years is the natural treatment

where you know you're going to have people flooding a in a storm surge being the deadliest part\nOf any storm like this are not just the winds with debris and checking out structures but the the flooding where people just make a decision to try and drive through the flooding or get through it\nUm and and that becomes deadly and medications\nAnd look even you know Tallahassee that's a little bit to inland they're expecting you know eighty mile an hour winds yeah still at that point and a and a ton of when sort of a bunch of problems\nOr could be had there as we go through a Wednesday it it uh when when it ... and it's interesting because it's still the movement is still ah from what I can see dead north of twelve miles per hour and but at some point it's going to start taking that\nAh easterly bent and then when it hits the uh the the the shoreline really at that point going um you know actually more east than north mhm and it's it you know it will hit it slows down a little bit it seems\nBecause it's seven pm Wednesday the of what would be left of the eye which would\nAt that point still be hurricane wins would be right at the uh you know the the border of Florida and southeastern uh uh excuse me south western Georgia and that point\nThen it cuts right across the middle of Georgia and then uh it continues to move or northeast coast of South Carolina\nAnd the eastern half of the eastern southern half of a of North Carolina so they've got a ton of rain there as we all know because of a Hurricane Florence but also their coastline could also be\nAffected as are also tropical storm a of a warnings\nAre especially long the the Georgia and South Carolina ... a line actually tropical storm warnings there and watches a for\nA North Carolina so we are right now there quite often you'll see tornadoes uh that that that spin off from storms like this and they can become destructive and they are and they happened very quickly\nUh the knowing and and growing up in tornado alley uh you understand that that they are the that that often there's little to no warning for those tornadoes and they become of course a a ... a separate a destructive force\nOf their own so certainly all the folks in the path of hurricane Michael ah over the next twenty four to forty eight hours heed the warnings or keep your radios on a keep batteries charged\nAnd to stay alert or coming up here in less than thirty minutes after the bottom of the hour we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale who did a great job\nAnd covering Hurricane Florence force or we talk to him earlier he also a covered a Hurricane Irma in Florida for us\nUh on red eye radio so we'll talk to him about this a new report the update from the national Hurricane Center which came across at two AM eastern\nAnd what changed here and and again what all of this means in terms of the energy behind hurricane Michael\nI it uh getting back to what we're talking about a a last hour and when we played the audio cut from Hillary Clinton sane civility is impossible until the Democrats take power again so that was recalled for instability and the interesting thing about that isn't and we've talked about you know whether it's Ted Cruz or you\nKnow in the restaurant that made a big news\nOf a uh a couple of weeks ago or Mitch McConnell are at the uh the the airport or a a Jeff Flake in the the the elevator or what's you know what's going on right now the the call number from Maxine Waters remember when Maxine Waters and she might have been really ignited that that political ...\nOf actually Democrats to like the office to write that was calling it a you know and and so we saw what happened this past weekend we saw what happened to Ted Cruz saw what happened to Mitch McConnell saw what happened to Jeff Flake\nOr the conversation on CNN yesterday it's not a mob it's just a people expressing their their uh their their their viewpoints and it's like well most of America looks at it and when they see people screaming and yelling and going into into a private place not an organized protest\nOr organized protest Americans were fine with\nYou go out and you protest and you're with tens of thousands of other people and it's a peaceful protest and that's fine Americans don't want riots Americans don't want mob rule they don't want you go they they don't uh most Americans don't approve\nOf the fact of going into a place that is not your property trespassing just to the point of harassing or a you know of some you know somebody else has happened in Ted Cruz's place but that call to harass people at ... anywhere uh\nYesterday a Rand Paul again and you know Rand Paul's wife or has been on this year for the last uh a couple of weeks talking about the instability Kentucky Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday took aim with the rhetoric employed by senator Cory Booker and others accusing them of ratcheting up the conversation\nOr to the point where unstable people could commit violence said Paul to Kentucky radio host I fear there's going to be at an assassination why\nI really worry that somebody's going to be killed and that those who are in a war ratcheting up the conversations those who are saying get in their face there have to realize that they bear some responsibility at this this elevates the violence\nThese are people that are unstable Paul says we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we are not encouraging them the violence and violence is never okay or there's never a reason\nUh to resolve things that weigh directly calling on Booker who last July told activist do get up in the face of some congresspeople Paul referenced his own uh salt at the hands of a neighbor\nAs well as last year's a baseball field shooting which Representative Steve skull east was wounded to show that unstable people can easily take things are too far and then we talk about the fact that Hillary\nTalked about you know no stability right share her call yet so you've mainstream that completely now with Hillary comes out you can't get more mainstream Democrat over the last Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability number one we talked about the fact that\nThey actually think this is an effective way to go to the actually think that politicians you know calling for it now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can have civility which is to call for instability ... which is the calls to harass people in their private life\nAnd\nI that was the first thing that hit me was was they think this is going to be effective\nBut then you get to the point of a Hillary now bringing it up where she feels comfortable saying it was Hillary's a follower she'll be as she would not take an opinion on anything if she believes that it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in her base ... we've seen that\nBefore remember when she was up in Canada yeah and she was asked about the pipeline right I'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president if\nThis is still a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on a dark and she didn't want to take a side right and so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability\nAnd and and they think about this\nSo now it's becoming mainstream in the end and wonder why instability over what what is the issue you're calling for due process you're calling for a presumption of innocence you're calling for preponderance of evidence\nYou're saying where's the evidence you're coming out because this is and we've talked about this yesterday what came out of this whole thing ah you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists and therefore you deserve no civility because of it\nWhich is of course that's\nTheir definition it's not the definition of people that believe in due process under the law people to believe in due process under the law obviously\nAre not advocating rape or sexual assault than any other crime right\n\nAnd that's the point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that is so radical that the writers taking were instability must lead and it's that simple point the belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case\nTo show the guilt to anybody and not just an allegation that is what has set off even the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in civility this is\nHow far how low\nWe always wonder we always ask the question how low will they go you know calling somebody and not see you know and and and saying that that's been for a long time but you get to the point now where they're calling for instability based on people's opinion on the other side\nThat evidence is how you judge somebody's skilled right due process should apply and all of these cases which means you look for the evidence to find somebody who's skilled

after it hits and then when it seems to\nAh get over water again is just and and that will be colder water it looks like it'll dissipate out there in the north Atlantic somewhere\nRight hurricanes often spawn tornadoes just be aware that that\nSituation is very real and those tornadoes uh you have often little to no warning or so again or if you are in the path of Michael and you are not going to get out of the way that path then make sure that you have all of the central is including batteries\nOr for a portable radio or device or and make sure that everything is charged or so that you can stay up with it and be able to hear any warnings that come across four or something like a tornado or as it was being described by Tom hale are meteorologist on this story moved again talk with him here and just a bit\nI'm Talking with him about the storm surge and the way it is a you know as he described it it's like filling up a bass up so it is not something again or if you are not familiar with this with a a storm surge and very few people are\nBased on the the ... diction models for the highest storm surge from this storm very few people on the planet has ever experience that and again we just have to repeat that that is a deadly deadly\nA danger to uh to to individuals well that may not be familiar with it and not a understand fully or what the impact is\nAnd I I never lived in in Panama City but at the looks familiar the the downtown city area and with with a lot of residences right next to the water on the bay right and\nIt reminds me of a lot of like Fort Walton Beach when when I Lived outside of Fort Walton Beach where I live actually lived in in Fort Walton Beach for a very short time but mostly in Nevada or Florida which is between Pensacola\nAnd in Fort Walton Beach and and that's in my head trying to figure out what it would be like you know when I remember sitting there right in residential the in in the city there and you could see the bay and\nI'm thinking if and that would have been a in Fort Walton Beach ... that came up you know fourteen feet what that would be like and that's what I'm trying to imagine in my head ... estimates and on and look at Pensacola or look at the uh\nPanama City in and say you're going to have a lot of flooding\nAnd and again uh we we talked about it the the houses on the beaches that are on stilts\nThey're roughly or the four of those houses and the deck roughly at ten feet\nSo if you're talking about a Thirteen or fourteen foot surge that means that inside those above the ... inside those homes you're still talking about three to four feet of water\nA and that becomes a you know I think that puts it in perspective for anyone who's even seen\nOne of those homes and I stayed in one over the summer I Can't imagine water getting that high there's a reason that they built on stilts and that the average is roughly ten feet it's because it's thought to be above the ah average storm surge\nIn in the path of a storm or you know in the average begin storm but Michael hurricane Michael is no average storm\nTalking to me they're all just Tom hale coming up at the bottom of the hour trying to get in all the other stories that are out there and they're actually\nA quite a few stories the the one that caught my attention yesterday because\nUh we really have gotten a response from the White House on this especially with the president coming out really uh yesterday in ... and Monday that a Rod Rosenstein is going to stay mhm uh you know he's she's going to be there they had the talk and everything is great then the story comes out the two senior FBI officials told\nThe bureau's top lawyer they believe the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious when he discussed secretly recording Donald Trump and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year according to sources close to a congressional investigation\nAnd an account that conflicts with the claims from Rosenstein and others the comments were either inaccurate\nBills land you're one point for nine percent now two point eight doubled right oh yeah\nYeah that's going to mean a lot of\nVery bad things in the future because of the fact that we we quit a caring I Know our our listeners and conservative friends still care about the debt and the fiscal policy of the U.S\nBut the the people in Washington don't because by and large because most Americans don't if we were all screaming about it in unison than it would be the number one concern of theirs but it's not and by the way that's on

a meteorologist Tom hale good morning Tom good morning All right what ... what do we know about a hurricane Michael at this point and when we expect another update\nOkay we should expect an update in one hour from now actually we should expect an update and a half an hour out of our yeah mhm yeah and uh and then the second question\nAnd so what is I I guess they give us the latest on that uh what do we know about what's the status of Michael right now and when do we expect Michael to hit the shore in the panhandle of Florida\nOkay well the first thing is you know normally the national weather service can be kind of conservative in regards to its own language but the national weather service or the national Hurricane Center in this case describes Michael as an extremely dangerous category for hurricane or life threatening storm surge\nHurricane force winds\nHeavy rain expected along the northeastern Gulf Coast and it's located a hundred and eighty miles to shout southwest of Panama City\nAnd it is one it is a one hundred and Seventy miles to the southwest of Appalachian coal that of course when Spain's or a hundred and thirty miles an hour and it's moving to the north at twelve miles an hour now take\nOh look at at some of the radar I'm at indications it's a if you've been watching any of the TV stations with their radar indications that shows a little bit of ... to it um and\nWhen he looks like it may be starting to make a little bit of a turn maybe one or two degrees or in the direction of Panama City\nUm and and so it's most likely going to come ashore right in between Panama City beach and down to Appalachia cola\nCallaway is a town along their port saint Joe is also along that same area as a category for and this is the official definition\nOf a category for a category for hurricanes have sustained winds of a hundred and thirty up to a hundred and fifty six miles an hour obviously Puerto Rico saw the higher end of that scale\nBut well built framed homes can will ah sustain severe damage\nAnd loss of most of their roofing and possibly some exterior walls wow trees will be snapped or uprooted and power lines down fallen trees and power lines will isolate residence and power outages will last for potentially a\nSeveral weeks a and they haven't here or possibly months now they're writing it for the worst case scenario here but uh several months was Puerto Rico's case um and most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months wow\nNow that's the definition of a category four\nYeah that's a while um and so you know what can I tell you
