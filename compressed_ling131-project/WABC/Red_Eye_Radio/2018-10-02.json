E. T. Q. U. I. P. dot com slash benefit ...\nNow back to the John ... was\nSome way [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm John ... John ...\nIs here with them and telegram intelligent and America's entry\nInto World War one the president of the United states has been given the Zimmerman Telegram and it is a fantastic plot for us in the twenty first century Mexico will attack the United states with ... with German assistance the Japanese will join in this attack\nAnd reward the Germans when successful in Europe of overwhelming the British and the French will give California to Japan and give Texas and Arizona or and New Mexico to max or to Mexico itself or allow it to happen the United states will be re partition as a result of this alliance\nThe other part that's in the room and telegram is that the Germans are going to begin on restricted or that the unrestricted warfare was always part of a German plan of aggression to intimidate the Americans that's critical because there was a war party and an anti war party in the Congress\nThe anti war party is very suspicious this telegram\nSuits the purposes of white hall of the British Empire of law at George David lord George the new prime minister out of money out of time they know that the British are are desperate and probably should be seeking peace turns or some armistice in fact the president at Christmas Nineteen sixteen into January Nineteen Seventeen\nWhat the president a Wilson was often in the headlines\nLeading a a peace idea an arbitration idea with himself as a referee so all of a sudden the referee is compromise but not yet the president is not ready to go to war he's holding back\nOne of the tests that they go through in order to convince Congress that the Germans are aggression aggressive and that the British did not concoct is is they want demonstration that the Americans had the ability to solve this code this is one of the scenes I Love more than any other than your book Thomas\nWhen a degrade knowledge of the great the crypt analysis expert in room forty who actually did part of the decoding of is there room and telegram takes an American named bell into the ... office in the ... office and allows bell or participates in belle translating that they had to demonstrate that the Americans\nHad the ability to translate it it was a theater piece Thomas it was a fiction but haul gotten away with hearts yes\nIt was as far as you're absolutely right what happened was you know when the telegram as publisher march first debate in Congress\nAnd to many um you know many many representatives and senators skeptical and say well ... where it was actually coming from and says suspicion was that this was given by Great Britain to the United states in order to bring the United states into the war and this is actually a voice in this congressional debate and this was ... absolutely true\nI'm now the Wilson Administration um then as you said I'm I'm a range is for um a Mr bell from the American embassy in London um along with whole to de crypt this telegram\nUm the evidence is that ... actually is unable to do so and than degrade takes over and do that for him\nBut then the Americans the American administration can truthfully say\nThis was captured the crypt it by an American I'm a so they wouldn't have to lie to Congress and say ah you know this this is what actually true in in in in a in a in a shallow fence um but the greater truth of course was\nIt yeah what they did either British it's called the Arab the third time they answered the question ah they answered the wrong question very and very detailed so I'll ask the right question in Iraq and in fact\nHall had constructed the ... of the telegram when it got to Mexico City a intercepting it so that they could do the code on code that and present that is if they interrupted the Mexican\nOr the Mexican reception of the a telegram what's critical here is that there was an agent network stringing between Berlin and London and New York and Washington on the Mexico City\nAnd you solve all this Thomas in one of the joys of reading your book let's go to march second the ... the roundtable dining club in New York\nOh the guest of honor that night as a man named captain guy gone and around him are a lot of pro war big deals including of course the former ambassador to a U.S ambassador to Britain Joseph ... chose\nAnd a captain gone wrong maybe is challenged is this a fraud did you do this is this your scheme and captain gone just not tell them the truth Thomas it's a joy to see him\nMislead the war party to their satisfaction people want to be convinced but gun reports to haul the Nineteen out of twenty American gentleman believe this is a fraud\nRight I mean that that that is the vet is very doubtful if if that was actually true to me it seems that\nWhen this telegrams actually published on march first Nineteen Seventeen\nOr the the debate is more well is can we take that seriously you know this this is so outrageous um um is this something to be taken seriously and you mentioned the roundtable um um dinner um how how easily these these prove this this American ... pro war party is convinced and it goes to show\n'em the telegram very quickly becomes a political tool in the United states it's really not so much about\nIs this a veritable threat I don't think many people believed that Germany and mix equal were physically capable of invading the United states and just men bring it um but for the pro war party it becomes you know yet another\nTool in their push for war a but then you also have the anti war party that dismisses this telegram is something ridiculous this can't be taken seriously this is just a\nA this is this is this is just a sign of how desperate the Germans are so um it is often has often been said that the telegram was sort of the Pearl harbor of World War one\nAnd my argument is no no it really wasn't it was not it was um if anything it prove divisive because it reinforced pro war sentiment were already exist that\nUm but even after the publication of the telegram you have a very strong um um peace movement I'm antiwar sentiment in the United states\nAnd telegrams is not unlike Pearl Harbor able to to rally the public behind 'em ... American administration is going to war and when America does enter the war in April Nineteen Seventeen my fees is is\nIt is a much more divided country than for instance Germany France and Britain were in Nineteen fourteen and you can see evidence of that after the war when a America does not signed the peace treaty of Versailles retreat into isolationism in really comes out of it only when Pearl Harbor all curse\nI'm so it was him and telegram does play a role in American domestic politics in Nineteen Seventeen but not in the sense that it unites the American public um for intervention\nDid not unite in fact you a stylish the fact that the anti war faction was determined to believe that America has been tricked regardless of December and telegram and at the end result is a hundred thousand American casualties ... did not match\nThe uh the gym and telegram or the the so called threat of the Germans the Mexicans and the Japanese that was fantastic and it was used as a as a ... but that it was the illegitimate that's what they believed even in Nineteen Eighteen is that correct\nThat is correct of course in ... in a narrow fence that Zimmerman Telegram was true it was not a fraud and there were not people who were saying was the\nFront of the same time but the suspicion at the time I'm by by isolationist or non interventionist senators and and newspapers was that this was play to the American by the British with the goal of getting Americans to the war and this is of course exactly uh what had happened\nAnd it's the facts the matter solved by Thomas Bogart Zimmerman Telegram intelligence diplomacy and America's entry into World War one it important to know how it all started I'm John ...\n[noise] at Hackensack Meridian help we believe the best

what he did\nDid you see him lined up outside doors um no I saw him congregating with other boys\nIn the ... would you do something and this is the this is a story that nobody would run with if it wasn't a big ... nobody would run with the story\nExactly no but that's why I call it fake investigative ... right and and this is and so\nWhile she's not a part of it which is why you know the media wants to have her on a we need her to tell her story in the public you know much like a hearing except for we're not going to do it formally this is going to be you know will control the narrative except she couldn't control our own narrative her stories change now\nBy the way\nWe're we told ... that was a sworn statements\nNow I don't I have no idea uh who would pursue anything if\nThere is anything that could pursue for her given a sworn statements but we were giving were were given by Abernathy of the media was given a a document\nThat had her making statements as fat and then she walks back but I think this is what the president was getting out you know so many things have changed in the entire thing you could look at the claims\nAnd depending on what is said to the FBI and these interviews\nCould be looking at perjury\nFor Dr Ford and I think this is what her attorneys are worried about I think it's why they were so anxious over the weekend remember they said over the weekend we've contacted the FBI trying to set up the interview and as a Sunday they were saying\nYou know no interview yet they haven't talked to her\nWell why would you want to do it so soon after testimony because you want to keep her on track you don't want to change your story now the FBI is not going to do anything against her and I don't know that there would be any action against her\nExcept for the fact that she was under oath last Thursday so whatever she said then her comments to the FBI\nAre part of the process of vetting Kavanaugh and if they differ from her testimony there will be questions and so the the left is coming out\nAnd this is why I think they're also going for perjury a per capita they keep making up these bogus perjury things that aren't going anywhere\nAre and all of them have to do with the amount of alcohol that he's drinking and he was never very ... who was having said well listen I was very clear to only have a four four ounces

anyway so is that ask them well because that I you know I've just had you know as these tiny little drain so how many did you have Seventy\n[laughter] I Love that episode it was great I'll I'll never forget a you know the the you know looking at it\nThat Ritchie says 'cause he actually Ron Howard ... trunk thought man that's good acting but if if Kavanaugh I'd come out and made certain claims by was clear to only have one drink at any function he didn't say that\nIn fact at the time in my mind when I was watching it I was almost critical of him and I thought\nNo actually this is exactly how judges are they're very forthcoming especially about anything that they have done in their past a to this extent this is not criminal behavior to the\nOf throwing the was the exactly growing the ice at a bar\nYou might according to one police report he might have thrown ice right yes yeah and he never says he threw eyes but in the police report someone claims they threw eyes and the guy's ear was bleeding look people's ears bleed although you have a deer ears and what's not from the ... [laughter] that was from the other person's throwing the big\nBig block I'm paying attention to this because damage I Need to know you know\nAll that matters is that it was listed as an assault and somebody was bleeding so you've got to think like a liberal updated so this is but this is the the ... in my sanity\nBy the way you know I'm laughing huh I was a club DJ for years yeah I saw a massive bar fights and why you\nHad in mind when I was in my time and and and all the\nOil field workers in the ... are probably asleep right now but uh out in West Texas or screaming the guy got to leave the bar with his ear intact oh [laughter] well the recall that a good day so here's the thing I'm [laughter] actually comes from a real scenario\nUm but ... ... ... the entire equation has to be distorted and there has to be this distraction\nRight and now it's about what did he know when did he know what about the claims right because the text messages now show well that that he knew about the Ramirez claim ahead of time\nBefore it got to the media\nWell okay here's the here's the concern I think for the Democrats is that the president has essentially directed the FBI to talk to anybody and everybody who might be relevant to the situation will that includes\nPeople who were supposed to have corroborated if they've got the FBI agent sitting in front of them they're going to be nervous they're going to end and I wonder how the story is going to change and again if it does\nI Wonder where this thing go buy a\nJust just as you're talking about that just as we're talking about this this comes across\nA from our news feed from uh from Westwood One okay our company guy so Westwood One is Eric Swalwell ... the the us representative from California he Tucker Carlson before this guy's a piece of work yeah and it just comes across as you're talking there just I didn't mean to interrupt you but it's ...\nIt's a Swalwell Senate cabinet lies or just qualified and I went well what are the lies or a buyout right\nApparently I've ...

there you go to social media and the questions are being asked\nAre just are just bizarre and if you look at the media and that's why we started off the show with us and when you look at what the uh for example the the the uh\nUh a Yale I'm of the\nFirst went to Yale with a glass having other classmates and you know and she came across in sort of if you only get said this and then you look at his testimony well he did say that they're actually to the point now where the liberals this is how bad is you're asking will they ever get off the brink lower to the\nPoint where they're making an accusation he's lying really yes he should've said this will lead did\nShe he's line no but you said if you said this wouldn't be line nobody's line but he said this\nI mean that's where we are right media\nCarries the exact media gives it life because here's here's the difference if you look at the case of the New York times talking about the the ah the accusations made in the New Yorker piece\nThey this is what they wanted to do they want to do their their their tactic on this story\nThis claim was to go find an interview as many people as possible to see if they had first hand knowledge of this happening they couldn't find one NBC goes out and says\nWell we couldn't find anybody to back it up but we're going to put her on anyway the gay or classmate actually makes a statement that parallels what Kavanaugh said instead of ... if you'd said this\nThen I wouldn't have a problem\n\nBut still the media carries the story because what you're looking to do is it if I were writing that story if it were my work to put that story into print or put it on TV or anywhere else\nIt would be my approach to say ah this is going to be torn to shreds because what she said and I need to go back over to this is what I Would do I would get the transcript\nAnd I would read it and read it again\nBecause she's claiming the classmate is claiming he didn't say something when he did it's an all out lie but if you're in the media and you're taking that story to print a TV\nTo whatever you're part of a lie\nBecause it took another media organization to tear it down and said well I'm actually he did say that\nOr\nDoes it ever feel like that and\nAnd and this does not come from arrogance whatsoever because you know that we refer to ourselves as a two idiots overnight\nBut does anyone ever get the feeling and this is a doesn't include just you and me are but everybody listening right there does it ever get to the point where you just think to yourself dealing with the Democrats right now the mainstream Democrats\nIs like dealing with our children yes any excuses the children will give yeah and I'm not\nSaying that ... out of meanness I'm Talking about the arguments that they are making you know you and I said this uh last week\nSaid the American people when you basically they understand due process\nAnd if you talk about the due process and what the Democrats are doing here and not you know the belief and you know that you're innocent until proven guilty the the the fact of what they used to claim they cared about ... you know that's what the liberals are to care about and the fact they do and I said but if you keep pushing it the majority of Americans do believe in that\nEven Democrats who say they won't vote for cabinet they still view this as a cheap shot against him\nYes they viewed as if you if you get them alone and you ask them they'll tell you that oh by the way one of the uh uh people that I Know on social media that uh doesn't talk much used to talk\nMore as a liberal and has been quiet over the last year came out in favor of Kavanaugh wow and ended in a very\nSubtle way and I was like wow but if you actually talk to Democrats right now they're not happy with the way that the ... the the this was actually going\nOr they won't come out publicly and criticize\nTheir party for what they're doing but they feel very uncomfortable and they understand there is no evidence here they understand and then they see this just rolling in ... and that's the whole point that many Republicans look at this and go wow are you kidding me they are going down this path and now they're they're just taking anonymous sources and throwing it out\nI mean this is just so slimy and so dirty yeah or against Kavanaugh because there is no cooperating evidence there is no evidence\nAnd look people aren't\nStupid that will sit there and say this really stinks\nWell and that's that's how it because it does ... they'll look at the forward and say all these go find me accounts another now of what a million or over a million dollars what are the world's going on here the lawyers were pro bono you're talking about an airplane flight ... why is all this money being a rate it looks dirty yes\nIt all looks dirty and the American public and that's why when you bring it up about the cooperation and when people actually look into it and you when you said earlier to me uh uh off the air you said this is really liked the experience that we have with ...\nBut he had no idea that kept regular it's about free speech while you're watching the ... well look I'm not angry it's just I don't prefer to watch it because of and you explain what he actually did and you explained the pig socks every single\nPerson that supported Kaepernick had no that that I've talked to and it's in the hundreds over the last year ... had no idea about the ... once you bring that up to go it's a good point\nThey had no idea about Michael Bennet ... no idea that Michael Bennet was the catalyst one of the catalysts last year and just become one of the leaders of the movement who was also you know in the locker room yesterday for Philly ...\nGot famous and became the poster\nPerson last year mhm to continue with because he lied about the Las Vegas police every single person that was supporting Kaepernick didn't know about that either\nAnd they went oh oh okay yeah that is bad\nAnd I'll leave it at that I won't judge them and but you can tell they know when you bring up things that are common sense to people when you bring up something like fairness\nAnd the\nPreponderance of evidence before finding somebody guilty that it has to exist somewhere\nThere's a reason\nThat NBC\nWouldn't run Mitchell's report why wouldn't\nThey run it\nBecause they know that he'd been there a few listeners there doesn't listeners\nViewers that that are left even if they're liberal would say\nYeah not good right and\nWhy do you do that to adults why don't you want adults to know the truth right why we don't hide anything on the show there's nothing I Would hide any news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't they right why will they hide things that are important\nTo a story and even if they disagree with it analyze it right but they they as we've talked about before we talked last week about lying through omission ... in a lot of stories out there now right or the light through omission we just won't include parts of it and if and while they'll\nGive an interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right they will ignore\nA key piece\nTo the actual an official piece of the actual procedure the actual process in place\nThey ignore it completely but when you give Americans when you start telling Americans will look here's what's going on with this case and you lay it out to them that's why all of a sudden you go to you know sixty percent\nCraziness surrounding this right to privacy now is going to be invaded yet and and and he just you know that I knew\nThem for ... right yeah so there are plenty of

there he wanted us to be making cars here in the United states and selling them overseas\nThis trade deal makes that harder\nTo have\nA the trade deal and the president used the tariffs babies and then one right onto his\nBig accomplishment which was the automobiles what happened in the automobiles there has to be more not American North American content\nIn any vehicle that is sold a you know or you know a menu sold between the three countries there is to be more North American content not necessarily American\nBut North American even though it's not the north American free trade agreement it's the United states Canada and Mexico it's still North America\nSo it's so uh\nThere has to be more North American which uh content which is going to raise the cost then the the um a salary requirements that he put on Mexico\nThan Mexico must you know race it doesn't affect Mexico would actually for General Motors and Ford remember the companies are talking about are all American companies and if you noticed none of the American automobile manufacturers are saying this is a great deal for them they don't like the deal\nThe deal will make it so Ford and General Motors cells fewer cars in North America and because you've raised the cost of automobiles in North America more expensive to manufacture\nWhat the president said he wanted\nWhich was to send more vehicles to manufacture them in the United states and send them overseas is now going to be tougher to do because you've raised the cost of manufacturing\nOf cars in the United states in Mexico and in Canada and you the consumer will pay for it\nAnd that is what the president viewed as the greatest victory in this\nAnd so as I you know we only got one email on at the one guy said to you know you and I said well wait a minute there's some parts of it we liked but the big part of it the president promoted is wrong and as I and I you know invited him to argue more than debate more than just the rhetoric of\nIt makes America great to what does it actually do when you raise prices but we limit it we live in a look we live in a day and age and I understand that we live in a day and age where nobody wants to talk about\n... when you look at these specific sub of what's going on with cabinet\nNobody wants to focus in and say okay what's the actual thing here but he's off into a different tangent the same on on on the economics in trade everybody picks their own little corner and they stick with it instead of saying okay what is a result when you raise prices overall and that's what the president has done in the free trade agreement\nAnd our trade negotiators have done he has made cars more expensive\nTo buy in Mexico in the United states and in Canada world when it together you know the cost of buying a car in the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric you mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused and said Eric ...\nUh but as you said yesterday or the and you and I've been doing some some uh uh reading and analysis on this is that her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of waste to finance them and so what are people looking to do to look into by used vehicles\nYes and that's driving by market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles the used vehicles\nAnd the price goes up and so for some people out there they believe this is ... none of it's personal it's all economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president and things because of president\nOr even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things and and that's one of the bad things as automobile now it could've been a lot worse than what he was promoting before but the fact is\nIt didn't affect probably Ninety eight percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing\nAs we said would happen we had predicted look who's going to be all this high all the soup ... and what we're going to basically get is the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here or there they get a little victory and timber we get a little victory on dairy\nThe big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states in Canada and Mexico that you that consumers are going to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship\nCars from the United states anywhere else and the president to use that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great victory\nRight yeah and I I think if you look\nHere's where the PTO will be you'll see certain industries that the reason the automobile industry has is key to the economy is because you look at the the the\nHow often now people purchase vehicles right\nOr more and more they're holding on to their cars\nSo that hurts the terms because well they want the stuff off the assembly line to be so\nYou make that more expensive you start hurting it industry you start seeing layoffs as a result of that then and then also make the used cars by default more expensive and you're going to see not just\nThe automobile industry but of course all the dealerships and all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms or those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that because people will choose as they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time\nBecause that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else we're not talking about well whether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car or electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce\nThat it's hard to come by it that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine\nHow expensive it is going to be for us that's the difference\nAnd we view it as a victory and as we've said nobody can explain to us why that's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy\nYou know again that's that's moving in and in some of the agriculture stuff where we do have more free trade now because of it and we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine but it's almost as if we make the victory over there and then we shoot ourselves in the foot\nOn automobiles now the other good thing is Canada will like this was mentioned with the timber that the president in all likelihood will be lifting the terror if they put on timber\nAnd now that has to go to a panel to decide whether a candidate is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction in the United states because that timber will be coming over and that was a fear of builders that housing prices were going to sky rocket another construction\nFrom the use of of woods because of the Canadian timber\nAnd hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down so there's wins and there was lost his across the board\nBut but overall if the president is stating that the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs on the aluminum terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on it\nWell and that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and if people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase on on vehicles and you start seeing that slide\nYou start seeing the economy slide and that will be your tell this is what the the Bush administration saw steel terrorists they saw companies leaving the country\nAnd they said this can't stand we cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this because the the job loss will be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those still terrorists uh prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right and so uh you know the president which was called a victory fine we just do the analysis on the reality of economic\nSlump he'd give me when you get ... just got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China\nThere's ... then ... and by the way political you can get away with that all day long to it's going it is going to hurt\nBut if they're not going to play by the world Trade Organization rules then not only the U.S but all of our allies and other

Welcome to the show\nGood morning I Wonder if some sixteen year old son I posted something on Twitter or Instagram that will keep them from becoming a judge forty five years from now but my point is that Senator Flake man actually ... the Republican Horton by calling ... you're a senator\nIn a a purple shall we say state or a state where your reelection is a tough one\nA year now and say hey look I was kind of go towards not going for the man or I was leaning towards voting for him\nI wasn't sure I sat through the hearings and like so many Americans I couldn't buy my only cold than the FBI does it a whole invest it and then reasonable person would say that there's no real conclusion after that investigation\nUnder the vote for him so I think this is that's the game she gives some cover to Republicans who may have been afraid to alienate some of their email or voters and and gives them a little political coverage vote yes\nWell there there's only works if they if the polls since Thursday which will start rolling in over the next couple of days that by the ... by the end of the week those polls show that the American people are not with them but the but more importantly those senators in those states especially where it's close\nOr are not getting the support of their voters and they're staged a and ultimately it only works if the vote is to confirm Kavanaugh because it doesn't work for the Republicans if he does not\nGet confirmed or it becomes still a very very much so an uphill battle or even in November even though I Do believe that this whether he's confirmed or not will work for them politically I don't know too what effect in November at the ...\nAnd I think the Democrats plan is it doesn't really matter what happens with the forward anymore it's let's get at whatever other allegations that we have to try to delaying that's yet they run early right yeah\nYeah they want further away they're going to want Ramirez to have a hearing or you know there will be a coal somewhere along the way when they know the boat is inevitable and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying on Monday that there will be a vote this week\nAnd so we don't know when that's going to be I'm assuming Saturday there could be a vote on the floor but we don't know\nUm he said the time for delays I haven't heard his ... yeah so they\nCould do that Sunday and get a

up anyway just for your information that the federal debt now at\nTwenty one point five trillion\n... uh the federal debt has increased by one point two trillion dollars over the last year mhm right you want to make this I'll make it simple for you okay I I did the figures in my head or something that you and I came up with ... what was it maybe ten years ago I Can't remember um okay when I was swimming in my pool Mm and instead of thinking things that normal people think\nI was thinking to myself how do I simplify the budget situation so everybody can understand it within thirty seconds and then they can say okay they can relate to it because you said billions and trillions in a lab do blah blah blah blah blah\nOr the situation we're in right now okay yes if because the ... the budget just ended what just September thirtieth just sun ... last year or\nSo and these are all rough estimate but but um if you if you took the federal budget and put it\nPut it and basically somebody who last\nYear made thirty six thousand dollars okay okay so this is the situation that we're in right now in this country a as a person that made thirty six thousand dollars last year you spent\nForty point\nFour thousand for a for a a a forty thousand four hundred dollars is what you spent ... and you made thirty six thousand right you have\nOutstanding debt\nA of a\nLet me see and make sure we
