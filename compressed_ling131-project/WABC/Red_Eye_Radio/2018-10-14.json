getting the ... the good kind of talking about race in America and I guess the Kanye West but at the White House\nBut um basically though I live in both faiths I take the train from Freeport every morning\nSix thirty five train I take out a report and I you know what I'd say there I'd say hon it's predominantly black it's about Ninety five percent black report Long Island\nAnd I see it that train station six thirty in the morning hardworking blacks dressed in suits ready to go go to work just like me I'm just saying I think the underlying dirty secret that liberals don't want to admit\nIs that there is a large that silent minorities out there are black working people and I think\nKanye West in his ... kind of touched upon it he was brave actually to go to the White House because the media and the liberals are killing him but you know\nThat's to be expected but what I'm saying is I notice this on the train every morning when I go in I teach this part of the black people calling a walk like me I'm just saying it's it's and I know that when twenty twenty rolls around and they have a choice to vote for Trump or someone who's\nYou know selling them a line of of handouts and this is what we need it and you've been done wrong\nI think it down a lot of them are going to vote for Trump and I just think it's a lot of things the liberal liberal media and a lot of liberals up that don't want to admit to and also another thing does anyone bring up the fact that Jim Brown was also at this meeting\nYeah no hedge Jim Brown didn't know what to do that in fact screens yeah Jim Brown was sitting there Trump talked about it in a couple of times but he's he looked like he wanted to be anywhere else Karen from Long Island you're on Seventy seven WDC\nHi Larry Hi Karen I should I should be insulted Chris shooting it's made you didn't even mention ...\nOdd sorry care and I should of I I was throwing out a couple of names of people that called very earlier

should keep or stay off of than there have been um ... what are you getting it on this because we only have a little bit less OK well she's a PHD and on and she says people don't realize how bad it is now this affects you know it doesn't matter what race you are\nIt's worth pointing out that both that Heitkamp voted no on judge Kavanaugh and mentioned voted yes on judge capital\nAnd mentioned voted yes because he knew it'd be ... be political suicide to vote against him in West Virginia\nThe Kavanaugh hearings are absolutely affecting the election and now Republicans are just as passionate to get out to the polls as Democrats Democrats of course are motivated by hatred for Trump and the fact that they lost the election Republicans were motivated by discussed\nOver the capital hearings and Republicans are more likely to vote because they're always more likely to vote\nWhen they say they're going to go out to the polls they actually do Democrats don't always do it\nAnother Democrat Claire McCaskill in Missouri is in real trouble she was ahead to before the Kavanaugh about she's now down three she's behind in Texas\nTed Cruz was considered a tossup states in this\nBeta well ... was that everybody's favorite Democrat he's now up nine Ted Cruz's up nine now it looks like the Democrats may lose Missouri and the Republicans will hold on to Texas\nThat leads six races and Senator Jon tester a Democrat from Montana was cruising the reelection\nBefore the Kavanaugh hearings he was up nine it's now tied in the polls with Republican challenger state auditor Matt Rosendale in Tennessee this one shocking\nCongressmen Marsha Blackburn was down to points in the race to win the seat vacated by retiring Senator Bob Corker she's now according to New York times up double digits so the Republicans will hold on to Tennessee as well\nAnd I really thought the Republicans were going to lose in Arizona but now Republican congresswoman Martha ... for the first time is leading Democrat Christ in cinema\nThat's the seat that's open because Jeff Flake is retiring in Nevada Republican senator Dean Heller is it a tough battle\nWith congresswoman Jackie rose and she was ahead she blasted Kavanaugh and now she's behind\nThe Republicans could actually pick up three seats\n\nAnd I haven't even talked about the Florida race were Democrat Bill Nelson is in real trouble in his race for reelection against governor Rick Scott but that race will be decided now on how well or how bad the people of Florida believe Governor Scott handled the clean up after Michael\nAnd then there's New Jersey\nWith the race of the Bob's Bob Menendez against Bob ...\nThat's much tighter than it's supposed to be\nI don't know that if in a state that is blue and getting bluer I don't know I just have a hard time believing the Menendez can lose but ... is a really strong candidate with a lot of money who was presenting a real challenge against the guy\nWho was condemned by the Senate Ethics committee and had to go to trial on corruption charges\nSo I guess it's possible if you live in New Jersey you tell me do you really believe that can happen one eight hundred a for a WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two two cars that will be the story of the night if that happens that'll be a huge story Bob\nAnd then does lose but here's the real question the question I have about this\nWill there be any backlash internally inside the Democratic party about the decision to do anything and everything no matter how will slimy\nTo try and defeat capital because I Believe they felt like they had the windows their back I think the Democrats felt that there was enough support in the so called resistance in the Democratic party that they could get away with anything that they they had a mandate to do anything they needed to do to stop capital\nAnd it turns out that may not be true\nIt turns out they might of waking awakened the sleeping giant\n\nThere will be repercussions\nEspecially if the Republicans pick up seats in the Senate after it looks as if the Democrats had a real chance to take\nThe Senate\nIf the Democrats blame their leadership is it possible that Chuck Schumer will lose his title Senate minority leader\nIt is possible\nIs that is true possibility because he was the main ringleader of a strategy that is costing the party dearly right now\n\nThey had a real opportunity to take the Senate and they blew it and they blew it because of the cabinet strategy\n\nIronically had they just voted him through\nGoing through the first few days of hearings talk to him about his court cases and allowed him to go through without the accusations of gang rape\n\nThey would do better in in the midterms and the fact that that's the case that they would have done better in the midterms had they not go going after cabinet also viciously leads me to believe that whoever came up with that strategy and push that strategy is in real trouble\nOne eight hundred eight forty WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to to to you know what's really fascinating to you know who's not included who's not out in the\nCampaign trail me Joe Biden's on the campaign trail Mitt Romney's\nOut there all everyone is something that George Bush is going to campaign for somebody\nWho's not after Hillary or Bill Clinton\nThey they are dead to the

bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's some moisture rising agents that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule AJ\nThe body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells\nThat connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting to wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things

he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy\nOf this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers\nWhen the new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor can now has never endorsed to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only endorsed is charities advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it and joining us live from California doctor can now welcome back to the program thanks map to occupy now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the\nPast year or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on you\nWell let me tell you it just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it would give some information about how this evolved\nAbout eight years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we followed our doctor's advice and our government's advice and we started putting on the sun block and staying out of the fund it had\nTremendous effects on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAbout vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant to the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coal factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it need to think and we'll talk about all these secondly I realized there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation\nCan learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about a complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't pocket on on the Internet at this was the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nYou know let me ask you a question here because I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case might have been de it'd be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with lie to Monday\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just gonna read off\nA list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing and they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamin Newsweek\nOr Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk am a news that's American Medical association or listen to this bat vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association the\nYou know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition\nBlood pressure health immune health all these different things as because vitamin D pat it's not a vitamin it is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ... it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight\nAnd what's eventually made is a steroid hormone now they're worried hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid on and the way they work that is the key there are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene\nThat is it unlocks two thousand gene is the key that\nTwo thousand one tenth of your genome by the when one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it and the only thing that can unlock it is vitamin D that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs the key on lock the right gene\nNot doctor you say we need five thousand I use pretty now here's here's the problem I went through the the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering your I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out in the the new times sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know the the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way with purity products why the importance of this five thousand number was that the magic bullet\nYeah because of the single fact and this fact changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime and ... for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side\nYou make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now that's incredible I thought about that\nI thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers or gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefit\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering the test the\nProblem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right then you have to go and have the blood test done and then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way other symptoms I could look for they wouldn't tell me ... you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but under symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only and another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later than I have a paper coming out in\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance\nHow sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain health those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient\nWon't have any way of knowing it because they've been to fishing for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think\nAnd then we move is norm yeah so it can't go by symptoms\nEven after controlling for known risk factors that is even after they control for smoking high blood pressure high triglycerides diabetes all the things known to contribute even after they control for that\nThere was a ... wrong effect of vitamin D day and it was integrated manner that is if you're really deficient than your risk is much higher if you're a little deficient than your risk is a little higher\nAnd we don't have enough studies you have to say that you know if you have heart disease you should take vitamin D although many cardiologist their prescribing it just on the basis of why not\nIt is safe you know five thousand units a day it cannot make anybody toxic five thousand units a day is ten minutes of ... even five minutes of summers gun shy\nSo the way these doctors are thinking is\nLook what's the risk versus what the benefits it looks like from the studies there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficient we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now\nBut it would be unethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient while we're conducting all the studies we need to about heart health or bone health or breast held or prostate health or immune system\nIt would be unethical to let them white vitamin D deficient the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're levels thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay level needs to be fifty or higher and to get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go to the health food store looking multi vitamins most of the best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself has a standalone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand I huge apples but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get with purity here why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that needs to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D just like your ancestors used to store\nSo if you're a level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to think of vitamin D as a mountain spring\nWith a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone and we've taken enough vitamin D to halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other pools below with the breast pull the coal and pull the immune system pull all the other polls that are blow it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the pancreas out all these pools\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit for a rainy\nDay and a little bit of a surplus yeah\nBut you don't do that\nYou're levels around fifty if you're levels less than around fifty you used up\nAlmost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation well and that's not a good thing\nBy the way down to ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three fish oil the free bottled fisherman both of these are thirty days supplies\nAnd all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero not talk to me about the link between vitamin D and ... what's the research showing\nWell this may be fifty studies out there that show a real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D ...\nBut that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues of St clues that we know what about mood that is people who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the ... people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitudes most people experienced as people way less than the summer\nThan they do in the winter so those were closed but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ... that's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last\nYear they studied women who were dieting and the women who had the highest vitamin D and takes lost more weight than the women who had the lower vitamin D intake yes\nAnd then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial that's the highest standard of proof we have in medicine and this was thirty six thousand people and they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect is\nBut the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take\nAdamant day so that's another reason plus since purity is giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the fish will you know of course it's\nThere's research that shows the fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reason to believe that two things together will help now it's not a diet bill it's not dramatic you won't just stop eating part of that that is you just feel better you're more active you're under doing something\nNow don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe that so widely important did they give this formula attract\n[noise] well you know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health Cohen hill breath pill prostate health pancreatic hill bone health the immune system I could go on and on the main reason that people will continue to\nTake this if you just give it a try for a month is how you feel you're get up
