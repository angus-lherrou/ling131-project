{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "Why not it is safe you know five thousand units a day it cannot make anybody toxic five thousand units a day is ten minutes of ... even five minutes of summer sunshine\nSo the way these doctors are thinking is\nLook what's the risk versus what the benefits it looks like from the studies there's a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficient we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now\nBut it would be unethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient while we're conducting all the studies we need to about heart health or bone health or breast held or prostate health their immune system\nIt would be unethical to let them white vitamin D deficient the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're levels thirty five they'll\nTell you that's okay it's not okay level needs to be fifty or higher and to get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most the best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself is a standalone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand IU Chambliss but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get with purity here why is that so important\nThere's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that needs to do and it begins to store\nA little bit of the vitamin D just like your ancestors used to store\nSo if you're a level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to to\nThink of vitamin D as a mountain spring with a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone and we've taken enough item and data halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool but all the other\nPools below with the breast pull the colon pulled the immune system pull all the other polls that are below it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pull over flows and starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood the cognition the pancreas out all these pools\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit for a rainy day\nAnd a little bit of a surplus yeah but you don't do that unless you're levels around fifty if you're levels less than around fifty you use up almost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation wow and that's not a good thing\nBy the way down to ... vitamin D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction\nWith their omega three ... three bottles fish oil both of these are thirty days supplies and all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero\nSix eight to zero now to talk to me about the link between vitamin D in body weight what's the research showing\nWell that is maybe fifty studies out there that show a real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D ... but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect\nBut there were clues the same clues that we know what about mood that is\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from the ...\nPeople who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitudes most people experience as people way less than the summer than they do in the winter so those were closed but we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely\nAssociated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ... that's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last\nYear they studied women who were dieting and the women who had the highest vitamin D and takes\nLost more weight than the women really had the lower vitamin D and take yes\nAnd then just a couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial is the highest standard of proof we have in medicine and this was thirty six thousand people and they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect\nIs but the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take wow item and day so that's another reason plus\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the fish will ... you know of course it there's research that shows that fish or in a self help with weight control\nSo there's reasons to believe the two things together will help now it's not a diet tail is not dramatic you won't just stop eating part of that pet is you just feel better you're more active you're under doing something\nNow don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe is so vitally important did they give this formula\n[noise] well you know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight\nMood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health coal in health breast health prostate health pancreatic health bone health the immune system I could go on and on the main reason that people will continue to take this if you just give it a\nBy for a

documents are so special and the ... and I also teach part time when I teach government\nI I Try to get my students to understand what makes the United states so special those two founding documents and what they represent between those who think there's wisdom is what we've learned from the past and those who think they can overturn thousands of years of history\nAnd people like me think wish them at the drop of a hat\nWas a drop of Penn I can never go ... ...\nBetween those who think there's something special about western civilization and those who think there is little good about it\nOr that we learn anything from it\nOne could go on for a long time listening to specific positions this entails so I'm Stu some from higher taxes to lower taxes\nFor more regulations to fewer regulations this was the defining left versus the right from a stronger military to weaken military to courts making laws which is what the left loves that's where there were so upset with the cabinet hearings they want judges to make the laws to courts interpreting\nIt seems to me that we're fighting for the soul of our country and there are signs it could be getting much more confrontational\nFrom the ... fascist to black lives matter we're free speech for those who disagree with is in jeopardy is no doubt in my mind that's what's going on\nBy the way there was just such a battle Saturday between the conservative patriot prayer group and counter demonstrators from antifa\nSo that when they get they got into a bloody battle outside of popular bar where members on both sides use beer spray\nMy producer a terrific producer Brian what's beer spray I don't even know what they're so I guess you use it against bears I said beer spray but it's better spray or maybe ... you know these guys route the bar\nAnd ... that's a great night police reported seeing both groups with hard knuckle gloves knives and firearms\nWhat they've done the march flash march for law and order in pi DX I think that's the name of the Portland airport or even the city of Portland was organized by patriot leader Joey Gibson a response to Portland mayor ... wheelers\nSide of the city's police department you may remember he doesn't want the police department to do anything most of the time that's what's great part of the problem\nSo in my opinion is preventing them from doing their job I bet you if you interviewed the police they would say the same thing hey just let us do our job we they cannot I Can't imagine that they like to see violence take place on either side\nBut this is just one indication of how the non violent civil war is turning violent\nAnd you're currently I Know you know as you certainly can't speak on college campuses without interruptions or the threat of violence if you're a conservative on college campuses that's not a problem for the left or liberals they get to speak\nWhere the you know if you remember the free exchange of ideas we're supposed to be the role of the day if you go to college campuses you'll often see that's somewhere that they talk about truth and the exchange of ideas that's not taking place anymore and of course now you can't even go to a restaurant or have privacy in your home\nIf you're on the conservative side of an issue and the opposite side recognize you or knows where you live they were giving out one guy right he was arrested I think last week the giving of phone numbers of various senators and addresses and he does on the government computer\nAnd just this past week the state Republican Party headquarters in New York was vandalized they smash windows and spray painted the doors with anarchy symbols ... left behind in the building read that the attack was putting the Republican Party a notice mentioned as\nThey continue this quote heart attack is merely a beginning we're not pass if we are not civil and we will not apologize uh-huh unquote\nBy the way maybe they were following up on Hillary's remarks did you hear what she said this week where she said Democrats can't be civil with Republicans during Donald Trump's presidents I Wonder what would have happened if she had one\nAnd Republicans said the same thing we certainly can't be civil until Hillary Clinton's term is over\n... of course get it if you wear a make America hacker anywhere you're you're in danger you are in jeopardy I mean it's amazing what's going on out there\nYou may be putting your life in danger and even putting a sign in your yard or on your car risks great property damage\nBut it may be getting worse than that would the shootings of congressman so what was it about a year ago serious injuries to see the skull east\n... who could have been murdered and of course on an operation day from the very beginning I forget which actress or sing or whatever it was I don't know if all those people there was a threat to blow up the White House or worse you know I remember that\nEnd Senator Rand Paul said recently he voiced fears about possible deadly force being used\nAnd who can say for sure that he's wrong seventh it's gonna happen if this continues at something like that is going to happen\nThe left and the Democrats and the media which kind of resolve seems like these days the means not supposed to be like that but it sure seems to me that they're on the left they can't accept the fact that President Trump won\nThe resistance of you know that's what they call it started before he was even president and there may have been we're finding out now a soft coup against him\nTo remove him from office\nMore and more information is coming out about that but by the way we were not supposed to find out the information Hillary is supposed to win and Obama said she was going to win and there was no reason that she wouldn't when\nWe went and found out about any of the stuff that that makes me think like a banana republic but there were those in this country that we're ready to overthrow the will of the people in whatever fashion they could\nSo in my opinion that was the beginning of the civil war may have started before that but that with what's been going on President Trump to overthrow sitting president to go against the will of the people just because you don't like the results that's left versus right and it continues\nThey hate President Trump's so much\nThat anything goes because they have truth on their side\nThey can't imagine this a shock to them when I say it on other shows that they were probably an equal number of people that were devastated by the election of President Obama I Do for many resistance but I got to be honest I I like to count the days are okay this years over you know all you have three more years left of it\nBut that I didn't never occurs to them\nBecause they're so arrogant to begin with so why don't you tell me if you agree with me how bad things have gotten between the two sides in this country\nAnd do you think we're fighting for the soul of our country that there is such a thing as I Believe as American exceptionalism that is under attack along with our basic institutions free speech that's under attack what we're used to think of traditional marriage\nFrom individual rights to free market capitalism these are all under attack and if I Am right what are you doing about the upcoming elections to make sure we don't lose the house\nWere impeachment hearings they said this now learn some of the other day by the way if you imagine who is going to lead these committees like Jerry Nadler Maxine Waters no she's going to the banking with what you would do\nI Wonder what you're doing about making sure this doesn't happen impeachment hearings will likely began the day the Democrats are sworn it they're going to try to teach President Trump and they've got they've already sort of going to try to teach cabinet and you're gonna have hearings for ever\nTell me what you think of what you're doing about this at eight six six Ninety red eye and this whole week I'm filling in on red eye radio but just a couple of more points to consider\nWhile you're calling and I want to add that the extreme hatred for President Trump is palpable you can feel it I Know Hillary was all set to be crowned and they were shocked by President Trump's win\nBut the hatred for him knows no limits part of it I'm sure is what they regard as unsophisticated behavior in a good part of it is his personality which can easily alienate people I knowledge that\nYou've difficult sometimes especially with the things he says he often says things you shouldn't especially on Twitter and he picks fights where they should be not\nHe demeans the White House see I'm being honest by answering some of his outrageous critics\nAnd he's clearly incapable of accepting much of any criticism I get that all of a few of us are but to spy his personal shirt come\nI think I'd better say the softly\nSo some of those in the left don't have a breakdown of the ... mayor credit that fact breakdown judging from what is going on these days I think President Trump has done a great job as president that's right I didn't even say a good job I said great job\n\n[noise]\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI care what I mean a while ago I was walking and I hope that site right right and I don't know what happened I had the after

convince themselves they're good and the right as bad I Wonder when you can correct me if I'm wrong but I Wonder if the right or you know sort of copying their civil war language can be dangerous I Know I'm twenty five and are just getting off the coast campus\nUm the younger right wing\nIs a really um [noise] they're they're in love with this idea of you know not your grand puppies GOP so they're they're\nReally getting that go along with the idea of pushing back against the law but I Wonder if our energy should be more focused on convincing the left that it's not this um this good versus evil that they probably don't even they kind of a justified in their work\nYeah I don't think you can convince the hardcore left it there is no talking them and you'll find out there maybe some independence you can reach maybe some of the Democrats I used to do a show in Los Angeles where I had two Democrats two Republicans on every week\nAnd those kinds of people you could convince and by the way this or you can almost distinguish the left from liberals liberals used to be like Alan Dershowitz where if you disagreed with people you know you followed it through the ideas and and the ballot box what the left or people like the antifa groups\nOr where they wouldn't even let you speak that there's a new fascists even though the accuser enemies of being fashion so I don't think there's any talk to the left if that's what you meant but I Do think there's a great middle that you might be able to reach\nAnd even some perhaps conservative Democrats are and that is true of our

word and and then when you do it's just kind of like a shame that is\nYeah pretty discouraging uh what's going on on the campuses especially you can never hear conservative speaker they won't let them talk my right\nOh yeah no you're absolutely correct\nYeah so I think you have to join the organizations you do so you don't feel alone and try to work on people you can how about your family how do they feel that they didn't think did they think you're ...\nNo not at all your\nThankfully I grew up in the Christian household so clearly a pretty level headed\nYeah well I I Would suggest to you that you you know keep up a fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the fact many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think the the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated in in what went on there the idea\nThat allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is outrageously is against the whole system where you're innocent until proven guilty he was guilty just because he was accused of it and so maybe that influence on people I think people are going to be surprised by the elections but Robert I I think your

I Would love to ask left is a well they wouldn't listen but liberals and least is this what you want\nThat some of the ... use of something\nI mean even if he doesn't seem quite fair I can see Tucker Carson cross and saying on Fox News that he's been accused of something I don't know what that was\nAnd he was totally innocent that could be a lot of people like that but your life is ruined your member of the players at at Duke lacrosse players they wound up in unison remember to want to Brawley in New York City or with Al Sharpton who never had to apologize for all of that stuff\nThis is what you want where you can just destroy someone's life and in their family because an accusation that's not corroborated and people are believed just because you make an accusation and in the in the me too movement\nWe understand women having been treated fairly and in many years in our country but the idea that that's that's enough as a what's the Hawaiian ... senators name that that's in the you know ... mentioned just shut up and go away\nThat's where we've come to I've set for years now\nGive me nine conservative odd black women on the U.S Supreme Court and I'd be happy camper what do I care about their race\nOr their gender I just want people with good values and of course I Want them to share my views what went on and on here on getting into it and I wanted to get into it later when we're on a week or so ago is just outrageous but then it brings me to my bigger picture which I talked about the first hour\nThat we have a civil war the left believes that they have\nTruth on their side and anything they do is justified summer so you can't speak on college campuses you can't even go to a restaurant and peace now right\nAnd they'll do anything and everything to get rid of President Trump and Hillary say this week something about we will not be civil again and we don't have to be civil as long as he's president of the United states whoa\nWe we've gotten to that point of view I remember that Ronald Reagan\nWe'd have drinks with these days you cannot drinks with Tip O'Neill at night and he's in the regular season and say you battling me in the daytime and Tip O'Neill the Democrat the speaker of the house from Massachusetts would say well that was in the daytime we fight there but here we're friendly that that's not the case anymore\nYou saw what Senator Graham said that he wouldn't put up with with this nonsense and you want power so badly you'll do anything to destroy people yeah that's where we've come now we've come to the point where it sounds like a second civil war to me\nAnd you see the anti for the protests in the street in Portland I mentioned that last hour\nWhat took place between the prayer group and their group and bloody and bare knuckles and the bear spray and all kinds of stuff it's it's getting violent out there and of course we have the situation of these families are almost being murdered by a guy who you know shut up the congressmen playing baseball\nThat's where we've come to I I really worry about this country it is really crucial and if you don't vote come or what is it about four weeks from now I don't even know what it is in early November and the Democrats take back the house and that's the prediction\nOf a lot of so called polls now and of course the polls wrong before so we're hoping for a bigger turn it on our side\nYou will you will believe what's going to take place they'll have hearings at the hearings they'll subpoena people it won't be safe to work for the Trump Administration anymore they'll catch on something and they'll get you on everything so this kid pay\nThis can't be what you want to happen in America even good liberals on the other side I Wish you'd call me\nAn eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine and seven thirty three thirty nine you can't want this because just like the reason we now only fifty votes to elect the Supreme Court justice or fifty one and the vice president votes in case of the pie\nBecause Harry Reid started that you ... the Democrats the left and liberals can't want this 'cause it's kind of come back to haunt them the next time they win and in American history it goes back and forth between Democrats and Republicans and\nOne side and the other side you you can't want that's the problem is you're you're not seeing you open up a new can of worms where you are guilty\nJust because of an accusation you open up a new can of worms if you will do anything to get rid of the press in the United states because you disagree their views and Trump's case even worse\nYou know like who he is a you personally so opposed to him you can't believe this ... this bump get this full this guy is not an elite is like the rest of you that he ever could have one and by the way\nHe's going to win again I really believe that the election was held today now two years a long time he'd win reelection\nSo ah ... we're we're in for a battle and we've got to make sure\nThat the the house has not taken over by the Democrats I'm pretty sure we're going to keep the Senate were probably when a few more seats in the Senate but in the house of representatives they a lot of people I I did a show a week or so ago and I had some experts on the third our including off the air they said to me it looks bath house represents\nWho's the guy that I Know well in orange county part of California data ...\nI think he's been there twenty or Thirty years he's in trouble they're spending millions and millions of dollars to defeat\nThis they are so passionate about this the other side\nThey're so angry about this election this past election that President Trump is in office to get what he's done and remember the courts were so significant because if they couldn't win elections the other side would make sure judges ruled right like the Muslim ban that President Trump because of what he said\nSome federal judges and decided it was a Muslim ban doesn't matter from the president have the right to do that\nSo they love the idea that the judges could make laws that's partially what this battle was about also so ... this is that's not what the first hour was and I want you to react to it\nI think we're going to another civil war going on I'm just hoping that it doesn't get violent\nThat we can get through this thing and I do everything there is some parts of magic you can't go to a restaurant that would have been on the herd of ten twenty Thirty years ago going to a restaurant with your family and having people chant around you to make sure you can eat there or having a waiter or waitress is not serving police or not serving people on the other side\nWhat what are we coming to does the other side really want that\n... I I Want to know what you're thinking to you know it's it's pretty sad what's going to happen if you don't do something the next few weeks I mean get everybody can devote we're we're going to lose this this is going to be a real battle worse than what you saw\nA with justice Kavanaugh the a week or so ago eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven three three three nine more guys they're filling in on red eye radio\nTips from Jay Jay killer and associates incorporated on customer service does your motor carrier provides uniforms for you to wear on the job does your company require drivers to adhere to a dress code\nIf the answer to both questions is no that it might be a good idea to Institute a self imposed dress code of parents can say plenty about a person the driver who shows up at a delivery dressed in a professional manner gives the customer a better impression of the company\nAnd the individual they're working with\nIf you're in the middle of the long run be sure to pack enough clean clothes for the journey driving can be grueling and demanding as the old saying goes close make demands and fresh clothing can help you feel more comfortable while on the road and when taking breaks for a meal this\nIf they disagree with the Democrats the knock on except let me know shifting marks are filling in on right on the radio [noise]\n\n\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI Can't walk in a while ago I was walking and I hope that site right right and I don't know what happened I had the actor that stuff that my aunt and my late and I noticed that I accept that it I don't have that anymore that is one thing that I Am very\nAnd I don't feel any that they should have like it's like my nerves are getting killed it's just wonderful I I very rarely at this product\nFor a limited time use discount code W.

just had a quick a little observation myself I'm I'm pretty politically neutral um but you know I myself have been in as young as I Am I I watch a lot of uh you know\nMedia and and uh getting on the social media and just the way that they're portraying on the current president Mr Trump is just\nA little ... it seems a little unfair and the way that they're doing it it it seems like they're just uh they actually get into the political side they want to just pinpoint no a lot of like the more scandalous things like this stuff but he says the stuff that the ...\nAnd the way that they're pushing it it's just purely for conquer and it seems like it seems like a lot of these uh these are that are\nUm showing this stuff or they just want to do it for the money and I think that's just kind of a dangerous thing to do because if you're um you know pushing the fact that we need to get all these young people out there and and vote and then you want to only\nReally show one side of the story it it just seems like it's almost an agenda and it and I just think that's kind of a dangerous thing like especially you know like I said if you're going to have all these people excited about voting and not really know exactly what they're voting for 'em I just seems that that that could be dangerous situation\nYou're pretty perceptive how old are you a twenty five\nYou're pretty young and uh it seems to me that you you reflect what I think a lot of people are feeling after the hearings especially which is the true to the judge pretty badly they're treating President Trump pretty badly not someone that I honestly I support him big time but he does bring it on himself with some of the tweets and so on\nBut the personal vendetta the hatred they have for him is way out of bounds\nOr I I did not like personal mom I didn't like I'm not sure I agree with him and the more than one thing on his policies I certainly wants to know harm to come to him\nAnd I certainly didn't wasn't part of any resistance I just knew you had to get rid of him the next term and I lost that one too you didn't see people out in the streets you didn't he see people are threatening the press I guess they didn't want it to the non like that\nBut but in general the anger towards this president I Know that you may not remember this you're pretty young towards George W.

it is their way or the highway\nI had trouble watching a ... a couple of weeks ago the Kavanaugh hearings on we'll go to tie the some of the civil war now even though it's my job as a talk show host to watch that circus\nThey didn't really care about that woman not really she was used as pawns senator Booker because those on your side would have ignored a conservative woman with the same charges against a left this man\nAnd your accomplices in the media would barely cover\nNeed I mentioned up Cathleen Willie Paula Jones Anita Broderick and more some of you hope remember some of these names and these women weren't on the left so it doesn't matter they accused President Clinton if you don't know of all kinds of a sexual assault\nThere just these women are just road kill on their way to power the absolutely Parker sea of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation I'm surprised they didn't have another Spartacus moment\nDidn't he admit in an op paid or something sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other phone is on the panel they talk about taking the moral high ground\nThese hypocrites have actually reached new lows little on the moral high ground every time I think they can go no lower he break new ground that's the kind of works I Can't go to a new ground tell me how you're\nAble to contain yourself I I had trouble continue myself during those weeks that week whatever ... more than a week actually with the delay eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven three thirty three thirty\nNine these people disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them Kavanaugh was not even my first choice to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered they could have picked for example the pope and he's a leftist\nBut they would have been against him if President Trump had appointed why in heck did they even need hearings or further FBI investigations\nWhen they announced how they were going to be voting for the very few exceptions\nAnswer to soccer and people like Jeff Flake talking about I'm sure people says I'm not the only one to talk about being named correctly by the way he said he would vote for cabinet are Kavanaugh he was all set to but it did you see this as a ... a woman confronted him in the elevator\nAnd he your method that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation Jeff Flake as before this delay did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it further divided us\nThis was all a show to lay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham had it just right\nThis is all about power and I could take it more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can't have the Supreme Court judge or what I Wish they would be honest about that\nBut they are a bunch of phony Hippocratic hypocritical left\nThey discuss them tell me what you're thinking eight six six Ninety red eye but it's worse than that because we have now taken away one of our most basic rights\nThe presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have proper ending evidence it doesn't matter if they're in and said you can still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the ... because you have to prove they did it with mouse\nIf they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan sector labor I think it was secretary Donovan that's the name that comes to me he was asked after it was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was\nThey said something like what are you going to do next and he said something like where do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein senator funds have the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do some Feinstein after you've helped destroy his life\nAct ever so serene as you ruined his life I wouldn't have\nI Would have let them it wears his bank account for all the good work he's done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton stay as president after what he did with the complicity of use Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate those hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war\nI Want to know what you think eight six six Ninety read I matched with Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys didn't hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago and I'm getting this off my chest the second time I'm very fortunate do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard\nThe judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was attacked I don't know exactly what happened and whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies in her story she doesn't know how she got there how she got home\nWhen it was exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said we reached the stage where all you need are allegations\nSo what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on making accusations and stalling every nomination they don't want and ruining everybody's reputation in the process\nNow there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accuse accuse and accuse\nIt's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked thanks to Senator Flake and Murkowski flick at least voted for it [noise] but Murkowski didn't I think she I think there's some movement or recall her and she needs to be recalled\nThe rest of bills fools who allow this process to take place looked by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin uh\nSame can be yours with a flick of your cell phone do the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nTo remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with the judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous\nSenator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive in bowling is with Joe Biden said he witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith and fairness and justice that binds this country together\nAnd see kidding that's a Democrat playbook\nAnd Mitt Romney yeah another genius I mean I was a delegate for him by the way I've got to make in full disclosure\nHe announced the support the decision to wait a week another example of why he lost he doesn't know how to fight these people and that's a point to you have to know how to fight that\nI was going to ask you your least favorite person that you watch during that week and perhaps senator Mazie her on her own or however you surname my top your list especially after comments that men should just shut up\nShe and she by the way a week or so ago she was asked if she was confident Democrats didn't strategically leak Christine forms accusations\nAgainst Canada just days before a committee vote I think it was here's a quote are you confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how to respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer to a doctor for\nA referred to a lawyer host George Stephanopoulos asked her own on ABC's This week and what a chance or she spelled spotted all of these things called do not focus on what we should be focusing which is the credibility of judge Kavanaugh\nShe responded before calling Kavanaugh's claims of political conspiracy against them bizarre\nShe didn't answer and stuff like that to me\nAnd her and she goes on and by the way even as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh\nThat Dr Ford is not being politically motivated by the way she her owner has suggested Kevin did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy\nThat is very clear again if you're on the right you don't want to serve the process of being a a\nA proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated for what you used her you and your masters and deception used her\nBowling branch guarantees

house 'cause\nI mentioned his name before one of my friends are state the Republican committee men from California's a dinner backers in trouble and he's never been in trouble he's in orange county a you know typically the president's party loses the the party in the president empower loop they lose seats\nI think it'd be very close and maybe we'll get lucky and we won't lose the house but I'm really afraid of that happening there's not like where the polls show that you know that a Trump was going to win any one so it's it's possible but that's what I'm saying type a little bit of a lot of people going out\nAnd then they don't expect to go out because the Democrats motivate they hate President Trump they hated cab and all they want no part of this and they're coming out in droves I think and so we have to match that kind of a passion so I'm not really answering it depends on the day in the mood I I tend to be optimistic but\nUh let's see if you ask me to vote today I'll I'll do

representatives and local areas and there I Lived in California is not metro for Republican here either\nBut if enough people were upset and I think they were by Kavanaugh hearings as an example I think they are going to come out in big numbers so I'm not sure there's going to be this\nIncredible blue wave\nI I've been convinced by the way there is a a a strong statement I'm convinced we gonna win the Senate easily or not that that's a big statement for me because of most of the\nRaces that are up for grabs or reason that Trump won ... states that Trump won in a big fashion and so we're going to pick up seats in the Senate I have no doubt about that and that should make you feel better\nBut I think if people are as frustrated as jury appears to be it seems to be a no reason to doubt it\nAcross the country I I don't think the Democrats realize what their reaction is going to be and they may have overplayed their hands in fact I think they did\nBecause even people maybe in the middle had had to have some revulsion to see what was going on they just bag or this guy they just told them apart and what you think Ford was credible or not credible\nHe wasn't treated well and then and then when it's all done I mean they have ... he couldn't win for losing as they say when it's all done they said oh he was belligerent uh yeah I was supposed to just sit back and take\nThe all the

frustration that all I think a lot of people feel out there\nThere may not be this blue it may be much closer than people think and because it's part of the hundred and said this than I thought of the Democrats retaking the house and the hearings and the subpoenas\nAnd the if you think the cabinet hearings were disgusting and revolting wait till these people do it for two years to do everything possible to impeach capital to a beach Trump\nThere are a lot of start there you know how ... works in the house doesn't first and then he's tried and the Senate doesn't matter that they can't when they didn't care that they couldn't win against cap no this'll be showing this'll be and their basis so angry\nYeah I I've never seen anything like this I remember I Want to be fair they hated George W. Bush and you know they thought Al Gore had one in Florida which when they did the results so I I think in a newspaper editorial boards or whoever did it\nAnd only one even came out for Gore and even that was assuming the absolute best scenario for him these people just take if it's possible he Donald Trump that much more\nAnd that's why you have the resistance and that's why you had a soft coup in the Justice Department\nAnd with the FBI at the top echelons where these guys were a lady and that page and so on they were Texan each other where they set up a Carter Page\nOr two for the you know that he was if you're watching that he was\nA spy with the Russians and he was in on the Trump campaign trying to you know make sure that the Hillary lost that means all incredible what these people are up to they literally were acting like a banana republic trust take the election away from President Trump\nThese people angry but if you get out there and you vote there's these gives me a lot of hope and it should give you too\nTo votes because our base that got out and support him and his opposition are flying liberals and this and I like I said earlier Rochester hold them quick this is a tax will spend county now the electrical two thousand six to Trump will do that a photo accept all the county where I live in the twin cities very very liberal counties otherwise\nHe would want to make it we yeah we got to go but you got to make a difference this time as we tried to hear Martin I read I read\n[noise]\n\n\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTax fund to seven nine six four or five that's F.
