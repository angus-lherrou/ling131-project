of\nDetail about a very famous America One hundred years ago his name is Eddie written block or the new book is enduring courage\nEighth pilot any written bucket but also a front door at a record book or after the war celebrated toasted he marries Adelaide finally get sort of divorce from the Bruce will direct\nHowever he's going to go through a bad patch year up to the point is drinking heavily and almost killed himself in a car crash making twenty he repairs himself thanks rattling ... really is an extraordinary story\nYou know they adopt too but Adelaide becomes the reason he lived through the second one I got here\nAny guess control of eastern airline thanks to General Motors selling it to him for three and a half million dollars and he is not a natural educated businessmen but she has a driving need to succeed he has a vision for aircraft he fights ... than the new deal blah\nWell after you got to remember right now so we're looking at a time when the civilian airline system is just being invented\nThere aren't airfields that will support that the American public has a little questionable about whether they want to get in and pay for a seat because it's still kind of dangerous so Eddie and a bunch of these one trip and a bunch of others or creating\nThe infrastructure and the whole idea of civilian airlines that we live with now an FDR\nAnd wanted to kind of get a little bit according to Eddie a little bit more federal\nRegulation end that Eddie felt was warranted you know and and and even had FDR said well you know I'm going to have these uh\nYou know army or air army flyers fly you know these planes and maybe not civilians and uh they started dying and Eddie was a little outspoken about that so he and FDR kind\nOf up to Nineteen thirty said he got through the Nineteen twenties the flapper era the ... the great depression hits America the Nineteen thirties the the recovery is very slow at tastes can take control of eastern airlines\nAnd through the Nineteen thirties the operates that effectively it becomes a money maker once it was free of the automobile industry there was always the automobile industry contributing casually\nAviation commercial aviation but then at commercial aviation becomes viable need to get to the moment that is\nThe most unbelievable in the whole story which is an epilogue almost tearful Eddie in Nineteen forty\nFour forty three forty forgot it asked by Marshall and the commanders of the Pentagon to get out to the guards were in disciplining Eddie knows MacArthur as one of the heroes of the first floor and Eddie was one of the ratio is the first war so he gets on a be Seventy Seventeen\nAnd he takes off out of why is that correct\nThis eight man crew Eddie and seven other as a lose their bearings and a run out miss their little refueling stopping a tiny island in\nThe sun for years old and one of those famous men and all of the United states of America\nAbsolutely and he is going down to is a medal of honor winner and he's going down to chastise a fellow medal of honor winner from the president to say stop you know dumped you know so they they're flying they have to pitch in the middle of the central\nTo sit and have not taken care to know where they are or where they were headed so the ... the the tail speed was too much there of course\nThey're off course they've made some mistakes and and you can just see how this begins to mount it's really creepy to watch it and they are two thousand miles from any continental land masses or a couple of islands hearing their\nChances are they're going to run into Japanese wrecks or two and a half three ... it was two and a half rash when they're small raft and these wraps or about the size of the bath tub three guys in each line on top\nOf the show he didn't take the foodstuffs or the water on the aircraft they forgot yeah\nThey're this was before an eddy would see that this would change later but they also weren't given they weren't in a life raft didn't have water and food and it only a couple of comments a couple of things they had made some Thurman says if because they knew they were going to go down\nOf coffee and sandwiches and I forgot those I think the pilot talked a few oranges in his vast and there they were with no food and water\nAnd nobody knew where they were in the middle of the war\nFloating and sharks we're on the bottom of bumping the Abbott and I'd like to see what making all this stuff so there's the the immediate problem is who's in command\nHim ... absolutely so you've got the captain who is kind of one of the natural but then another guy's a colonel so we are ranks Eddie during the war is decided they said you can be a brigadier general and he said no\nThe um I just want to be a civilian they paid them a dollar a year to go around talking to various groups and to you know the war effort he was a hero and he went and talked to people\nSo it wasn't clear he was the only civilian ... who was the leader and as things got worse and worse they had shut John that as you know they shed a lot of them it shut their\nWay from like a hundred and Ninety pounds a hundred and twenty yes yes it was their living on a few things that can catch yeah uh and I think there was a bird that for a while\nThat's an incredible story a you know as the eighth day and there are sitting in a stupor because the sun has burn them and then they open source and then burn them again the salt water comes there can't talk 'cause they're so dry and they're at their wits at eight days of just no food or water\nAnd Eddie has just ... has a door that Adelaide given them any feel something on his head or pressuring he knows all the other eyes are looking at him and he knows that there is a bird miraculously and he reaches his hands up the crabs that ... and\nLo and behold they chew on this raw saying but most importantly they took the intestines and they uh they had a couple of fish trucks and they were able to catch a couple of fish and then move them over to the next\nAh the the the days are out there are several weeks yes twenty three days um they are dying slowly one guy's one\nDies or had some injury and he was drinking a lot of water a sea water and egos mad and his kidneys fail and he'd they\nPush him off and you and the fight for survival doesn't hang on any although he has the survival skills out there now writing to the rescue was Adelaide how so\nEr what a wonderful story so after two weeks Adelaide they've they've nobody's heard of that ... or so after two weeks secretary maybe says okay writes a letter to Adelaide saying you know nice nice in a nice way she's saying well we're calling off the search\nAdelaide doesn't want anything to do with that so she goes down to Washington DC more just right into the office and says you cannot\nStop looking\nFor this like on this American icon right and the guy says well to the middle of the war in middle of a sudden she says I don't care you do something about it and she probably was salty where their language then too so they extend the search for another week on the last day\nOf that last week and amphibian flyer finds these ... drag old half dead men and save the written\nSoccer back from death one more time in the book is enduring courage John Ross is the author has five ... oh my pleasure I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\n\nDid you know that studies\n\nHave\nDefined interrogation probably an energized and then we have friends who was the Saudi Government is preparing a report that admits officials were responsible for the accidental deaths of journalists ... of course one of the least lumber report\nA Democrat and becoming more so I think what time\nBut I have long since admitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may have very well been the only Republican that could have won that Don me at one point that this is the only guy I think that would have won that election\nIn fact I've wondered out loud if Providence was involved in his election\nAfter all Obama had done you know what did he say was gonna radically change our country\nAnd I thought it might have been too late for America if Hillary had won\nI once asked Bruce ... for those who don't know who he is he ran for the Senate against Barbara Boxer her first time she Iraq and it and I became is that I think they told me is chief surrogate spokesman I Would speak for him when he could make an event and he ... he was poised to win it was fifty fifty I think the weekend before and then\nI'm just thinking about it allowed the Democrats are always this has been in their playbook I said that last night they saved this thing against them that he'd gone to some kind of clumsy so if you knew Bruce ... such an innocent guy\nHe didn't go there for for anything to do with sex or anything like that it was just a place they were going up in fact he was going on I can say this 'cause it came out with one of the hosts set at KBC where I used to be host\nAnd a seven Ninety KBC and it was just like I said oh you want to go here Bruce and he said yes and it was meant to spring on him the last weekend sound familiar with Diane Feinstein or to try to show conservative voters oh look what he was willing to do to go to unseemly nightclubs put it that way\nSo yeah I just thought of that they've always have to send their playbook nothing's new\nBut anyway uh he lost that we can and one of the reasons people said he\nLost was because if you remember a George H Bush had pulled out of California I think in that election that he lost um to Clinton and he pulled out all those funds and then they use all of that to make sure box one but it's fifty fifty before that we can and they pull those dirty tricks\nBut he's a brilliant man and I wanted to ask for surgeons in by the way he worked for Richard Nixon and I I think he said this on the air so I can said he was one of the few that said don't don't to resign don't give this thing up\nYou you remember some people think Nixon was impeached wasn't impeach the he withdrew for the sake of the country even though a lot of people thought Richard Nixon was was pretty bad but Bruce that I went with him there and I I tried to convince them not to resign but he said no we're going to do it for the sake of the country anyway I asked Bruce once almost beat Barbara Boxer\nFor the U.S Senate from California if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country Bruce always taught me something whenever he was on and he answered of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd it was it also Providence I Would ask myself that we got George Washington when we needed him so badly remember\nThey wanted to make him king if you know your history and he turned it down and you know set up I'm going to retire or president says okay that's enough and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most you wouldn't get any argument for me about gods involvement\nAnd now I think you're going to ... I think I'm Crazy we got Donald Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most as long ago was saying you know Providence I don't know but I wouldn't you wouldn't get any argument from me\nYesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't say much either considering who he was running against right and I remember many of us thought we would be very satisfied if President Trump\nWould just nominate conservative judges that that was enough especially for the Supreme Court we all are a lot of people I knew thought hey that would work for me that's that's enough right there and I think a lot of people across the country felt that way [noise]\nSo I thought we were way ahead of the game when he appointed a Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but it didn't stop there and I'll just mention some of them are things he's done a metro ... much better lists last night\nEnding the bomb a care mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline remember Obama wouldn't do it and I n war reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy and the proof is how well the economy is doing\nA significant tax cuts lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax one is by the way it was ... and the same one I mentioned who years before his time say we should be able to fill out or a tax returns on a postcard and then everybody copied them years later and ah that that is eventually the where they want to go with us\nMoving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal I didn't talk much about that last night can imagine we paid them hundreds of billions of dollars under fifty billion under Obama gave them secret cash on a plane which he denied\nPay them off for what they're our biggest enemy ... you know do you feel like I Do that you live that I live on a different planet I mean don't you ... always of our biggest enemies or at least the ones killing our soldiers right now we give them money to eat them to\nHurt us and hurt our people that alone I mean is incredible eight six six nine to read I Want to know what you think about the Iranian deal is incredible eight six six same number nine o seven thirty three thirty nine\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly reduce the denuclearization of the ... and then Sheila getting American remains return from North Korea [noise]\nMaking sure our borders means something I admit that hasn't been solved yet we're gonna talk we didn't last night about the the Marshall people from Honduras opt to request asylum that's going to be a winning a situation for him to deal with and I'm saying that obviously sarcastically\nAppointing countless conservative just listen to the lower court's not\nRight you watch federal judges and ah you know the ninth district which is a crazy district gets overturned the most saying things like a you know he Trump the president can't do is they can't do that it's a Muslim ban and all this kinda stuff and they've taken power and their own hands well some porn that he points these lower court judge the federal judges to\nAnd of course the naming now of a second Supreme Court choice another conservative break out on the list goes on and off and the American people love that he's not politically correct the American people are tired of all those politicians who spin and spin and spin\nAnd are afraid to see what they're really thinking so maybe he does too much but at least you you get people love his honesty or at least he says what he means\nYou can never say that about President Trump that he doesn't say what it means he may say to watch but he never says two little I came up with that one\nHe was one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he's done a great job and most the American people get it but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left the Democrats and liberal listeners will call me let me know what you think and I said last night I just said softly if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that\nAnd he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nAnd I don't know if you feel the same way I think each day he's becoming more and more presidential he's growing into the job if you remember Harry Truman to replace the FDR and people set off I teach government history too so I Know some of the stuff and they said oh he's going to be awful terrible but they said she grew into the job also\nYou were dreaming by the way if you think he's going to be defeated I just want it tells you cuts out there on the other side you failed to get rid of him but not from lack of trying you start in the day he was not a Salafi is now actually we know they started the resistance against them much before election day\nWhat was election day came they couldn't believe that this ... so called bumbling fools had one All right he was so bumbling but he's still one right no matter what the upper lead or of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed right where we've seen the text between page and struck and all that stuff\nHe won I don't know about you but I was teaching at that time at night and I was almost in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania which was always seems to me like Republicans ... goal you know we're going to wait at this time going to win Pennsylvania we got it down\nAnd not only did he win but despite their best efforts he won he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years\nNo matter the Mahler persecution or OK prosecutors persecution to me no matter the hostile media media no matter the never Trump voters which I can never undo it\nAnd no matter all the elites and the swamp\nPresident Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them\nAnd despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed I fault attorney general sessions for that I'm going to talk about that more later\nHe she never have recused himself he played into the Democrats hands politicians typically talk their officers that's not a big deal to talk to them may have talked to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike the things would be better when he got re elected\nThat he you know make more stuff happened I've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general\nAnd disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSession should've made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened in grad school staffers did you hear that he threatened them as they help their bosses conduct oversight and justice disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption in his agency that amazed me\nThis is all gotten way out of hand and it was clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime if anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest ... of our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI\nWe've seen the past couple of nights some freezing rain in the

race is too many tics and he was a strange\nCat and of course ... if\nThey were if the American public even knew what Clinton the damage she would have done which was been era terrible we would never

this debt of a a hundred and fifty billion dollars we gave to Iran\nTrump ... go on the bandstand and say we could've built Detroit we could have put millions of black Americans back to work and train

and why they gave it to them I don't have a clue\nI I have a clue and he uh didn't feel the way we do about a who your enemies are and who your friends are writing was mean to our friends in in ... a really nice to some of our enemies I'd like your idea I think it's a great on the imagine if you went around and you see in the country and the campaign stump saying he cause people kind of feeling\nYou know they hear a hundred and fifty billion or whatever you know and it doesn't they don't relate to but I'm saying hey we could rebuild the trend is going to rebuild a you know she she
