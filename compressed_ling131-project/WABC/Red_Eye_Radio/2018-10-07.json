K. Dr fraud as the ... not the survivor [noise] yeah that was amazing but I really want to talk to you because you you brought up this really um\nYou know traumatic um topic about abortion\nAnd how the lot you know it was really\n\nJust like they're so petrified because I'm Norma ...\nBest known as Jane roe I'm\nSo glad I tell you in the middle of the un what did I catch you in the middle of eating a sort of [laughter]\nDo you what you want me to come back do you do you want to do you want to finish that and then I'll come back here\nOh you're just always like to like bring him in it like this [laughter]\nYou don't laugh at your flatulence and then you got me and now it's like oh my God I'm starving and now Larry comes to me but yeah whenever it's good for you I'm I'm with you all night they well our you've done or you do have a lot I can go ahead no just that there's there are so petrified\nBecause this was a legal um decision that\nTo make it a national um a forum versus the state issue and that even the uh plaintiffs in this case the norm Corby us AKA Jane roe\nShe um became part of the pro life movement has never been voted on and they're just petrified because they know that the American public if it ever came to a bout that this is not especially when you get into the\nPartial birth abortion and the federal government paying through a um a Planned Parenthood and all the\nIssues about it I mean I Wish I was never a legal issue it so I hate even talking about this because I think it's a personal issue and I always believe like Steve Ford that we would try to change people's hearts\nAnd you know not through the law um because we ever your whole like newborn baby and you think of like what could have been if\nYou know I I feel that this is just like such a personal thing that's become this um you know heightened\nUh and I think that that was the whole thing about cabinet yeah well that's what they knew that he was strong\nRight and let me let me bring it back to that and I'm going to let you go just so you can finish eating what isn't shall people taking showers people eating\n[laughter] and what was talking about the Jewish what was that I missed that I somehow missed that last week but\nGetting back to our topic and talking about the abortion unlike some of the people that were accusing Brett Kavanaugh I Believe him when he says roe versus Wade as presidents I Believe him when he says that some of these rulings or presidents on precedents I don't think he's going to overturn roe versus Wade\n... I don't I\nIn in Nebraska is now strong Republican so\nI don't I don't think the Republicans have any chance of losing that see so the cabinet effect so far especially in the Senate has been pro Republican Joe from queens you're on Seventy seven W everything are\nTwo things first all talk about for the testimony I I was curious about how she had no lead and to what happened upstairs you didn't mention any crude comments downstairs leading up to that if that was a little bit of a curiosity yeah\nJulie ... most importantly in that how did you get in the bedroom with those two guys\nRight I mean did you just walk up with them did they invite interrupted gee did you go up and they they they\nWent up and I in fact they she went to the bathroom and they were outside the bathroom and I pushed her through the door\n... yes yes but so she went to the bathroom and when she got out she didn't know they were there\nThat aren't ready for what you say\nAnd then so then she made it downstairs pass them without them singer\nRight right and then and then if you look at cabin or the guy was very regimented at that time so he wouldn't have to have been somewhat of a Jekyll and Hyde to do something like that not only overall but also within the moment within within the evening\nNow I also want to get to that George ... professor ...\nAh that was a that was pretty incredible tweet and then the Georgetown ... the president said well this free speech\nBut I mean if you're looking for in a row thank God they they acts to a very expensive show based on a one of her tweet\nThe let's look at the ... let me stay on the phone ... between look at the look at those core is seven titles white men justifying a serial rapist\nAggregated entitlement all of them deserve miserable death while feminist laugh as they take their last gas bonus we cast rate their corpses and feed them to swine\nYes so\nTake a look at that take a look at that tweet and now turned it around let's turn it around and say that that was first of all\nAbout Democrats secondly that it was talk since they talk about white men so many let's say that that was talked about Hispanics or a black man and and now let's say that instead of cast reading their corpses they're talking about women and we talk about cutting off their breasts would any of that\nBe acceptable not one part of that will be acceptable and if it's not acceptable for one sex and not acceptable for one race or not acceptable for one gender then it shouldn't be acceptable at All right\nWell she the woman personally I mean she's not the south side of the box if she ever won an affair with a with a a white man and and the future just knock out a huge percentage of a man from our life\nI I don't think that her dating is the worst part about that the the the prospects of her dating it's the fact that she is that she is now asking the people be mutilated and killed because she doesn't agree with him politically by the way it all starts off with her saying that\nThey that he's a rapist without without it being proved that he's a rapist that all of the senators up there that are supporting him or or helping him are backing up a rapist and that\nAll of them not only the rapists but all of them the alleged rapist but all of them should be killed and castrated\nYeah but you have to think about a tweet I mean if you sent this to somebody privately you're putting that out in public your professor at Georgetown your people know that we can get all over the planet you\nKnow I I get it I I and the fact that and that's a good point and Thanks Joe that's a good point the fact that she felt safe and tweeting that because she knew that in this political environment she would be protected\nBecause she's attacking white men she couldn't attack anybody else\nAnybody else she couldn't attack a black man she couldn't attack the female that's the point I was making Bernard Goldberg wrote a great book called bias and if you've never read it it's outdated now I get it some of the stuff but the biases still the same\nAnd he talked about how men in especially white men this was even back\nTwo decades ago when the book was written that white man it's okay to say things you could never say about anybody else in fact there was a guy that\nStood a woman up at the altar and Katie Couric was on the morning show at the time on the today show and this is according to Bernard Goldberg and said boy I ... you would you like to cast write him and everybody left\nEverybody laughed at that horrible horrible thing you could do to somebody to cash trade them she thought it was funny and everybody thought it was funny because it was okay to go after a white man\nThat's okay the kid about that and that's OK to say horrible things about them and Bernard Goldberg some magic if I said I wanted to cut off for breast shouldn't be cut off her breasts\nYou'd be you'd be fired like she would be fired this professor from Georgetown would be fired had she said that not talked about cast rating white men Tom from blue Point New York you're on Seventy seven WABC\nYet and Trump's you just ignore all these these people that are filled with hate everything schooling in place he's going to get reelected you unemployment the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine with three ... three point seven percent yup you get a cat who got us MCA\nHe's helping out form is he's getting up with China and eventually will move that was a new NAFTA deal\nYeah yeah you know how to build that wall before twenty twenty and he's a few and I'll tell you what do you have a very happy uh Columbus said there\nAre ... to job thanks for calling I really appreciate it\nI I yeah I think he will be reelected because I think peace and prosperity still matters but it is incredible that because of the cast something nobody talked about the fact that unemployment is at its lowest and\nFifty years it's amazing it just keeps getting better\nAnd so going into going into an election with no war\nWith our greatest enemy ISIS defeated with the fact that we're going into talks with North Korea and unemployment is down to three point seven percent there's no way he doesn't get reelected if he does it it would be unprecedented\nSheryl from Ohio high I understand you're listening on line\nI Am and this is my first time listening to you and I'm loving it show\nA show I I really appreciate it I now since you're in Ohio could you tracked down Tom there was a guy named Tom that used to always call\nFrom Ohio [laughter] and I and our new city [laughter]\n[noise] I heard you say that earlier yeah I'll put on an ...\nOr so what is it about Ohio that shirt Brown's going to win reelection easily\n[noise] well I I should tell you I'm I'm I mean you're in Ohio now because I have a company here but I'm originally and New Yorker okay so and I still go back and forth so my loyalties are ... politically remain with New York although I started getting swept up into the politics here\nIn Ohio as well I think you know I Can't figure out why these people do what they do ... ... ... intellectually speaking charged round should have no chance whatsoever class and then be to age where he's got you know these past allegations from his wife on\nIn their court filings where she claimed that he you know pushed her up against the wall and made her feel fry it and then I mean it you know her allegations against him are far worse than drifting for the allegations against them judge Kavanaugh yet Indiana nice things could\nBe holding on and it looks like he's going to get re elected\nOh he's there they're pulling money from the guys running against him and so I think the Republicans are giving up the race to Sherrod Brown it's incredible to me I I thought that he was vulnerable and I guess he is and it's especially because Trump won the state by like nine points so I slow\nI no longer I mean I live in a ... I'm I'm a huge huge Trump supporter and I um I live actually got invited to the inauguration because I um I I gave a lot of money and was very involved with the campaign when we had the um\n[noise] convention here in uh in Cleveland and so I was there and I mean I just love love love love President Trump so much you have no I mean I Can't even express how proud I Am a tan and the job that he's doing\nSubtle when I was at that convention in Cleveland and Cleveland did wonderful job did it in a great job\nI mean the the chief of police and the ... there was such a small handful of protesters and he kept them so far away from the convention center that you know you wouldn't know what was going on I mean it it we had no incidence which is great\nOh well thanks for the insight I woke up\nIt I thought the gym came was gonna win easily just from what I see and\nThat's what everybody's trying to say but there is calculating\nWell we'll see I'll tell you his latest commercial he put out\nHe's challenging Tim Kaine to release the names of the senators that Iran that slush fund\nAll right that's smart that's a good idea hey Mary I got to go but thanks electrical and I thought it was good to hear from you again you know from the Bronx zoo that\nSays here's you know under your name where they write what you want to talk about\nIt says star of the show [noise]\nI thought you're going to play a a George third goes it's a you know back to the bowling pin for me you know\nI should do you want that to be a theme song it should be a theme so\nShow from a cops because that's appropriate for me\nAnyway I think we have the second coming of a sunny assure you know the Johnny Boy from Staten Island and Judy Judy Judy from Brooklyn they're like the new Sonny and Cher only the Arctic or Johnny boys ... Sonny was I don't know what the Judy but either way\nYou know what it looks like you you look it up pictures in\nWell I Know that he added a fourth listener to his podcast that nobody listens to is Judy from Brooklyn but anyway it's the same number of people who watch or TV show you know Jersey martyrs so anyway you\nKnow we have we actually have ratings on that so I Know exactly how many people in okay like that and let me let me tell you\nOccasionally I when I tune into Jersey motors I have to readjust to the collar on my TV set because of that Bert orange track or\nYours will tell you how many people who want to tell you how many people are twenty five thousand or your service you really twenty five thousand are that many many action in New York and New Jersey that to an end yeah apparently you do too\nWell only because I'm waiting for the reruns wild wild west to come on after your show anyway it's time for a reality check because of course all the Trump crack heads are calling it the night and Johnny Boy says that I was wrong all yeah I'm wrong okay here here's a reality check for Johnny Boy so they kind of corporate this it\nWas low rate of podcast reality check number one Obamacare is alive and well the Republicans that repeal it\nNumber two there's not one more square foot of wall that separates Mexico from the United states and not a single dollar bill has been advocated by funding by the Republican controlled house and Senate\nAnd as far as judge Kavanaugh is concerned I'm telling you they're at right now he is never going to vote to repeal roe versus Wade because this man is the second coming of Anthony Kennedy\nHe clerked for Kennedy Kennedy recommend that him and not to mention Kavanaugh was a member and is still a member in good standing of the Bush crime family so therefore that makes him\nA a slime ball Republican and it also makes them more moderate who maybe might lead to the right but more often than left he's going to go with the two of the Bush tax on the court who should get replaced and find a way\nVoter fraud and voter ID laws are not being enforced why\nBecause that wonderful groundhog we have for an attorney general you know the result that didn't want to get involved with the Russia Russia Russia Marcia Marcia Marcia investigation well you know that the same guy who's been hiding out for the last Nineteen twenty watch hasn't done a bad thing\nDoing was voter fraud laws or voter ID laws\nAnd in the Republican states the so called red states\nThat are all going to come out and vote for the Trapster and his candidate they haven't enforced voter fraud laws and photo ID laws either that's why Ted Cruz is in trouble and Texas and let me tell you something if taxes tours blow America turns blow and we're all screwed\nBecause they're going to be thousands of mutants mine grows and ... we're going to vote in Texas are going to pick up teddy boy because he didn't have a pair of balls in the Senate Judiciary committee you didn't go after the Christine Blasey Ford viewer Chrysler when he should've should've now they're in a steady lead job a God\nThe prosecutor to his job form what other rather than him showing some are as a because there's an a type reelection and race\nAnd as far as the Republicans\nAre not going to reward Lindsey Graham nasty or the ... from Maine Susan Collins because they were thinking ahead to their own sorry ashes and their own sorry re elections\nAnd I'll tell you something else Murkowski what a paragon of ... she was when she bought a president today just like Obama that Fifteen times when he was on the U.S Senate auditioning for a spot in the president's White House\nSo I'm not going to reward rhino slobs establishments fly balls and I'm certainly not going to fall down the Johnny Boy and his toy piano from his pot guys that only four people listen to\nAnd Judy I tell you right now that wrap that you came out with today I got to tell you that was about five cock roaches that were in my kitchen they just turned up inside they put their six legs up in the air\nWhen you came on the air and you started screeching that rap crap\nSo I thought what your job or I\nYou know good call but a lot of those things you said with incorrect first of all\nI'm looking at video of new wall going up along the Arizona Mexico border\nAs you're speaking of is looking it up and this is just from three days ago I'm looking at new wall being constructed along the border so when you say there's not one inch of new wall going up your role also the Affordable CARE Act\nYou're right it didn't get repealed but many of the things including the including the mandate have been taken away\nSo um I\nI agree with you with roe versus Wade roe versus Wade will never be overturned so

said I Try to get everybody on but what can I say the show is becoming popular [noise]\nWould be offering free brought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human which is spelled G you aren't she U M I n now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most powerful\nSupersedes on the planet you can positively influence R D an AA meeting joint comfort Chelsea inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this we talked about this on fear a few minutes ago just patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula\nOf course human which seven times ...\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know the term curriculum and they may well note tumor wreck group which is a yellow spice and it shows\nUp in curies and it's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying tumor wreck and its derivative ... since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied is this\nA couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined health so if people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these agents in the brain that protect the actual issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred and fifty milligrams of this stuff\nYou get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another Kirk human extract so this in my opinion is one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances\nOn earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I knew that we turn to him or the ... the green tea in the ... humid in your new green she she aren't liquid ...\nFormula which purity given away for free today and first tell me about the third nutrient on the list the spiritual which is super hot right now there was no some of the headlines and the science behind ... spiritual I Know it's from red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera troll is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows\nUp and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties\nYou look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and insulin sensitivity resveratrol helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator\nYou know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy\nIt is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine ate a lot of cheese they smoke\nCigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but ... appears to be key in that and additionally there is a brain benefit like there is with the Kirk human\nWith blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resveratrol you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that we are just plain take too long to explain\nIt again we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Chris let's laser in on how this wonderful formula you created an injunction maturity products\nI Know that purity has been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years ago ... reading from the better Business Bureau and people can get a complementary bottle of this green T. C. R. today we'll get that number out in a few minutes but first what\nDoes this she are being foreign second you designed this formula in a liquid soft you know why do you like the liquid soft you know technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human and or is there a trial\nThe big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful\nProtective amount the recent that it's in a liquid soft shell is that that allows for rapid end very complete absorption I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when you have a fluids soft\nShell you just happen to get more quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption into the intestines\nThat means that your body utilize is more of the ingredients and the supplements soak Greenpeace ER is green tea Kirk human interest Vera trial\nAnd the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for the three particular ingredient\nNow of course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complementary bottle green tea see our show me this you wanted to buy this green tea plus the patented B.

is a doctor from one of the biggest hospitals in Philadelphia and I can tell you the most people say oh I'm all the way\nFrom Jersey City or wherever or\nLong Island oh we'll patients from around the world where the patient flew in from China that depression is flew in from Mobile Alabama for Israel from India and this patient came in she came in with their children [noise]\nShe's fifty seven she's an anesthesiologist and she puts people to sleep just three children and she came in with her children their daughter\nFor progressive cancer in the intestines and she's been emailing me for about a year\nShe has cancer it's growing in the primary side and she's been getting chemotherapy which are chemicals that go on living\nAnd she's putting him into therapy she was fine until two years ago and two years ago showed abdominal pain and she said by surgeons gastroenterologist an adventure was found to have blood in the store and she had a CAT scan colonoscopy inches found a of a cancer\nOn what's called the ... front of the right side of the abdomen\nAnd there was a Ninety percent of collusion with cancer traveled to the liver and to the skin so she came to her doctors with a blockage with a lot of the stool with stage four cancer\nAnd she's been on chemo for a year and three quarters so doctors at the super duper places in Philadelphia too\nAnd she's been on for a year and three quarters and uh her cancer market the C. E. A. originally it was six hundred done before and now it's going up\nAnd the cancers growing in the primary side she just had a new seat the skin cancers growing the primary side and in the abdomen and she has liver metastases and she's planning immunotherapy\nAnd she has a domino pain and she has partial obstruction she never had a PET scan so the best test\nShe never has has not only doctors it's super duper places in New York but\nA lot of chemo doctors just don't like to get the best test to visualize the cancer I guess to think and that doesn't matter or the thinking they're going to give chemo for the rest of life for the patient this is a\nPretty young looking healthy looking woman even though she has stage for cancer which is another point not look like or crippled up in pain to have cancer if you saw her walk the streets as\nGood shape and she was physically in good shape\nAnd well she's had this cat scans and the CAT scan shows that the mess in the colon is increasing as liver metastases ... in the abdominal cavity itself [noise]\nShe said to breast surgery\nFor other conditions you said two C sections deliver babies\nShe was born in Trinidad examines her her exam is pretty normal so suppressive that it was pretty normal family even though she has a cancer the colon cancer a liver\nAnd that shows you another teaching point the limitations of physical exam that it's it's not so possible to feel everything from the outside of what's going on inside [noise] so we spoke about all the options for her we spoke about the fact that the chemo was not working\nShe got to have him in a therapist should try that she's been on a variety of medicines for a year and three quarters and does that work at the cancers grow and back and we have plenty of data for treating the cancer in\nThe cold and and she was shocked has been getting chemotherapy advice for nearly two years of no one has ever told her about radio surgery no one ever told her she can come to a doctor Lederman who have a highly successful treatment to the cancer in the colon itself\nShe was shocked and I gave her booklets and shoulder examples of a string cancers and the correct or coal or area with success and we most commonly have success will be talking about another patient who had a big cancer and the transfers coal and\nTurn it only with radio surgery with success so for her she was ... she does not want anyone operating on her\nIt was just something that people do a lot about medicine often once the least conventional opening surgery and chemotherapy treatments she's had chemo for a year and a three quarters is just not working any longer\nSo are we able to treat the mess in the colon packs lecture yes we have experience probably the most of America we were first of America with radio surgery\nExperienced treating cancer and the liver yes we've treated the thousands of patients with cancer and deliver this is what we do every day here at radio surgery\nSo for
