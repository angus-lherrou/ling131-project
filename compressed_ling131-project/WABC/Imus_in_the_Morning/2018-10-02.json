{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "That's true and by the way that a rule was Merrick Garland was initiated by Senator Joe by none other than by didn't himself\nBack in Nineteen Ninety two when Bush forty one was president so uh that argument goes out the window then that was their rule and I'll ask you this Sebastian Gorka this FBI or investigation now that this one week FBI that the foxhole flake or made the sex so called compromise with the Democrats\nThe president is trying to look at the silver lining and says this might actually be a blessing in disguise it might just be something good for the Republicans how do you see that\nWell it could be because you know the that they will find nothing ... about first absurd ... this demand by the Democrats and by flake\nOr perhaps the highest ranking individual outside of the president and us governments days his son in law ... Kush though\nIt took the FBI a year and a half hour to finish his background investigation a year and a highly gentleman that Jack ...\nAnd now the FBI gets six days to investigate allegations from thirty six years ago the whole thing is a joke but when they find nothing\nThen we'll have to ask the question what are the Democrats going to do that and my fear is that they'll find somebody in the next six six days to lie about Brett Kavanaugh at that very very dangerous\nYeah I think you're right I think that ... central planning on doing what what'd you think though are Sebastian for folks that have been hurt you or seen you on television the last couple of days one\nOne misfortune actually first spoke with was there any point any point during those procedures on stories that what you thought oh my God you know what she she may be telling the truth and capital may be in trouble\nThere's this one I I I don't know what happened to her I don't know if she believes you know that this is ... I ... I was in that I have no idea whether it's\nA mistake that I didn't do something else but this one very serious floor with a story if this person didn't have a driver's license and was taken hope\nOff this incident how is it how is it that of all the things she can't remember she can't remember who got her hope because if this event to cook and she almost full she was going to be killed or rape\nShe the person who saved her from that incident would be has save you a full life she would never ever forget\nLate on a great point\nIt's just like it just something something is think about it I I you know clearly she has some issue here but how she can't remember the person who saved up for what she calls one of the most horrific events in her life I don't buy\nAny of the uh among the Democrats I mean some of them are just uh I I mean this was a sleazy tactic again Senator Dianne Feinstein sitting on this this whole time as you know\nAnd but the couple of the other people and the Judiciary Committee like Senator Blumenthal Who Lied about serving in Vietnam and then and then questions\nOr questions capitals credibility and as a from New Jersey senator or Cory grow up or I mean this for these people to sit there on their high horse and a cast aspersions on on the on a falsely accused man\nI strikes me as something that the American people see\nCory Booker admits the groping a high school students Richard Blumenthal\n... lives repeatedly about having a combat tour in Vietnam\nWe have Kamala Harris who ... the man who's in his sixties when she's thirty for the for for her political career benefit and then we have Senator Feinstein hope for Twenty years has a Chinese spy on her payroll and these are the people who are going to take the moral high\nGround of a man who has nothing nothing\nTo be ashamed of in his whole life it's absolutely outrageous and the one lesson for all of the list as if they can do this to a man who is this ... this is Brett Kavanaugh they can do it to anybody you included\nWhat do you think about is his friend though the other guy George and I know that um somebody was making the argument maybe it was crash you ever get on friday\nOr this guy's an admitted alcoholic he's surprised by the way he may be some of those things ... because of what he did years and years ago between us if in fact he\nIs guilty of anything that's been cited the last couple of days so what do you think about the possibility that his buddy was somebody who did some of these things not having all buddy buddy judge\nI I don't accuse people of things like\nThat without evidence while he drinks too much how many people in America to drink too much of it is absurd as the questions about boxing and Kavanaugh's\n[laughter] really\nNo you're absolutely right Sebastian Gorka who by the way he was the assistant to the president for for a while there uh\nYeah so let's move on quickly uh and he's got a book out by the way why we fight why we fight it's a great read\nAnd or will motivate are a lot of people but uh this is a president or vice president Trump\nHe's been pretty restrained through this whole process uh he had the un has stopped and he just completed this trade deal that everybody said he couldn't complete with Mexico and Canada ... we we did rework the NAFTA agreement I mean he's getting stuff done\nGetting stuff done in ways that

her up the very first day when when ... when ... board was sitting there testifying\nTo her describe right to her just credit I should say yeah it was a it was pretty horrible and NBC knew it as well yet they still they still want with it NBC or the network not even the MSNBC the network\nIn fact it was Kate Snow who interviewed her and Kate Snow said the following yesterday I Believe it or not about when she she prefaced the whole interview with this but still went through with an\nNBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her clients there are things that she told us on camera\nThat differ from a written statement we've been trying to independent to reach out to anyone who were attending parties which only sweating like I'm Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names so far we've not found anyone who never statute also unclear about when she first decided to come forward see\nI disagree with you I'm going to give kids no credit if she had gone on with this interview and never played that this claim or basically beforehand and just acting as if everything's sweating except with the fact\nThat would be one thing but that's a very powerful statement by Kate Snow letting people know from the very beginning they got nothing I mean so I'm not exactly sure what the what you did wrong she said they got nothing no corroborating evidence we got to contact\nI Would say that she said we got nothing right but we're going to put it on an well why not got ratings well how did you go\nOkay by me was one of the stars the journalistic ethics behind I'll stop with that no corroborating evidence we have nothing but much less put\nHer up but what if she didn't make that point I could see why you'd be upset this morning I can what did he made the point well whatever you you could ah we we report you decide but here's the ex boyfriend of this uh um after mentioned the sweat Nick lady the ex boyfriend then there's a bunch of other ladies you got to a boatload of problems is what he said about her\nRight after I broke up or her she basically call me many times and I wasn't going to basically say you will never never see your child alive bond or I Want to you know I just want to go over there where they can you guys on that that really is killing me a little bit and\nSo that's that that's more of that goes by the second now but it it is it is all out there and a ... he was out there saying that he was spiking punch with a with quite luge but you know and I\nActually saw a story where um the form of very popular New Jersey nets and New York Nick\nChris Dudley who played for the next between Nineteen eighty nine in Nineteen Ninety three\nAnd a niche between Ninety seven and two thousand big white center could make a free throw for his life but break physical player played excluded basketball at Yale supposedly Dudley and capital became like best buddies and they've gotten a bar fight together in Virginia\nAnd according to this story which by the way there was no police report filed Dudley actually\nIt's somebody with a glass bottle hosing the person in the bar to bleed profusely and sending Brett Kavanaugh all\nThis is the ... you may have like a Christine Blasey Ford you may have the venues a little off but you're right essentially\nI Believe the bar fight occurred in Virginia it was up at you know I think it was in Virginia years later it was up and yelled during his junior year according to the information that I have well let me say this they had gone to a a a concert\nAnd when they got back to the bar the Yale bar they they missed took go they thought that there was a guy there who looked like the lead singer\nFor the band they had gone to see which was you be forty okay this guy alley Campbell and they were looking at 'em and that guy he noticed them looking at them they look back at him he looked over and he says stop looking at right when I was at that point that um\nThat the ... the fight broke out because I was very young teen eighty five yes and they say that uh it was a cabin or that through the beer ice or something yeah he's ... and then it was a guy that took the bottle and smashed the guy over the face that's what caused him to bleed\nProfusely suddenly there was a there was a police report filed but there were no arrests\nAnd everybody denied everything and uh you'll be forty guy has not been reached yet but uh how you'd be forty in the action and then I'm forty or this or they they drag got another Yale plus the the new thing is now that the shifting the\nI don't know some people say moving the goalposts from sexual assaults who he lied about the extent of his drinking during his testimony and that alone\nShould sink this guy that he he missed characterized the extent of his drink and this is the party of Ted Kennedy by the way [laughter] that's kinda funny when they put it that way it's throw at and so this is this is one of his\nUh uh Kavanaugh's Yale classmates who was out there who does not want to see this guy on the Supreme Court does what he said\nShe read we usually I never saw him but I saw him drunk\nSo they have never saw pests already so I'm quite drunk in in college so keep 'em off the bench for God's sakes so anyway it's a full court press and I would say one more thing one more thing about it a a Megan Kelly once again and this is again saying this stuff on NBC the the network that aired\nThe sweat Nick interview she said about this whole while sweating egg thing or she really elated on ... take a listen\nShe allegations have our own conduct or it didn't it during a sensitive Portland Company Eighteen years ago that company claims she told that she graduated from Johns Hopkins that they learned at the school had no record of her she also falsely describe your work experience at a prior employer they said that she engaged in unwelcome actually had to conduct herself\nShe made false retaliatory allegation against her coworkers\nThat they had been inappropriate with her and said she kept medical leave and simultaneously claim unemployment benefits at the same time and they say there was a restraining order filed against her by an ex boyfriend so the people who are very upset that the CIA that looking into Julie sweating that allegation there are reasons for that\n[laughter] well that's the end of that there you go Megan Kelly just a\nPunch during the ... basically I can tell he's been coming up ... she really has yeah she has a one really come around on Megan Kelly I Hope she has a a a rock solid the ironclad contract over there while they can't possibly the or\nThe other insiders at NBC couldn't possibly like that they may not like it but they may like it because everybody else is so the other side that\nFor the network it it's probably good take advantage to it and say look with ... right exactly right exactly where ... you know she's been on the money look I got to be honest with you I Want this thing to be over I don't care about Julie sweat Nick cared about not care about Ford obviously I cared about capital\nBut every single day new stories new nonsense President Trump pretty much singing the same thing\nOver and over again Kevin supporters saying the same thing over and over and over again\nThese stories that are coming out no not even a salacious to be honest with you I mean a bar fight with Chris ... so to me this is kind of out living it's got\nTo the point is was doing a delay the lay and ah have stuff come out of the woodwork and ... and give you a cabinet ... to say to hell with it right somebody else while it's working\n[laughter] let's see if we got a big show coming up today we'll talk more

starting to play good and that's a great site\nYet but you can never tell Bucky Dent in the burning so Joe Bucky leading up to that game in Nineteen Seventy eight you guys are\nIn August you will fourteen games back in a couple of your age pitchers catfish hunter Jim Beatty whoever remembers they were both hurt they were both hurt so what what was a process like I mean did you really really think that it was feasible for you guys to do to accomplish what you accomplished\nOh absolutely I mean you know we're on the air before these guys are professionals that they knew how to do it you know and it was just a matter of getting healthy Austin was when you know the the baseball first have next door to the store to get some guy shirt and we started to get healthy and\nWe are we're sort of we can make up one game a week of September ... regardless of an and that's that's what we'll catch them and that's exactly what happened you know we got healthy then the one guy that I just you know the answer too much about it\nAnd gives you that you're just a phenomenal you know a young you know every fifth day we knew we were going to win and they were\nCaptors came back and beat it came back we started getting healthier than we started putting together for five game winning streaks and as we got close um you know the feeling changed and we want him to September and and uh and did what we have to do\nThey talk about the uh you know the great years to ... may when the young this you're good and in eighty five was as good as it got luggage read\nThat you know in Seventy eight but you guys was was just so amazing you know really started a monkey with the Boston Massacre that game and early September when Willie Randolph knocked in five runs I think that's kind of the time you guys started to feel like we're going to catch his mother I for ...\nOh yeah oh yeah we want to know the first game than you know a a we've made him and then uh you know we swept him and then we went back home and uh and play them at home and uh you know everything changed I mean you can feel the the electricity and you know in in one big thing that that\nAlways talked about you know is the fact that\nYou know when ... took over you know the papers were on strike bomb lemon time yes so every everything kind of calm down and everybody could like relaxing just you know concentrate on playing the game baseball and and that's what happened\nYou know it's amazing to the Bucky Dent you actually won the world series MVP which is sort of overlooked in all this horrible\nYeah you know with with this a home run forty years ago I mean that was a big deal\nThat was you know uh you know we just uh you know people just remember that you know because it was the one big moment we're kind of the whole world shut down and it seems like you know everybody was watching the game you know it was a holiday and ah everybody's stayed home and and that's the thing I I I get a ... amazed that you know forty years ago and\nPeople walk up to me is not a day goes by somebody and say hey you know seven years old in Iran all my um you know the red Sox fans you know they hate either Yankee fans love me you know Red Sox fans you know the the Iran home you hit the home run out through my TV out the window you know I get a chuckle out of that but\nYeah I remember that game you know sports is that gave a big moments and that was\nA big moment I mean it was like when I was watching you\nKnow ... when he broke my heart when it hits home rather beat the Yankees you know in the world series\nThat's very good analogy Bucky Dent forty years ago today the big ... against the red Sox but like Bernie said great point burning goes on to win the world series MBP against the Dodgers so I don't know this monkey but you weren't in the New York papers this week\nYou know why [laughter] no\nOkay it's a great story or something to do what they know not so bad it's well it is actually kind of it's all about football so the general yeah I Know the jets Bucky get blown out by Jacksonville on Sunday so they're interviewing the jets head coach Todd Bowles after the game and he says and I quote\nWhat can I say I don't know what else I can do talking about preparing his team to play well according to my friend Mike McConnell when the New York post\nWhen you imagine the Yankees in the eighties early eighties\nAnd you guys are like Eighteen and thirty one I guess after some loss you came out and said the same exact thing that Todd Bowles said last Sunday the differences Chris Johnson didn't fight over time bowls but George Steinbrenner did sign up for you is that accurate\nI mean you know we wash has talked in you know a ... tough games\nYou know ah that week and then you know uh I I think Randy belonged to hit a home run in the eighth and appellate game up and we wound up getting squeezed or whatever and then\nUm you know uh you know I was just one of those moments where it's a you know it's a hey you know it was almost like what am I going to do you know we lost a tough game you know so all we gotta go we've got to go back and play tomorrow so maybe they didn't you\nKnow put the rest of the story and they just wrote down but uh yeah you have talked moments where you go geez you know this is a tough one you know where you're going to do go quite I'm All right wide open and go get them but\nYeah I did get fired in a ... that night after the game actually I knew I was going to get fired because I had a conversation with general manager about\nGetting the player in there because a\n... get out of the first inning and we were needed a book and I and so when I hang up the phone or looked at my wife at the time and I said I'm going to get fired and while she goes\nWhat [laughter] I go yeah I'm a little far tomorrow and that's exactly what happened with the note under the doors in the room at twelve o'clock and George Carlin harden\nThat's never pleasant never pleasant but but in their lucky yes on on the Bernie to listen to them all let's fast forward to twenty Eighteen tomorrow's big wild card game against the athletics for all the marbles with the Yankees at home\nOr a Aaron Boone has some big decisions to make among them the biggest decision his who to pitch to knock Severino or a half I mean what would Bucky Dent to\nSenator how that would get very [laughter] ah\nI live a phone call and good record they're caught out but you know that you know that's his decision\nYou know he's been with those guys all year you know or or ... or you know been a a an aids for his pitch well lately but uh the kid had just come over pitch really really well\nYou got to knock out you know that's that's a tough decision and I'm sure that they'll go figure like off because it's one game it's all you know if it's go wrong it's it's for all the articles\nOn the way out here buck you look at this Yankee team this year and ... it's a hormone on Saturday then judge and they go on to break the record set by the Nineteen Ninety seven Seattle mountains and your mother was gripping hit fifty six Buner hit forty he right here twenty three so rental hits thirty one this Yankee team this year\nHit more home runs in any team in the history of major league baseball by the way with guys like entering judging gallery Sanchez too big time home run hitter was on the bench for a long\nTime that's a pretty amazing feat by this Yankee club yes\nWell you got to give them a lot of credit you know you've got to give it a lot of credit because they have to have you know they they made some good decisions they've had some kids you know the kids are a set of carry on a long way to share you know a young kid that they're\nAll ... he actually broke Joe DiMaggio was record for doubles that's amazing\nAmazing and you know towards as a second base those kids are coming in and stepped in and and play a big time for you know and uh you know the ... who's come over and he's\nPut a big charging them you know when they were floundering there you know he said some big home runs for me and and kinda got 'em over that hump to they could get judge it some of those other guys back or hurt you know so uh they they ... as far as having that to get them through the season\nBucky Dent forty years ago today that big a big three run home run propelling

I was sexually abused as six years old I don't even want to talk about it he says you got to listen to the ... vote just told me what happened to I Believe it yeah I was just saying the abuse but it

sisters I Know they don't really use it as a teenager I was six months eight and a I guess I was sexually you have nothing but make a long story was\nGoing to have you been the last time you were on you you were very very upset about this capital the your contention was where do we draw the line we all we've all done stuff like that we were kids in high school you actually put it on me and you're right I mean I remember every single grandmother\nSo what has changed if anything has anything changed in the last week about how you feel about this is just all looking\nAt the people that I and with all respect to that doctor that was it to you I Know one thing I had a cousin that was a psychiatrist PHD\nShe was more nutty than anybody she has this like ... they sit down and we want to go into the deepest recesses of your mind did you ever remember this and they start to believe I interviewed people for a living my whole life\nAnd I interviewed people committed murder up in jails and\nThen all of a sudden they start thinking about something and they believe they never did it or they believe something so specific you can put them on a box sets a lie detector test that lie detectors that might thing right now something happened\nTo this woman was a cabin on your convinced that that's all right 'cause I think something I'd never go I mean let's let's be honest about one thing we were all young guys when we were sixty Seventy years old you are to die for one was on I read\nAnd how many times you know what a gal you dry hot potato and right next the Jamaican and she said no no no no becomes yeah yeah yeah\nAnd let's face it any guy I asked that do they go not eyes that's baloney 'cause every one of us have gone through that adolescent stage and all I Know he'd ever hit the allegation was he never viciously raped or anything like that\nHe tried to hit the whole allegation was he put his hand on math and and tried to ... and my point is\nYou know when in reality how many ties Bernie sit look at me how many\nTimes do you mean when you when you went out and they were on top of a kiss dinner and you were going from the moon and all that and then all of a sudden the no became the year and\nNobody was there was never know with me but that's what you read the no ... on\nThe air is saying I'm a single guy and I got three girlfriends I'm Out there I date and all that now I dump one of them and I am running for mayor of New York city you dumped me\nShe makes an allegation my reputation is ruined by corporations ruined nobody here's what's what's dangerous about what you're saying your head [noise]\nHis contention is he wasn't in the right to do your saying well wait a second he may have been in the room and he just did something that we've all or eight or he was had\nA couple of drinks and them and he doesn't remember a couple of beers in the fall but if you believe that he was in the or that he was like he said I wasn't even in that room was highly levy such white toast first of all he couldn't hang with us from\nA couldn't hang up 'cause I ... in common on jak gas is not what you see that point is with all due respect to these white bread white bread means that he's like a straight line this guy looks like if it's somebody Bach that um he would jump out of windows country and in reality if he was like I said\nIf the allegation was against it I Would believe it right should not because I was in the worst lines or if\nIt's a double to the hippocampus but the ...\nGetting is in corporations people don't realize if you're a boss over somebody

Ben for up for the first four seasons so did you write yeah but you've been on the boat or forever but you love this guy by the whole experience\nYeah we work well together and that down the shows in second season right and it's been fun it's a lot of work because um you know the cast and crew changes every year and a lot of 'em are experience so it's like starting over every year right but I'm training for the\nWorld to see that is what's funny about the show Bernie kind of like a lot of our our radio show like our voices go across the radio but people don't understand\nThat the show even before the show this job is Matt this preparation a lot goes into it so for you guys they see the glory part you're on the boat you're on television but the truth is there's a lot of cleaning up of manure that goes into this\nJob every right capitalism it's settled a glum wrote looks like metaphorically right you know we're not laying on the beach drink an umbrella drinks all day long ride on a case right although most of the time you are [laughter]\nMean listen well yesterday when we promo the upcoming guests for today we mentioned you guys and our engineer and he was like oh my I Can't believe it the most beautiful women in the world on this boat he was like over the moon with that with the with the good looking girls I mean\nThere's a lot of uh you know obviously ... the sixth season is set in fact eating\nA lot of ... a lot of uh\nAnd as I mentioned I just can't good looking bait let us get there like that you have to wait well absolutely I mean if\nYou have to be you know stuck on a boat for six seven weeks right\nMiserably good luck and you've got a choice right out of some ... not just the girls are guys are handsome man but you know it's not just about that I mean I think that the some of the writing some of the uh relationships\nThat go on tape on your boat or with some of the folks up work together and you know I'm a love triangle I may have been season for I don't remember the exact season but uh the what goes on back and forth between the folks on the boat is just as interesting as how you guys look\nSure I mean and everybody gets a little bit more attractive than season goes on because you're stuck on the boat with them right and you're drinking more [laughter] right yeah yeah it's like another double\nIt is right so so is it more stuff that goes on when the cameras are off in other words we see all the fun the controversy the back and forth and relationships but to some of that stuff carry on captain Lee after the episodes or over is this something that some of these relationships some of these\nOf the folks back and forth to deal with that all year long does it stop once the cameras on\nPretty much it does yeah once the cameras stabbed once they're off the boat it's like it's been a slight see it\nThat's it yeah yeah I mean one of those folks actually leaves is it um is it kind of like the last day camp that I get sad I mean like ... for example he was a ... seasons which he said when he got a place in season five\nI don't think so he's in great things in Fort Lauderdale he's got a great catering business and only stay friends that some people you're happy to see them go six weeks stuck on a long time yeah enough time some people do make it say that that's true yeah\nPlenty of time and you know there's some ugliness a or a K chest pain for example I mean you took some heat on Twitter and the captain stepped up big time for you just recently\nYeah I did I mean I think people don't realize that not joining a show called America's next top model on a show about working so yeah they can comment on my work all day what\nOkay so so then when it came after you about your physical appearance yes and they weren't very nice of you\nKnow but I think they're just bored and you know like there's a lot of negativity on the Internet but I constantly stepped up and what\nYou said what did you say cats on the I don't I don't recall the incidents specifically but but I don't have so but there's this but you know what your job here\nIs not just a captain the boat maybe it's not your job did you watch it but a guy than that but you end up becoming kind of like the father figure for all these young kids like I mean they they they look to you for for leadership advice and I I Believe it leads from watching the show that you generally care about all these guys are ...\nAbsolutely it's it's funny because you know you take eight or nine good looking people write relatively well educated\nA relatively by the way this is what I'm In real close quarters apply a lot of pressure throw large quantities of expendable\nCash and alcohol and what could possibly go wrong\n[laughter] really [noise]\nThe love boat the on steroids or something like that but our way over the top are you are you out at sea a lottery your is it pretty much in porch\nFor example a heated we're out of the most the time your so people these people and that they don't have the sea legs necessarily they get seasick alive to some of them to write some of them do it or do they get quite comic they throw up on a on the boat yeah that was that while\nThe ones that are fun to watch are the ones that like over a million by the first day on I mean I just burn it up the first day at Harvard anything that will hold still in a glass like and then all of a sudden we get out and see and they get a little emotion going on a lawyer John they're looking for a reset [laughter]\nLaughing too is the most miserable feeling like there's a way to get seasick myself legally on a a like a whale watching crews for God's\nSake what's I did last year in um so funny you said that in a San Francisco I was sick as a dog yes I hated that feel that you have to cap and\nCorrect me if you have to look at the horizon in order to data that helps and that helps and the amount of alcohol you know the limits either of them are now do you\nDo some of the stuff that goes on with you the season I Know that you have to I guess maybe step in between is more limited though Josiah yeah and counter line now you start to buddy up to Josiah bright you guys get tight\nHe's lovely he's a hard worker he's experienced he's ... isn't held on lovely to into a I Would say she is different than desire right very different yeah so do you like to say more than I Do I not and I'm favorite\nWell yeah because he worked so hard but you're not supposed to play favorites is um I guess the postal well you don't care of those I don't like somebody more that that's our job and not somebody who doesn't\nOkay that's a little I used to have some really tough to work for by the way\n[laughter] I Know I Know I have\nIs the way it should be made any votes listen as he you like that do do you try to treat everybody equally all like hey do you give the kids more cake when they deserve it\nYou know when when people do an exceptional job I mean as far as I'm concerned you don't get a pat on the back for just doing your job and showing up there is no participation true wow if you really excel you go out to be a way you do the extra mile you do the extra five miles that's when you get an anti boy and if you have a little screw up along the way\nMaybe overlook that because what you've done in the past is so much better\nBernie sounds like president [laughter] hey listen below deck tonight on the bravo channel nine o'clock\nThe beginning of the sixth season a captain Lee and Kate chest pain in the studio with Bernie and said I have to ask you guys are any in any shark attacks or along the way I mean people out there just jump off the boat and you know lose a leg or something and not not\nSince rocky I have several lines in shark infested waters this year so that's a nice new experience\nOne of the Caribbean and when I Would take cruises with Danielle burning ties in the Caribbean they would throw the garbage over like midnight on the boat and you would see the fins sought to circle so she thought about somebody of a more than once and yeah there's no way to know what I mean I don't think there are a lot of sharks in to Haiti or yeah although\nThere are a lot of sharks why wouldn't there be great whites I'm huge huge reach the whole island is around all the tea mountains are surrounded by ... so do you know\nEverything like every island what kind of fish they've got I mean are you is that part of what you need to know as a cashier and one of the iceberg is all of its [laughter] tearing the glasses [laughter]\nHey let me tell you something that guy on a true story that boat was going down captain Lee and he stood there behind the controls on the water came breaking through the glass and he went down with the ship you your boat starts to go down you on a jet ski back to New York and\nFifteen minute [laughter] at first when us [laughter] that makes me put it on the back right I mean that line [laughter]\nGoing faster you fool [laughter]\nAny anything else we should know about a we talked about you and your ideal captain we talked about getting emotional what are we going to Ashton plays a big old and new chef Adrian he plays a big wall anything else we should know about\nThis season I mean I'll second happened land that it's the best he's never had a great cats curled up our largest yacht and a new exotic location\nAlso it's a it's a new boat it's a very very it's a new about it's a hundred and eighty five feet a monster\nShe weighs so let me ask you let me ask you noticed 'cause all I care about to be honest you guys are great I Love the show love you I don't mean to get an episode get on the boat it's only kill you oh you haven't yet Mr skinny women we want to endure remote\nAnd look the president's policies are putting people back to work that's the bottom line\nData that would be interesting if he uh does that daily be named England and bats and our next ...\nYou know [laughter] you know it's funny even on the on the comedy central network this guy Trevor Noah\nHe actually was giving ... on the comedy central next network the uh the successor to John Stewart was actually praising Trump saying that the guys actually he's coming through our wedding on some of these deals with the trade deal that he came through with yesterday the U.S MCA\nHe really is he's brought NASA child into the United states with that there's a Chinese plant in the Midwest we had done a story about it a trade deal that he just brokered the eleventh hour Sunday night unemployment at an all time low right you know he calls\nGDP is just a record is going to be another one coming out here I Believe in the middle of the month\nWhich is coming just in the Nick of time before the elections for him for the president and uh but anyway this ... know a guy take a listen to him from it you got up there in a meeting I Do I Do Trevor Noah from last night talking about the president's new well ... ... ... revised NAFTA agreement\nI also feel society this deal looks like it'll help American carmakers and farmers and protect a lot of us based jobs\nI'm thrilled to speak to the American people to share
