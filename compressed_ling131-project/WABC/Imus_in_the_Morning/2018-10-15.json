this something that you want to do more than other words even doing a dancing with the stars so you put your point until you're good at it we got it okay you're cute and [laughter] so do you are you looking to move on and do more stuff like that time\nYeah I mean like I said in some interviews I can see dancing with the stars as being my last hosting gig 'cause I've done just about every form out over the years uh and and uh\nI Can't envision another hosting gig that would come along that would entice me but the idea of building those different muscles the acting muscles uh is is intriguing and this was a great opportunity to do that\nIn another part of a Tom ... history is that you actually hosted Hollywood Squares uh yeah I'll be long after Paul wind and Peter Marshall he came here let's talk with gun but does that that was a legendary show and he must have been a lot of fun doing that\nThat was a lot of fun I did that for six years for all those years with Whoopi Goldberg a as an executive producer and center square and the last two with ah Michael\nEvident Henry Winkler the Fonz nice\nSo I got to meet a lot of great people many of whom of states are good friends and uh yeah it was fun for about three different the way it's produced here we would do five and a day\nSo we would do three in the morning we break for lunch and then do two in the afternoon back when Peter did the original one because we've become friends in the in the past ... years they would do it more in the evening so they would be a lot of pretentious alcohol drinking\n[laughter] better\nThan the

you'd be on the Bernie in situ in New York City talking about season twenty seven of dancing with the stores you would have checked me into rehab right let's be honest\nI would've I would've said it's legal everywhere already\n[laughter]\nBy the way some of these shows now you got that Jennifer Lopez show you got so you think you can dance I mean I think all these shows basically kind of jumped off what you guys did and some of the very beginning right\nYeah I think so as well and and you know we aren't that to the original show in England called strictly come dancing which is sort of at the mother ship of all the dancing with the star shows but certainly the success of dancing with the stars in the states uh I think was responsible for all those other versions UC\nTom birds are on on the

minutes\nNot everybody loves the boss especially in Washington DC where he basically he doesn't trust anybody\nIt's a vicious vicious jungle essentially is what he said well he said that the real estate business in in Manhattan\nYou did say that but he also specifically said I don't really trust anybody because at one point she said your wife millennia says there's three or four people there that are close to that you really can't trust and he's like she's right I Can't trust anybody why don't we listen to it that's awesome [laughter] very\nVigorous and no one who really don't building

to is the sanctions we haven't done that ... are you prepared to know what what does he have to you know I Will tell you this is in the Obama administration I haven't used the sanctions I haven't done anything\nI haven't done anything with meeting I Believe he likes me I can have a good relationship I have a good interview with him I have a good chemistry attempt to look at the horrible threats or man no more threats no more threats\nI never knew how dishonest media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound bite\nI now I knew how to change the subject to get well no but even the way you asked me a question like about separation\nYeah when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk of them out I was making I don't mind your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you\nThat you treated me much differently on the subject I disagree but I don't want to have that fight with you OK All right now the fight with the nighttime I'm president and you're not [laughter]\nI didn't want to go there that he was doing so well up because I Know he ... he did very well during that interview and she had and of course I'm biased yeah full disclosure kidding disclosure but she had the power of editing and he's still came off well you\nKnow she definitely had an agenda every single question\nAnd I thought he entered everything correctly but what she said he said it four times what all she had to do with that point was just engage him in his answer and they could have moved on but it did seem like in President Trump's defense\nAny time he said something defending himself\nShe wasn't really interested in going God moved so I mean it was such a pie in the ... there was a ... ...\nYeah well I mean is the president's supposed to be sort of the fifth estate to call out the you know the government or whatever but they they go overboard if that was Obama as he pointed out she wouldn't quite have gone through the lengths that you did to be sort of a little disrespect\nShe was a you know I remember very vividly interviewing Trump and Pence and I didn't know she was nearly as bad I thought that was you know jumping\nTo most of the talking and and it sets him so that things by the way but I really thought last night she really came off like um\nLike she had an agenda like she was clearly rooting for the other team yeah which comes as no surprise I Know it was all supplies I for some reason\nI didn't get the feeling in the past ... Leslie stole the media yes Bernie but with some reason I thought was least all was a little a little better than that and last night she wasn't well\nIt's like a it's like my friend finding out that there's no Santa Claus yeah just like Leslie stall you know I guess it was listed I give you an example St tell you brought it up NBC News you know you're talking about fake news you hate the phrase you might not you probably are still don't like Trump that much I'm not talking about you and so let anybody in general but\nThe phrase fake news ah\nIt manifested itself over the weekend with NBC News of all people they actually tweeted and then reported on MSNBC\nThe tweet Reed's watch President Trump says Robert Lee was a great general during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible right now listen to the clip they ran a company that the tweet the caption read\nA general who is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise]\nYou know what I'm Talking about the grand [noise]\nIncredible so I'm really it was a great general and\nAbraham Lincoln developed a phobia\nHe couldn't beat Robert Ley he was going crazy I don't know if you know the answer but Robert ... Lee was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln game armies and I can't speak Robert anyway and they had all of these\nGenerals they look great they were the top of that class at West point they were ... graders people there's only one problem they didn't know how to how to win\nSo that's the extent of what they play and you heard he did say grab he was as a drug man he's now he's incredible drunk and general right but still they went with this and other outlets picked it up MSNBC picked it up and obviously to imply that he's embracing Confederate leaders you know he liked the Confederate you like the south\nWell that goes back to his lousy effort in Clarksville but go ahead I'm Sorry right no that's right that's also not cholesterol\nHis show that All right so you're right but the but the rest of the tape or they got called out on it apparently by a few people including Trump himself and it took him two days to\nFinally apologize to apologize to if I could do a correction right and then play the entire day because he was in Ohio when he tried to flip praised grants from Ohio and he went with the rest\nThey weren't one day it was looking really bad and link you just said you hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem\nAnd Lincoln said I don't care what probably as you guys aren't women and his name was grant general [noise]\nAnd he went in and he's not the hell out of everyone [noise]\nAnd you know the story they said the Lincoln you can't use them\nAnymore he's an alcoholic\nAnd Lincoln said [noise] I don't care if he's an alcoholic frankly give me six or seven more just like\nThe real story of course to be accurate as Lee was winning in the west to Vicksburg or whatever and then in the east you had the ... you had the generals McClellan in them couldn't beat we lead was kicking ... so he says give me that drunk in general from the west and they said hey he's a drunk and ... and Lincoln said well tell me what kind of whiskey he drinks\nAnd the general so why do you want to know and they said because I Want to spend all my other generals ... a barrel of that whiskey so that they can win like he wins and he brought him over to the east and he ultimately won the civil war\nIt's only kept thinking about was talking about the fact that yeah the media school Donald Trump again how how silly it sounded I'm Sorry but Donald Trump has proven time and time again he knows nothing about history\nHe may be a very good president than he is but you know nothing about the history of this country I mean nothing he's made Mormon states more full pies in his year and a half in office than guys can make in a lifetime and to hear Donald Trump recite history and as you just said by the way didn't exactly get it right again\nYou know he got the thrust like you've got the thrust of it but but the point is this the NBC News\nPut that out there to perpetrate the fall so that Trump is a racist than embraces the south gr confederacy slavery and all that crap\nAnd as you know or the the the whole deal saying was that the uh ally runs around the world twice before the truth ... Tyson shoes yeah southern correction two days later who's going to see that too like you know when they took the end okay bust out of the oval office right allegedly\nNever happen but it took days before the corrections and nobody saw the correction\nIt reminds me of when you're um you're in a courtroom right and somebody screamed out something that's really really bad for the defendant and the judge goes\nAnd it's supposed to forget it's way too late to Julia already heard it died so it's kind of like that but I'm all in on what Donald Trump did a good job with ... mostly stole was well it certainly wouldn't feel the team and we got more than I write more that audio right ah I think I think she exhausted it do we have more are we done with it\nOr we can get more All right and Hillary

the speaking behind your back and you know and\nMy way I feel very comfortable he [noise]\nHe has asked president Donald Trump courtesy of CBS sixty minutes with Leslie sold last night\nThe atmosphere that atmosphere and which I thrive yeah forty two of the president but uh\nHe didn't have a very nice things to say about not as ... like the guy is a good guy but he's probably leaving soon\nYeah he thinks he's leaving they didn't say anything bad about you know he he thinks he's a Democrat Mattis was forced staying in the Iran deal yeah so they have had some differences but uh overall\nBy and large I mean getting rid of ISIS and all I think mad as has been a permit tremendous asset it'd be I'd be said when he leaves as well\nWell he did and he was going to be said Donald Trump he said everybody everybody leaves that happens\nA lot of John Kelly in him hate each other so that's not going to be upsetting but not ends Kelly in Madison killing killing and a President Trump right don't call them President Trump if you're a friend of his he's uncomfortable with that he's like even my friends they call me Mr President\nYeah I'm Down to what do you mean don't be so formal all the time I think he's talking to you but honestly when I spoke to him\nAnd my from my backyard that was in the summer of Seventeen about six months after he took office\nI call them in and it was kind of awkward I made a call Mr President right yeah I don't want to call him he says his own friends and family called not yeah ...\nIt was a but he got used to what he's used to it now and he feels like the present two years in a specially after whatever he's accomplished all the good things he feels he feels good about it and I'm so Mr President is a very applicable and it was back then as well but now it's ah\nIt's ... it's I mean even the even the news anchors\nOn local news or low the goal the president of the United so President Trump they should just call them Trump they call a President Trump now right he\nHad a good weekend with the the pastor coming out of a turkey out of house arrest\nBig rally Saturday Night and then the big interview with Leslie stall you didn't even have to pay ransom writer exchange anybody for that guy no nobody did was uh he used the the the weight full faith and force of the economic power of the United states\nTo squeeze turkey into a into a recession and they were like okay we'll let them go right and that's it then goes to a nickel and now I guess they'll pull back a little bit and they'll say I don't know they'll toe the line a little bit in the future and the same thing with the uh the Saudi\nSaudi people that's a that's another complicated it would have meant that dude that thank you well yes uh\nThey they they were apparently they did kill him but he's not an American citizen and what the what what what the president is saying is that we had these tremendous an arms deals and also\nWe've built is a big coalition over there Saudi Sunni Jordanian Israeli all against Iran and they just want to put that in danger\nIf ah if they do cut the arms deal they'll sell those arms to Russia or China I mean they'll get those arms from Russia or China and he's like that would be a cut throat right right so why do it the guy again he was a Washington Post a journalist but not an American citizen do what they did was bad\nListen we're dealing

Lopez was an amazing event amazing I'll be back to own a couple of weeks I really enjoyed it but what I noticed was that was coming back\n[noise] so what I did was I took me about two blocks away which is very convenient\nFrom this Bourbon Street place is the Long Island railroad literally two blocks away but it was a nice day a lot of weight about twenty minutes for the train didn't matter got a phone call from both deal gave all my football picks\nFor yesterday he want 'em all by the way they'll tell us that the more I thought he gave that up I guess not people don't know what are the game with his son and his grandson three generations of details I gave them four games all for one anyway\nSo I'm waiting for the railroad and I took the road to Penn Station that an uptown train home\nTo the Upper West side and every week now I'm here on Sundays so I'm at Penn Station I was never Penn Station or something\nAnd every week man I go down there and the excitement factor coming off the Long Island railroad like a thousand Bernie I'm not exaggerating like a thousand jet fans wearing their jerseys high fighting each other screaming the jet chant\nThis is a good three hours before kickoff downstairs in Penn Station on\nTheir way to a metlife city right I guess about to take New Jersey in Trenton New Jersey transit is connected to Penn Station in Long Island railroad yeah and of course ah or anything of West and south all over the country the to the Amtrak train that's true\nSo on Sundays whether it's the giants playing in New Jersey or the jets playing in New Jersey Penn Station is literally a pre game show it's a tailgate party yeah\nSo I'm going back to the sleepy Upper West side having towards the to train going up town and I'm walking past like a thousand to high fiving me coming out to the game sit on my own I'm done thank you [noise]\nBut it's just it just it's an amazing city if we ever ever get to the point where we clean up this dump downstairs 'cause it's so it really is if we get anywhere we get rid of the funk get whether it's a God damn homeless\nClean the place up make it so that every time you turn a corner by a shake shack ... greens it doesn't sound like a dirty as clean the\nPlace and you're not getting a you know have held up you know I walked into the building this morning at about I'd say it was about two o'clock in the morning\nAnd the guy out just before I walked into the or doors that the circular doors that we walk in here at a two parent plaza yeah this guy says to me oh man you got a dollar [laughter] that's what he said remember when you were you with kids and ah I was talking to us all reading about this anyway with me in the ... they used to say\nYou know let me hold a dollar yeah I mean I don't know and I had our last back that's all I live now that most of all Russian I talks like we both [laughter]\nThe the the kids in the hope that I grew up okay to a little white boys like me let me hold a dollar let me all the corridor right no I can manage my mother's my whole adult man\nOh man it or else you could ask kicked yeah but that's all I had a little flashback this morning walking in of course it was a homeless guy right\nOh he's about thirty five years old and able bodied red and whatever but uh\nSo yes if they clean that it's just so in addition to being funky and nasty and all that stuff they're intimidating it's dangerous you don't want it I mean I don't I look I could probably took the guy's ass maybe maybe not I don't want to have to you know as you don't want that guy's blood high enough to deal with that or\nA calling the cops either for me or for him or what I hear that want to go to work listen\nI saw fight this morning I mean it's just unbelievable that you would say this because it wasn't me I had my coffee my veggie egg white and one hand my briefcase in the other and I'm walking past the guy big burly guy by the way looked like he you know really strong looking guy\nAnd the homeless guy mentioned what that means that I'm going to kill you to the homeless guy and as I was walking into the building I heard the guy scream at the top of his lungs I told you man don't touch me I'm going to kill you and I really want them to walk back out\nAnd see what happened but I didn't I just came upstairs what this is for forty six and them\nCome on man yeah\nWell look ... with ... the I told you what was it two weeks ago in McDonald's across the street a guy simulating a sort of a a gunshot moved to my temple Donald's\nIt was still light out terrible it's terrible and I again I I was on I knew I was on videotape in ah in Mickey D's and I was ready to I had an umbrella I was going to put it in the solar collectors that I'm thinking to myself\nI don't even want to deal with their own that's twice in two weeks\nYeah well you got to get rid of the ... you know it's funny there was a story that's all over New York one today and so he's a big day a new one because later on tonight mayor de Blasio sits down with everyone Louis and I just can't miss TV it's like Trump and was stolen from last night\nSo I'm a big story about on the lower east side which I Love that part of the city to Atlanta down there they're building these four beautiful\nYou know high rise skyscrapers yes so the nerve the nerve of these people just like they did it in Williamsburg the nerve of these people they're going to build nice buildings\nAnd actually want people who make money\nSuccessful people to live in the ... the none of them do it regularly got it right they got to keep the place looking like crap so that the people that don't make a very good living on intimidated by rich nice people moving in what well they're going to displace the people in the ... that some get a better job\nWell why why can't the people who live there still live\nThere are those that do someplace else\nWell I mean that's not exactly why if you had roots in the lower east side already even would already Williams bridge long ago he was burnt\nSo they shouldn't fix the neighborhoods they shouldn't build nicer places while they because somebody's been there for thirty five years but we've got a crappy job build affordable housing\nThat's what that's what made the Blasio promised instead of selling out to these rich real estate guys\nWill do both and but the idea that you don't want you know nice buildings on which people in your neighborhood because you can't make a living I mean I'm\nSorry I just [laughter] you know it's going to have people like people that just displaced like that they're going to go to places like Yonkers or Utica New York perfect but you know Mount Vernon money earned in Mount Vernon that's fine\nBut I don't know nobody wants to live in those places what was I I Want to where I live I Want successful wealthy well dressed nice looking people of all that's fine that's not true I mean I've got a couple of former football players living up by major\n[laughter] that's the only one living some of the best friends\nFor black for what it meant that they make money you know I I see these people these protests have you ... you don't want nice buildings on wealthy people in our neighborhood we don't want that because my God because I'm such a lazy by somebody else\nA little lazy you may be then you you grew up you were a you fought in the Vietnam War and you always make it only it was the last war for Twenty years and uh you know you you have a certain pension and how they're going to force you out of the hood\nSo that fat lady I saw this morning on New York one she served in Vietnam [laughter]\nCould good or is it as she could be Saigon Sally I don't know [laughter] let's go you're a heartless band I am I Want to clean the place up this is the greatest city in the world it's not the cleanest place [laughter]\nGuy got set up the front and what do I care\nA\n\nOh man\nMy back is hurting them for that [laughter] listen folks a lot of us we live with this back pain every day you know who you are I mean it's just met too many of us can be getting out of bed sitting in the car all day sitting at your desk all day whatever it is\nYou have back pain and it's annoying bug that zero compression back brace that's the answer to your problem it is from on\nIt is a godsend the zero compression back raise that was created by a nurse from Brazil yes she works in New Jersey now the beautiful Rosalie she came up with a zero compression back rates 'cause she had back pain and she designed it\nSo it relieves her pain and unlike those scam devices you see advertised on TV\nThis thing is uh is designed it has a something that massages your spine is the best way I can describe it at massages your spine\nAnd gives you good posture and you're back pain just miraculously disappear as again I Love it it works for me it works for most people would try to zero compression back right so effective the government actually granted Rosalie a patent\nFor zero compression back race that is how effective it is go to their website folks and go back pain dot com read some of the testimonials read about the the brace itself which by the way the word is misleading brace it's asleep device that wraps around your waist\nDoesn't broke through through your shirt that zero compression back race but less than
