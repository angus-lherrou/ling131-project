today with the with the capital coming down in a couple of hours and even though I think we know already which way Jeff Flake is going to go 'cause he went to a certain way last week of course\nAre right now the overwhelming favorite nearly two to one is that Jeff Flake will vote yes to confirm Brian Cavanaugh is that a relatively popular Wade through today\n[noise] ah yeah sure is that you can bet on a variety of senators and which way they're going to mean so as you mentioned in the market a flight is are most likely to vote yeah I'm here to come out last week after the the\nTestimonies by Kevin on Dr court saying that he was going to push it through the Senate Judiciary committee or with the expectation that ah you know the FBI report what came out this week and a him he he came out yesterday and said oh and and senator Collins\nAnd said that they thought the FBI report was quote unquote thorough so I feel like that is a saline that he is most likely to vote yes for cap and also

watching the confirmation but I told her this last week\nI got a buddy who you I got buddies who don't they're not knee deep in the political stuff they just don't care they like Trump there okay would jump they don't like Trump but they're not knee deep and they stopped they never ever ever came and went on in their lifetimes\nAbout a Supreme Court nominee they just don't everybody was engaged with the ... they took this personal and so did I ... and for that reason and nothing to do with Dr Ford God Bless her\nI Wish for nothing but a happiness and help but what about you went through I Hope you get the help she needs\nBut what happened on Saturday was just right\nThere was unforgettable as well as a matter of fact I'd go so far as to say it was indelible to the hippocampus right whatever that means and ... that's what she justified or\nIn her testimony she used that phrase but the fact of the matter is\nIt was a it was a victory for for good yes really it ... it was it was energy versus the rule of law I mean which which which mob justice versus due process no I mean that's especially when it came down\nTo watch what you what I feel some strength it's it's a horrible wars because once again women lose you know women have been losing ... go through all\nThese you know what they say yeah but but ... ... that's been or do that I mean I think women are fair minded or women or they see they watched what happened they watch the same thing that you and I sure women fair minded women\nAnd then they heard the analysis from some of the people was supposedly fair people on the news both politicians and media people and show them what they saw\nDidn't jibe with the people who may be analysis and they and they\nI'm sure the question they just did this at all is the the same crap that I saw and if you're still saying what they're saying I mean this was a good uh this guard he writes for political gain or you know evidence\nOf of the the presumption of innocence all that time honored are emerging core values just thrown out the freaking window for political purposes\nMore you talk about presumption of innocence and a bunch of this came down to one one of the politicians lady she was in college you know she was one of the question marks going into this thing horror Murkowski Jeff Flake and about two or three others\nBut do humorous shoes and comments by the way Bernie after the confirmation on Saturday talking exactly what you're talking about which is in this country there is in fact right to be a presumption\nOf innocence in this country we have a percentage of the innocence and as a matter there and that's what I can sanity that says a standard was the question now is more likely than not that Brett Kavanaugh\nAssaulted Chris things for\nAnd there was no corroborating evidence that he gets so age that the people that perfect as her poor sad what's press and that night\nHad testified under oath both to the committee through the ... declaration that they committed and to the FBI now\nThat they had no memory of this happening and that includes\nDoctor for its best friend when Christine Ford testified that she ran down the stairs and out the door and shortly her best friend who was there would have followed to her and asked her what was wrong\nNobody's come forward to say I'm the one who gave you a ride home or I was the other person at the party I'm not saying that she was not sexually assaulted I Believe that she was\nAnd that that horrible experience has abandoned her life but it does not mean that Brett Kavanaugh have was her assailant\nSusan Collins very rational there again saying would wish that we think something happened to this lady were not positive but it certainly looks that way but that's not the question\nWe'll be the onus is on her the accuser to prove I Want to say beyond them shot over down but at least come up with a credible story as to what happened and Susan Collins who you know you know didn't want to go for Kavanaugh said it perfectly\nGod Bless them is for the good luck to her yeah couldn't do any of that\nExactly right I mean not she her speech on friday was a it rivaled Lindsey Graham's ran goal close close whatever hers was prepared she read but still\nShe was fair and she had a she had people bribing or Shia political packs offering are millions of dollars if you vote no and that's partially a cemented her reasoning to vote no is that how can this be in this country\nWe're going to throw out again due process and all that stuff with the bigger picture\nIs ah the the left is is losing a war right now and they're getting very frustrated they're increasingly like authoritarian fascist leaning with again throwing out all these American civil rights that we've had they use the media as their puppets and all that stuff\nThey were against free speech they hate Israel and the Trump's election was D Day and this here to me this was the battle of the polls for them\nWell we'll have to go they went they they they went to extreme they did and they didn't lose this battle ... is a desperation attack and they lost that they got a Lynch mob justice last they did but but the real uh that Atticus Finch one yes but the telling tell will be next month I that's the that's the that's the\nBottom line they may have what they did lose this bottle addict has been through all that terrific but if they go out and they win these midterms than all this is a bunch of hot air books coming from you and I but that will be the telltale sign up\nAnd coming up next month and and the polls as I pointed out last weekend and others did over the weekend that this NPR marriage\nThan a few other polls they say that this battle has energized Republicans who are sort of dormant leading up to now the Democrats have been energized and they they were and they are\nAt but the now the uh the gap between the energies ... of Republicans and Democrats has narrowed it even now according to poll I don't buy that I mean the\nDemocrats are unified they are energized I Know Mitch McConnell said exactly what you're saying now that the GOP is now energizing together\nBut I have not seen that I've not ever by the way every so we'll see we'll see a ... I decided that they ... they wouldn't have big game and it's a very exciting speech but again it means nothing if they don't when\nI was I don't know but you had Bush forty three people or ... or rice not exactly big Trump supporter you're Glenn Beck\nOh Glenn Beck rich Lowry guys like that all they all they all coalesced around calving all everybody did end up the Trump people as well of course so they seem to be unified but well let's take would hold me until the election you could\nYou could rally around Capitol because you're a scene rational person like I Am\nThat doesn't mean you're necessarily going home for the Republican Party\nSome of those guys you just mentioned by the way still don't love Trump still don't live with a GOP is doing on a daily basis but they were rational enough to take this one case and say hey this guy may not have done it I'm not sure that that means that those are all in a while all gung ho let's go I'm not I'm not sure\nThat still not sure that's the case either I Hope it wakes people up I didn't mean to see what ... ... when they put this guy throughout his career job this disgusting severe job\nAnd the way they went about it centered Dianne Feinstein with the letter late and Chuck Schumer was in on it all this stuff and ... and the press going along with it printing is stuff\nI mean I think people hope I hope people woke up but will it stick to throw a four weeks from now will say\nWell that's so that's the next big political story coming up talking about politics too great guess coming out today\nFavorite congressmen out of Long Island Peter King will be here at seven forty and then another great politician out of Long Island ... will be on moments after that both guys by the way hopefully will endorse all very very good friend Tom Sullivan out in Queens as she gets ready for like\nOne of the all time great play by play voices in history and that's that's not a a set of hyperbole\nOf ... one quite very well he's right there too but I'll tell you what Bernie's done more sports than even Mike Breen by the way you see it's not even close he was he's all over the place everywhere he's on the on the same category as the ... the Albert genuine play by play his ... his book is out front will join us\nLater on this morning it's Columbus Day you know what that means a oh a favorite actor from a Bronx Tale chance commentary\nHe's going to stop by studio that's always fun\nAnd my buddy and we'll see how this goes later on this morning\nComedic actor Thom on all he's got a show out is out there every day trying to find these tapes\nWhich will in fact make Donald Trump will bad how's he doing with that by the way burn\nBut I I got to tell you something I saw him last night he was on with this guy bench Shapiro yeah yeah and you know it's just between you and me I assume he slavery and I have thought it was crazy and they don't shut up I Know you can't get a word in edgewise but he's a nice guy but even though he's on the other side is a little crazy\nBut ah I don't think he's found the tapes yet I don't think he ever got to the end of my last night as he didn't produce any he's\nGot other stuff going on he's got some tapes but not the big one that of course Omarosa was talking about jet swing giants lose and you will she loses all that and more burning and said on a Monday we're coming right back [noise]\nYeah [noise] oh what a night for the Yankees on Saturday judge goes deeper gang dairy Sanchez remember him what an idea how to home runs the easy to you know you have to you for behind game wants to the red Sox five nothing for sale was just moving along nicely\nSince then the Yankees about school the red Sox and to to in that series and they'll play the ever important game three in the Bronx later on tonight in fact three baseball games today one thirty this afternoon the Astros have a chance to get back to the ... and sweet the Indians that game as in Cleveland\nThat at four thirty this afternoon game for the Dodgers and the Braves the Braves shaved off elimination last night jumped out to a five nothing lead just to have the Dodgers come away back in time but the Braves won the game on a Freeman home run six till five\nSo that's two on LA game for from Atlanta this afternoon and then tonight Yankees Red Sox won team has moved on the Milwaukee Brewers they swept the Colorado Rockies so the pores are white the winner of the Dodgers Braves series to play in the end they'll see as Bernie is probably wearing his his um\nWhat do odd Jackie could I pick it would be a ... about Nick Swisher David called oh that's a well he's a okay great Yankee great met as well yeah buddy on his way to the stadium tonight sitting in Mitchell mold builds eat that's right that's right I'm going to talk about it they're just not going to be the winner\nYou just don't go no this is but this is huge I'm excited yeah ...

other show a diehard fan like it was a terrible terrible thing that happened at the that was to fight the\nIn itself was terrific but nobody watches those fights burning except for the guy who like you I I could say the same to you about hockey\nI agree with you All right I'm not talking to other I'm not talking about the ... last night I'm here to give you my opinion I think sixty five bucks and I'm not disappointed ally okay but there is a it's a lot of room to make it very if you make it on a ... it's terrific\nYou the support wants to get out there to more and more people nobody cares about the nine o'clock fight you're not going to hit me talk about\nPeople luminaries before all shepherds are boxing fight on HBO and let me let me talk about the oil and what I talk about the big fight that's what I'm saying to you is that the the other court fights were as thrilling as the button you don't want to talk on the court I talking about okay because I because you thought about that is right right\nSo I'm telling you that they were as they did they lived up to expectations right it was a great night it was worth sixty five bucks except for the fact that it was more at the end by the violent but you ... you can't sell out sixty five dollar night based on on the court\nThat's what you're missing here you sell it on the ... even in the fight was a disaster to coal main events were extremely thrilling or they'll fight that preceded up McGregor could be\nWith a pet is a raise it was that test I'm sure that all the guy\nThat would be a pet is broke his right hand the heart the courage that these guys show right I mean it was it was you were on the edge of your seats right now we're watching well I'd like to say the same thing when you talk about hockey\nI'll get I don't but I don't I don't talk about how whatever whatever whatever you talk about what your it's like I say the same thing I don't know I'm telling you what my only taught me a bit but your point if you're into it\nI don't talk about the rangers laws to travel in the morning my point is if you want to see is trying to white and it's up to bigger audience ... nobody cares about pet is the way they got some great fans do\nWas not a you know twenty nine Ninety nine or forty nine Ninety Ninety sixty five bucks right because it they knew the demand wouldn't be high so I'll be interested in things that go to see the numbers I don't know what the numbers are button\nI as I said earlier I I Would have paid two hundred sixty five bucks after having seen it knowing what I knew if I knew after the fight if I knew before the fight with any way I feel if I had to pay two hundred sixty five bucks it was that good at night\nFrom me at from a from a fair from a die hard fan of the fights with some some uh they would they would jaw dropping some of the knockouts were phenomenal I mean it was it's brutal that's right it's a combat sports it's nasty but it was it was exciting it was that's that's what it was and that's what that's what people like me like\nRight but again it just I don't keep going in the same thing it's not about you they're trying to grow the sport they've got you know like the you know we have the same old thing about Trump supporters Trump already has you know you love Donald Trump we know you love us she and I agree with you I mean I\n... that was not a good ending at all it was disgraceful\nTrying to say to you is you're you're kind of minimizing like it wasn't a good ending but the people don't care what\nI said no butts no buts about it was a terrible energy\nAnd and the ending of the big fight so all my point there's been all along not to take away from your enjoyment\nBut we talk about Trump getting more people to like him he's already got you you will see getting more people to like them they've already got you nobody cares about the under caught it comes down to the big fight and when it ends in the embarrassing passion that did that is a huge not small all huge black guy for\nThe last ... let me just say that ah first of all ... soccer ... Europe soccer fans the hooligans were out there I remember a giants fan in California\nHe was beaten to death he was I think it was terrible scientists Dodgers I enjoy the Dodgers fried notes that limited to the sport I mean it had passions fly and the ugliness happens Philadelphia is no I'll just point Philadelphia running say no more right don't they can't go out and it left that that was bad\nBut uh just from my experience it was terrific and I'll give you just just just throw away your hatred of the fight for a minute ride this one very very exciting fight it was actually funny see if we can laugh at this\nThis guy Derek the black the St Louis ... he's like he looks like Shaquille O'Neil\nHe weighs about two hundred and forty five pounds\nAnd he's fighting this Russian guy who's even bigger than he is six seven is ... the ... Gulf is his name\nAnd the beast is known for getting you know ... it's almost like a rope a dope he gets beat up and then he takes some huge shot and he always comes back right but this and this particular fight you said I think he's going to come back the Russian guys got this lockdown it went to the third round\nAnd uh with twenty seconds left the beast opened up with about a twelve punch combination\nAny knock the Russian this huge rushing out in dramatic fashion it was unbelievable so then afterwards he pulls off his shorts debate the beach the Derek complex piece Lewis who's quite the character he poses shorts off\nAnd he's standing there with a pair of ... it was like jockey underwear but they were black so they're like tidy why does but they were tiny black he's whatever right so Joe Rogan goes up and ... and he interviews and and it was a very very if this was worth the price of admission take a listen\nI'm really one of my parents\nSplit up so that again it was a Russian guy [laughter] so so uh uh jumped to the Russian the question how how did the fight go down I think is number three guy a crash [laughter]\nYou came by and not much you can send it without knocking on your absolutely one of the top guy in line for the hot on that sometimes when you think about that\nI knew him up like a small Claudio\nSo he was worn out and he's like a a you know don't talk to me about another fight right now because he is beginning to see sort of fat but uh I Can't really ought to be ... I'll listen to this this this was the call that I was at the cut I was trying to call for his number two you're right go ahead\nPlease come from behind the likes we feed\nWhen I think you\nKnow my wife is\nBefore the flight Donald Trump comb told me I got to make it look very similar to what you're talking about you and I couldn't\nJust it was absolutely hilarious he ... it was it was it was funny yeah it was entertaining\nYeah she taught me um I don't think so because I'm not a wrestling guy okay I was when I was a kid I enjoyed watching problems all day and I'm not even a ... well this is wrestling now these are great athletes these are tough guys they legitimately beat the living daylights out on the action in the wing\nIs excited and real it's not cold it's not scripted but it's it's a rush to a bit is wrestling and I can't stand that stuff\nI don't want to hear from some ... I I wrote the piece who was it was really funny I Know you thought it was I ...\nIt's actually when I was laughing out loud in a moment\nRight maybe in the moment it would've been funny it was ... and I just I'm consistent I don't\nLike it but these guys are ah for the most part this could be guys side and even McGregor\nThe noble discipline martial arts guys and it's a mixture of much by called mixed martial law it's a mixture of striking wrestling grappling jujitsu all this stuff\nAnd they're very very ... again honorable people who have I have the courage and the balls like you can't believe it in the ... I got like ... not only do they live\nCoverage I'm an organ their courage or the fact that they're toss\nAny of that stop these guys are the toughest athletes on your I'm not arguing any of that stuff it's a circus like atmosphere every time Congress out there some of these other guys the wrestling the Derek the beach that what he's saying and doing to me this is just for me you love it I think it's idiotic sophomore if not for me\nWell ... what it is for me I Love the uh the just the ... the sheer I don't know the the the ... of the ... the fighting that goes on to the coverage that they have to go in there and take the shot knowing I mean some of the knockouts again\nThese guys on the fourteenth think elbows to the head and they know that there's this subject to that at some point\nIt was a with McGregor in to be he actually how he got he was he was submitted yeah it was a net cloaked him out if he ... he actually he was at a more technically a neck right he\nAlmost broke his neck yeah and so called macgregor had a tap out already horseback would have been brought would have died and so it it just like I say it's just it's it's bad against which as you get to me it's kill or be killed and it it to me I Love\nWhat I Will see what happens if we get a rematch of ... even allowed back in the United states 'cause I don't we focus obese or who knows and by the way could be won the fight has not received a penny because state of white is holding his are holding\nA painter why would not allow him to where the belt in the ... he said no no no you gotta leave first it's too dangerous out here we'll we'll talk about it later\nThey go oh like a giant Louis oh do back in June your is on the news today the jets kept the when the Yankees WBUR important game three tonight but a lot of politics about to come your way Peter King leave cell in Tom solving\nA discussion the capital confirmation on Saturday what the midterms may look like next month and some of these local races one eight hundred eight boring WABC one eight hundred eight or eight Ninety two twenty two it's a spirited Bernie and said in the morning show on uh Columbus Day Monday and we'll coming right back [laughter]\nI Am sitting in the morning [noise] always say call this fall\nYou know that and us towards the end of this way it's going to be the coverage is going to drop like a walk\nSo now is the time to get into the best health in shape of your life with ... diet ... died as he only weightless planets one hundred percent customized specifically for you\nKnow pre packaged foods no county boys none of that nonsense eating brownies and pizza the scam Valerie ...

was the fifteenth century donated fourteen Ninety to cry in twenty first century with twenty first century standards\nYou know it's funny you say that that that I'll take it to something not nearly as important sports okay if you get Mike Breen on the phone we love my brain then you try to compare Julius Irving\nTo Kevin Durant all Larry Bird to the first thing Mike is going to say to you is listen there are all great players but I have a really hard time comparing players\nFrom different eras different generations different era there something that Larry Bird may have done in the eighties and nineties or may not be the same as a player today soldier so the answer is in your case no what happened back in fourteen Ninety two that's what folks I guess did back then well how do you do it different standards a world\nWas a much Wilder place it was almost sort of a survival of the fittest type a thing of you know the the ... the mighty\nYou know the the mighty rules yeah if you're a week you were you were subjugated that's the way it was the other slaves were dead my Irish ancestors they were they were dominated by the British for many many many many many many years because they didn't have the resources and the ability\nTo throw their asses out until the twentieth century when they were engaged in World War one and then the Irish that OK Now we're going to start or whatever that's why you hate Lennox Lewis to this day\nActually my dog's always him and his father Jerry Lewis they can ... can lick my [noise] I don't think they're related but that's a ... that is a funny that's a funny Lewis Jerry Lewis and Lenox\nBut let's listen to a club or Christopher Columbus or what he did was the fee he accomplished by crossing the Atlantic because he could he figured out in these little little small boats he can he figured out how to use the wind the westerly Wednesday I was looking for the the indies is what he was looking for you never expected\nAmerica to be there in fact to this day people don't know whether or not he thought you know he was in the indies or read that he that he hid a a a new way of miss\nWell some people want to even take that away from them they say that he was not the one he was not the one who founded America\nNo there weren't Vikings who ah hit Newfoundland and places like that about five hundred years before him like Frank talk and didn't [laughter]\nThey'll like no cinder going [laughter] but\nYou're right they they they tell you the Vikings ... well they do get it for being the first one\nThen they they could make anything of it and they went back wasn't didn't they give some other guy uh what's his name or the other great explorer uh come on help me out here but they're drama vast could have gone to\nWatch about ... ... what are you talking about which one did they give you one other one the credit for finding America do some ... ... if if ah that that may be a merry go round and we'd also like to change or America is named after a merry go\nThat's right ah for discovering it but he Christopher Columbus or he started the colonization for the Spaniards he was Italian yes\nBut he was working he was contrite was outsourced he wants to try that by the Spaniards just some say he was Jewish he was a ... a hundred percent\nA hundred percent Italian ... from a general I'm not mistaken what salami comes from but anyway that started with is the Spaniards started to come here\nAnd again take over and they did and that's why that Spanish influence you have in South America Mexico Central America et cetera et cetera et cetera right that stuff like that so so uh uh uh chess ... point is again\nHe was a great Italian he was a daring Italian you a lot of courage to do what he did with three small boats they go across that ocean like that I ended up that time\nI think they still felt the world was flat as well or the ... there were all kinds of hazards into roles of course and there was no cable no cable you know there was nothing they couldn't you couldn't put the meat and the refrigerator or anything like that and how long was he actually out there a\nOf took him too much to reach the Bahamas all from Spain he started the Canary Islands I hit the Bahamas after two months from August to as a ... well now what what what was he in Freeport Nassau paradise island which wherever they go to Atlantic City state Atlantis but what he did to going back\nHe figured out that the winds were easterly tech north\nSo that the wind's blowing back to a towards ... and they got back quicker you got back into it was a big hero bigger but he brought slaves with them and that that was not cool they didn't like that no no no that's why you know no they didn't do well the slaves didn't like it right\nBut but but in the in the McGurk household yeah you're OK you called Columbus Day you you you you're okay with it yeah\nYeah I'm fine with a call ... I'm ... more than five would pull your Columbus Day for my Italian brothers and sisters again you can't judge a fifteenth century man with the twenty first century ... feel the same way I mean look ... this this place where we live right now\nIs one hell of a place yeah and he he he was the guy who discovered it and it produced a man like our next guest Congressman Peter king what are the greatest statesmen to ever walk this country and he used to be my congressman and it goes back to Christopher Columbus I\nI Would make that assertion yeah only talked to a bunch of famous politicians Peter King lead Sheldon also on of Long Island Tom Sullivan out of queens former congressman Bob Turner so the next forty minutes lots of very cool local and national politics and it all starts with

elected president and she had nominated someone like Merrick Garland or whatever\nLess there was something that was in his past it was obvious I would've voted to confirm it when I say something it's obvious I'd have been trying to find every bad rumor every obligation this was a shameful rage and I think it ... the political part of it is certainly ... or the Democrats the part that can never be\nIs for a judge capital and his family what his wife and daughters have to go through what he has to go through the rest of it real that's going to be out there some kind of a footnote\nWell you know the Democrats would deathly afraid that the the balance of the court was going to be thrown into a into a mess basically will roast roe versus Wade would be all of a sudden in jeopardy so from that standpoint Peter King from the court standpoint\nWhat does him being sworn in really mean should the Democrats or be as paranoid as they are or do you think that for the most part it status quo\nNo such status quo I think it will move the court if you want to try to reach the right but no\nJudicial decisions are not the same as Republican or Democrat conservative and liberal it's been awhile since your practice law but I went to law school that they might have some knowledge of the law and I can tell you that a determined is probably disappointed in some judge Kavanaugh citizens and\nThe other hand you will definitely be a side would say ... or ... would have been to a rink course would have been where a\nA Justice Roberts has to some extent but again that's not a region Jewish asked me somebody I mean if they got on the court added as they can be a step down she would've appointed as someone who you consider a liberal jurists\nThat's not enough to shut the Senate down for that shouldn't have to that's not enough to revert to process you make your argument you say why you think\nA a dose of potential citizens are not good and that's how you get to vote on that but you know destroy your Persian personally you leave it to a a a discussion of his patients of his decisions of his writings we've asked\nWhere do you think he's going I think you are you all go to the stadium jumping issues incrementally we moved to a more conservative position\nBut again you know I I ... I think it's great it was a great judge\nBut he was also the judge who voted that it was a legal to do flag burning now I just like Bertie wrong but I Know at church career was coming from he was following\nHis philosophy and his ideology she had throughout his career and based on even though he hated flag burning\nHe thought that it was legal on the first amendment so those are the types of things we're talking about it's not\nA A R a political a personal decision it's it's a a philosophy and I believe that my own overall overarching philosophy is\nJudges should not be making the law they should be interpreting the law and that's what you're going to see you go to see a judge Kavanaugh will be interpreting the law he will not be acting as the legislature will not be acting as a Congress you'll be acting as a judge and I'm sure that probably eighty Ninety percent of the time I'll agree with them\nBut I ... a hundred percent of the time and that he's not making war is interpreting and that's\nThat's the role of Congress is the role of legislatures that's their job to do not the courts doesn't\nCongressman Peter king of the Bernie and said show or as you point out congressman king or on the substance look if you want your point of view represented all you have to do is win elections that's a process that speaking of which said the president said that the other night you don't head matches to an arsonist\nBecause in his opinion a lot of people's opinions the Democrats expose themselves as just a bunch of crazy people are willing to throw out da da da Silva was Asian principles just to gain power and that's dangerous\nThat showed how desperate they were showed how ah how ... they are doing anything at all they have to do\nTo stop the Trump Administration to stop conservative politics and took control the court and that is wrong that is for that an election day it's not for it out or would you have a good man on the up or you just made him and\nI basically they're saying anyone who makes any allegation against judge Kavanaugh is to be believed that his dirty erected means absolutely nothing you find anyone at all of a say something and again a professor Ford she made well believe what she was saying I'm not even getting into that but I'm saying when you look at it there was no\nEvidence whatsoever to back up what you were saying all the witnesses she gave you decide that ... that didn't even know you know the judge Kavanaugh what's so uh it\nIt just never it never made sense to go forward like this and uh it violated or rules of due\nProcess that's for the one person they understand Charles probably materials coming on at nine o'clock\nYes rates reading a great guy and these are becoming after you've already I don't know why I'm thinking that I just had a simple one though is trying to get the whole you won\nTwo things I Want we want to talk about local races first of all our good buddy Tom Sullivan wanting in Queens and

I spent four years in the New York state Senate and I I can see a colonel solving hitting the ground running making a huge impact as a great leader up there on issues that are important to veterans in New York state for our police for our firefighters are EMTs\nUp for for those who keep us safe from that perspective of his experience\nIn the military but I thought those leadership traits that you learned in the military that you can't learn just about anywhere else argue curl sold his resume speaks for itself\nBut just to add my two cents a having served up in Albany for four years is that at all but he is desperate to\nHave a Colonel Tom Sullivan there to hit the ground running to make a huge impact and it and it goes beyond just the public safety peace we need we need individuals\nWho who are smart with the other taxes and fees are out of control spending that's out of control and protecting our rights that there are elected officials\nIn Albany right now who who feel like\nTheir job is to get reelected they pander to constituencies that helped them politically they forget about the men and women and children that they represent your seat impact quality of education\nAt and and so many other aspects of the infrastructure announced where so uh I really hope Curtis I live in wins I look for is celebrating with him but most importantly I it would be a celebration for his district because they would have an amazing new state senator\nThat's exactly right district Fifteen candidate for state Senate Tom Sullivan on the line with us and now of course the first district down in Long Island congressional district believes cells in a veteran himself by the way\nOf Iraq War and a congressman seldom my question to you would think that that's the disgusting spectacle that we just witness down in Washington might actually galvanize people to go out and vote for Tom so when people who otherwise might have just stayed home\nI'm sure that in New York and all across the country that there are people who are now awake that maybe two weeks ago we're not really think much about Tuesday November six now there are people who\nNo matter what you don't have to give them a reminder they're showing up at their voting and I'll tell you that that includes a whole lot of Democrats who since November of twenty sixteen they woke up the next day they were really upset about what happened and they've been thinking about November six\nTwenty Eighteen since the day after the election November twenty sixteen they're showing up\nIt's important for our side you might have woken up on Sunday just yesterday and you're you're happy because you have a new ... new justice Kavanaugh but you can't let the the happiness that you feel on yesterday morning\nI translate into complacency you have to keep in mind exactly what what we all witness these last couple of weeks\nAnd we also have to keep in mind that ran through justice Kavanaugh got confirmed that Nancy Pelosi Jerry ... they're all talking about impeachment\nOf justice cabin already it's insane there are people who are on hinged who are not stable enough to be running our state and country who\nIf we don't fight for the country the state that we want over the course next few weeks we will end up with a very different country and state in January twenty Nineteen\nTen or ... thank you one more in this capital K to guess Peter King to Tom Sullivan ... next gas on the line or our friend Anthony wiener when he was forced to leave in two thousand eleven congressmen Bob Turner was elected to replace\nThe shame the Anthony ... Republican replacing a Democrat Mazie and here he is a the fourth and final guests Bob Turner Bob good morning welcome to the Bernie and said in the morning show I bumped\nBurning good morning\nYeah but but whatever it was was what he said constructive or or not well that's the question ... Sherman the coach of the giant says no\nI Can't imagine you lamenting is very happy the actually the coach of the giants of Fox Sports a quote they said he was pissed off and living yeah that's what to do back injuries and actually he spoke afterward to ah the press about it you want to hear that yeah his head coach pat ... of the giants\nAre a salmon answer all the drama questions right now and I'm gonna go back\nTo what I said All right I address it without a doubt I addressed it with our team I've publicly declared that I didn't agree with his comments and I asked anybody that was interested if they want a clarification go to a hotel 'cause he's a big man\nNow I'm not going to give the public a pound of flesh on this right that would make me small not strong and these are the kinds of things in my opinion when\nYou have the locker room that we have that will help galvanized young 'cause the locker room took care of it and that's all I'm saying on it for NATO dark if you have follow up questions with this matter go see or do\nThey have it I Love it when their coach speaks French hey but listen [laughter] that was French huh oh del actually\nSaid I stand by everything I said no regrets no regrets yeah so um the German or put a tourist or is it still ...\nI think it's put to I mean look I think ... I think Eli is probably passed\nUm you know ... or Dell chalk it up to listen you're paying me a lot of money um I've never been put in a position of leadership before and he feels like as the team's leader\nHe needs to point out all of the wars and inconsistencies and this comes from a guy by the way that although when a men's talent in my opinion as good as any wide receiver input bowl\nWas still is and always will be a jerk off I'm paying them I'm I'm not a number of them you gotta pay and you've got to keep him but he is a complete\nDo ... I mean I think to go to the press before a game like yesterday was uh when we went to ESPN and we didn't go to like they'll do pose to use the ESPN football interview what are you going to have some nice things that is what I'm saying yeah I think that was a deep\nBag move on his part and uh it's probably won't get better\nI probably will not get better with them because then him going back and saying I stand by what I said no regrets but I mean look the fact that it seemed like it almost with a ... a fire and the giants because they did\nPlay well I mean I was stunned at the end when a when Caroline to kick the field goal that they should have won the gas giants you don't want to get a giant just you\nKnow they they should have but what he said though and now that that I think that that causes turmoil and they just can't be good\nWell you know and the giants and I wanted for there'll be of the eagles on Thursday night the season is basically over he like had a mixed bag through some really bad interceptions really bad interceptions but then of course you got that dramatic Dr should have won the game\nSo it's kind of a mixed bag for Ely a mixed bag for oh dealt Barclay again was outstanding really good amazes zero right by the way that that last the epic he's okay they already said he's going to play on Thursday night and he's been terrific this argument back and forth to the giants the right guy to come up\nUm but it's funny that there were two guys in New York football\nThat take a beating before the games or do back in junior with the giants\nAnd then you get this kid I say well what the judge he's the guy that got when the Cleveland Browns he was the hero yesterday the hero he broke records two hundred and Fifteen or to oh it's a fantastic but you remember he's the guy that had that depiction on his social media of the top\nHaving his throat cut open more sort of like ISIS that's why I say of course he's also the guy last week that was wiping as is and what did he get because of that [laughter]\nI got a sponsorship deal would do like what I'm saying so I'm Talking to Peter Schwartz\nO W up and you know sit sports Sunday before the game he was my reporter I've met life for the jets and Broncos I'm always saying this guy Caldwell is a dark bank probably she'll be suspended or goes out and gets two hundred and fifty yards\nIn addition to the incidents you mentioned he also has a ...
