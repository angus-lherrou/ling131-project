was\nYou know what he's my husband I Love 'em I'm I'm not going to uh\nNo uh kill them or or or you know some oil\nOr support him uh he did what he did this is about me I mean something like that where she doesn't have to a make ourselves look bad if in fact she does care about women or even malign her own husband just kind of play the fifth right Ron respond to go out no no you're right my husband's his comeback I don't know if I could do that\nBut I my I Would uh I think that if that has to take me too movement had occurred in say twenty fourteen prior to her presidential aspirations the second time around\nI think she would have dumped him I think so I think so I think she would have dumped them for a political expediency I don't think so I think she I think she's still thought he would be an asset even with all that nastiness out there he would still be an asset\nSo a lot of folks out there the vote Democrat that still think he's the best president we've ever had ever yeah I mean they don't care what he did but they don't care except\nAny of the mainstream Democrats today are they all say that not only in retrospect not all ...\nAll the hash tag ... has to take me to Democrats they like the the women Democrats ah Joel Brand or Kamala Harris and all those people well again they'll distance themselves then\nThat's anecdotal that those all again you keep mentioning three people and I I don't give you some more out of total notes I talked to friends and family and I bring that up that Clinton did all these things and the quick they say yeah but the country prospered we've run you know best financial shape a bomb bomb bomb bomb so they're not so she can she would have\nKept them Germany prospered on their Hitler products from their rights great you're right but uh I think she's just a a pretty pretty scheming and manipulative and uh I don't know I just get that feeling that you would have said a listen bill\nI got to cut you loose or she didn't do getting in a way of my she didn't do it by now she never would have done what do you find it again just if the has to me too movement is on a woman earlier I don't know [noise]\nOnly knows that she uh she sounded very fullest yes I was that was terrible I mean I was terrible her age whether she's an adult or not has nothing to do with it\nShe was smitten she will start truck saw struck by the most powerful man in the world and he took advantage of it and that's the bottom line you got to be a genius to figure that out and she should know better\nAnd how about uh of course are now calling for incivility\nNo I mean just feeding into you know the the the there was a a a baseball field full of Congress men who were actually are almost assassinated because people were calling for instability yeah and\nIt's actually gotten a lot worse since ... has gotten back then I don't even remember being Maxine\nWaters or or Hillary or hold or\nSaying things back then I actually I think it's gotten a lot more since then I don't remember them calling for instability back then they showed up at events and been violent even back then under George Soros but all of this rhetoric has started since then what's real and makes it a head scratcher a lot of you you\nDid have the uh the people the anti for people who were beaten up but Trump supporters and so again I said that that was\nViolence out the events but they were not mainstream politicians asking for violence\nListen to this list a said this is a for twenty twenty democratic presidential nominations who's more most likely to win and this is a CNN poll Kamala Harris this first\nNope nope art then um [noise] I'm not going with Cory Booker are they own a Bernie Sanders nope while not Sanders not Booker nope not Harris and they got to be going with I couldn't even tell you\nI got to tell you they're Goldberg I Swear to God it's Bernie Sanders thirty three per\nSe I sat learning is that no I'm Sorry Joe Biden told [laughter]\nThere's fighting thirty three per se is he running well who knows what's going to be eighty two people think that people think the Democratic presidential nominee will be twenty twenty\nThirty three percent and it's similar poll forecast a Hillary Clinton back two years before she announced just like now would be two years before the election right\nOr they had her up there AS number one\nBut anyway thirty three for Biden Thirteen for burning nine for Kamala Harris April is Warren five for a Cory Booker and then a John Kerry gets five percent and Mike Bloomberg right gets for peace well he would run as an independent he thought he would run as a Democrat\nAnd we went on to the um the the gambling websites by the way have Kamala Harris as the odds on favorite not a\nNot a Joe Biden\nYeah I Can't see a I mean he's going to be too old rich way too old and he's got a lot of skeletons in his closet including speaking of has to take me to\nThe way he grilled Anita Hill I Know he's apologized for it but uh I don't think a lot of a lot of these women are in a forgiving mood well at this point I think people even room while the bring it out I guess oh sure they will yeah\nYeah but anyway you have by Sanders\nThe two of them between the two of them they've lived a over a hundred and sixty years [laughter] and then the two leading contenders for twenty twenty and listen\nDonald Trump is no

New York city\nSo there's not even one Republican in one of these major races that has a shot not one\nNot the only Republican you have really is dead out of it and so now you're you're eating and leaves Elvis out Long Island All right they though I've I ended up as a national guys but uh\nBut yeah but statewide in a city wide no no chance no no no no not exactly but in New Jersey let me just tell you this yeah this is Bob you can just taking the gloves off we love him be sexually yes we do of a marine self made businessman and just a good guy\nBut finally he's going after he's gone after Mendez in a serious way Melendez is essentially a rapist that's right that's exactly right that's what I said and that's what this commercial above you can just released alleges it begins\nWith a voice you hear is that of a creepy sleazy Senator Bob Menendez\nWhen will me as a society begin to believe what Trump's where I get a credit lie about underage girls were teens new according to the FBI\nIs your ... not allegation engaging\nIn something in the Republican race here in this shocking FBI out to eat and President Obama Justice Department had\nThat for several years has been traveling

percent accurate no hyperbole none of that that was accurate\nHe wasn't even a quid the jury was hog right and it was the Obama ... the Obama Justice department that brought\nThe charges against him so my question to you is is that a really good commercial which we think it is obviously or is it three weeks before the election as you say quote unquote taken off the gloves is that a sign of a desperation\nOh no no no I ... the the polls have them a negative ... statistical side okay so it's just I'm sure it was planned all the long list of what are we going to you know hit him with

New York post they're doing a big preview today on the upcoming NBA season two big games tonight Knicks hosting Atlanta nets in Detroit with the pistons local season starts tomorrow night something about the logjam point going into the Knickerbockers would really like to see\nNo Keno come up with a Frenchman in his second year what the Knicks indeed that guy he put on some muscle put on some way here during the off season to me he looked a heck of a lot stronger during these pre season games what about the Frenchman a point guard moving forward\nYeah we'll find out in a few hours ... Togo so you know tell us a after practice today [noise]\nListen Miller King I had the best pre season of all the guys at point guard but he plays other positions they could put a shooting guard he could play small forward so does first I Want to start with him at point guard and use a lot of minutes there when he could come off the bench\nAnd he could play the two in the three and a little at the one uh Trey Burke\nFinished up as a starting point guard last season\nBut ah he didn't have a good pre season at All right now I'm torn I don't know which way he's going to go three days ago four days ago I thought he was going to go with Trey Burke but I think there's a mounting a momentum for Frank to start\nA he shot well he defended beautifully he really looks like a different player he's gained an inch and a half he's six foot six he's put on ten pounds\nHe looks more comfortable look stronger go into the basket he had a really bad rookie year I think we're going to be very surprised and happy at his second season\n... your best player on the nexus in his cancer now provided that ah the government of turkey doesn't whack them which that they they hate his guts for some reason but he might not even be a Nick after this year ride\nYeah he'll be a free agent he's making a ... million dollars this year it's going to be very tough to resign and the only way they get him back is if they are flopping free agency and can't find anyone else he's a leader he grabs off into rebounds defensive rebounds\nScores inside is even improved his mobility on defense during preseason he's considered an old school center and that's not the way the NBA is going they want seven footer should be shooting three pointers that's not and if\nHe's a great guy with the media you know you you're probably come on your show every all yeah\nIt was asking them yup I'm is ages already contacted me to be completely honest I don't either weekly spot I Swear to God he\nIs a terrific guy and he loves the media and right now he's you know the guy we go to in the locker room but\nAgain the next are looking to be more of a modern team and have more of a center who is an outside threat a but for now he's going to post fourteen points and fourteen rebounds and I that's my prediction I think that's what he's going to average ...\nOut on the way out about sixty seconds to go I remember during the midday show with Jodie McDonald circuit two thousand three one burning I Will not do than when I miss\nAnd the you know I say is coming any spending eight million dollars on guys like ... you know

the niche charge more for their seats than anybody in the NBA they can't camera down\nWhile they turn it down and this is this is tearing it down all these guys are kids there's not one that's when
