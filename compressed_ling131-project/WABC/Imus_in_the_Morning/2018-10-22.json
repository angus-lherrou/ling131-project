them and you know that he's right behind the person\nAbout this sticking the ice oh hello Steven I might man I didn't mean to he was on his porch Sunday yesterday anyway he's scary\nScary but he has to ... we we didn't um stop our Halloween day at the theater on Saturday Bernie we did something and you came up in conversation\nAll separate then yeah like I said Bernie is always kind of making fun that we live in New York City we've spent the better part of forty years living in New York but since we've come back in\nJanuary of two thousand sixteen we're kind of like\nHalf city dwellers have tourists right front I'm always doing stuff that yeah ... well you if you've only been in town a couple of years after a long hiatus yes you say Hi ... yeah I did I got a high end yeah baby\n[laughter]\nDon't we do we do these tourists these so after we're done with a Halloween movie if it only makes sense Bernie than on a Saturday in New York City you keep the horror theme going so we did something that was one of the coolest things I've ever done\nAnd we went on what is called a haunted house tour in New York City ... we're all in Greenwich Village wow and I've got some stories about some houses and some brown stones and some history that Bernie you'd be in the history buff that you are you going to love it you liked it\nLoved it it ain't it by the way of grocery that's where the tornado was a two hour walking toward pointing out brownstone was real famous people die to heal the the ghost is still walking around it ended on grocery four Ninety five growth and that is the apartment building on the corner\nWhere the cast of friends actually live in the show nice that's awesome it is awesome and she tells a story that I didn't know this because I don't last week Juliet put this story up there was a liberal considering bringing friends back together or we built a than that but they hate each other back it up\nWhy did why everybody that worked at like a big bang theory cast members hate each other enough friends\nLet's just like you and to be encouraged to LA rise lacking Christ supposedly the biggest jerk off of all David trimmer tells a story that towards the end of the guy the guy ended up towards gives me that he bought a a landmark building in the East Village\nDavid trimmer bought a landmark building in the East Village and the mother effort tore it down\nEven though it was a landmark already doubled his own time yeah yeah it's actually a contempt for the vote I get Maxine all the people in the East Village hate David trimmer we hit him now too we are moving so I'll give you some of the history behind district is that some of the buildings in the west village that'll haunted\nIncluding one apartment\nWhen Mark Twain and Joel's Steinberg Marco Mark Twain oh there's a twin twenty and and Joel Steinberg you remember him right yes now that's scary they lived in the same no kidding not at the same time\nRather than what right right that's one of the most haunted places in the village I get thrown out later on in the [laughter]\nI had my lean burned to bail out you'll be burning instead of Halloween hardest is one hell of a T I Know it's very exciting it really is very very cool for twenty bucks\nYou walk around for two hours and see some of the great then it starts\nWhy didn't Washington Square park she could buy some decent weed ... and and and again as you pointed out what the what the attraction here is that those buildings all the original building although he was ... right they were there I mean the place which I which all Steinberg killed his daughter Lisa which became his adopted daughter went to public school\n... ... that that ... been there for like two hundred years of a freaking diaper bag while you're there if you start to talk in Washington Square park is is that guy still in jail got out of jail ten years ago a very good question it to the poor little girl and you know people forget that she was even adopted legally\nThey also had a little boy in that building Mitchell he was also not adopted legally he was given back\nTo his natural mother ... moved to Harlem and go to prison about ten years ago it was her name hadn't noticed that enough found that's right now with all that you know gross that's tight you know very similar stories the Joe Steinberg into domestic abuse\nThere was a very famous wide receiver want the Colorado was a big time all American player got drafted in Nineteen Ninety seven by the Carolina Panthers spent three years between Ninety seven Ninety nine with the Carolina Panthers and was coming on as ... as one of the best young wide receivers in the NFL when he decided\nHe was going to kill his pregnant girlfriend\nPregnant with his son yeah this is a is a guy from Tennessee or something like ... ... that's right recruit he killed ... Adams yeah his son chancellor was born he's got some\nIssues to sell to the state lives out in California anyway he was sentenced to Eighteen to twenty four years back in two thousand one this morning today\nRecoup roof will walk out a frequent walks oh my God that unbelievable number that story that's an injustice how does that guy ... how do you just typed in girl printed out the ones that you wanted to go see his son it's all about the judge that\nHis son's a bit if you have to vote right wing party always says that is why voting some point I got these these cut them loose Bruce creates these mother at first I'm telling you that you guys getting out of jail today walks out today right currently\nHere and he was like the most hated guy yeah I mean what he did was was was revolting we hug me ... and he's still a young man yes he's got to be what in his forties now I was very early twenties early forties yeah maybe mid forties forty four forty four she he got sentenced\nTo kill due in Nineteen Ninety nine but he got sentenced in two thousand one you may remember we had like a little bit of a tragedy here in two thousand one\nSo it fell under the radar exactly but for a little while there he was like the most hated man in America he was OJ basically killed the girl\nKids born he walks out of prison today\nSeattle ties up so nicely it really does things that happened during nine eleven what ever happened with Gary Condit that whole thing that well he he was innocent he didn't kill John highly they think are really good at it was a it was an illegal immigrant yeah [laughter]\nYeah I ... that was where do I go to get my reputation look at you were asking what ever happened to Gary Condit yes as though he was the guilty part I Know I thought it was guilty well I'm ... I'm not sure he isn't by the way it was because they tell you some\nWell according to the investigation and the police and all they had another guy yeah\nWe'll we'll see I Know we've got a very good

walking towards McDonald's ... bumping into Saturday morning and there's like seven eye witness news trucks across the street from my house don't like oh my God somebody must have got writes I don't know you know\nSo I woke up to the turkey the what are you guys doing here of course of course I say a chip for the\nBernie ... you know maybe you get this like oh my God I'm I'm working for us it's nice and fresh rubber may affairs [laughter] all the guy actually bought\nUp up to be on the other guys that go I was on his new Bernie every single day so that plucked outside the candy store the the convenience store whatever you call that they sell newspapers and you know the Muslim guys\nAnd uh there's like three trucks parked outside because they were they were filming people buying a lot going on taking money which I guess nobody won one queen ... billion actually\nThere are two very with is the Powerball Powerball ... and the mega millions but go ahead no so how much is a ... you know ... one point six wow that's the mega millions what Megan ... one point six the other is like six hundred billion okay so there was a witness news all over that but I really don't know who's ... is it loose Cho\nAre very possibly shut up ... Cheryl how do you say hunting shut up veteran ... if it was Saturday was neither one they don't want to but it's almost ... who's going to moderate that debate oh don't matter Bill Ritter Bill Ritter that's right exactly no is that right that's for sure for ... that's a fact you nailed that second second guess All right\nYou nailed by wasn't stories about bill at oh I thought I\nI I wasn't either I was kidding about it in fact I was gonna say bill\nEvans but no it's Bill Ritter who are\nQuite frankly I mean he's he's not a political heavyweight but still he'll be fine he's a sharp God though he hates 'em I Believe he's one of those\nHorrible liberal dams up yeah so we'll see how it goes but as long as he lets them so he has fair questions and ... you know dummies up stays out of the way\nShe's uh she's ... she's very assertive very smart this chili Farley ... however however you you pronounce your name let me ask you there's no one knows more about there's something new and I mean that nobody\nWhat is what are the we have to break in my two minutes put give me the two or three major issues\nThat they're going to debate you and I are clearly on faulty side which we can change out of job and wants to come on we do that without having a rose dude on what um what are the the major issues but we are with falling on part of the reason why we don't like\nTo them that well I think it's going to be a first of all the way she ran away from the state of Israel that's a I think that's going to be a big topic the way she just does it just just throw them overboard also\nThe way she abandoned due process during the Brett Kavanaugh saying I think that's going to be a big issue I mean she's a chilly fall is women but she's still a woman but she still believes in you know two hundred years of jurisprudence in this country generations of it\nSo those are two issues and she may bring up the fact that ah upstate New York is still basically a financial slump she may bring those those three issues with ... with the highest taxed nation in the state\nAnd we give a lot of money the same thing that bothers you can set about New Jersey we send a lot of money to Washington we don't get it back so with the highest tax yeah that is Trump's fault isn't it\nWell no that's the centers wall for not representing okay properly okay\nEr and Schumer as well right for not doing a good job on that front and also like I said ... with the highest tax so uh that that she's for the salt adoptions she's not for the soul to directions\nBut still the root of the problem is the fact that our taxes are eight point six percent the highest in the nation which is a a disgrace so I think those three issues\nThere'll be a huge and and and again just the fact that ah Joel Brand is just a double talking a phony who flipped totally she used to be a moderate and now she's uh\nUh she's she's she's Linda ... without the are stupid he job one of their their their friends I mean she writes a nice thing about our world and I got her mind yeah six she she she she says a lunatic but we're all going to talk to falling on the show later on today are all kidding aside we aren't in the middle of Bernie\nAnd said in the morning show of all what's become a a a struggle a power struggle if you will match a Rosen Dan Donovan both want us\nAnd they they are they're pulling out as both of them turn into a whole weekend of emails and chaos it really did we got that story kind of like what happened to between ...

I Am keeping holding up well\nWe'll see we'll Cory Booker goes down again but it's it's a big story and eventually the major news outlets will pick\nIt up okay well we had to put a Bernie Bernie McGovern that's on Saturday ... that was a point that we care about your point about that's right we called it with Matt Lauer and we might have called with Cory Booker will have to wait and see what take a short break when we get back\nTo very hot races down in South Florida getting national attention all over CNN MSNBC and Fox this morning we'll talk the morning show hosts at eight fifty am a former sister station towering told us on the two big races but after these were\nLaws are not for him to touch on friday morning [noise]\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI care once in a while ago I was walking and find that right right right and I don't know what happened I've had the after effects of that in my hand and my great\nAnd I noticed that I accept that I don't have that that is I think the I Am\nVery wet and I don't feel that they should have it like it's like my nerves are getting killed it's just wonderful I I'm very well on it\nWhen he was asked what would a socialist agenda do for the state of Florida because that's what\nThey're you know arguing the Andrew Gillum to try and propose it says we really don't want to monkey around with that data so that was a a bad turn of phrase for him and he's still he's kind of been under the radar since that phrase without her and now the debate last night came out and the two could not be further apart on the environment healthcare\nPresident Trump a gun control following Parkland\nBut I'll tell ya early voting starts today in many of the county that it will be across the state on Saturday but\nThe to still have another debate on Wednesday the twenty fourth and Broward College so\nYou know at this early voting if you cast your ballot now something might happen on when they are and that but you never know\nYou can never tell a caring Curtis from W. S. T. O. down in Fort Lauderdale West Palm beach excuse me journalism or the monkey up comment I mean anybody with half a brain doesn't really think that ah the census was trying to invoke any sort of a racial stereotype or anything does he do that\nNow you know the term monkey wrench throw a monkey wrench into with Charles monkey invented the monkey wrench and then they changed the spelling his last name was with the the not the case may be with you know referring to like don't throw a monkey wrench into the economy\nOf course but I really you know if\nIt's obviously he did not mean anything racist by and he even said I'm not going to even you know\nYou always have to look at the but the counter but that's not the question or to Bernie's point was yes Bernie that the Democrats absolutely rallied around that made it that so whether he intended to say something nice you know which of course he did not doesn't\nMatter because the fact is it is hurting them yes or no yeah apparently that we have yet right\nBut it but anybody with a Russian ... another using it to hammer him over the head with they don't believe he meant that are in his sinister way either they can't possibly unless unless the ... the totally devoid of any intelligence\nWell they're saying if he slipped\nUp he should've corrected himself immediately but I don't even think he realized the connotation of it when he ordered it and you know until after the fact right also said that um he also said that given with articulate and they took that as a racist comment saying that what you got whatever\nBy what would you point out the fact African American man there's a particular by the way like Joe Biden did right right okay so you got the big one a second debate Wednesday night the sadness and give them the other way which is getting national attention or Donald Trump mentioned rich Scotty was the governor but he was going up against the rocks going down there and Bill Nelson I own a car and\nAnd the last look Nelson up about five points old it's like the former governor is in big trouble\nWell the governor has pulled out of debate to stop because he's still dealing with the aftermath of hurricane Michael so you know and rightly so if he was on the campaign trail and really not helping the pan handle that would look odd so\nWe'll see what happens I don't know if you believe these polls but it's hard for us here in Florida they believe this poll I tell I felt something you know until actually November six rolls around and we see what happens\nRight exactly listen uh tearing I watched the debate last night and a dissent has really had a I think he had Gillum on the ropes when he was talking about the murder rate in Tallahassee and the fact that the corruption about the paying for the Hamilton tickets I mean Gillum really didn't have an answer for it\nYeah well there's an investigation so you can't really sides corruption that's always you don't want to hear inoperable corruption or indictment ever it's rare regarding yourself so we'll see what happens with that but uh you know in terms of his platform a socialist platform he wants to expand Medicaid here in Florida\nI'm In a Governor Scott really has a stake in the black\nI mean we're in and I don't mean that in the next to Matt in terms\nOf all when we're not going to go out and see what my God oh\nMy gosh yeah so we have you know our our shores and bought\nA joblessness is down a we have a large surplus of money we're doing very well so you know I think Floridians ah I mean the guilt and says he wants to add a forty percent tax on business\nYeah Medicare for all that somebody's for Medicare Medicaid as well as expanding Medicaid so yeah\nWell you wonder if the whole gun control thing go after Parkland huh I don't I don't mean you know right wing or Muslim or types I mean people may be nearing towards the middle debate ten now because of the tragedy took place right then they're in trouble to lean towards Gillum even if in the past they had not\nWell what's interesting is that run the fantasy says he would immediately fire sheriff Scott Israel which the FBI Eliot till end ... what happened and that and Gail I'm I'm is you know more for gun control but remember the governor came back and like a week or two after the shooting on Valentine's Day passed\nA sweeping legislation to you know raising the age that you can buy a gun\nOne a outlaw the assault rifles I mean so many things that he did as a Republican governor or to answer the question so\nIt's kind of interesting where run to the other is standing we'll see what happens but yeah I think Parkland is going to wait on everyone's mind when they go on the ballot box\nYes or Gillum did sort of defense Scott Israel and uh but but but having said all that he's a very good a character that he's a very formidable candidate and uh so anything could happen in the races up almost ... retired uh we'll see what happens tearing Curtis from W F

I think you're going to college but you still hear this even today this age old argument oh you guys really athletes\n\nAre you asking me I don't really care whether athletes or not we just drive race cars and have fun I don't [laughter] argument or not\nI don't know what that gets us if we can convince the world that we're at late but um if you like a you know if you like cars and you're like guys racing cars are then you're going to like NASCAR\nI Love it I Love the attitude that's great deal on her junior the book racing to the finish hey do so uh you quit though is the game about a year ago and are you right\nWas running out of my ... my secrets were about to be exposed to the world and you were getting fertilizer\nAnd he quit the game tell us the behind the scenes of what happened\nWell basically I suffered a concussion or in two thousand and twelve got they got the treatment that I needed got well and a wet\nAnd one from right here that think things are going pretty well for me and do that and Thirteen and fourteen I started a dealing with the more symptoms after some crashes throughout without a fourteen Fifteen\nAnd I uh I didn't get them treated I we are basically tried to race and continue to race or and manage that situation myself and that uh they piled up they got about ... twelve concussions over on you to\nTwo and a half years and just you know it just became something that I can no longer manage myself and I went to the doctor and I had to sit out half a season but we fix all the problems that I finished my last ... you know my last year my contract in two thousand Seventeen healthy\nBut I read the book basically share it with people how I made that mistake or trying to manage that situation myself and basically layer and a bunch of concussions together and a series of you know a few months and it created a lot of problem for me so\nI uh you know I don't want to see someone make that same mistake and you don't want to be a race car driver you don't even have to be an athlete this can be for the you know somebody on the job or or or somebody in a car accident uh I'm just trying to point people in the right direction and get the help they need\nThe pipeline through Daytona winning the race twice by the way you know foreign fourteen like you mentioned junior those are pretty good for you and are wrapped up about four hundred million dollars worth of work when you're with time last year I Will ask you this when you made the switch and I guess it was around two thousand twelve\nTo one hundred motor sports was a big big deal Dale put people in the game how was that for you was it difficult to do that make that switch success obviously but to make that switch in two thousand twelve how big a deal with that for you\nWell it was a opportunity to drop some of the best cars in the sport and if you're you know\nYou're playing on the team and you look across the garage and you see guys the ailing and cars that are that are good and you know I was with a great team but there's other good teams in the garage and you're always curious about their culture and what their cars feel like and how they drive and\nThey're winning championships there when a lot of races so you just obviously curious and when opportunity came to be able to get in one of those cars and work for that company and drive for that team\nIt's hard not to pass up and I'm Glad I did it I really got an opportunity to understand what a championship culture is white and a\nLearned a lot and grew as a person being around all those individuals that they can that\nYou know or you can be our guest here on the burning to chose Dale Earnhardt junior the book is racing to the finish\nA Dell just generally speaking I mean there are a lot of a well known names out there of races Jimmy Johnson Jeff Gordon all and there are a lot of fights too and I'm just wondering if there was like some guys who initiates by two were particularly got under your skin I mean we'll drive we have road rage\nBut I mean you guys it's intense is there anybody out there that uh you you particularly says that son of a bitch I'm going to take to anybody like that\nUm you

will pay you off then cut you off or do something that you don't live but you get over it pretty quickly or you got to move on you got to raise those guys every single week and then\nYou also got what you want to do what you want to accomplish and if you're thinking about this other guy and trying to get him back you're not thinking about what you need to be doing to try to win re right\nRight
