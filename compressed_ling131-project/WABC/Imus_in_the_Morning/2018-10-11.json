out campaign and let me tell you something okay what we think of this guy he's Seventy two years old he's on the plane every day ... himself all over the country speaking with the same level of the Tuesday as in every single speech in every single way\nSo I mean he's going to be very very tough to be I'm I'm looking for the cage match WMA cage match joke by Donald Trump rather get the prize that we've got to get the president on a few slim fast shakes before we could have been\nAround you talk about it you have your friend Michael ... he came out yesterday and said I Want to fight president

declared victory because they'll still keep the Senate\nOr loses their house which typically happens in a bitter electric for every president so it's not clear to me that this is going to be different if you look at the data the data really doesn't lie or twenty three days out you know data does not look good for the Republican so but I think I think the Kavanaugh stuff Howard I'm up\nAs it related to fund raising it Howard I'm up as a related to the Senate but I think that's good news for the president I think you could use this\nAre going into twenty twenty or that the Democrats in the house or obstructing and so on and so forth so look he's going to be very tough to be I Know I Know his approval ratings are bouncing retribution as about fifty other people have that forty one\nBut in a

Garner's gainful employment he can come back to New Jersey but Bernie you you you think\nThat no matter what there's this whole thing is just a ... there was a blast a September twenty eight that was out in Freeport Long Island right that's a terrible place by the report\nActually the northern Mali where I had my first date on the non violence is\nBeautiful and I and I have friends who live in a free board it's parts of it or not you\nKnow never visit them [laughter] come to me if there\nAre only made up in order to come I read all the higher up like a woman and reports he was followed home it or not she was the thirty six year old mother of two she's followed home\nBy some twenty four year old he falls into her house knocks or out on her front lawn knocks rocks around cold more conscious of\nRates are for an hour oh come on and Britain as she woke up during the rape and he knocked around to get home and she uh she has she ended up she had a broken Joel now she's uh thirty six year old mother of two you know they got this happened in front of him for ... you know you don't know I don't know if this ... I mean and she's she'll go unnamed of\nCourse the nobody identified her but uh\nBut here's the thing the guy that did it to her was in an illegal immigrant and not only was he an illegal immigrant he had been court sent back and came back again right\nAnd yet it also there's reports are that he is criminal convictions and they couldn't they didn't the border they let them out instead of sending them back to where we came from El Salvador in this case by they let him stay\nSo do you think that the New Jersey folks are trying to send a message do one thing I mean I'm I'm confused as to why that would be the case as well\nRight why why why the hell are they I mean the guy and tax fraud and on September twelfth of last month\nThe department of homeland security did a raid and they they grabbed a bunch of people try to grab I think sixteen people you know and all of them are five or six were sex offenders well we've got ... ... do you guys right Bronx guys in Nassau County or not white collar crimes I noted\nNor do what they did say are going back to when he was initially convicted ... and when they sent them away this is almost three years ago now they did say that that there was a very good chance you'd have to go home\nYou know but everybody was saying there are just sit there just saying that because of the high profile person and they when they don't want to look like they're a bunch of you know ... and ... and not coming down hard on people who break the ... where is where we're\nAnd your outrage over this guy is illegal immigrant in Nassau County because they have sanctuary cities or we have a weak as border\nAnd a woman you I mean we're talking about it is the year of his take me to all that the woman here I mean my congressman by Congress woman is Kathleen Rice yeah who is a big uh you know supporter of the movement and all that stuff yeah and Governor Cuomo is in Seoul center to deliver\nThis guy was allowed to stay here at home you want to be a ...\nAnd also because I thought that she ended up right\nBut anyway I think the government Cisco that shot Kate says that's another one you also went back it was this one is local that's what I this is relevant to what happened and you didn't hear much about it because they're not on bravo TV violent happening what what you're saying well I mean I've I've said people should shine a light on what we just did that\nBut now it's ... it's just showing that worried about Joe Judy Joe\nWhen you've got people on the guy in Huntington station a forty year old he had a conviction for re people's caught up in that sweep on September twelfth he had a conviction for rape and they let him back out on the streets along I Will\nBe two different things you're right we we often find a lot of these people don't commit heinous crimes have done it before and there are still here no one's going to argue that those people should have been sent back and kept their numbers about maybe six and I want some of the Democrats will but this is a white collar crime he didn't really hurt anybody go\nBut you're saying though that then that that it's basically just it sounds like what you're saying is that it's just you know sort of a technicality yet you have to go back there but if you're if you're gainfully employed back here in the United states that's right and it's cool yeah I Know it's kind of like a little bit of a slap it's like you're sort of deporting but not really\nRight that's what I'm saying if that was not authorized drama with Daniel Rosenberg I can guarantee that but I think that's the case I think it'd be gets a real job he can come back up I I I'm not\nI don't know about that but either way to me you have that there are other people that systematically methodically but by the law the United states can stay here and you're gonna throw this guy out it\nDoesn't make any sense I mean it doesn't make any rapists all kinds of ... and other violent criminals but but in this case you know that rape on Long Island let's turn on the other thing is\nYou know it's it's it's funny the way Bernie did this\nBernie comes up with all these real pots and we'll banks and and and serious crimes we just wanted to talk about Robert my what I Believe down deep Juliet that he loves you would never admit it\nBut he loves the real housewives of New Jersey he loves going to ... I got this is his way of making an argument that keep Joel limits on the show I happen to really like to ... see she's\nLike yeah and I and I really like a ... point last year\nThat she really was recently or she did this body building talked to did you see that picture I didn't but I mean when she was in prison and those are sounds to me she was like ... right now she transformed herself to what she was she actually will like a bomb and they took a picture of me looked like and\nShe looked I Wonder if it's very likely animal shows on celebrity ...

Y. T. E. fighters\nOn sale now at Amazon dot com like this for a visit Doug books that the U. N. N. books dot\nGov hey man Miami's breast cancer center in Brooklyn\nI celebrate these guys I mean they deal with horrible stuff every day I took a tour a couple of weeks ago\nThe way we treat each other now is this the new normal is this what's okay and you have to sit and check in with yourself or you're doing a disservice to you to your kids to the to the future generations that are looking at adults and emulating their behavior and that adult behavior is getting more and more toddler ask\nYou you're absolutely correct and part of the problem with these ah these cowardly trolls is the anonymity that they enjoy online and uh it makes the the comments way way more vicious than than if they told you to your face or you could see where you know who they were sort of a President Trump in ... so he was on every social [laughter]\nBut they don't like\nTo talk about political please I've been trying to get Trump or whatever I Want to send them a copy of my book\nI don't I don't\nKnow him can you pass him a copy and just be like please do it's a favor to get off Twitter it's not helpful because you know sometimes the undermines his own policy and I I agree with the policy you know during those Brett Kavanaugh hearings I was sitting at home saying please don't wait\nPolice on and on\nAnd he didn't well for the most part any sort of got involved later on but you know the other issue with that is if you could have the best of intentions but in that short amount of space your tone of voice isn't coming through the context isn't there\nSo he ... he is very true you know misconstrued Larry Gross is\nWorried you know I was a former teacher a former dean of a high school\nAnd I saw what was happening to kids that these kids don't know how to communicate anymore with each other the into personal\nSkills are down the drain and I was worried um I actually close the book with a letter to the next generation because you're always talking politics about the future of the country you can't talk about the future of the country if you're not having a conversation with young people about how they're behaving in these medium\nAnd really the challenges they had that we didn't have we didn't have all these dating apps and all this social media and going on Instagram and comparing your body as your you know you're you're sixteen years old and you have an awkward stage and you're comparing your body to photo photo shop\nFiltered images these are challenges we didn't have and I think the first step is to say to them listen we get it this is tough you know we're here to kinda talk you through those conversations with you and and make them feel hurt as well\nBut it's very very unhealthy ... below the book is called has to do not disturb how it goes to my cell phone to take back my life tonight Barnes and noble bookstore eighty six elections in at seven o'clock\nOr ... what is this book was born and raised and the bigger picture in your book and it's all because this is epidemic at this point the addiction to not only cell phones but uh as you point out been watching the spoils the whole time video games all this stuff and you tell the story about how when you were to\nYour father even got sucked into it and you're just he just had a taste of it and he was strong enough to to the ...\nAll that you know it's funny that's everybody's favorite story [laughter] yeah my dad my dad is you know in his seventies now he loves WABC\nBy the way he listens all the time he's probably listening right now\nAnd he's he is the least tech savvy guy I Know the guy doesn't tax he doesn't he has a flip phone he has a V. an old school VCR in his bedroom he's got you know it's lined with VHS tapes he takes out a stop watch when he goes walking\nTo kind of measure has time he doesn't have an apple watch he doesn't have anything fancy and when I was a kid I sort of got an addicted I hit the started playing super\nMario Brothers he even got into that like wow I got to get the I got to get the dragon and I got to get that\nAnd I would never say to myself at the time I was shocked I couldn't process at all I was a kid\nBut I wanted to show that even if you are not inclined to be a tech person like you're not the one who's at the apple store to get the new phone right away or you're not of that age group that's you know you know super trendy with all these new tech devices it is possible to get addicted because these\nGaming companies are designing these games and designing these apps to be addictive to you they're studying to behavioral psychology and figuring out well every human being really respond to the same way to stimuli so\nHow many times do we need to get them to click a you know a B or C to get addicted so anybody this could happen to anybody and you have you know we have the we have an attention span right now on average that's less than that of a goldfish\nAnd that's actually\nTrue and ADHD is on the rise and overhauling sides with a rise in these devices so I don't want people you know it's hard just sit back at home a lot of people say well I'm not really a tech person it could happen to anyone and even if you're not sitting on a cell phone how much Netflix do you sit for six seven hours\nOr read or watch a whole lot of a cut her love though you don't step foot outside\nAnd it's okay with it I'm not telling people to throw on your phones away and I'm not saying you can't spend a lazy Sunday and watch movies all day occasionally that's good if it's how we kind of\nGlobal billboard you're saying but but but what you're saying the mother and my father eighty five years old ...\nHe is a junkie I mean and I know that because I go to work at four thirty in the morning and I see my dad when he spoke on Facebook at two thirty study what are you doing up or to go to baseball games so there's an eighty five year old guy my son was for example he could play Fortnite enroll blush all day\nBut what this book is about ... it's like everything else in life\nWhether it's cell phones or Facebook or should not judge\nEating ... I don't care what it is it's just a lesson in\nDoing things I'm Down in the middle of the words don't get addicted don't don't do spend too much time don't go to Josh smugglers hunt for all of this do it in moderation budget right\nIt it's about balance and it's also about thinking you know we've we've accepted this as a new normal that when you go out to dinner with somebody you're sharing your time with them and the and the ten thousand people that are in their phone\nYou know social media on you know tech things\nAnd you know you go on a date it's like if you're the guy and fifty other people on minimum so you don't you don't you know that's\nThat's not healthy that's worth something you should just sit and say well this is life in twenty Eighteen you can do something about it you can make a decision\nFor example to take your phone and put it on an airplane mode while you're sitting with someone and remember that eye contact matters that making people who are important to you feel like hey you know what I'm taking two hours and I'm going to give them my time that's\nStill matters it changes how other people feel about us it changes the interconnectedness then people wonder well why doesn't anybody care about each other anymore why does everybody scream at the top of their lungs\nWell because everybody's completely detached staring at the phone nobody feels respected it carries through\nSo you know all of those things that I talk about even you know keep the phone that the best hip I could give anybody get that phone out of your bedroom because you'll leave that foam in your bedroom you're getting up in the middle of the night you're checking it you're answering an email it's keeping you awake that blue lights coming emanating from the phone\nAnd so if you don't even if you don't read the phone and say the phone is just sitting there studies have shown that just the fact that it's nearby disrupts you and makes you restless because you feel compelled to want to look\nAt it and it it does he get it out of the year it's a huge problem it's a series from really just people spend in regions locked up in their room but anyway it's again it's a serious book as well and it's all is compelling one ... reveal some deeply personal stuff as well it's has to do not disturbed from job to go to bill or how it goes to my cell phone to dig dug Claus\nTonight at Barnes and noble bookstore eighty six elections in seven o'clock ... thank you and er into groceries is on the book is really interesting and important\nThank you got so much it was great to be a little while you were on I was reading what a great book it what\nIt is [laughter] ... what ... what do the right back on the burger\n[noise]\n\nHey folks like me you're on the go all the time because you don't want except for men to never does the ... one thing after another you need something to give you the energy throughout the day [noise]\nWell no I I don't have that issue any longer because I was introduced to this incredible product called balance of nature [noise] it gives you a fraction of a\nHealthy food and if you kept in touch with the big bang boom you're done balance of nature provides real nutrition of overturned serving up thirty one different fruits and vegetables a day off of nature is one hundred percent of all natural whole fruits and vegetables\nAnd they also provided health posts at no charge to guide you with any questions you have\nTo take steps to give herself better overall health like I did have and use it for about five most a lot of families used in South of nature fruits and veggies\nAnd I think coming up with changing my life isn't it time that you did the same poll about a hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one that's eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one for for the balance of nature dot com read all about if\nIt gets up and make sure to let them know you heard it here by using just jump into WABC for special this tell\nUs about the nature dot com you discount goes W.

I like that I write\nAbout your daily ... is with the nation of Islam just got to the restaurant so\nI bumped into you last week yeah we actually start this off and you were talking about Vietnam no there's a lot going on today would you want to get to write but you don't spend a lot of time the last couple of months specifically\nTalking about Vietnam ... history new history from Brian ... is a professor of history that at the Naval Academy okay and what does he come out and told us that we did not know before\nWhat we're looking at here is how decisions are made in the White House or the Eisenhower the Kennedy the Johnson administration because stops with Richard Nixon taking the office that's next volume right\nAnd how the decisions by the national Security Council were based on political trends at that moment that were inconsistent with the best information about where the war was and what the war match\nAnd it's it doesn't matter Republican or Democrat Kennedy Johnson a Eisenhower\nThe decisions were based on what we in the United states needed for the next election right election but I ...\nAnd that is that can be a great strength because you are responsive to the American people but when you're investing blood and treasure in a place on the other side of the world where no one understands what the American interest is what what's what it's for it leads to the tragedy of fifty eight thousand names on the wall and we just eight pounds\nWell you would be a ... in theory was to stop the the the domino theory or they're going to spread of communism I mean that's that's what they were telling us and they actually the the whole Gulf of Tonkin things turned out to be a hoax I mean that they really escalated the war it\nReally didn't happen right it's it's it's so sad you mentioned Tonkin Gulf but we have to go back to the gym brothers and the assassination thought you had it in the beginning of November sixty three which we remember because of the assassination and the end of November Kennedy your heart is ready to\nUh to install the GM brothers who are Catholics and alienated from the Buddhist population of Vietnam and the Nineteen fifties by Eisenhower\nForgive me I don't want to go down the trail too deeply right install them and then to say it's not working out and the ... states they're assassination by military hunter\nIs a prescription if that's the first chapter of a Graham Greene novel you know tragedies coming and so the fact that these the best and the brightest in Nineteen sixty three including John Kennedy\nCould not see that this decision would lead to America's catastrophe is amazing to me and I'm only going to guess because we're all we're all the same as they were in Nineteen sixty three that the same kind of thinking\nHas gone on these last year for the Obama administration and it's going on right now for the Trump Administration you make decisions on the basis of blood and treasure on the immediate needs of the electorate right you're going to make mistakes\nWell let me tell you this and this is one reason why I'm here Bernie can sit with you and Bernie is a historical genius much like you are then you can talk about every battle every skirmish every political decision I Can't okay here's why I'm here\nChuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone going to Vietnam and they are able to rescue nine thousand POWs they get John McCain out in Fifteen minutes I mean ... is that an insulting are you OK when we make a movie like ramble what Chuck Norris walks into one of those guys\nBut we're really died down guys will POWs for years and years we make we make movies about guys going in and having great success\nThat bother you know why he swapped pictures me off because because she got a great
