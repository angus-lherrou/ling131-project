not at all now but by the way we have that order was while we have we have a lot of young is going to be fed so we're not a big Frank exercise I have one [laughter] oh my God yeah friday Woodside so\nPlus we got the unexpected don't last night he uh Alex Smith that's right the quarterback of the Redskins [laughter] yeah Nikki Haley apparently ah well not apparently I saw you hit it out of the party that she was a glamorous and she was hilarious I heard\nThat she did something wrong or right I should say she did something earlier in the week for a private audience and supposedly she said some things some real things about her relationship with Donald Trump he's sworn to secrecy\nWhat ... what is this stuff ... drift out which he said well ... the the way you read the are the headlines are Nikki Haley dishes on her time with Donald Trump look dominance it does but\n... you read it and it's not it's not it's not otherwise it would be the lead story on CNN right that you haven't heard about it because it wasn't God she was like I learned from him\nWhat I advise them not to call that Kim Jong un little rocket man at the un\nAnd he did and it turns out that was the fact of another where she said I learned from what he did right at school but I ended up finally\nBernie and said did it again we have\nPissed off another local politician we've got the audio to explain why\nBut everybody on just what everybody was like wind up seeing this guy is one except for one not a good sign Roland Martin\nHealing am arguing last night on Twitter with Roland Martin good times good times God\nWill give you all of that it's going to be a phenomenal shall we got great guest stopping by making of arrogance fatty acids exactly but she would you got to be careful and I bet it is to to ah to jail because he's African American and he's a he's a loud mouth so if you're fighting with somebody like that on Twitter\nI almost have to let him beat me up because\nI Would rather do that then have anybody out there say anything anything because God Forbid your critical or you involved in a legitimate debate there are different Twitter rules for different people will do like the white guy that was the bad guy oh that's the bottom line as well\nAs well let's be honest look Lewis fact there is there is a double standard but I mean I think you could a rumble with Rowland oh you live without calling names and then and make it or not even calling names if you even if you're winning the argument but believe me calling names if you do that you deserve to be raked over the\nWe took apart by\nWithout a good delivery was out of bed delivery without a good oh yeah oh my God you know the\nSensibilities was so heightened time that yes every little damage right the only thing that came close to the liberal place them on Nikki Haley she was actually a very funny but what what I think is a knowledge is maybe not even but sort of to that 'cause\nSo tense between Trump and Hillary was the mayor and the governor last night who by the way I Believe the only contact came at the very end of the night when the ... shoulder and\nSaid by that's it as another Cuomo was sitting down when the Blasio entered and as he approached the day if they were separated by one person where they were seated\nAt a Cuomo jumped up as the Blasio approach and walked away yeah he didn't want to have to be there to ... that's right yeah and so as you point out yes it was a Cuomo tapped him on the taps the blogs you on the shoulder and says goodbye is a very ... and they were both to buy a ...\nBy Nikki Haley about what you need you said Cuomo got up so we'd have to say hello to the ... yeah that's very similar to Phil Murphy the governor of New Jersey leaving town so he doesn't have to endorse or say something nice about that crooked corrupt piece of garbage\nBumping into the uh the well the er an alleged rapist that ... those then why would dumping them or if you want to you know\nYou have in self tainted by this scum bags or you know hand shaking hands or disappearing together on TV would because Democrats lucked out stuff do they just want to win [laughter] All right but thankfully a ... and this because they're they're they're they're worried is going to lose and ended up those pictures\nWill come back to haunt him in the future when he runs for uh the the two of them together this is New Jersey corruption you know I mean you you can imagine the pictures together yeah\nUh back when they could be for a minute and people throughout and ended the Phil Murphy called cozy it up with an alleged rapist and he doesn't want that wisely or so yeah that's funny front page of the New York post actually\nI'm a boy above you getting out boy he apparently is picking up some big most yes he is very happy about that went up by been one more time\nBefore he wins on November ... and Andre before he wins not saying I like that to them is that confidence is going to win\nHe's like the jets are going to beat the hiking on Sunday he's gonna win okay yes he's going to win the the let's let's call them right now the senator elect their Hugo Bob you'll get\nDid you make sure the senator elect is sometime next week or make sure that as well they know thank you Steve I'm going to talk to Steven ... later on today so innocent somewhat back to Nikki Paul Ryan a little bit Warren everybody mentioned at some point by Nikki Haley last night back to the Smith dinner just cutting number one\nLast year he ... he's a boy scout and that's fine however Wang [noise] kind of scary wanting to buy things again right that he wanted him to another one\nThis one ... [laughter] actually when the president found out that I was in the un American he asked me if I was going to try to live for\nHalf the jobs that I Swear to God I wrote some of that is so far that is good I mean listen if only the late night guys they would step out of their little a political boxes they could write stuff like that are only stuff through but they won't do it and now they won't that's that's that's because she was terrific there would be fun little rhyming can only funny to hear Kimball or\nUm I guess Kobe or any of them but they won't say they they they they they avoid it like to play yeah but there it is that you have Nikki Haley a kill I mean and again she's gonna be the next president I mean who unless of course Trump gets beat\nThis woman here she mean give me money for that's right twenty twenty four right she's ah she's the designated\nA Republican candidate if you ask me because she's as we've pointed out before she's a superstar yeah she's got everything including a she checks though the are going to be identity politics boxes as well but as you see there she's got the delivery the timing the balls to do a funny edgy joke she's got she's good\nIt'll be hard against Ocasio Cortez it'll be two women so we'll be guaranteed do you think I'm kidding I read something today that Bernie Sanders is even kind of stepping back and allowing the

she's an isolationist cute [laughter]\nBut she's we can do it you can hear when she ... she was on with Kim all the other night and she's like like ah like I'm like well ... yeah she she doesn't have the chops now so uh it would be most you can be Congress person from queens Bronx\nBut presidential aspirations she couldn't possibly do handle herself on a national they said the same thing about Donald Trump so to say well she's twenty eight and he's been around he's all ... savvy and a right is a world of difference between the two I mean not to mention of\nHis personal experience as a builder and whatever I I don't wanna she's not going to be the person is going to be other people and Kamala Harris is not going to make sure that Ocasio\nThis upstart from a from the Bronx is not going to overtake come all our mouth is she is not going to be the Democrat or a nominee well you don't have any right now it's not\nYour call Michael Michael Andrew Cuomo is he didn't turn up on that

morning welcome to the gotta wait body burning and sit in the morning show here on Seventy seven WABC a couple of good guys stopping by before we say goodbye [noise] tight I'll turn am [noise]\nI could tell you one earlier this morning only that I was sitting on my couch last night\nWatching several Lewis some guy Bobby who's a\nNew York one and this guy who was detailing how\nMarc Mauer narrow the Republican candidate for governor who by the way is the most disrespected politician ever we love him\nHe's been on here with a bunch yeah he gets a he's a Rodney Dangerfield of yellow six especially no debate against Cuomo wasn't invited last night to the Al Smith dinner I tell you that easy just poor by some gets nothing go because it was going on and on about how\nTomatoes credit because he's made the MTA a big part of his losing platform unfortunately but he actually has a very detailed plan on how to fix it\nUnlike Andrew Cuomo\nYeah he went on to talk about what Cuomo has not the second day of a new\nLine and blah blah blah [noise] so I'm sitting there watching this last night and I'm fighting on Twitter as I'm watching this with your very good friend but awed rolling Martin yeah my buddy yeah but boy what did you guys ... become type when was it ... back in high school [noise]\nWe played on the same football team [laughter]\n[noise] we had a sort of a Aaron Hernandez with their quarterback\nSo the reason why I'm fighting with Roland Martin is I sent out a tweet them to this let us take you back a couple of days ago on the Bernie and said show we had the Republican candidate for Congress Staten Island Dan Donovan on this program\nAnd it was a great conversation deadbeat guy Michael Grimm he's gotten endorsed by President Trump and he's going up against max rose election day and he's leading in the polls he's killing them just like ... brand is killing Chely Farley just like Cuomo killing\nA a friend of mine are all he's killing rose anyway Dan Donovan was on and this eventually transpire\nIn the end you know it was a good debate you guys went back and forth and your certainly we're more in step with you then you know you're you're our guy we weren't doing the bunny into Joe's indoors sing you congratulations Dan Donovan which is every bit as important as President Trump [laughter]\nSo there is that was just as a big deal one was there so it\nTurns out I guess Bernie we were supposed to have ... on a couple of days after Dan Donovan in fact he was already booked he was already but yes so I guess he and his girl his PR girl will listening to that Dan Donovan interview was\nThat you may be presuming a little bit too much I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and leave open the possibility you know throw out a sort of an olive branch leave open the possibility that he didn't hear it that it was one of his people who heard it and made this decision maybe max rose\nThis guy's been to combat in Afghanistan okay let's say you're right right well let's let's push up further so why is it turns out whether it was him or his people they heard the burning instead endorsement for Dan Donovan and max rose canceled\nTheir parents yeah this is a guy that as you said is a a war you know for all the very least wasn't listen he was injured and if they're okay so we think it was in the Army National guard a boy so he's a real hero\nRight yeah you can't take that away not what did you ever noticed that but right say so but if you're going to go to Afghanistan and you're a hero and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts match service can't catch on Bernie and said because we indoors Dan Donovan come on this show and\nTell us when we're wrong about their diet is that you don't can't that plus he's do that you're a one year old\n... ... yes right it may also be\nAnd it's it's something it's just speculation on my part that he heard us trashing his dad Charlie Rose\nOh that's true to write should have done that but I don't know how we can take that back going on as soon as you did trash and for his stature\nI didn't Tresham oh my God you said you needed a step still what I did I said look you know I said I said he wasn't pressuring I said the optics we're not so good it was like tracing their nose you can still had a comment is not being ... if it's being descriptive when you ... it to the Nixon Kennedy\nOr eBay when you saw it on TV you thought Nixon lost because he was sweaty and he had a a five o'clock shadow if you heard it on the radio you thought Nixon one it's the same thing with max rose and then ... if you saw the debate and you see this little guy there at the podium\nBarely I took his head was barely above the podium and they dont ovens is standing there is a tall guy much more imposing ... wasn't very good off that's all I'm pointing that out that they shouldn't have allowed well maybe you didn't like his people did not serve him well\nYou know you're right about that so I guess whatever it was he cancelled so I go on Twitter lessened like oh hold on a second it cannot be running you know it was kind of the same thing with Trump\nYou know I think the president didn't come on this show for the longest time because I wasn't speaking nicely about him and I thought that was a was move if you're going to deal with the world's most ruthless leaders\nAnd you're going to deal with the Democrats as Donald Trump those every single day you can all while sitting Rosenberg they get under your skin it's the same thing with max rose if he's going to tackle Staten island's biggest problems and Brooklyn's biggest\nPart of the nation allowed right yeah you can allow Bernie and sits in Torrance men don't bother to try it I said it does\nShow some balls right no seriously I don't want to talk this respectfully I really don't want to leave open the possibility that he'll come on that he'll he'll reconsider because will treat them very civilized we always do he will give us he will he he may very well when a silver\nYou always said that their own and Martin on finding withdrawing um on Martin goes well why would you come on your show you already in towards the other guy said well wait a second wait a second every now and then it's good to go on the opposition an enemy territory go rolling you went on with me and Bernie a couple of times you survived\nWe didn't kill you and we really dislike you say that [laughter] but uh we give other people opportunities to come on and yes maybe magic rose especially me you can win over\nWe had we had done to Brazil and we had the other guy what's his name the uh who's a Chris Matthews on with Chris Matthews we had a lot lot tire on every Friday I taught but the the the guy who ... who is that the Aretha Franklin funeral the black guy\nWith a book that went bad that don't don't use as an example but we had them I kind of what it was we had an open mind so we bring people want to be known that it doesn't I don't want to use that as a little uh is that was Michael something or other\nRight whatever or whatever just listen but most of the time we treat people nicely it's respectful in fact all the time no not all the time Michael Eric Dyson yeah that was ... and that's just one of those extra couple of\nTimes but on the sooner you know this guy's a war hero he would demand I Will respect and we allow him to speak his mind meld though let the people make up their mind so if you're right\nAnd somebody in his party made that decision uh time above but I'm almost Ninety nine percent sure that's even worse that's like saying to me\nGovernor Christie\nDidn't do the traffic thing it was his people well wait a second well you're the coach of the team you're the governor your people shouldn't be able to make those decisions ... so he was guilty no matter what whether he did it or it's people did it comes back to\n... that's not helping us getting back on when I'm being honest I Know but I don't I don't want you to be honest right [laughter] do to solve it if you want the shackles into the doors then Donovan you know I wasn't for the endorsement I Would have waited until after we ... All right so here's I'm going to\nDo because we really want to get metros on [noise] I Am taking back the endorsement right how long ago endorsing damn Donald ... at this point can you do that I don't know\nWhether you tend to be done in a million [laughter]\nA voting for Hillary Rodham overtime no Hillary try [laughter] yes you can do that so what the thinking vibrating country by\nSo we want max rose that we were kind of like match we like we guess so many of these people made that decision max is is the the owner of the team\nAnd no one's going to tell him what to do he needs to go back to his people\nAnd so you know what I'm gonna go on with those yes listen I can handle is right these two knuckleheads what are you kidding me I got to go to Congress and deal with the uh you know the Savage is down there right I can deal with these two bull headed knuckleheads I'm WABC radio here's the other thing homo doesn't have to debate ... 'cause he's up my thirty points he doesn't have to\nMatch rose is getting his ass kicked bang he needs more than we had him\nWhat if he goes on Bernie and said and I were huge in New York audience and were huge on Staten Island big on Staten Island there like we like max rose how bad you want to go to Washington right on Christmas you've got everything to gain and nothing to laughing at all F Roland Martin and a couple of people on Twitter\nThe heroes you warm max rose and your dad Charlie Rose to hell with them all sorry about that just come on the show right because ... they'll get that

eight teams that make\nThe playoffs on other words ah a LeBron stands to lose a record a record that are of being in the playoffs for\nWhat his entire career basically yeah so this year he stands to lose that already it'll and I think I Know I think I made the playoffs I go up but they're not anywhere near the top seeds Golden State they've already one used in actually lost a first game at home a couple of nights ago with come out of line three Oklahoma City\nThey're not near those teams but there by the second tier the five through eight right we're going to be one of those teams that make

mildly nauseous but I knew what was the last time that happened to you when you got that type of report she'd probably want to know what's weird about that [noise]\nMy doctor was ... what are we coming up next our money she met there on the judging biking dj we got more Nikki Haley from last night one of the local races coming up with a couple of weeks like my friends and my friend says next

was really going to give him a lot\nThose are really stink but he's like I like to ask is the worst of cereals about to come up [noise]\nI just it was a nice guy he was a friend of mine but the thought of this guy touching my wife plus the the roses that arrived at the house after his first visit\nThat would kind of that's set me off a little bit she would get you know we have the same feel the same phone plan so any time as a phone call we see each other calls you know and not what you call come to the doctor\nAnd she's like he just told me by pap smear it was okay but now\nWhat are you in Dade doing\nSo well I got quite so it got to the point where\nIf she went to him the whole weekend was ruined was rolling 'cause I'm just a complete psycho well you\nJealousies a horrendous sentiment terrible right but but poison of course but it it it's bad enough and then all uptight and it was a great look you've got I got to thinking about the only guy out there that was getting freaked out when the white was going to a good looking guy and all\nWell is it I guess that's the case\nWith in the medical profession when you go to a doctor and also if your wife goes to the gym and she has a a hot now you know got really know gotten cut them but nice trainer of handsome trainer yeah no that's not going to have that big black guy like looks like a you know a vendor Holyfield in his heyday right\nWhen we both had that we both I've been looking trends or a you know looks like more gas to know and his ... right\nNot good so that the President Trump said that that would set you up as well right but but here's the difference is a trainer with the gym that ain't life or death you know so you can get rid of that person\nThis doctor actually played a very important role in keeping my wife healthy then ... and he's the best guy no down there but you didn't care about I didn't you cared about right eye she might be attracted to him and he's like ... like lady parts why did she might actually enjoy having a legs in storage yeah\nHe's the best kind of down there [laughter] yeah that's gotta be offered being friends with you I couldn't\nWife's got uncovered you know wasn't that we were friends it didn't matter we will friends yeah it's just that he was so good luck yeah then I just you know it just\nI wouldn't want actually I wouldn't want a good looking males doctor 'cause I I Would be afraid I Would get turned on\nWell the other thing is like if he's good looking like like sometimes when ladies put their legs up for something really like here's a great looking guy checking your wild and like you know you have like a long like a very very ... you don't want to do\nIt now [laughter]\nSo like I don't worry about I go to like I really don't like us who

speaking of the judge snow on the line backer Darren ... on the defense the lie about these three interceptions which is pretty uh pretty impressive no\n[noise] yeah yeah look this is a former first round pick a lot of expectations coming out of Ohio State ... extremely young player when they drafted him and I still think he's finding is way but uh it is encouraging to see him play clearly better than he did a in his first couple of years in the league will see how the next\nYou know two and a half months ago but ah who's going to complain about three interceptions in six games right\nSo on the way a realistic expectations you talked about it you're right about a new one where they can pick up the slack bear but\nNot secondary going up against you mentioned digs feeling is probably the most underrated best wide receiver human National Football league and cousins someone's somebody to bring so what do you think a realistic expectations I think Japan is a more down to third consecutive home when the Sunday they ought to slow down just a bit just\nLots of lately because if they don't get pressure on her cousins have got to kill them evil you'll see a three hundred yard game you'll see probably to one hundred yard gain from feeling index\nIf they can't get cousin's office spot and and and looked at Minnesota and divide frankly is not very good so the jets in theory on paper should be able to disrupt cousins and if you can disrupt cousins\nA he's a he's not going to let you up and I think the jets can win but that is a big question mark if you look at what happened last week against Andrew Luck they\nPressured him a fair amount they only hit him three times that in fact them once\nAnd even though that off as of line of Indianapolis wasn't that good it's clearly better in my estimation than what the jets are going to face this week so it's not a very good Minnesota off at the blind that's an area that the jets have to take advantage of because again

this is this veterinary asking me as a worthy of it yet that's worthy oh boy and it's just the uh well if the ... a cumulative ah\nYeah same with my friend is all of these things about saying one thing lying and then then there'd be letting it never happened\nOne of those ... years been on record saying something and then he will ... will he will swear swear the next day that he never set it and then we will always play the audio were as clear as\nDay he said it right and he did but the thing about it the reason why it's amusing is because princess is so pompous ... period so arrogant right so Koch sure of himself and he's wrong all the time just about the present uh he'll never apologize won't ever acknowledge right like for example we were talking about the markets where the other day\nAnd I congratulate him on winning the super bowl with Denver which he did\nI had the wrong one he didn't beat Seattle He lost to Seattle they're one of the year after they became known in Carolina\nAnd I was like you know you're right I was I wrong you do that all the time ... runs right what I got a stat wrong yeah he'll doesn't make you wonder you less entertaining no or knowledge will just screw something up big deal right but he will fuel like never just refuses\nSo what is this deal with some Ninety year old guy called them one year old guy calls and he claims that he was at a a Babe Ruth game in Nineteen thirty two oh wow that's one that's kind of ... and France us a call the the the game he he said that the babe Ruth hit the shot heard round the world\nWhich of course he did and that was the Bobby Thompson shot right against the Dodgers that's another thing I don't know if that's in the same a first order you were going to play\nA here is it it's not as a guy described the babe Ruth as the shot up around the world we had a that's a separate piece of what do you want to hear as he grills this old man some so old man says one day I was six Ninety year old when I was six I was at the game in Nineteen thirty two by and for incessant refuse to believe the old man I\nAm going to be old and my father took me a Yankee Stadium when I was about six years old and he said and I said yes\nFor a great baseball\nPlayer who's going to be the greatest played baseball players of all time and it was Babe Ruth I just remember it being a little kid going to the game and that's all I wanted to tell you my\nUh not what you were we will do what you were born on twenty do it but how would you remember I mean how would you even remember all the way I Would I Would prefer having all that\nWell he was gone by the by the time he was Seventy be gone though that's the only thing that like in Montclair what's up my\nI I was going to talk about the next I cannot get passed you addressed in belittled that Ninety year old guy that had come and Barrett stole about a conversation with his dad about ...\n... ... or you know I really got tired I'm like okay when I was saying was he would have to be like four years old when Babe Ruth was still these simpler that's all that much do you remember baseball when you were five I don't remember\nVery well when a month to mean changing the numbers of the guy was six in Nineteen thirty two he said he was born in Nineteen twenty six nobody said twenty ... twenty eight so he was four\nSo Mike was right the guy said he was born in twenty eight said he went to the game and thirty two that would make them for not sick so Mike what's right by them but I can tell you my first baseball memory came when I was about five\nBut I was in a barber shop in Brooklyn and I heard ... ... up at the plate against vital blue in the Seventy three World Series and age it is possible at five years old even for maybe ... members something so disappointed if I'm Mike let this guy to go ... what do you got approval soccer forty years old and sounds\nLike a nice shoot old man I was a memory like that right and a year to take 'em all at the grill and\nLet me say some of your driver's license son of a bitch but Mike was right about the number is unfortunately from Mike on the east coast about the plane now talking about Green Bay Packer quarterback Aaron Rodgers he was way off on the numbers\nAre Joan oceanside was a\nQuick you're up yesterday and maybe today about manning is a lot of the problem is not really as much as a line that you've gotten back so many\nOr even twenty two\nRight but you know you make of the guys who are more than him nice guy but the fact that God will than their garage is everyone gets back that many times I don't\nThat's not true that everybody gets act that many times I mean green Aaron Rodgers is having a bad year going into last night he's having a bad year I had the guy a touchdown says seven interceptions going into last night's game\nOkay keep that um I ... a touchdowns in seven interceptions there's another Green Bay call\nBecause I didn't know that it okay and you're like um we don't want the facts to get on the way he there was an eight and seven ... I Believe Ken touchdowns and the only one in ... ... exactly right eight and seven that's half the time he's going to pick out a touchdown\nTen told one ratio touchdowns top picks Francesca couldn't be any more wrong [laughter] then and\nKudos to a motion extra points that out but he again he says it with this uh this arrogance and this this is a shortage or that you know I Can't possibly be wrong right that's what it is I mean you hear so anyway let's go back to the thirty to getting the shot heard round the world yeah cuts five Matt\nPlay the world series the shot heard round the world which has been depicted so many different ways so many different times\nSo I'll explain that he has he has a a woman who wrote a book about Babe Ruth and um they were talking about that and he said he went on to say to her can you explain the shot heard round the world\nBy Babe Ruth right in court which of course it was ... when the giants beat the Dodgers and got to the world series now listen last night was game by Red Sox an Astros\nDavid Price had never won a postseason game for land and maybe the best pitcher in baseball the game was in Houston the Astros a World Series waning champs so there is no real middle craziness about picking the Astros win last night\nI mean that was probably the right choice of course the White Sox did win but if anybody was really sure that the Astros were going to win there was Mike\nPlus you know this earlier this coming up but then I you know that that's not even a question mark ... there's going to come up big he always does that with that we do do that and you can that you can expect that mean virtually under you know he's going to come up with a performance ah but but Berlin that will be there we know that that's a great analogy\nOf a great announces follower gave up for earned bronze yea I lost and a whole bunch of hits and laws and Los Angeles and by the way a motion to keep a terrible by the way of our land there but they would probably just better most of these columns all about uh the headlines about many Machado will be in a bad guy but the second\nThe second story is of course the the princess and stuff right here and in which he\nTalks about his app right while everybody's always asking me how was Mike doing with the Bernie how's he doing with the sales charging ten bucks a month a hundred bucks a year everybody wants to know is Mike actually getting subscribers of course just your\nAverage does the path that we do not ... in this business nobody discusses a ... a number ever I learn nobody gives out numbers we're not at liberty to give out numbers in I can tell you right now we're ... we're doing really well I'm very happy with what we're doing uh my partner is a very happy\nBut I learned right away as we in the business found out like I asked the sports that that would have been in business and I found out nobody nobody in this business ever releases ... it's like oh they don't release numbers ever so nobody does that probably ... ... are we doing fine but I mean I'm very happy\nWhen they keep it in and say why is mark ... numbers I see a role was numbers I've seen Godfrey numbers in fact I've never known anybody who didn't release their impressive and the millions and millions more\nWhat did you mean in this business though it's not really been he's in the business for about Fifteen minutes he he couldn't even you couldn't even talk about a correct me on CNBC where they spoke his name and correctly\nBy the way the CIA guards this uh down at the I don't know Fort Knox or something or whatever it's it's it's just a well kept secret nobody's ever going to know of course if he was killing it the the information and be all over the place\nBiked but as it is no we're not going to release it nobody else does so anyway feel much Nick taking out the ...
