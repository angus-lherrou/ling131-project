I can ... those people are just social liberals is what they are\nIn fact be damned I mean it is they're going to go with the facts be damned facts the or the fact that he is pro Israel pro Jewish has Jewish families done a pro Israeli pro Jewish things\nCondemns anti Semitism in no uncertain\nTerms and again has not taking pictures with Louis Farrakhan about like the President Obama et cetera all of that the damn so what we have this man so what we're going to connect it whether or not as ... as its factory later it doesn't matter\nWell let me ask you this many years ago it is true that I guess an African American people truck to rent an apartment from Fred Trump and Donald I guess this is true that they actually did put\nA letter on the application that that noted that that person was black I'm not sure if that's racist or not but they did do that right I I I I don't know it's a oh there was a federal most would you do know it was a federal law I don't\nPersonally if you go with I use ... I Believe but Joe look it up\nBut that doesn't mean necessarily he's All right but the the the ... there was something out there that says well this this isn't really right and then of course all the non ... nonsense rumors about what he said on the side of The Apprentice all I'm saying is the rumors go right one of the Jewish rumors what has he done was said\nIs it still Charlottesville is that it because he didn't call out the Nazis\nIs that it\nYou're asking me yeah I mean I've got to be something he said look you look Mexicans can hold something against him were the ones who are not\nWhat he says a nationalist which by the way every you know for example in the Olympics people who wave the flag for chili or\nFor Croatia their national right he's talking about American nationals and they're trying to link that to white nationalism he's talking about American nationalism\nAnd may maybe that's what you're asking me what what are they trying to hang your hat on or as far as anti Semitism goes\nI think it goes back to to Charlottesville he wouldn't do it 'cause he didn't go out the Nazis\nSee what we are going to get what he said that he wasn't clear what he was saying there are good on both sides he was talking about the pro Confederate statue people and the anti Confederate said no I I Know but it wasn't clear\nHe did a terrible job ... money but you don't if they did a ... he deserved to get bank over the head to say I know about in the fire when he was trying to say that when you come out and you just you just eve visit right the Nazis he didn't do it so that's the only reason I think\nIf you ask me if that's what they're trying to hang your hat on that that that that could be one I mean I don't know that held a dry whatever it is the basis for Trump is an anti Semite\nIs essentially if it's not just says a reads thin you know non existent not only agree with you\nAnd I keep trying to figure out because I see people social media in the news Jewish people oh my God I was a Jew he makes me sick and he joins some guy took me to parents just two days ago sit Rosenberg Jew but some Donald Trump is actually what they're saying that\nIt cuts across is ethnicities oh my God he just makes me sick it doesn't matter if you're Jewish if you're Irish Murphy a it Phil Murphy in in New Jersey the governor the the Irish mayor of Philadelphia the the the black mayor of Tallahassee\nThe Jewish or a Jewish people in Pittsburgh or opposing his\nVisit he just makes them sick so if they happen to be Jewish or as a Jew he makes me sick they as a person as a as an American they make him sick that's what you're hearing and they'll they'll hang your hat on at every on anything however than it is and it's all a\nManifestation I Believe again of losing in twenty sixteen gotcha that's all that's what I think it's just that are just all those little short losing bitterness and they're just never ever going to give an inch whatsoever I mean that's what they've been told to uh you you get up in their face push back every single time resist resist resist\nThat that's what this is ... so you know we should do today than being that you and I figured it

comments that this would not have happened as have been a security guard may be correct and it may be necessary\nSecurity is necessary tons of put on guards in front of places of worship\nIt's just not a very I mean it may be necessary but it's not conducive to the highest occasion that we're trying to effect at our places of worship that's the that that I guess that's the downside but listen it's better than having innocent people mowed down\nI Would think so slowly I mean or whatever it takes to protect people we have to do we don't want to do that I mean ideally we'd do not want to do that we're not gun nuts were not a you know militaristic people we want to protect people that's all I mean do don't assign evil intentions do whatever it is\nA we're trying to propose who knows we just want people to be safe\nDo we have the money\nAnd the ah resources to do that no no no well what what you would have to do\nI Believe is every house of worship would have to hire their own security but you know when you pass around the pets around the\nPlate and talk to Dr Bob it's called to the doctor well we call and we we passed a rental baskets I'll take him to church\nSo whatever whatever whatever you put into the envelope\nAnd you stick in the basket it would have to come out of that that part because of the city certainly or the state or the federal government certainly couldn't provide\nA an armed guard for every house of worship that's just not feasible not practical yeah but you have to take matters into your own hand maybe you I mean it's got to be on a case by case basis\nIf you think that uh there are nuts out there and you you might be ... and it's impossible to predict and look we talk about these things we always do this after a massacre and then we forget about it we go back to ah but the same things we've always done and that's the the still the same thing with school shootings\nI mean why don't we don't get into a whole I don't know who should get about school shootings at this point because the old man just nothing really changed though you're right about that we talk about changes nothing does so now houses of worship it is up to you I I

said it's about uh shows off his up\nHouses down and down the hall right All right my extra guide what makes you a question would watch old out come talk right who\nAre the giant things like we like it was saying that willing to trade them show who\nOnly a top notch teams gonna want him that means you're going to get like between the twenty fifth and twenty eight or ...\nOr the dirty you want a number you want top five in Cleveland it's not going to take them because that would be that would be poison putting that got like ... what big main field in that and that hurt or just like years ago when you know the giants got rid of a shock because he was\nHe was an ear idea when he was a rookie they got rid of and that drives me that run it out and in fact I Am I right or wrong\nAbout oh I agree with you in fact the one place that will that wants to gold believe it or not is because he's a liar he doesn't want to be here he doesn't like New York no matter what he says I Know he's got a tattoo Russell's part he wants to be in Los Angeles loves it there\nHe'd love to be on the rams that makes sense because the only undefeated team in football they're already eight no they got the best player when football in Todd girlie\nMaybe the best young quarterback and football and golf now you give them or do Beckham junior and you're right they're not going to have any real good draft choices because there were terrific last year to give to the giants so\nLook I don't know that the giants traded Eli Apple they traded Harrison maybe there are about the bench Eli Manning I think they are but in terms of trading away or down on those I I don't think that's going to happen next up\nDo you want a disgruntled the OB Jay on your team poisoning\nThe law and asked me every week yes I Want I'm On my team okay here's what we all want to see what's in football and heat part of the reason why he's disgruntled is he's frustrated because you can't use quarterback\nCan't get on the football he's up to one hundred your approach is the last three weeks but more than often his quarterback can get on the football I Want a guy who cares and he cares\nYeah well I'm not so sure about that because he's a he's a bad guy he's not a bad guy well he's he's not he's not he's not a positive force well yet luckily\nHe he was a couple of years ago the football games yeah basically that was then well now this is no teams won one game on his quarterback and get them both I think he's a jerk sure I Do chicken you know you don't do that you don't get what a great talent\nBecause you don't love the guy's personality to the teams win Super Bowls with guys so to jokes that style as\nWell you wouldn't Super Bowls were guys go to church you got to get the right coach to control that guy and you got to do your best to make sure that guy is happy on the field and the guys they put around them especially as quarterback but I'm going to happen I'm not defending old don't necessarily but you know straight away a guy who's one of the three best that his position of football 'cause you don't like them\nWell you should actually before you sign up to the Ninety five million dollar contract that's when you should have made you move\nWell if they if they were going to do that right but but again I think they made the right move you give them the money you sign up you know go out and get them somebody who can get on the ball and we'll see if they can do that to say probably can so well I'm so sick of the giants anyway\nSick of all they don't so sick this one I hated about spoiled Barney you know one thing about\nDonald Trump was being around the Bush tells you the way it is not always quite people don't always wanted to put straight talk ministry right or wrong from the hip from the hip tells you the way to assure them every week with ... first of all he acts like he's got the ...\nAnd by the way of of what is getting getting amongst ... sports Sunday now I don't care he acts like he's got the most important job in the world you know that make up my ...\nYear old dopey football go kill it on a bad team and all we want to know giant faithful is is he like going to continue to play quarterback\nOne in his last twenty by starch with different offensive linemen and not old DJ every single game his record it was twenty five starch is four and Twenty one\nHe's made the playoffs once in ... years those Super Bowls were a long time ago all we want to know coach is is he going to play he shouldn't play he should be bench but not to do was white last year\nAt this point the bike week they've won one game he should be bitch just sell you stop treating us like we're idiots\nThen they would have to admit that they made a mistake in the pre season so they made a mistake well what do you go to what was it the following us as well I I Am throwing out\nRhetorical so you know not even or even with the even with the O. B. J. oracle state you can't you can't do that the one in seven it's obvious they made a mistake so you're going to keep going and make it worse\nAt some point you cut your losses of course and you say okay so does this do who ... ... what's the other guy will letter what's his name ... out of ... what do you have\nTo lose nothing you'll you'll lose every game like I Do not want to try and he'll get knocked down and go to the benefits of why I tell you the giants are down several nothing on Sunday\nHe likes playing well he got a great stride going great drive going they got the ball and the Redskin red zone and there was no pressure on the line not he steps up in the pocket and throws the football right to a Redskin defender right you're you're\nMeeting a little wetter and you'll lose and you get a good ... coming up next year now you're taught 'em live on the Bernie ...
