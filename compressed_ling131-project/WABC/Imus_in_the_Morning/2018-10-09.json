Fifteen there have been worse just like this for the Yankees this is a a you know this is a franchise record you know and then they'll last night they had for the second time ever in postseason baseball\nActually had a position player pitch yeah and I said he wants to know why would they do that someone\nTeams are down you know twelve Thirteen fourteen especially when you consider the Yankees have a game for today and Yankees of course we're hoping to go to games by coming up in Boston on Thursdays do you start to going to be I got a manager for the next game maybe to gain mode and you don't use your pitching\nOr like when you're down by fourteen runs so it was a an interesting spectacle maybe only gave up ... ... home run but uh I got to be cared a lot of people stuck around I I watch the Soviet\nAnd then of course the one guy hit for the cycle\nAnd it was a great move you know Joey Cora did a very good job last night he inserted a Ian ... is the everyday second baseman for the red Sox but he put brought cold wind up last night the the faced a righty and he went out there as you said he hit the cycle last night he also put drivers out there he had a big game last night so\nYou don't ... to changes\nOn the line up they both worked in a big way and then of course he opted\nTo go with Nathan above the who just kills the water kills them ... wants to their head once again shut down the Yankees and he moved poor settled to a game for which is later on to my point being every button that Joey Cornel push yesterday before the game Mitt outlawed out to be magic\nIs it out what's going around the corner choose me right away his brother a drug Joyce's brother I Know Joey actually that's right\nAnd we bought me push before the game last night worked out great for coral\nTo Red Sox us let's not give up all hope\nNo no okay they got another game tonight in the stadium right let's look forward to uh I I think they go back to Boston Thursday Thursday we have a one to we haven't another wild card situation one game sure die\nWe've got two of those keep hope alive if they win tonight that will be the same situation on Thursday that's what I mean they got to in a row I'm saying they're going to win tonight you're pushed shore up guaranteeing aren't there's no doubt about it okay I mean boy this is a this was a fluke last night you\nKnow you say was a fluke I look at these other teams the Dodgers moved on yesterday the going back to the end of the U.S for the third consecutive year at the time\nBut there will teach and they've got Clinton ... one of the best picture was ever and a young kid named Walker viewer who's amazing the Astros one again yesterday the going back to the AFC us but the second straight year\nAt the top of their rotation they've got one of the best picture ever in Justin ... you know people all over him and born today that's fine I I get so tired of that conversation if he took him out in the fourth of people wanted they went down three nothing alright alright\nLet's let's get over a forget Aaron Boone what he's got to get on the Lewis this think arena or cash me because when Louis several Reno and only one Nineteen games this year\nBut he's been awful since July good start Wednesday against the A's beds thought last night he showed up late by the way it showed up late he shut up eating only of warmed up what ten minutes a day that was that I don't that's disgraceful disgraceful point being when you look at these other teams that continue to enjoy success around major league baseball\nThere eases Bernie are not just great pitchers today\nThere's some of the all time greats ever\nYankees best starter is Louis several Reno that's on Brian cash them and not everyone but when\nThey're going to give you a little drama but they're going to come back strong keep hope alive it's over ... by the way to the bullpen yeah thanks for nothing [noise]\nWell they didn't use are good pictures last night ... ... what Lance Lynn ... Lynch Ed Green I mean whoever if they had taken stink arena without a early they would've just replace it with a couple of losers as well right\nI I didn't mind though I think he knew was won several gave up the there was sick on a limb give up the big that made it six nothing but I guess he wants to see the big guns like I said for tonight for a game for and possibly Thursday for a game five of first pitch last night\nAfter you know ... ... arrived late barely warms up bats misses a home run by about two feet\nAnd I'm sitting there going oh no this is a long night\nWhere do you think Joe ... was a a Luis stink arena there would be sitting in an over a\n... I Wonder what what the hell was the other like on the Detroit who knows that it was a stuck between tunnels was freaking out I think you'll wait how you ... you're starting in a playoff game on how could you be late how does he not get punished for that or who knows what he wasn't leads he he wasn't\nLate to the park he wasn't late for his start he warmed up late he showed up really too late to start but he didn't break the rule wasn't like he showed up\nAfter the first page or he was there but he got there too late that he couldn't warm ... if I weren't the only made the point and money is really good at that during the pregame broadcast\nThat you know you'd like to really get their little earlier warm up before especially\nOn a night like this it was ... yeah yeah your show up I mean but do whatever\nAre so anyway I Know a lot of people are despairing but this is what makes a sports so good so dramatic it is yes your team gets you got a team by males a little bit yeah or or I mean it's not really a good touch us what did they lose tonight and it's over [laughter]\nAh yeah like I mean and that that was fine yeah I I I was done with baseball in New York about a month and a half and where the Mets and I thought oh I have a bitter Medford I'm not bitter and ... I go to the British a lot of people if they lose\nTonight two thousand Nineteen starts tomorrow for cash for the Yankees\nAnd he's got a gun and this goes out to Joel Sherman and can David all been all the guys today they're all over in Boone who knows better by the way\nAnd yes I Do think we made a tactical mistake but I don't think it matters this goes out to Bryan cash man okay\nYou're not going to be the red Sox and they've got crushed sale you're not going to be the ... when we got Justin from land or you're not going to beat the Dodgers and they've got Clayton partial you're not going to beat these teams won several you know is your best order so if the Yankees get eliminated tonight it's great to bring in statton\nYou got all this up into firepower which by the way got shut down in the last night a bachelor and the witness protection bright for God's sakes would go out and get some big time pitching\nSo that you know you go into a series with naka\nG CSA ... Lance Lynn but Jay ... at the least you you talked to one of the world series with that\nLet's be we'll come so the pitching uh was lacking but you don't ... I got to tell you I'm rooting for the Yankees yeah if it was the Mets\nI'd be I'd be very destroy oh of course I wouldn't be taking this as a ... year right now almost gleefully loved I loved working for the Yankees yeah I Want them to win and uh I think they can I think they're going to win tonight\nAnd we'll get into a big showdown Thursday night ooh very exciting I'm an important game five yes a very important that every important and also every dramatic yes\nAnd ... that's what makes it that's what makes heroes that's what makes the stuff of legend yes I was just game five or a roller no doubt or game seven her oh no doubt\nSo ah let's not all ... you know jump off the top of a building here on this address not today Thursday morning do it tomorrow or wait till friday more now after they lose the orange is\nEven worse because they get to they win tonight just a force the game by more that will be in Boston wouldn't be as bad but I don't know [laughter]\nI Know I I felt good about splitting the two in Boston you come home you got your quote unquote ace on the mound it through a good start against Oakland in a game three I really felt like the winner of last night's game was going to win the series and I thought it would be the Yankees\nBut it wasn't so well it it ... they're going to win tonight and then Thursday night look for a ... game five Yankees Red Sox and you got the patriots and ... with the falcons later every Thursday night no\nNow even as she got the giants eagles oh he he's also\nThe Yankees to win tonight you got Yankees Red Sox and on Thursday night now a boy he's playing for the AFC us lives change so practically eliminated one in four or so it's not the same meaning but it's actually the Yankees and\nThe giants on Thursday night a big sports not huge\nSo let's let's let's you know look at the silver lining power right let's keep hope alive unless you're not a you know they don't get all suicidal s that's stop fashioning or a news with the no no no come on\nEspecially when you see what's going on in the world today and we've got I Want information on that horrible accident upstate I Know which killed ... people Brett Kavanaugh has his first day as a judge yesterday I got Trump we've got all kinds of good stuff one eight hundred eight or eight WABC one eight hundred and forty\nPicture and I can post it on your page\nNow that point you can delete it you can block me do whatever you want but I can post something on Bernie page which is a guy here what you're saying it was also why I don't want to be honest uh that's how am I going to want to be honest I don't want to see what anybody else is doing or thinking well they're not it's not that they're sending nasty things about me to my page right it's just\nSelfish like I don't want you want ...

I was going to be my point he he was asked about it\nBut he didn't bring it up somebody said what do you think about that right you know they they know how to ... don't comment as well so he says I like a music to twenty five percent of the Trump did go down to Tennessee to campaign for this lady\nSo in a way I guess uh maybe took but whatever anyway it trumps great week last week and that that's what it was and he stood he stood strong he stood a steadfast as the judge last night thanked them for you when others might have local\nLaw we gave him credit when people were saying Trump was mocking\nWas mocking this lady you and I at least made it very very clear he was not mocking he was just stating the facts and again this this lady God Bless her we both think she went through something horrific we're both sensitive to her but in this case it begin to accuse somebody doing something\nAs heinous as she did you got to provide details you provided not in an old Donald Trump did was a ton of recites what she had not said but not said on ...\nOn the ground is just right and and the ... the behavior of the Senate the Senate turned into a lot of the flies for God's sake I mean it was awful\nThe guy you know grabbed his penis about two thousand times I mean every two seconds he found that really ... got to you know maybe he's got the arrest ladies got the ... and he was the song was terrible I mean just no talent\nScout nine million tattoos like long air it looks like a complete dirt bags or sounds like a ... is a loser\nAnd just grab and his dad for like ten minute\nI thought that was the shelf up it's just a very very uh vulgar stuff there we usually puts out\nWhat's we see that is when they make the same place at yeah yeah he was also where he's a he's a ski looking do okay but I got to tell you this is actually even makes he makes um flavor flavor looked like George Clooney [laughter]\nBut you you know health flavor wave looks a little uh you know stinky and all that stuff now but he's not a hateful person flavorful if you know what I'm Talking about not at All right now I'm going to say and I know you don't know this but that's the same with ... who's on the head guy always not hateful nasty\nHis his lyrics of vulgar sexually all that stuff and it looks as if he is he's grabbing his crotch yeah but he is not at all I hate all type of guy I hate him but you can't say I know\nNow you have a strong weren't able to make a judgment but on the bus or a flavor flavors a perfect example he's like he's a he's a flavor flake type of guy a likeable guy\nIn conversational OK okay he was just it just to keep it real here on the Bernie and said show yeah I Know what I'm saying no I don't he\nHe was a when obey Jay made those comments over the weekend a looming was next to him in the interview I don't know why he was with the was also with LeBron James and the barber shop on LeBron James HBO show yeah\nAnd it's part of the whole crew yeah it's so funny I got to tell you this before we speak to the other very courageous and amazing Asra Nomani who's got an op ed on the wall Street Journal worked on it for two\nYears congratulations to her so I told you that I'm I'm a member of New York sports club but I also joined the economics\nThat's right because you scared to help me with these are the same ... you know a lot of knives it up I had to leave my economics doesn't have you know they do but I've never heard Bernie talk about all the way around us\nThat in fact the economics is being sue ... or that that was one I don't know there was actually to to to be one of them was a\nA guy in a steam room right and the other was it was just he was a customer right and another was a guy who worked there uh-huh who actually call the police on a Wall Street executive it was that on Wall street and make it collects data on Wall street\nExecutive ah you know they're ... themselves and for me to advances and he called the police and collect fired him for for calling the police and fire them for the ... and so on suing equity ... so you're not safe\nBut I'm not going to do with the same old stuff to be honest so just as clean or it's nice or it's a it's much more expensive obviously but I like the gym better so I um I like I'm a YMCA kind of like ... thirty that's me yeah well you know part of the reason why I stuck around so long and you know sports club was it's funny you say that\nBecause I mean the the comparison to Daniel to rocky\nThree when\nThe movie starts a you know what he's he's got the fancy wing and he's got the glitter and all that stuff and then eventually Apollo Creed takes them down to this really like nowhere conditioning stuffed Bailey ... it's like lemon last mile\nYMCA up in Yonkers in general square same thing I spent ten years I did in that particular YMCA sweaty\nNames right grimy roaches that's what the last couple of portable you kind of funny because I got into that much I Do but then it stopped working for me certainly so I don't even ask for\nNow you know you're moving on up moving on looking at like a big shot you know right so you get a free or you can leave us playing a free a free session with a trainer that's coming up\nTomorrow and then they do all your um they they measure you you know what I'm saying sure so it turns out a way a hundred and eighty seven pounds a hundred and eight pounds of out his muscle down to just eleven percent body fat\nGuy goes you're actually in I mean you're really good shape like I said yeah we have to understand my neck is killing me my shoulders killing me sometimes I Can't sleep at night I'm In pain all the time he goes oh\nYou're in great shape [laughter] I'm like wait a second I just told you that I'm not I'm not because\nWe can work on that because it's a humble bragging [laughter] through I'm witnessing a hobo correct falling apart no but the guy told me I mean when great eleven percent felt pretty good that is damn good\nMostly now Danielle costs like no a lot out of water on it\nBut it's really well\nYeah but how do they I mean to me these guys at the gym I Know what you're talking about them I mean they just like\nYou know they don't know what the hell they're doing they're not doctors I Know I don't get it either I I I like I said that's not scientific my guys in great shape all knew where you are in fantastic or shape no doubt about attack if they have a machine right you've got to your your gym so\nI Know but I I don't put any stock in it either see I don't buy it either you take your socks off the standoff right it says it ... I don't I don't put on your fingers on these two things and all of a sudden from standing\nHolding something we do things they're going to tell you your whole makeup right exactly I'm just like you I don't I don't buy it in a lot of these trainers to some of them walk the walk\nBut a lot of them don't a lot of them are that you had how did this this person become a trainer how did they give this person a job as a trainer when this person can't you know couldn't do twenty pushups forget all this I can\nI won't go in your case what but don't they have to be certified trainers after they get certified and then just like a cop becomes a cop or the five years later you get a you know two hundred and fifty pounds [laughter] I Can't run around the block\nRight yeah but I think what trainers but even the guys that are in great shape that doesn't mean that they're meant to be trainers and or certified like sometimes I'll see a guy that's not incredibly muscular\nBut looks cardiovascular fit and I may even trust that guy more than the guy walking around with muscle the company but you're right ... how do you know I mean\nThey never show you a um they don't\nTake out like a a certificate [noise] say well I Want to do this program or you don't know you don't know and it just strikes me as a lot of these trainers are winging it if you ask me do you ever employ a trainer no no I I don't I I I\nI don't understand it first of all I I Know they supposed to motivate you yeah they do sometimes I like to ...\nYou know I Know after three sessions what to do I know what to do I don't need you anymore I don't need you trailing me or raining me I I just want to do what I Want to do I know what I have to do on the shelf disciplined enough\nJust leave me alone mommy certainly they have like a certain day sound like somebody pushing me and especially I'm doing chest I Need that spot or anyway for the for the bench by then you've got to talk to them and and they're nice people I mean I ... a silver the New York sports club at thirty six Madison's great guy he got to talk yet you got a tall you gotta make plus on top of a play golf\nI hate I Can't imagine being on the

now\nI've created my luxury flagship store in the heart of Manhattan that's forty nights in Madison to do just that\nThat and you yeah you you say what the us right\n[noise] well you know as a Muslim and as a Muslim or former especially fighting extremism and extremely ideology I risk my life everyday standing up to the extremists that are anti Semitic in my face and the ones that\nMurder Danny because he was Jewish so it's um it's it's really so far reach for them to go to that ... of their own on anybody who they're talking about George Soros\nUm you know what's important here is just like on the right the best as an investigative reporters have followed the money on the Koch brothers\nIt's a it's our duty as journalists to follow the money on that that also and so that's what I did day after the election of twenty sixteen when I started seeing hash tag resistance and and it was my Muslim work and activism that put\nUs on my radar because as your listeners might know and you know the one of the first people to put that hash tag out was your Brooklyn um product Linda's her sore who became a\nPoster girl for the resistance movement against Sean and and so my world intersect on this um uh you know just dangerous dangerous nexus between\nThe far left and our\nVery far religious right among Muslims and and that's why I got involved in it and started paying attention to the detail\nRun and basically the the crux of it is is that uh obviously one of our freedoms in this country was people happen to love I don't so much anymore about why because I'm not sure peaceful protests even exist anymore but but we live in this country is you're allowed to go out and do those types of things in your point is\nWell it's one thing of a bunch of ... civilians assembled on the corner and speak their mind what you're saying is these are highly ... professional people going out there and taking they have to want to win a brand new level with billions of dollars behind them\n[noise] yeah you know and of course in our democracy even they have the right to do that but we have the right a citizen in his journalist to\nSeek transparency and to follow the money and and not be accused of such horrible I'm bigotry because we dared to ask questions\nSo that's what I've done the last year and that that bugs I can hear the noise around me is because I'm standing in line right now at our U.S Supreme court [noise] there's a line of about uh about could hundred people waiting in line to try to get in for the two hours of now he just ... um court justice Kavanaugh's birthday on the job\nA lot of camera crews and I I'm looking at the crowd because I'm curious if among them is somebody who has got the plant to just screaming traits like they did on Saturday um during the vote him\nAnd that so yeah so good well\nIt's just that you know the reflection that you're having is exactly the one that I've had is what is healthy discourse in our society and um and of course whatever it is legal is legal and with not you have to face the consequences but you know we we do need to be wise\nAnd reflect and I would argue that the\nFar left and the hash tag resistance movement has been very destructive and and this last weekend was so disturbing because right here on the stairs of the of the Supreme Court where they've been you know rushed it claims have just bang on the doors out like by\nGoing through barricades which they didn't the cops just let them go by um there are women who I'm\nSad stories of sexual abuse were just exploited and to the point where one one of at one point they said their trauma specialists around help\nAnd so I just feel like we're taking very serious issues um and exploiting them for political gain that ultimately is going to boomerang on the left and the Democrats\nAre I think I think that's happening we'll see in the months of course when you're talking about the ... one incident or two days ago when they were scratching banging and killing could the doors of the Supreme Court it looked like a scene of the walking dead for God's sakes do I ... it was\nYeah I was standing right next to them I was right there because um it was\nYou know that easy it was not this is their people taking selfies with all this high drama that is what is really disturbing all said to me is just a lot of moments that are just said for social media um I you could see I I I watched as the\nFirst wave went in to the protests um at the Capitol Steps\nI found in um the name of the company that is actually the actual paid protest a company that directed it sort of like um stage director is a company I just got the name D.C action lab so I encourage your\nViewers to go Google that because you'll see the images that CNN and others um broadcast of the protesters\nThat were just staged\nThere are handmade and you know they they they just professional protests company organizers had they had these um like light light\nBeam on the um on the on the uh\nCourthouse where kept having not work and that could pay for that stuff right it was the company\nThat is an amazing job and great investigative work once again the peace in the
