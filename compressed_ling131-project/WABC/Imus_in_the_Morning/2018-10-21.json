{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "So we know that listening helps listening helps you learn and do better with about a man who was referred by a listener\nOr this listener had a brain tumor yet surgery at one of the big hospital she was so angry they opened up his head he said he was just so confused from the brain tumor that that his side of the paper they open them up they closed 'em up and send them home\nAnd yet they left the tumor in his head and they ignored that as a PSA was two hundred so as a brain tumor left in his head after surgery at a PSA two hundred left a tad that\nAnd he learned about us and they came to us and I treated both his brain tumor and we diagnosis prostate cancer and founded localized and tradition for that too\nAnd now he is sending his best friend to us and who was his best friend but let me tell you about his best friend\nThe patient the original patriots a brain tumor brought him in this week and this man is Seventy two years old is a Hispanic man from Dominican Republic he's an account and very distinguished man he's married with four children came with his wife\nIs diabetes and high blood pressure is found to have a PSA of Eighteen he had a biopsy and usually when the ... started there's little God like a spring loaded gun and twelve little needles go into the prostate ... eleven or those twelve needles came back positive for Gleason seven cancer\nSays a very high risk cancer with a PSA is more than ten PSA stands for his prosthetic specific antigen\nThat was Eighteen eleven or twelve corps positive for at least in seven cancer is knocked tore or four times a night his dream as better the daytime than the night time he said no treatment [noise]\nHe was seen by surgeons who are trying to cut on him but we know that surgery is very unsuccessful for men especially high risk men like him with a high PSA and high Gleason score\nYou can look at a book with a I'll be happy to give your book with or he can come in or you can call her office\nFor a PSA tend to be the most famous surge in America only has a thirty percent success rate so there's lots of reasons to avoid surgery number one that's not very successful open or robotic number two with surgery open a robotic\nMost men will lose their sexual function most men will lose their urinary function\nSo luckily for him his best friend too we treated them is doing very well with good sex life a good urinary life brought him here I examined him he has a buggy prostate modular prostate in large prostate\nHis events prostate high risk with the level of twelve chorus positive Gleason seven pits Eighteen\nAnd were staging 'em up or get a scan of his whole body to make sure the cancerous and traveled we'd like to do that we like to be able to tell her patients exactly where the cancer is lots of people do cutting first staging later that's wrong I Believe\nBecause if they caught it cut off your arm or your leg or breast here along or your pancreas or bladder prostate and don't know if the cancers traveled why are they doing that we believe there's a logic to it\nIf you have cancer God Forbid you if you have the cancer has find out exactly where the cancer is and then talk about treatment and then this men were staging of up see exactly where the cancer is\nAnd then offer appropriate treatment and I can tell you that he's very

pearly border and the right to just\nAnd he's been seen by dermatologist they wanted to do radical surgery on his skin well that would be removing a lot of scandal a lot of his chest and he just does not want that he never smoked you worked at the field of medicine is\nJust retired he knows about medicine and he does not want to have surgery even though\nEspecially because he's a doctor he's heard about our work and uh we're treating him to make this cancer go away actually two separate skin cancers right in the same air and his chest both baseless cells and both with high high success rates with us this is the work that we do\nAnd it was like about a woman who sixty seven years old she comes to us with a sort of calm or around the aim is a good sign up\nShe had a big mess that she went to one of the big hospitals in New York and there they recommended chemo and radiation first she tried that but she had a severe toxicity how they gave it to her she couldn't finish it\nThen she went to another hospital in Philadelphia for profit hospital or they weren't so circumspect they removed the ... sarcoma but they left all the cats are behind all the margins are positive and now she's

joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... acid or Eighteen bill you said that recently the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why each have such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule\nHa the body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells\nThat connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our heights we we see the the brain a shriveled up in\nThe eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know positive daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like a jello a type of a water balloons filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one\nFilled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles the thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement non drug stores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about highly run a gas it well\nIt took Thirteen Years for ... it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are going to take this through the doctors and pointed out as they did glue consummate the revolution starts\nWith patients in people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these useful levels of ha restored in their body\nYou know you've written a great deal about the rule of highly want a gas it in the bodies connective tissue out as each a work in the joints and the connective tissue\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surrounds the nerves there's a sigh addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve\nAll of these are going to need a special cushioning that ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches in plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you it work miracle\nIt was for him why because purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called high drops that's taken from olives and pat you notice you can put a bowl\nOf olives on your table in a year later come back and except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there they didn't shrivel up and waste away due to fungal contamination so there's something very strong and all is we've known it for a long time\nDr Roberta Korea an Italian researchers now here in this country doing some research on hydro Roxy tier is all\nExtracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules do the trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so we began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives\nInto ... new ha joins formula you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill of rights to us this year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nYou see this is the kind of thing we hear and of course there are astounded with this they just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a doctor Cali saying he looks like a man\nThat's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe this level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula and of course he sent us pictures on the Internet\nHow fit he looks for his age and you're going to look a little younger because when you were young you had a lot of this now this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean and\nIt's all safe all natural its purity H A joint formula and pat most of the people who write to me or call me or not people who regularly fall for\nIt you might say radio commercials they don't buy stuff off the radio they just out of desperation knowing nothing housework

longtime advisor for purity products welcome Dr Lehman so great to have you back on the show today this is a big story isn't it Oh absolutely\nSteve and let's go right to the chase here that discovery you talked about at the top there\nIt's crucial oil because crew oil is simply amazing for us it's great for the heart great for the joints fantastic for the brain for the eyes I mean I have people coming into my clinic every single day and they want to feel better I mean they want to feel physically better\nStronger they want their choice to feel comfortable but they want to stay mentally sharp\nThey want to keep that brain thinking like it did when they were younger they want to protect themselves from coronary heart disease and maintain those flexible healthy youthful arteries for wonderful circulation hasty they want to boost their energy and you know why not\nI mean we deserve it and that's what we're going to be talking about here today with this cruel omega fifty plus which is the cutting edge\nCombination Steve of crude oil which is so fabulous\nFor us but we infused the crew will notice is so important we've infused the ... with the high omega three concentrated official you need to do that when you're dealing with cruel because cruel just isn't high enough\nYou know make it through so many other important parameters and virtues but you got to get that high omega three fish are on there and we've done that so this is now the best of both worlds but\nWe didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've added some vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the amount of crow by sixty seven percent so this now becomes the finest omega three nutrients in the world as far as I'm concerned\nThis is very very exciting this cruel oil sensation I mean it is all over the news docked in eleventh grade studies are out there many experts are declaring that cruel oil is better than fish oil so give us this low down on his girl omega fifty plus formula\nRight right right the you know if I told you I mean we did talk about this before the show that this is one tiny pill that benefits the joints and the brain and memory mood

but get this\nOn top of that for the first thousand people that call today and we're giving layer second gift\nBecause I just demanded this you know we're dealing with the fifty plus some hey you know if you're forty and you feel like your energy is lower this is for you also but for people fifty and over we're also giving away free beat twelve energy melts demand this because hey as we're getting a little older we don't absorb that be twelve as well and I want you to feel\nThe benefits from this cruel and make a fifty plus I Want to Jack up those B. twelve levels for you today as well you know what a value proposition you\nKnow when it comes to your health they really is a win win this is amazing I heard you say that this can actually reduce the risk of coronary heart disease I mean when you hear that whose ears don't perk up after that how exactly does that work anyway\nRight right well Crowell maker fifty plus remember this is the combination of cruel world with the high omega three highly concentrated should also which is much higher\nAnd omega threes than most cruel oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the higher omega three fish oil we're talking about support for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy youthful flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that's being nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little ... oh what about triglycerides that becomes so important so\nThis growing like a fifty plus supports the heart in so many ways and you know the bottom line is we need to think about this because as we're getting a little older fifty plus maybe mid forties certainly sixties and seventies it's decision time and I mean you know your body's not working the way it did when you were in your thirties\nEnergy might not be there you need to make a decision or you're going to take it laying down and just let yourself get old or are you going to do something about it you're going to stay physically active but you're going to do the things you need to stay healthy and getting these omega threes that crude oil the vitamin D the antioxidants makes such a difference this is a\nChanger for anybody in at fifty plus age group\nNow this is absolutely great information I Know that they make it three's talk about that just for a second our best known for their cardiovascular benefits and there's certainly also known as brain so now we discuss this in some of the past shows\nIf you would touch on the brain benefits for our listeners listening out there today and tell us why you say that supplementing with omega threes isn't just a good idea for the brain but an absolute necessity\nGo oh this is such an important point that you're bringing up absolutely for brain health we must must get these will make it three's back in there you know when you think about omega threes and you think about brain health and memory and mood and feeling sharp you really want to single out the D. H. A. component to that do go\n... you know what Steve your brain is sixty percent fat body weight and up that twenty five percent twenty five percent needs to be D. H. hey you know what I use an analogy in my practice people understand calcium and bone health right if you don't have housing in your diet\nAnd you don't supplement with calcium your Bones Are going to get parental and weak you understand that\nRight right exactly that's what happens\nTo both bones need house here for the normal strength and structure\nNow with the brain the C. D. H. aid for normal structure\nWill use this for one brain or on to communicate with another to build out their brain to meet the serotonin the doping mean older feel good neuro transmitters so must must habit must get it back in there so important and what this crew lawmaker fifty plus we've increased the level of ... because we concentrated omega threes and they're now\nWith criminal fifty plus you're gonna get a hundred and thirty ... milligrams of da tree preserving Steve while the leading brand of crude oil you're going to get twenty four\nExcellence twenty four and a leading brand you to get a hundred and thirty with chronic or fifty plus that's why this is so incredible for the brain\nThis is absolutely exciting I got to tell you though during the last real show that we did together you're totally shocked\nMe knocked over civically you say tell me around the time I see what did I say that\nAnd I remember that the study showed that Carrillo improves joint comfort in just seven days now if the benefits of the brain on a hard didn't ... Myers up that certainly would that would touch on this study and tell us how this works\nRight right those are great study in fact that's the reason I started taking crude oil about five six years ago a pilot study double blind placebo controlled exactly what you want to see out of the journal of the American College of nutrition ... participants got three hundred milligrams of crude oil or placebo now remember\nIn Columbia fifty plus we're giving you even more of a giving you five hundred milligrams of cruel also even more potent but\nThe participants in this study that got the crew loyal got some amazing joy benefit Steve\nGet this interest seven days and you remember this from the last show but you just seven days they were twenty eight percent more comfortable and George drop or when I read that I immediately went out and bought my first\nBottle of criminal but after thirty days they were thirty eight percent more comfortable the researchers didn't stop there they looked at the flexibility of the joints they looked at function of the joints all improvement a cold is the crucial oil advantage so if you're out there and you're taking fish oil fish oil is great I mean ... in here it's so important but\nStaff that's what I call it ... the of the nation staff people are going to appreciate working with purity they're a fantastic\nCompany they put their money where their mouth is they give out free bottles and you try and you're like wow this is great stuff thank God for purity\nLet's talk about the heart health for a moment it's probably the single greatest concern that people face as they age so anything that we can do to boost heart health becomes really a top priority you know this I Know there's in those books out there and do this as well\nAnd I know you mentioned earlier that omega threes literally lower our risk of corner heart disease you I had that correct 'cause that's what they said\nYou know absolutely protecting the Hart says what put omega threes on them back back in the seventies Dr ... discovered you know how protective they were for the Eskimos by the way is a wonderful guy had lunch with them a year or two ago great conversation but bottom line is omega threes protect our heart\nIn so many ways they promote a smooth rhythm ethical heartbeat important for the bodies normal inflammatory response in the heart muscle inside the arteries in planes\nThey promote those youthful flexible arteries so important for circulation they promote healthy blood platelet activity healthy red blood cell activity who supported healthy blood pressure that's very important\nTriglycerides so they do so much for the hearts are simply\nAmazing cardiovascular protection with these omega threes\nAnd it just keeps getting better done it you know I got better in mind when\nPeople I have patients coming here all the time and I'm like are you taking your omega threes I Hope you're still taking your omega threes you know they were afraid to say no you don't like the omega three doctors take your omega threes\nIn fact if there was only one nutrient that I could take Steve honest to God if there was only one nutrient that I could take hands down to make it for his first most important nutrient ... and his crew will make a fifty plus I Love the way to combine the ... with the fish will she even the best of both worlds can't beat it\nI've

slipped as we get older tell us more about this what did you\nWrite this was a great study unimportant study because what they did he was very interesting this out of the journal neurology and what did they just they check the omega three level\nIn the red blood cells of women a thousand women older women so this is a big study hours in women [laughter] but then again ... years later and the women were on average Seventy eight years old at this point\nThey did MRI's scans of the women's brains\nAnd what they found Steve this is so amazing\nThey found that the brain volume for the women that had higher omega three indexes are in other words they had more omega threes in red blood cells the woman that had more omega threes and they're red blood cells\nThey had higher brain volume they were actually maintaining more of the youth full size of the brain their brains were bigger you could see it plainly any MRI measurements that's really cool but not only that there's a very important part of the brain noticed the hippocampus\nVery important part of the brain that facilitates learning facilitates memory and\nThere was greater brain volume in the hippocampus for people that had more omega threes in their red blood cells that's how you can really measure\nHow much of making three someone's taking and so if you take omega three she will raise your omega three index we know this

right lane trying to get into a seven o'clock a meeting and you know calm down we'll we'll see how it is an ... five or ten minutes\n...\nWhichever dinner last night and and it's it's kind of um ironic that would tell you that\nA quarter of the patients that I talk to and I measure that blood pressure and I said what you have less time says\nWell last night was different as special occasion I had three orders of Chinese food I had leftover Chinese for breakfast I just had assaulted bagel and and that gives me a snapshot one is that they're stressed they had assault load and to they need to make some changes so\nHow do how do you educate patients on\nUm say ... I mean 'cause it is it is a key component to contributing to blood pressure\n... absolutely a hundred percent and I think the starting point with the salt conversation in my mind has to be first and foremost don't add salt salt is everywhere it's it's it's stored and everything it's added to everything already first of all get rid of your own table salt\nSecond of all you're going to eat out certainly enjoy we all want to make that we don't want to take that away [noise]\nBe a little bit more selective but he also cognizant that when you do eat out you're likely getting assault load in whether it's Chinese pizza Italian whatever that food product is it's likely salt loaded\nSo just to educate educate and then bring that not level down a notch and then finally when you're cooking at home try and move that salt down and use other spices to try and create a taste flavor so that you're not so stuck in your diet\nI fight a very challenging though the the recommendations to if you have high blood pressure pre high blood pressure or the or concerns about high blood pressure to keep it under twenty five hundred milligrams a day that's a that's a tough number for the for a lay person to understand so\nThat a that's roughly a teaspoon of salt in all your food um\nYou go to a barbecue you have a hot dog with a role in some catch up\nYou're probably having about twelve hundred milligrams of salt um there's no label on the on the hot dog the um so how does I mean it how does the person who is trying to restrict salt really want to take the salt shaker away or how do they do it it's very difficult\nI and I agree with you I don't think there's any question how difficult it is and I think the thing that we have to remember as physicians and to educate our patients that number one you can't do it overnight if you've been on a high salt diet all your life which\n... to put this into perspective the average person's salt load is about eight grams or a thousand milligrams most people who are not paying attention to this are taking about eight thousand milligrams so when you talk about getting down to twenty five hundred milligrams a it's challenging be\nEven if you go down to half of that you're down to four thousand already so reading labels having realistic goals and understanding that you want to achieve this over time this is not an overnight project\nYou you simply can't make these changes overnight we don't want to control your blood pressure overnight we don't want to get your from one fifty over a hundred to one twenty over eighty overnight as a patient you'll feel way too many symptoms so that it's it's a work in progress so to speak\nSo so I I agree with you and I I'm Sorry I tried to get a snapshot into people's lifestyle I asked them when I see them I said tell me about your last three meals\nA begin to see how much they understand um and and then they say and again I'm not a nutritional insight sort of given the the the er recommendations to\nOne you can add salt start with that to start to understand what's in your food I mean if you go to a restaurant you have no control so they generally do like to sell their products are going to add salt\nThe more that you do your own cooking at home the more natural rather more vegetable based uh the the less salt you're going to have\nAnd I think you could really change your um your palette to get you know to get to the point where you don't need to have the shaker your bedside and to have a a a diet is basically approaching that that that number that may be able to contribute to lower your blood pressure without medications but\nOnce you get is that if I was high blood pressure with all the good behavior you just made either just have the genetics for high blood pressure you may have some um uh some changes that you just can't reverse immediately in terms of being overweight or having better or sleep apnea all those things will take time to improve so\nThen it's time for medications um and and many patients are very very reluctant to start medications or have additional medications I'm an editor there regiment\nSo when you're encountering a patient and the um the topic about it's time for medication you've seen on a couple of occasions both on their home blood pressure monitor or and the offers a measurements that their blood pressure's above that one thirty one forty over Ninety range\nYou shake medical therapy [noise] yeah and I think here too is the the individual is Asian is very important the conversation with the patient in front of you and to say again one size does not fit all and to say okay it's time to initiate some medicines and you want to have a conversation about the medicines\nBecause medicines have side effects and I think patients are always concerned about those positions are concerned and you need to take the time to have that conversation and say okay\nWe're going to start here and I think the key to understanding that says that one medicine\nMay not do it and that you need multiple medicines usually to get the blood pressure down that is part of the package there is\nThere is something called resistant hypertension which about a third of people with hypertension may have where you need more than three drugs to control the blood pressure so setting the expectations that one drug may not accomplish the goal is very important I think\nWhich drug again one size doesn't fit all and you want to say to the patient look let's let's look at the person in front of you and let's say what fits best for them if they're diabetic for example the drugs that ended in ... or ... like\nLet's say the pro or Los are ten those might be better options so\nThe um\nSo several comes in and you have a um to a shared decision\nBetween you and the patient deciding it's time to be treated 'em\nTo take the particular medication and then you generally use a step wise approach you start one medication see their response described the potential side effects of that medication to begin to adopt some of the lifestyle changes I think that uh all of us agree\nCan reduce blood pressure those lifestyle changes are weight loss or reduce alcohol intake or no smoking\nOr reduce your salt intake um you know stress management ... I mean stress is clearly a component of of um high blood pressure\nAnd in the world we live in with having a a it having a breaking news uh every two seconds on TV and having a a device in our hands constantly are showing is what's happening someone talking to us I think I stress levels ... society going up a exponentially\nSo you you try to you try to address all those and despite that um\nMany patients do need more than one blood pressure and then you saw the second medication I often tell patients with with the lifestyle changes that they they make you can de escalate you can reduce medication so there is light in the title is because you're on a one two or three medications\nYou can potentially get off some others\nAbsolutely and I can't stress that enough with you and I think that you hit on something big the smoking if they're smoking in the stock that's huge in fact it's it's probably bigger than giving a medication the effect of stopping smoking is bigger than getting a medication\nTreating sleep apnea if you have sleep apnea that's the equivalent to taking medicine and finally exercise you know we've touched on so many things about lifestyle exercise get moving\nIt has a huge impact on your house even if it doesn't directly lead to weight loss the way your blood vessels respond to exercise there is no medication like it\n... or ... I'm going to see whether we have any callers okay\n\nThe um ... one of the questions it's coming up is I'm white coat or hypertension white coat high blood pressure in the ... the um [noise]\nUh what do you think of that is it a real phenomena that your your blood pressure in in the doctor's office is one Seventy or eighty and and someone comes in with a a a ... a diary thing there ... or one twenty over Seventy one forty or eighty one thirty over Seventy ... what what do you say about that\nYes the first of all is very real it is a very real problem it is a common problem patient's blood pressure is can be up to twenty points higher and their doctor's office\nAnd you take a strategy where you're trying let them sit for a little bit you say okay I'll shut the lights off take a few minutes and you try and get five ten minutes apart for a couple of blood pressure readings here's the problem the white coat hypertension does signify an increased risk so it can't be ignored\nIt's not that that blood pressure you know the feeling becomes oh Dr when I go home it's all fine\nYeah but the fact that you're twenty points higher in a situation like this that is a signal for increased risk\nTreating that is challenging because frequently when we work on that number\nGet in touch with your doctor's certainly if you have any symptoms if you have any chance discomfort of trouble breathing you want to you want to address this very emergent Lee at that point\nA new beat so um I a friend hopefully a it's a very complex question and again I uh hopefully unit that short amount of time there was already said\nIf you take out to to monitor this year die on the table is it true if I die on the table that light ... centimeters left after a not\nA friend of my friend I'd I Apologize that again um\nYou have a very uh unusual a complex problem and again I don't mean to cut you short but a ... uh the the shows coming to an end and I again please a addresses with your

sold and take your exercise all these chains all these things can impact and prolong life we're reducing heart disease and stroke because of blood pressure control\nOr the or the future's bright um

today with Dr Donald Berwick president emeritus and senior fellow at the Institute for healthcare improvement and former administrator of the center for Medicare and Medicaid services a pediatrician by training Dr Berwick\nHas served on the faculty of Harvard Medical school and the Harvard School of public health he was vice chair of the U.S preventative Services Task force in surfing the Institute of medicine's covering board\nShe earned is empty ... from Harvard Medical school start to Berlin welcome back to conversations on health care it's a real pleasure to be with you that you know when we had you back in early two thousand twelve or ... in the past in the spring of two thousand and ten and you were on that ground floor of the policy development and\nYou recently published a powerful article in the journal of American Medical association in which you lay out some of the political challenges that have\nLong been embedded in the American health policy just give our listeners an update on the a C a and really sort of where it stands and I and I'm thinking about the two lenses that you use to describe the Affordable CARE Act\nOne that it was to give people more insurance to is to make the healthcare system better what's currently going on there if you could just give us a lay of the land\nYes I have as you said conceded the credit card is actually kind of to log in one one two weeks to get more people covered with better coverage and the second to help health care change and improve so it does a better job on the first ground the Affordable CARE Act potential was to cover about\nThirty two million people sixteen million by expanding Medicaid coverage and sixteen million by setting up these affordable exchanges with subsidies to people so they can afford insurance or they're not eligible for Medicaid\nButter lower income unfortunately we're backpedaling on both the Trump Administration is doing everything account too slow progressing\nCoverage they want to dial back the Medicaid expansion they have made it possible for Medicaid benefits to now be much less valuable to discourage states from expanding and to eventual you end up we were called block grants that is instead of the federal government being the co insurance Medicaid they just give money to states has to offer that money\nAs a result Medicaid expansion has slowed and there are people now especially under the new work requirements who have had Medicaid who are going to lose it\nOr this is hurting people badly in the lower end of the economic spectrum\nOn the expansion of exchanges in order for the exchanges to be vibrant federal government has to step up and make sure that the exchanges are offering insurance policies that cover\nWhat they showed so that people aren't going to be surprised to find themselves not covered and the subsidies has to stay in place there are a number of maneuvers the government is now made to cut back on the subsidies to\nDo to make it possible for insurance companies to offer far less valuable insurance coverage said you're going to be going to buy insurance and discovery it's doesn't cover or something you really need\nAn so effective coverage is going backward this is a you know it's a toxic a trend and I I think we're we're backing away the under ... by the end of the Obama administration we had about twenty million people covered up to thirty two you know it could have been an that's decreasing now unfortunately\nOn me make health care better front there's also some dialing back there's been some wonderful experiments done with new forms of payment that health care providers offer farmer continuity\nAnd those experiments have been could have been cut back on and I think we're seeing less progress on otherwise what's so we lack the kind of federal leadership we need to have universal coverage and health care reform and it concerns me\nWith ... for all of us who were deeply engaged in health care before the AC a there are certainly so many things which we thought clearly in a very turned away dressed some of the persistent problem that people in this country and getting the coverage and the care they need it and use laid out in your article politics in health care some of the\nPolitical challenges that we've grappled with and you turn on the rise of these new potential threats to health reform some of which you\nReferenced and in the contacts in the environment changes in the ... the Supreme Court\nI'm going to just help our listeners understand how the makeup of the high court really has the ability to significantly affect\nThe health reform progressive than made and also how state government could play a strong role in determining health policy as we go forward\n[noise] yes that editorial in the journal the American Medical Association it was actually at a tour of about two articles that were in that issue one was an analysis of the probable effects of\nA shift in center of gravity and the Supreme Court and the nomination and confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh would have on healthcare first of all the Affordable CARE Act itself requires\nSupport from the Supreme Court or interpretations that matter\nThat say that it's okay for Congress to set up a system which expands Medicaid him which provides more coverage to people\nOr I think there is a threat now that the ability of the agencies and each H. S. C. M. S. and others to actually protect beneficiaries will be decreased under a Supreme Court that where the center of gravity has shifted\nI mean the basic fundamental idea here is health care even write the question is do we have a court that actually wants to make sure that people have access to care as a matter of justice and I'm worried about that obviously the wellbeing of women is at stake here are certainly should Wilkie weighed be overturned we're going to see\nA wave of a serious harm to women childbearing age\nAnd a and I think we could see contraceptive coverage decrease as well so I think there's there's enormous harm hospital with a court with a shift in center of gravity\nThe bigger picture in my editorial was\nKind of speaking the doctors and nurses you know is it if you're a doctor you want to see patients you really would prefer not to have to do with politics you know it just let me please let me see my patients is critical circus you know go on with them or you know if that's not possible politics is in health care in America as well as other countries but in America especially\nCause with three trillion dollars of the economy at stake bass forces entered the picture and I'm really urging conditions to step up and protect patients and become politically activated I think we've got to do it or will be in\nYour article really as a clarion call in particular to the young practitioner who's starting off their career you know ... ignore politics that their own peril and those of their patients as well and I'm Wondering what your advice is\nWhat what do you think a a meaningful engagement will be for someone who's also got a fulltime clinical practice what what's the practical advice that you know\nI I you know I don't want to be glib about it there are two years of engagement people have their lives to lead but first vote on the turnout in American politics the voting turnout is is dreadful at the very people that are being hurt the most aren't the ones that are voting so I'd say physician nurse you vote and get people to vote and be part of that call\nYou know doctors are respected nurses are respected and when they take positions patience listen they're trusted and I I think that it's your judgment call as to whether you want to bring that into the consulting firm but I think speaking out now about the idea that if we don't protect\nHealthcare as human rights were all going to get hurt\nSweden or poor you know your seat innovations tort too much or health will be here systems he can certainly weren't\nWe've been speaking today with Dr ... with the president in marriages and senior fellow at the Institute for healthcare improvement and independent not for profit organization seeking to improve health and health care worldwide you can learn more about their work by going to I. H. I. dot org or follow Dr Berwick on Twitter at Don Berwick\nDr Berwick thank you so much for your dedication to improving the health care system here around the world for all you've contributed to our advances of recent years\nAnd for joining us on conversations on health care today\nYou're very confidence or having the [noise]\nCitizens and helped her we want our audience to be truly you know when it comes to the facts about health care reform in policy three Robert to ward winning journalist and managing editor fact checked out or a non partisan non profit consumer advocate for voters that aims to\nReduce the level of deception in us politics\nLearning what have you got for us this week\nThe department of justice is citing with plaintiffs in a lawsuit that it said if the acceptable would end Affordable Care act protections for those with preexisting condition yet president Donald Trump claimed that quote pre existing conditions are state and he said that he quote will always fight\nFor patients with preexisting conditions\nThe lawsuit in question was filed in district court in Texas in February by twenty states it argues that because Congress eliminated the tax penalty associated with the eighty eight individual mandate that a requirement to have insurance that the mandate itself is now unconstitutional\nAnd without the mandate the entire health care law must go\nThe suit bases this argument on the Supreme Court twenty twelve decision that found the mandate was lawful under Congress's power to tax\nIn June the department of justice said this was a rare case where it would not defend the federal government and the last ... said the OJ largely agreed with the plaintiffs\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions wrote in a June a letter to Congress that he had made this decision quote after careful consideration and with the approval of the president of the United states\nSessions explained that the administration didn't agree that the entire APA would have to go if you were successful but it said to her vision would need to be eliminated those guaranteeing that people can't be denied coverage by insurers or charge more based on certain factors\nThose provisions protect those with preexisting conditions from being denied a policy or charged higher premiums\nBefore the a C H instituted these protection insurers could deny coverage or charge more based\nOn health status on the individual market where those without him quarter based clans are public coverage by their own insurance in early September the\nDistrict court judge in the case heard oral arguments on a preliminary injunction against the ADA requested by the plaintiffs we can't predict what future steps the administration might take if the plaintiffs are successful in the case\nBut it's misleading for the president to say he quote will always fight for an always protect patients with preexisting conditions\nWhen his Justice Department with his approval has decided not to fight and instead sided with the planes that in a lawsuit that could end such patient protection and that's my check for this week I'm Laurie Robertson\nManaging editor effect checked out or\nStax Chek dot org is committed to factual accuracy from the country's major political players and as a project of the Annenberg public policy center at the University of Pennsylvania if you have a stack that you'd like check email us at the issue radio dot com will have checked out or Laurie Roberts and check it out for you here on conversations on them [noise]\nEach week conversation highlights a bright idea about how to make wellness a part of our communities and everyday lives over the past few decades kids have been getting less and less physical activity throughout the school day and his budgets have been tightened\nAnd achievement requirements of increased says and has become less prevalent in many schools University of Michigan researchers wanted to find a creative and effective solution that would increase kids movement without disrupting the school day\nWe looked at the scientific literature in terms of pro long feeding and they have demonstrated that if you just just two minutes of activity a small very skewed up do some movements sit back down\nActivity in that small of a dose can have dramatic improvements on health on cognition on learning so we decided to develop an intervention a program that would allow children to get these small birth of activity throughout the day\nDr Rebecca ... Hassan is principal investigator for intact\nInterruption of prolonged sitting with activity\nShe wanted to find out of just two to three minute short burst of physical activity five times a day done right at the student's desk would impact the kid's cumulative movement the research showed that kids of all shapes and body types found the program easy to participate in\nWe typically see and P. E. or recess lower participation and girls compared to boys\nBut in classroom activity breaks you actually see similar rates of participation if not higher rates of participation in girls compared to boys we also saw that for\nChildren who are carrying a few extra pounds that those children also were exercising at a high intensity so we did not see any differences by weight status which is excellent even children with asthma\nThey were even able to do the activity breaks because just a small burst of activity it's not a large enough triggered to trigger a asthma event and so that's another great one for these types of programs\nDr Hassan ... just said they wanted to to sign the intervention that would be easy for teachers to adopt and manage so they created videos designed to get kids moving quickly get your heart rate so then allow them to quickly eased back into their learning mode\nSo our lab we created a compendium of two hundred activity breaks that are just three minutes long we got a lot of positive responses particularly for their videos from the teachers because it was really easy to implement so there's no rules that you have to explain there's no instructions it's quickly get the children up\nPress the button move get the kids back down and then we're back on to as\nDr ... said that the most promising results were in the cumulative effect of the multiple burst of activity throughout the day is kids' burned on average about a hundred and fifty more calories per day and at the end of the week had her crude a significant amount of physical activity\nNo matter what the intensity of exercise was the kids when they went home and they still continue to be physically active we had these that are ... they measure movement at the hip and so it tells us how many calories where the kids burning how much physical activity where they getting\nAnother question that we asked was again will the kids eat back all the calories and we noticed that no these small birth of activity did not affect hunger\nA low cost easily adoptable fitness intervention for kids allowing short burst of physical activity throughout the school day enhancing fitness reducing stress empowering kids to move more positively impacting the learning experience now that's a bright idea\n\nConversations on health care so and I'm Margaret Flinter\nConversations on health care is recorded at W.

thousand twelve regular season now a doubt when today would be that person for games away from it in the stadium\nAnd what did it would match the longest road winning streak against the Redskins since Nineteen Seventy one as you mentioned both teams coming off\nBig wins the Redskins that route of Jacksonville\nThe Redskins or a narrower win over Carolina a receiver Tehran often the parents Williams or out for Dallas or the Redskins are going to be without Jameson Crowder unlikely Chris Tom spin and called Richardson junior still a tough week for Alex Smith\nAn hour or one of the big games today though has the eagles hosting Carolina later on today peppers tight and Greg also when he's right he's one of the person football what is the right to be is right or the eagles the right team was\nThe kind of fight against Brandon what do you think is is a good week for Greg Olson against the eagles [noise]\nFor having me that is always I'm so excited and very bummed about the Melvin Gordon news absolutely\nYeah I think what's interesting about that is that first came back\nHe actually Ninety eight percent of the teams opposite snap so they must believe that he is back\nAh the only titans played in more of their team snacks or ...\nOr so I think he's bad was only four catches forty eight guards but listen for catches a still a good sign especially when you're playing with Cam Newton who's not exactly known for his a passing\nSo hopefully this is a good game but yeah I I you know listen the titan position is really tough this year so you have to plan especially in a very favorable matchup in fact\nIt's the best match up for the Panthers against the\nPay let me talk about the lions are there the pie week last week the plate well a couple of weeks before going to Miami was very very hot MBA Wilson just told me it will be about a hundred degrees we'll be all against the top and Jean much on beating at home how does that bowling for Lyons quarterback Matthew Shepard fantasy start today\nAt the top\nTen in terms of defending against the quarterbacks wide receivers anti dance the best match up is actually a running back\nA redneck has been ruled out it's going to be Karen Johnson taking on the book of his nap\nSo and I say the arithmetic snap because they're still going to have like ... lent their blood probably going to steal or at least some carries if not a goal line a carry their and everyone's got to get very frustrated doctors averaging five point seven yards per carry some a little more interested in him than anyone else but listen\nWhen you got golden paid when he got Kenny Golladay when he got Margaret Jones junior there's a possibility a touchdown for sure both Kenny Golladay enlarge on how the touched on each of their\n... and three other last four games which is a lotta touchdowns in golden hated on paper over Thirteen hundred yards the sea\nWhile to more of a level that you're one Brandon Lee of course all bad if he export does a great job once said sports Sunday Jacksonville and Cleveland today now Jacksonville acquired Carlos Hyde this week in a trade cars letter Burnett is still hard\nAnd a Cleveland got rid of them so that means that worked at the ... when he got a Georgian Nick Chubb dj will get the calories for Baker Mayfield hide in Jacksonville\nJobs in Cleveland what about those two guys\nUh what I asked her oh Jacksonville is running back and just after all\nA we're getting conflicting reports here about whether or not Carlos Hyde it's going to play at about two days to get used to the Jacksonville system either running back that's not as imperative but there's a possibility but if he does it's difficult to start a yelled in or ... by the way a lot of us myself included were depending on the jail then this entire time so it's a little frustrating\nA it's a possibility that they both uh become very difficult to trust\nBut stay tuned to the news you guys up until kick off that game is not at nine thirty thankfully ah and then as far as a Nick topics can start the Tampa Bay bucks can't stop anyone so I don't know how you don't start every one that is going to touch the field as a brown this

don't want to see no boring NFL football they want to see points and they're going to see it this morning\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nHi this is very exciting for me you know the the few guys around the country to get a sense in this business by the way a lot of guys are not very 'cause I think that every ah Mike on the line right now is one of the most entertaining and smart is and there's a reason why for decades\nFrom a little writer in Philadelphia He's now a monster TVs or whether he's on a course first take which is on ten AM\nTo noon eastern time on ESPN every week they were doing a show here in New York but not the eight point seven ESPN from one to three every afternoon he has kept us all entertain and thinking for many many years and that's my buddy Stephen Smith good morning Steve in\nWhat's going on Buddy Guy you'd go a long time those speak have you been\nI've been great back in New York last time we spoke with still struggling down in Miami trying to get back here so you could appreciate Steven on the road to get back to New York it took me twelve years but now that I'm back I'm I'm so happy\nWhile as well deserved is what I enjoy your work detail of you know what you're doing um you've always one or the most knowledgeable and passionate do around so I'm happy to hear that you're back and I'm happy to be on the show with\nYou but thank you mean those are all big words coming from your Stephen ... Smith let's do some football and basketball locally of course you talk about this on ESPN everyday is one of those TV\nI Know most people don't blaming the offensive line for the giants woes I'm a giant fan and certainly the members of line is terrible I'm not going to deny that but if they ought to young a quarterback who can possibly get out of his own way that may help too so for me see even for me\nPlace most of the blame on the thirty seven year old quarterback who cannot get out of his own way and by the way it's\nNot even close to being an accurate quarterback anymore for me the old line get some some issue here but to me number ten is the main problem for the giants you thought\nWell I'm going to challenge you on that thinking that from this perspective number one ... mountain or use the career of sixty percent completion pasture this year he was cleaning more than Seventy percent of his palaces up until a week ago\nWhen I saw me for a second when you're going to pass as to your money back out of the backfield you're going to complete most of those Steve\nThat's fair that they are but I'm going to get to that second point I think that you point in the big in the wrong direction because tell me something that that you just said about he like many if you have a good thing\nFor than you know you're saying if you know\nWhat I'm saying is you know who he is you know what your personality and as a result you supposed to build around that time I look at\nThe Mars outlook at a ... am I looking guys like that and the reason why I look at it like that is because even though he's thirty seven years of age\nHe was an Iron Man only started using it for the last Thirty years or so was when he was backed by black box but then that could do and Jerry ... who went to John ... mission to make that call you knew that he was the mobile you knew that he was the greatest most accurate passed in the world he clearly was in his brother Peyton Manning\nThe way you you never confused it will be in a pot and arguably a top ten quarterback in the national football league\nYou knew about his immobility you knew all of these deficiencies\nThat he had raped yet and still how many years have the giants had to build an offset the blonde sort\nOf said rows and rows of the world wouldn't be talking about what they're talking about right now it seems that we've been saying this about he lives a year even though I have a problem with him just like you do the left the ultimate level of culpability that I attach it not to him\nBut to the giants as an organization because you knew what you had a you still have that if you\nAre very very fair point can argue with any of that you're right a re ... and now we'll see of course of government can change that but you're right they're not dealt with the biggest issue over the years it's still the same now old OPEC and junior gets Ninety five million dollars look\nDown the money wasn't going to make him more mature and if anything goes the other way\nBut I still live at least one of the three or four best wide receivers in football I was happy I hate him I Want I'm On my team he acts like insurance there's no question about it but I got to tell you\nI feel is frustration here's a guy that it's being double covered trying to get up and down the field and by the time he gets open Manning's really throwing the ball to the turf where he's running on his hands I feel bad world do backed him junior\nWe all do because we know that he's the star we know he can play we know he deserves better than what you're getting all of that is true but here's where I'd jump off the oh Delbanco junior bandwagon only in this respect that\nEven though he's been a ... an immature it if it breeds from passion and because he cares that we'd rather that from my superstar that to him not to feel that way I totally understand that but we have to take into account who we're talking about here we're\nTalking about a giants organization that prides itself on class and carrying yourself representing the brand in a certain way there has been trepidation and apprehension about given O'Dowd Beck and Julia is money before they gave it in because of the very reason\nAlong the way they met with him\nYou gave them your word you were going to be on the opposite of that you understood what representing the brand was all about you understood what being a giant was all about that it wasn't just about how you played on the field is just so ... how you could get some off the field and you did all that you could\nTo make sure to convince them that you will worthy of the money because they like you know it wasn't going to be just about your performance on the field you sign up but that then the second you get shoved money\nSubtlety here we go again huh and not only do you speak out\nBut to your daddy speak and your dad he spoke out earlier this week said he speaks out I'm not even saying that he was wrong but why are you going to pick some video of John Mara toss in a chair because he's frustrated with the team who if he had a call now my son but\nI got a better question where were you oh they'll that can keep your when your son was trying to get his money how come you didn't see it that you know why because you were wise enough to make sure that you did it in the air\nWith your son the money well guess what owners across the board you know there's just as well as the if not more so with all the years that you've been covering sport now more so than ever\nHow you conduct yourself may compromise your bottom line in terms of the money you're able to generate based on the players ... they\nPeople will turn off because guess what they don't like how you act et cetera et cetera which is what will raise an onus higher so it's perfectly plausible that John ... is saying\nYou're conducting yourself this way is affecting my bottom line you agreed not to do that and I gave you Ninety five million dollars I made you the highest paid wide receiver N. N. F. L. history without even a playoff when on your resume\nAnd this is what you turned around and do I\nFeel betrayed and I think that when you take it from that position I don't know how anybody can argue against John Mara but what we can't treat him like he's one of the players he's the owner of the tea he doesn't cash check\nHe cuts that to us for us to act like oh he's as equal as the player\nYou are sadly mistaken because the last time I checked oh delve that can do it is paying himself he's getting paid by the New York giants and I think oh they'll that comes to your dropped the ball and I'm not trying to be disrespectful I don't know the man I'm quite sure he's a wonderful father is a great job\n... are raising his son I'm quite sure I I respect the ... come into the defense of his son\nBut come on now you got no business picking your nose in that particular situation because John how are they really say anything we're all\nGreat stuff here in Ninety eight point seven ESPN one to three everyday Stephen Smith of course first take with my good friend max councilman tend to noon eastern time ESPN not is all great Steven a and by the way the giants of course looking to avoid a one in six start taking on the falcons in Atlanta tomorrow night or are they will be in fact\nOne in six let's get to the NBA and all the bronze got a couple of games under his belt gets the double double in the first game the law's the law so I should say on the road in Portland talked to a couple of guys last receiving a guy like\nParker and I asked the question chemical quarters sneak in and so forth I Know Golden State whether you since federal puppy Oklahoma City as well Kendall Lakers with the best player in the world sneak you know so for the consensus is no there is six or seven but most of it was said\nIn the playoffs yeah mother probably more of a six or seven right\nThat that I Would ask you not to hang up on me [laughter]\nI got I got the Lakers finish in as a top off box seats and getting to the west the conference finals\nOkay so when I asked the question about being a foresee then you don't think it's a crazy question\nI don't think it's a crazy question at all because of my whole point is this\nCome playoff time if LeBron James resume need anything to anybody come playoff time who can definitively look at this man and say\nBy that time would experience God like Ron do and land the what the young ... Brandon Ingram Alonzo ball Josh ...\nWho's to say that this guy can't get those guys together to make a run at any body ... Golden State Houston that severely compromised offensively because Trevor reason looking bomber takes off both gone and not only that you're quote unquote defensive coordinator and justice Delhi", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Imus in the Morning", "city": "New York", "day": "21"}
