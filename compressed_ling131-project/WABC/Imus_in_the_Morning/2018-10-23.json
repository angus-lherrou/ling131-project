ah she's been getting more speeches she's been more critical of course of Trump all along it as almost as though she's been trying to lead the resistance she's in the headquarters of the resistance that's how she's positioned herself\nThen you see this speaking tour coming up that she and Bill Clinton are going to do a this is timed I think to keep her name front and center while the other candidates are beginning their campaigns right after the midterms are the twenty twenty race begins\nNext month I'm and you'll see them forming exploratory committee raising money doing more travel and\nYou ask yourself which among them could go toe to toe with Donald Trump which among them Cory Booker Kamala Harris Joe Biden Bernie Sanders Eric Holder\nAndrew Cuomo bill de Blasio Michael Bloomberg so many people want to run\nWhich among them could unite the Democratic party behind the message\nOr be the leader of the party or the biggest brought us leader of the party and raise the money to defeat Donald Trump can can test them and then finally get in the ring with him in the presidential debates now can you imagine Donald Trump debating Cory Booker\nIt we're Spartacus or sharia would not have a chance and up and you go down\nThe list that way and so I think you combine Clinton wanting it with all of the things she's doing and the weakness of the field and you say you know despite at all and she's not my favorite\nBut I think this idea that she doesn't have a chance is foolish because if she wants it I think she has a very good chance of getting it\nYou're I Believe you I Believe I agree with you a thousand percent Michael Goodman from the New York post and the burning ... her runs in the left includes a calling for instability which is something\nYou know the radical left is doing these days they're actually perpetrating but a lot of Democrats as you know Michael are saying listen Hillary shut up you're getting in the way your old news you're going to hurt us more than helping us\nWell they're saying that now because of the terms that they don't want her to cast a shadow on all of the candidates running but ... that's going to be over in two weeks I'm a ... they didn't they didn't ... they don't want her to go away forever they just didn't want her to you know subtract from this\nSpotlight on the candidates are who are running around the country uh I I think once that's over she's gonna be welcome back by a lot of people and look\nI look at it this way guys she sort of the incumbent nominee if somebody else wants that job they have to take it from her they have to beat her in some way now doesn't mean\nNecessarily in a primary but you have to gather the crowd the crowd has to be behind you if you're going to be if it's Andrew Cuomo or somebody else we we haven't even heard of they've got to show that got the most money they've got the enthusiasm that they have something she doesn't\nAnd right now I don't see that I don't I don't see it emerging from any of these people we know these people\nNone of them I Believe\nAre that Iraq Obama emerge emerging superstar ... these people are all fairly well known on the national stage right now none of them are terribly respected or well received by a broad swath even at the Democratic\nParty and you can argue both in agreement then except was learned just you know write it I think you know you can you imagine her debating on\nHe um well I should say I saw something last week a Bernie Sanders it almost seems like Michael like he was willing to take the back seat\nTo a ... point says almost like let's let the young lady kind of move forward which doesn't make any sense to me because it seems to me like he would still like to be president and you did write in this column Bernie Sanders is on vapors what does that mean exactly well\nLook I think I think his movement led by him Pete I think it it it changed the Democratic party that is now the energy of the Democratic party what Bernie Sanders created the movement he created and twenty sixteen\nBut I don't think he's anymore regarded as the essential ingredient or the fire has been let in the Ocasio Cortez is in many many other candidates I just don't get the sense that people look at Bernie as the one person who can lead it\nYou know but although you know your age problem\nHe doesn't need but let's not forget that if not for his own party schooling him against Hillary he may very well one\nYes yes that's right I mean he could have a ... what we found out from the league was out of the DNC\nBasically favored Clinton Clinton I mean I still think there's a criminal case there by the way of the way she co opted the Democratic party is fundraising and used it for her campaign I mean she just siphoned it right out of the coffers of the party\nOr that's what Donald Brazil wrote about and it's pretty darn clear that that's what Clinton did well what that did was give people basically an unlimited amount that they could contribute to Clinton far in excess of the federal limits\nSo she a lot of you know all that money was just siphoned right out of the party and went right to her and her argument as well we propped the party up when it was broke yes but it wasn't broke forever it raised a lot of money that went right to her\nUm she'll look I I think\nJust to finish on Bernie I I think he's still got\nA you know a lot of support but I Would be very surprised to see him emerged as the nominee I just don't think that ah people look at him as\nEssential to this movement now this movement is a real it's got it's got a lot of energy and enthusiasm a lot of followers it's bigger than Bernie\nAnd speaking of the movement of course Michael a we have the midterms coming up and and the thing that everybody's talking about these days is this a mob and that sets a bum Russia born or a down and down the you know coming up through Mexico how do you think Michael ... only take on it how do you think that's going to impact the midterms\nUp you know I think right now it's helping the Republicans as helping President Trump make his case that the borders are open\nThat we don't have sufficient even legal authority to stop them because once they get in and make that application for asylum at the border even if they come legally to the to the crossing points\nAnd make that application we have to let them in the country into their cases adjudicated which is never because the backlog is so great so when they come like this it's essential almost a guarantee\nSo I think I think this is a strong argument for the president are demanding that there will be better protections on the other hand I must say and this is really a matter of timing\nIt depends how this story and ... if this story ends badly\nLet's say Trump does send the military and innocent people you know children are shot by an accident or by some ... you know something goes goes wrong in the military opens fire on some section here I mean it wouldn't take but one or two people to do that\nOr something like Kent State back in the seventies right you are one or two people getting killed innocent people getting killed can have an enormous ramification so if that were to happen before the midterms I think it would be devastating for the republic\nHas a great one other one was listening to your
