have the toll breast removed and you have a\nLarge tumor lymph nodes involved you most probably need other treatment to try to prevent the cancer from growing back\nSo these are the things probably the surgeon doesn't tell the patient probably the surgeon who wants to be a hero prohibit the surge and wants to say oh I got it all about the probably the patient says oh did you get it all out as a certain says oh yeah I got it all out\nBut that's really miss leading the patient maybe he got out what he thought was all of that but then the surgeon he or she should have said by the way you need more treatment there are a randomized studies were half the people get more treatment and half the people don't get more treatment\nAnd the people that get more treatment to have a higher chance to be cancer free that's called\n... therapy so additional therapy after the first therapy is called\n... therapy if there's no obvious cancer but we know there's a high risk of cancer growing back\nIt's

are close the cancer was aggressive and now it's come back\nBecause she did not get proper at ... therapy she did not get the treatment that she needed that she should have been educated about and that's why we're here today on the radio\nAnd it was about a man who is six to eight years old ... has a daughter\nAnd there's a new ad uno carcinoma of the lung though his along medical history has a new PET scan showing the cancers growing who was diagnosed with lung cancer this year and he said to PET scans he said no treatments that one of the big hospitals the shows you how slow they operate\nThey got to PET scans but no treatment and the cancer is growing\nAnd two and a half months on no treatment well what do they think it's going to do what his cancer to cancer grows of course it grows so they got documentation it's growing but they didn't offer many treatment and finally he was sent here by a listener like you\nYou also has diabetes as juvenile diabetes had diabetes since childhood he had a kidney transplant the diabetes destroyed the kidney spit on him into suppressive medicine's so people are an immuno suppressive medicines have higher risk of developing cancers\nFive months ago we had a cat coffee at a CAT scan showing a mess in the long hit a PET scan a biopsy done showing out of no carcinoma as a speculative mass\nHis weight now is one fifty five it was one eighties who's lost twenty five pounds is five foot eight so I was always worrisome when people lose so much weight in a short period of time I examined him he got to PET scans of the short period showing cancer growing and we spoke about all the options\nWe spoke about treatment of his cancer not invasive Lee and that's what he likes the idea of pinpoint treatment no coddling no bleeding no surgery no just tubes no chemo\nHe likes outpatient therapy and how do we do radio surgery on lung cancers well we make um older on the body with computerized the body\nWe sending thousands of beams from thousands of angles to attack the cancer all non invasive leave with high success rates in fact new studies just a review and with Dr Ossorio Lederman show better results with

moving like molasses for his cancer while his cancers growing\nIn fact one of the artworks of radio surgeon there's artwork when you come and go see the artwork and see a big boat stuck in the middle of the ocean and that kind of symbolizes the big hospitals are almost so big they're paralyzed by inefficiencies\nAnd like this man he suffers by the end of ... suffers because she does not get care

views expressed by the preceding ... those are the sponsor and not necessarily the opinions of Seventy seven WABC or cumulus media [noise]\nFish is really the only great source of these two compounds\nFish oil supplements Haitian has now become the biggest category in the vitamin business because of all the benefits all the clinically proven benefits of EPA and the ha charities really taken a leading role because we feel we have the best product and now the best\nProduct combinations with other ingredients we've combined with fish oil\nDeliver even better benefits for people\nWe're talking with Jesus in camp president a platonic development of purity phonics about I'm exciting new plan to be a little exclusively through purity one called the omega three super ...\nWe've got a special opportunity a free bottle offers the tune we're going to be given up that phone number ... Jesus let's get to ingredient number two because this will make us three super ... you know just something that no other fishermen upon it can do it actually lowers cholesterol talk about these plants terminals explain how this works and why it's so important\nRight well I don't know anyone who isn't concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one compound one ingredient\nThat stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical study shown to lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol HDL the good cholesterol though\nObviously you don't want to lower HDL plants they're all only target LDL and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in as little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level\nSafely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all since the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to stabbings\nStaten work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plants that rolls work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called\nMy seals into thinking that the plants they're all or actually the cholesterol particles so that might steals pick up the plant sterile instead of the cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles instead sort of just get pass through your intestines than you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them\nThe point is if you're on Staten you can take plants they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants they're all to deliver the benefits as shown in the study\nThat's something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that laws on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever shown any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow Jason let's talk about the third ingredient in the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all over the world's most of my co Q. ten and why it's valuable for our health what is what does it do\nWell co Q. ten is found in every single cell in your body if they're from the moment you're conceived until the moment you leave the earth\nUnfortunately as you age you lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much\nA few ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten\nOne word should come to mind pat energy\nYou cannot make energy without co enzyme Q. ten ... is the\nCritical pivotal energy component of every cell in your body Ninety five percent of all your energy is related to the amount of co enzyme Q. ten in your body without an adequate supply you become energy efficient you technically would have energy the fish and sell\nSo co enzyme Q. ten delivers a whole Napoli of different benefits were putting in fifty milligrams a perfect dose for you to get every single day it's going to support healthy blood pressure is great for your gums\nIf you're a person who has tender gums maybe when you floss or brush your teeth you noticed a little sore and is maybe a little bleeding could be a sign that you've got to co Q. deficiency coincide Q. ten supports immune function\nIt supports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti accident\nIn fact one of the most powerful anti accident ever discovered they're actually taking a look now at Cohen's on Q. ten and its role in exercise and muscle performance one other interesting oh coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where\nOne study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled death and his little was ten weeks or so when you talk like a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and so the three and one product we're talking about these three amazing ingredient extremely safe for a long term used for short term youth in any dosage\nAnd I don't know if you saw that report the other day but basically half of Americans are taking one or more pharmaceutical drugs so I Know a lot of people out there listening already taking something they're thinking is that they should I take it to my doctor\nThere may be no three safer ingredients than the three we're talking about today\nNow Jason as if the super ... wasn't enough with the co Q. ten for energy the plants generals for controlling cholesterol and the fish oil for just about everything else purity is putting together an offer you see people can't refuse tell me about this great double free offer you got going on right now today to get people started\nThat's Wright Patt we're letting anyone out there give this product

your heart it's great for your brain from mood for easing occasional stress for managing something called whole most Fifteen\nAlmost Fifteen is a very important biomarker that your doctor may look at when he does a blood test it's related to cardiovascular wellness\nSo be twelve is what we call up a real work horse vitamin and just like with omega threes too many folks out there are deficient

to visit in the office but I just wanted to ask this question I have a fit\nShirts diagnose way and I was wondering if you're a stem cell therapy would actually help that'll get me into a position a bit of that want to do us a call your version on me and I was okay if I can get to that position where you don't have the stem cell already working through my body with it I call the ... version of all if it takes would keep me\nIt was difficult to say the one thing I can tell you is that we've had patients that are diabetic or that have had a variety of different issues are and we've done stem cell therapy intravenously and a good percentage of the people that are also had a fair bit of a a fed reversal\nSo I can guarantee or say that this will happen but we've seen results from that so I think that you have to check your vitamins you have to check red blood cell magnesium potassium\nCorrect those usually a fed is a disorder where in the left atrium\nThe a\nNervous around the pulmonary veins coming back into the heart start to fire irregularly a radically and that would cause the top part of the heart to twitch so I think correcting your minerals might be a significant benefit hormones as well\nI think if you look at research on heavy metals they correlate with ... so I Would take a look at a variety of things to see what things may be contributing to it and try to change that landscape change that environment\nBut again I can tell you we have a lot of people that have had multiple benefits in doing the stem cell intravenous procedure let's say they're coming in again for diabetes and their vision improve their sense of smell improves but you could look at some of this on the the videos on my website\nYou can see people that have had dramatic benefits from different areas of their body when they did the procedure\nRight now with this question I just wanna fall one block the maybe ... they'll have to come in and go through a whole team that are totally understand yet you think that I should hold both have an audio version it's like I'm going to see you\nAnd I can't really I Can't really give you advice on that because I don't know how bad your problem is I haven't seen any protests so you know people that are having a really significant short of breath and the fed is you know not in control\nThan it might be worthwhile and certainly you're cardiologist but the best person to answer that 'cause he's senior to do the procedure and stop that from progressing because having the a fib continue does have its downsides of side effects so\nThe best person to tell you how quickly need to do it as the cardiologist tissues lifted all your all your uh information\nOkay well thank you so much about ... weeks\nThank you for your call okay phone

us\nSo we learn about what your body's doing make recommendations and watch to see those change so it's a it's a very well observed mechanism to want to see exactly what your buddies doing now that we're making recommendations whether it's vitamins minerals hormones exercise et cetera\nSo important to be scientific and the way that we understand what your body's going to and how we can help to correct that one eight hundred for eight WABC if you'd like to call in to ask you a question you could do so now one eight hundred eight for eight\nNine to two two\nInteresting correlation between melatonin levels and high frequency hearing loss and this talks about a cross section of study involving subjects\nThat we're both male and female over the age of sixty low plaza melatonin levels are found to correlate with age related high frequency hearing loss\nThe average level was one point at Eighteen point three micrograms per leader as compared to those who had significantly higher levels that didn't really have the hearing issue so there may be things\nAs your body ages that you lose production of that contribute to hearing loss of problems with memory focus concentration energy and as I discuss things have patience I start the conversation\nI'm with a little chat about how your body over time when you're in your teens you're making huge numbers of new cells a new cell divisions every second and as you get older you're living in an older cells that are not being replaced as much by your body and in many cases as that happens\nIn your hormones start declined your buddies that getting the right chemical messages\nFor your organs and tissues to function\nAnd that's a major part of what we see as aging\nSo if that is in the background and other things come to a bar across whether heavy metals can start to get into your tissues and create damage there's tons of evidence\nIn traditional medical literature about heavy metals how they affect your body if people aren't getting nutrient levels appropriate they're not doing exercise\nThan your body continues to change and worse and so these are all things that are behind the scenes occurring that we want to talk about so that's an important part of the initial conversation\nAnd you know I have arrived here have\nA I Know I have some problems with the outside\nWith all your lower back could be creating this addict problem again in ... hip would tell us if you're running down the cartilage et cetera there ... ...\nI'll go on ... I enjoy your program funky thank you look forward to seeing you have a wonderful day thank you for the call phone lines are open if you'd like to call and do so now let's go to Dan Hi there\nHow are you guys got cow ... ah\nI have a problem where um hell a normal high and a way on that side by I'm abnormal a called a lot of ... or from other people are fairly comfortable wandering so\nCold in other words you've got to where you know Vassar sweaters of things when everyone else is kind of warm\nYeah\nYou know everybody has a base of men about great everybody's fat percentage on their body everybody's calorie intake in you know acting exercise activity varies\nSo some people might be cold because the thyroid and slow or testosterone ... so there's no one answer all take this vitamin and your you'll be warm we have to understand what's going on you know ... looking at your hormone levels so I think that that's probably a correlation do you do a lot of exercising oh\nYes I I Can't say counterweight\nOkay I mean for the majority of people that we see we try to get a get them to do exercise every day something that's thirty minutes or so or more of activity or is your body fat low\nLow I'm about ...\nYeah because if your body fat is low of course\nYou know the quote insulation that fat provides would typically\nTend to make you feel warmer now people that are overweight you see them walking around with shorts and you know T shirts in the middle of winter you know 'cause their body is insulated by a a great deal more fat so right it may be that there's nothing you want to change in in terms of adding fat to your body\nBut if you're home all levels a little bit off that might help to improve that picture\nSo and again a lot of people that you might be comparing himself to might have more body fat and they may be warmer just from that\nI I actually there are a lot ... ... it's not normally called on the air or firing oh wait I or my ... and a lot of situational\nYeah somebody had to determine that'd be a testing again I can guess as to what you know may be contributing to it\nHas to take like hey we're allowing\nCorrect that makes them a sense let your body and tell us what's happening and then correct it from there\nBy and chemical yeah most of the White House ... yeah\nThe blood tests are covered by insurance because\nWhen people come in and it doesn't matter what insurance you have\nIf your insurance dictates that you have to use the specific lab then you know we give you a prescription you go to the lab so that's the entirety of what we do we wouldn't say oh go to this lab because\nAnd your insurance may or may not cover it so typically whatever insurance you're or whatever your insurance requires you go to that lab whether it's quest or lamb Corp or this or that\nSharp sharp okay alright alright auto correct All right Frank thank you so much for your call\nOkay phone lines are open if you'd like to call and ask the question do so now do wait for the end of the program one eight hundred eighty four eight WABC one eight hundred eighty four eight nine to two to 'em and as I say there may be people that on testing are completely normal but\nMay have a different presentation than other people so you know we can try to expect people to obey the same we can try expect people to all have the same requirement for things exercise\nUh nutrients so that's why it's an individualized understanding so your body will give us a true picture of what's going on in doing this sort of testing\n\nUm some people all they need to do is a little bit of exercise and they lose weight immediately other people need to do a lot more exercise and be more diligent with diet so there are a variety of different things you know variables\nThat your body has that make one person different from another\n\nOnce again phone lines are open one eight hundred for eight WABC what eight hundred eight forty nine to two to\nList the for some interesting information\nA vitamin D in type one diabetes so there's been so much research in vitamin D it's almost that every day I get on the computer and I look\nFor great research there's stuff going on with vitamin D all over the world and almost every facility\nSo it talks about vitamin D deficiency and looking at four hundred and Seventy two subjects those with type one diabetes\nAnd those without you know controls the individuals that had the lowest levels of vitamin D seem to have the more significant issues with problems related to diabetes or difficulty in metabolizing sugars so I think that there are lots of nutrients that if deficient\nCan affect the chemical biochemical pathways and mechanisms that allow\nA sugar dysfunction so multiple components in the metabolic pathway of vitamin D may be altered in the type one diabetic so as I say\nThe more that we learn about your by the more that we look at it that will do we correct your vitamins and minerals your exercise\nUh look for allergy to foods allergy as a major issue with people today because the majority of people that we see coming in with stomach issues or rash or this or that they might have a hint of\nA reactions to foods in many cases immediate or it may be that they're watching their died so much when they take out dairy 'cause a lot of people just randomly like to take out there and actually do better with it whether they randomly take out um the grains\nAnd they start to do better allergies a major issue you know most of your immune recognition your immune detentions in your guts Seventy percent they save your immune system is and you got so\nIt's likely that the processed foods and things of reading today may be contributing to your symptoms\nSo and doing a testing for allergy we do into journal testing on the arm because it's the most accurate it doesn't have the false negatives that blood testing um scratcher protesting has so that's the gold standard we can pick up allergies and individuals and then tell them\nHow they can change their diet and get these things out of the diet\nAnd washed their symptoms change so that's something we're very cognizant of because I've seen so much of this\nOver Thirty years but um\nIt's it's always part of the conversation when we uh you know do a console okay phone lines are open let's go to Louis in Manhattan Hi there how are you\nOn TALK uh crochet and taking my call obscenity H type to two hundred and thirty five pounds um and the\nExercise you know what's in a gym I think the treadmill for like thirty minutes I was happy with that because I Would do it to a point five but you said something just should be doing this every day that that\nSo if you look at what works and I can tell you exactly what work second sure you'll videos of the semi website for people that died that that are diabetic I talk about two different mechanisms going on the central\nThe core issue which is your pancreas not making enough insulin and the peripheral people either eating too much carbohydrate not doing exercise the hormone levels are declining the hormones that help to burn sugar and fat a and their vitamins are low so it's two different\nUnderstanding that makes it easier for people to get it\nSo we started to cut costs down and go to thirty grams or below per day that can start to bring your sugar down if you're doing exercise will\nCause a day yes that's absurd CERN\nOh it works works like a dream the only thing is uncertain eight people thinking that they can eat tons and tons of carbs and not end up having problems and we done this for years no not everything so okay let me finish so forget able to bring their cars down to thirty grams a day where they could have\nBerries yogurt chicken turkey fish lab soup salad nuts squash greens\nLots of foods cauliflower broccoli ask grow Cale center\nThose individual start to have their sugar drop if they start to do a half hour to forty five minutes of nonstop activity every day they burn sugar and fat better if we correct declining thyroid ... around that helps to burn sugar fat and then the mechanism that it's been documented in traditional literature\nOf using stem cell therapy intravenously that can help to get those cells to your pancreas they set up shop make new cells that make insulin so the ... the stem cells become pancreatic cells that make insulin\nMy testosterone level is twenty five they said that's the way too low\nYeah she'll be seven hundred\nAnd she says to me a a ... she says we can fix your medication number one but number two doctor I'm Sorry I Can't afford your hero you're asking for five thousand dollars\nNo I'm not I'm not asking you to do anything and yes there are some people who can't afford it can't get to us so I'm sitting here telling you the things that work to help to improve your picture\nYou know the reality is people take supplements because they hear that this is good for this or that and the supplements may not be getting into that ligament because there's not much blood flow in that ligament or the supplements may not be getting to the joint because you don't have a ton of blood flow and you're drawing like you would to your heart your lungs your liver your kidney your pancreas\nSo it depends upon what we're really doing that that's why the exam and the MRI would make the first step\nSo even if it's a chronic thing out of a cute thing as ways to go about doing what you just said the ...\nWell yeah I think that the best mechanism is to understand what you're dealing with first if it's a chronic pain\nThat may mean that you have degeneration of cartilage or ligaments or tendons and the joint you want to address that you don't want to take supplements or you don't want to take a painkiller just to make a symptom go way to manage to have more progression of the damage or degeneration so the first thing is to understand what we're dealing with and then start to make recommendations\nOr whatever and if it's like the whole body though and it just feels aches and pains\nWell it could be either a significant mechanism like an auto immune to inflammatory mechanism is making everything hurt that you have to test their blood test for panels that can do that or or maybe you have to back down on using either heavy weights or an activity that causes pain\nAgain this is all theoretical I don't know you know what we're dealing with until I sit down and talk to you\nSo basically it's unlike guy they say can Troy ...\nI don't do our kind of stuff as I've seen thousands of pages patients over the years\nOver Thirty years that I've been doing this and the ones that take the ... of the ... don't really report benefit or they say you know I thought I was feeling good and now I have more pain than before because maybe it was masking the pain I just don't see a mechanism for how those things get into your blood\nAnd then get through your blood vessels are even getting through your stomach to absorb gets your blood vessels small blood vessels and then get into your joined I don't see how that gets in injecting things in your joints a different thing 'cause it's directly you know placed but I've seen a lot of\nPeople who've taken just about every supplement is supposed to be good for this or that or arthritis and yet we don't see a result when we evaluate him so it's going to be learned about your buddy first seeing once there and then taking steps to help to correct it\nI get one last question I'm I'm I'm very rarely\nTake an app that will tell you like at all but I Am out I like it was like once every couple of weeks or just\nThey don't think that would be a problem for you I had a lab\nBy long term effects of an ethics laboratories not healthy\nNone of using it three times a day for you know months and months and months or years I mean I don't know it's again all theoretical but if you're taking one once in a while it shouldn't cause a problem I don't know whether a person might be allergic to it or not so sure\nBye bye and I do find that it's like it's a it is an ethical throughout like the the ...\nThere was no miracle as decreasing the your perception of the information and what's you\nKnow math in it yeah it's masking it\nSo that he could work real hard if you take the you know the meds and then you end up with more injury and more damaged thank you bye Let's go next to Rita in Long Island Hi how are you\nI packed up how high the fire hell you first of all what a blessing and you are\nOh thank you yes I kept ...\nReally um to answer people question I'd like to hear with you every week it by ... sometimes I over weight\n[laughter] that's okay [laughter]\nBut I Try to go through and find or pick Oh thank you [laughter] um my question is food plan I Hope I don't know I think what the crime has has had started your food\n... yes yes we put together a a\nMenu for the local restaurant that uh\nIs making foods that are within the thirty Graham account per day or variety of great vegetables and protein sources protein shakes snacks and things so when you come into the office we sort of walk you through that so you can understand how to fill out the form\nTo be able to do that and I really made this food plan\nBased upon people coming in getting their blood work done for vitamins and minerals hormones looking at the allergy mechanism and then putting the perfect food plan together for them so that's how we typically are starting it for people that aren't patients yet um we don't have the mechanism yet to recommend\nFood for you because we don't know enough about your body to tell you what you should or shouldn't do so I don't make recommendations\nUm unless we actually see patients and you know get your blood testing done so the food plan is already in place started it impatience are getting great results with it but again I most important ideas that it's the only food claim it has all of this good information about you even before you start to food\nSo testing your vitamins and minerals your hormones whether or not you might be allergic to whether or not you're digesting are absorbing well so that makes the food plan perfect\nThat's aspect that found that sounds wonderful\nYeah I mean you couldn't get a better way to do a food plan or\nWe'll plan or die because we're covering every part of your body record every company out there that advertises on TV and they just make you buy food or get you to go to a center and talk to people in need food and buy their ... you know it's just there's no comprehensive medical nutritional part of it and that's what this is about\nWhere I think this is the most the most the best way to do it\nSo I'm a full plan you reckon that I'd like to clear on how that work again\nWell when I was sitting with you in the office than you want to set up the food plan I go with you how to read the menu and you check off the food that you want so ah the way that it goes is there's these boxes that have you know you can pick whatever you want for breakfast 'em and you pick the boxes that would be a day's worth so lunch and dinner\nSo the vegetable for one of the lunches would be spinach and then you can pick chicken turkey a organic by sending et cetera et cetera there'll be your lunch and then your dinner\nYou'd pick another vegetable with another protein so it's just a a format that helps people understand what they're getting it also helps the people that are prepared to set for you\nBut it takes a minute for me to explain how to check often in order to foods\nAre lights up yet there\nAre a place to purchase food or now\nA no not yet this is only being down through the office at president yeah\nWell you go by your on your otherwise that's wonderful in other words it gives you a\nGreat company will deliver the food's directly to use so once we know what you should be eating your vitamins minerals hormone yeah then you could order the food and they delivered to you\nOr I can correct yes ma'am oh\nThank you so much for your call have one more call to get so they want to cut you off but let's go to a pro in Manhattan said Hi there how are you\nHigh tax capital is am I wondering is there any impact on lack of a hot car using stem cells\nIt's hard to say because I haven't seen a huge clinical trial protocol for macular pucker\nWe do have a patient who has macular degeneration who had lost color vision and overhead central vision that had declined\nUh we recently did a video on her because she had a terrific result her color vision is back she's able to see a line to be able to write on that line uh that will be up on the website over the course of the next couple of weeks\nOr because everybody has different types of damaging their body you know with no medication or a doctor can say Oh yes this will definitely do this or that or with no process of doctors who say yes you're back surgery will come out perfectly\nBut when you're using your own cells to create repair those does that go with in your bloodstream can get to wear your blood flow goes stem cells get up off the train to get your tissues set up shop and make new cells so I think this stems cells can get to really any part of your body to the blood\nBut if you're looking at the videos on my website you'll see people that have had wonderful results with it should be up soon\nIt you will have it out than because I was up for it and ... okay you know we don't have the video a week or so ago so oh I see so much for your call\nOkay friends thank you for listening to the program today\nA God Bless you all have a wonderful day I'll be back lived tomorrow from six to seven here on the amazing WABC give us a call the office five or six seven nine four zero four zero for and the websites Dr ... met when he was five or six for three three three two three two and we'll talk to you tomorrow but minor\n[noise]\n\nProgram was sponsored by cc medical services views expressed by the preceding programs are those are the laws are not necessarily the opinions of Seventy seven WABC or humility media\n[noise] guy a dot com\nAccused serial bomber jailed Trump angry at media I'm Christopher cruise\nFifty six year old Cesar ... former amateur bodybuilder DJ and stripper devoted to President Trump woke up in jail this morning facing federal charges of sending pipe bombs through the mail to at least Thirteen prominent Democrats corresponding to touch with Jens says they are that financial problems in a long history of arrest\nYou know the thing is don't wait start to al ... properly now\nYeah I think that's what this week was it was a wakeup call to whether you're taking too much risk in your portfolio are not enough and it's time to rebalance at risk you know against their goals because we're always constantly rebalancing against certainty in uncertainty is there anything you're uncertain about today right\nMe I think about everything like it's hard to go outside your door without worrying about you know if it's your turn the news on right in and then you forget it you're uncertainty goes up by you know at least ten fold\nYeah I mean you know I sat down before today show and made a list of things that I'm uncertain about and I'm up to fifty and I'm sure I'll get to a hundred and five at the time we're finished there's never any certainty here's what certain time passes and markets operate and you can't control either of those facts\nSo you have to have a plan you have to have a strategy to deal with the inherent volatility of life\nYeah and I think that's where we talk a lot about having an all whether portfolio meaning that you just want to have a portfolio is prepared for what ever could happen you know I think there's a lot of emphasis on\nWell we think too that interest rates are going to go up for the U.S is going to be the best place to be it's a fool's strategy because you don't really know if that's the case and it may not play out that way and it usually doesn't play out the way you think is\nSo I think you have to have a strategy Bob it's almost like just in case right just in case the U.S doesn't do as well just in case the markets an all time high and then all of a sudden it does swoon and October argue protected are you prepared for that\nYeah it's not about being right or wrong writes about being invested for total return strategy so you know it's just a diversification is a key that's where you have some certainty and you want to have a strategy that's tied tested you just don't want to take more risk than necessary\nAnd most people do but if you're feeling in your portfolio today then that means you probably are\nYeah and it also reminds me of another metaphor Bob ... a a bad apple spoils the whole barrel\nAnd I think that has a lot to do with how are you allocate it right now and I think one of the big problems is you're getting close to retirement and you're relying on your portfolio going up at the stock market every year that's a really bad strategy as again you can see what the market goes down that can have a detrimental effect on your entire financial life\nJust having a portfolio strategy that's solely dependent on appreciation of the markets\nYeah I call those one trick pony Dr seen it over the years one of the advantages that we have\nIs dealing with thousands of people and and meeting with people every week as we see you know where people are putting too much risk right there's you know it's been in saying trade right before was was energy stocks nobody calls the about a little stocks and they were ... were a big hot area years ago but you've been warning every\nOn for months about the fact that there's too much large company grows up too much technology in their portfolio and now it's coming home to roost\nYeah exactly you're probably feeling the pain no pun intended being her last name\nYou're probably feeling amplified right now if you've owned the hottest stocks in the market because the laws of the market are whatever goes up the most eventually comes down to most so it it's just one of those reasons reminder of okay maybe you're getting close to retirement or you're in retirement right now\nAnd do you really want a portfolio that that the whims of the market and the ... of the market can be extremely violent tile or you've got to build a portfolio and start thinking about do I want a poor boy that's consistent and reliable and it's not just dependent on one or two variables\nIf you're thinking yourself right now I Need a real plan that's tied to my goals that's not dependent on big market fluctuations here's your shot to do it if you were in the next ten calls you have over two hundred thousand dollar safe retirement\nMyself in Bible run for you are total financial master plan will do that with no obligation costs it's a full holistic real financial

City\nGood morning this is Bob paying chief investment strategist here at the capital management I Want to wish everybody a happy Halloween trick or treat\nWell it certainly wasn't a treat to be invested in the financial markets has stocks globally decline across the board this week on Wall street the best performing stocks leading a bull market\nAre commonly referred to as the generals and just like an army wherever the generals lead the troops will follow all the generals on this bull market had been the so called thanks stocks made up of Facebook Amazon Netflix and Google\nAnd two of those generals Amazon and Google led the market down after their quarterly reports disappointed investors and failed to me analyst expectations now there's another expression on Wall street that all markets revert to the me\nLike a rubber band that's been stretched too far it must be relaxed in order to be stressed again this is exactly the same for stock prices back to get over extended in one direction whether up or down always return to their long term average\nNow with Amazon up over eighty percent earlier this year it was time for this general to return to its me\nNow the rest of the market or the troops wasn't up to eighty percent this year and with this pulled back in October valuations of only become more attractive but yes in the five hundred now trading at a much lower P. E. than we were just the beginning of twenty Eighteen and us economic growth\nCame in at three and a half percent for the third quarter much better than expectations\nThe stock market corrections well they're unpredictable their temporary and they're part of the natural order of a healthy functioning market\nThis is the fourth longest bull market and the second longest economic expansion in us history now since the birth of his bowl way back in two thousand and nine we've had pulled back almost every year that corrections of sixty percent Ninety percent twelve percent Thirteen percent and most recently ten percent\nAnd the only year that we didn't have a pull back was twenty Seventeen now that's not normal that's an anomaly but trust me I'll take any year where we can go up every month month after month but we know that's not normal now even with all these corrections during the course of the bull market since two thousand and nine at the beginning of this month\nOur market hit all time record highs and price that was only three weeks ago all of these deaths were temporary all these deaths were eventually met with new highs and of each correction patience was rewarded and I don't expect anything different this time\nNow if you're sitting there wondering do I have a portfolio appropriate to my goals in my dreams the current volatility in the market\nI sit there and wonder when he said no give us a call or text eight four four seven five to six eight nine to that seat for four seven five to six six nine to oh\nThis is no pain no gain now back to the show is Ryan Payne Bob pain no pain no gain financial radio Bob and I like to give you a common sense\nAdvice you can use for your own planning and investing\nAnd that's why I put together our video series what you need to know about creating an income\nYou cannot outlive it's just a great bass line\nTo get the planning process started you can download it for free simply ... the word bullish\nThat Bush B. U. L. L. I. S. H. the five five five eight eight that's the word Bush text it to five five five eight eight eight what you need to know about creating an income you cannot outlive it's just a great bass line to get started mate to financial\nPlanning process a little less overwhelming\nYou can text the were bullish to five five five eight eight eight download for free text or Bush the five five five eight eight eight\nSo Bob for most of us a retirement plan at work tends to be a very large portion of our networks\nI told you so into the world as we know it finally they've been telling you that every year [laughter] so it's like why aren't they are today [laughter] yeah\nThey were all these people out\nThey said you know two thousand and Lebanon market's going to go down forty fifty percent they were wrong and then they tell you again and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nBut the fact of the matter is we're in not the longest running bull market in history for the record it's not right now the only the fourth longest that end up being the longest right but in every ball marketing history riders corrections and yes no exception\nNo it's a good point I think we do forget that on average the market has a five percent plus correction every year so to have a sell off lick we're having right now is very very normal it has nothing to do with the fact that we might be going to a bear market that's just normal market\nVolatility well it is and I think unfortunately we are all scarred by the two major bear markets that we had in two thousand and eight and two thousand you know seven years apart everybody thinks that's normal where the fact of the matter is those types of declines are very abnormal the very infrequent\nAnd no one can time these things but the only thing I Want you to think about right now and I think everybody should be thinking about right now right is that when the market bottom in March of two thousand nine it rose twenty six percent three months\nIt rose forty six percent in seven months almost sixty six percent in one year so as fast as it goes down it comes back really quickly\nAnd it's hard to see right when you're in the middle of the of the sell off and all the pundits are saying you know this is the end of the world in fact you know what I'm thinking about though\nIsn't this the greatest industry in the world because it has the short term memory you can come out and say the market's going to sell off every year be dead wrong then you get ... you write once and no one mentions that you were wrong for like you know can be ten times in a row it's like that's completely forgotten\nAnd I think that's just a wonderful thing about our industry it's ah\nYou can you can reinvent yourself over and over again with the same wrong message [laughter] that's\nWhy we run the segment every week on financial propaganda to warn you against Charlotte's ends like perma bears on there all the time and\nIn the article that I read they actually lied to you about the perma bears record oh well you know he predicted the crashing into eight and get everybody back in and then got everybody back out again last month and he acts of the matter is they never get in they never invest their not investors their newsletter writers they're either sell you a book or a newsletter\nMy messages avoid them at all costs\nYeah I mean there's this funny I was I was going in my apartment the other day and in one of the the ... she was in the building and we'd like to talk about the markets and we're talking about the market volatility and she says to me well you know there's a lot of traders making a lot of money in this volatility\nAnd that's BS [laughter] you know there's this there's this fallacy that there is these these market you know God's\nThese traders that are there out there making big bucks it's not true you know there's the it doesn't really work and then you know you always say at Best Buy these traders were so smart why aren't they as wealthy as Warren Buffett and as we know Warren Buffett is a long term investor he's a buy a whole you know he buys things in ... and for a long time throughout\nThis market volatility so it's just it's just a complete mess that there is these you know these market trading God's that are figuring out when they get in when they get out it's just not\nTrue well you know the market is representative of just all the companies in the world combined you know they're growing\nThey're raising should never panic out of the marketplace would be like selling your company right now the only company you're selling it right now because simply because the prices down where if you worked for a big company or your advisory management you should sell the company now because the prices low\nYeah to make any sense at All right in companies have intrinsic value but you know the market pricing is like having a crazy uncle who determines [noise] you know each day what's your the price of your company should be one day it's worth a lot next two weeks and not so much\nYeah I Love that analogy it's a crazy uncle or another another do some a lot of the propaganda that's out there right now I I caught an article and there's a lot of articles like this mid term elections loom over the stock market like this is going to be some big events and this goes back to what you're talking about earlier in the Shabaab\nThat when you're in a bull market all the good news gets ignored and the bad news gets focused in on which sounds ironic and I think this is a perfect example of that there's a lot of noise about the mid term elections right now and how that's going to negatively potentially affect the markets\nYeah well it's just another list that sits on my list of sit the uncertainties that I made this morning ride mid term elections I been getting that question you know quite frequently you know from our clients and you know it's a great questions because it's you know it's on the news every night but when it turns out\nIs that over time the markets do well regardless of who's in power and typically it's a divided government so you know what the market really loves his gridlock so whether you're leaning left or right you know when it comes to investing you want to keep your political feelings away from your investment strategy\nWell I'll tell you crazy statistic here Bob the S. and P. five hundred hasn't declined in near after mid term elections since Nineteen forty six\nAnd ... on average his clients Fifteen Percent\nSo not only should we be worried about it we should actually be bullish because odds are after a midterm election and the thinking there is that you know whoever happens to be in power at that time is going to really try to goose things up and make the economy look as good as possible you know because they're trying to obviously get reelected at some point so\nIt actually is it's a great sign running a mid term used to be excited that's a very bull assigned based on history\nWell it's almost as if the market shakes out of the market so you don't make any money when all these good things happen you know it's like it's dark as before the storm I guess is what they say right\nWell put by like that and you in the markets are crazy uncle got some good good Bob isn't just running around in yourself\nI
