York ... need to bring radio surgery is the first in America and in the western hemisphere finding radio surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at two and two choices for a free informative Brooklyn and DVD\nHey Dr Lederman we're back\nWe are back and I'm One talking about a six year old man born in Mexico he has a child and he has multiple medical problems he has diabetes gastrointestinal problems was seen by one of the most famous surgeons in New York\nFor prostate cancer for years he goes PSA was five to six than it was ten in the house was PSA is having a half and he had a biopsy\nOf his prostate showing Gleason eight cancer Gleason eight is one of the most aggressive cancers and if he had surgery if you went to one of the most famous places that we have this information or\nProstate book but you can look at it right now which is what I'm doing page for figure three if you went to the most famous surge in America\nFor Gleason eight cancer Gleason eight nine ten cancer of the success rates only twenty three percent lousy lousy lousy and this man actually the surgeon send them to me because the surgeon hates\nSurgery for prostate cancer because he knows the truth you know as a prostate cancer surgery usually leaves the ban impotent incontinent and often with recurrence cancer\nThis data that's page ten of our book from Harvard Medical school showing sexual problems after open surgery or robotic surgery removing the prostate\nNinety seven percent\nUrine or probes which means most commonly leaky the urine more than eighty percent after open or robotic open surgery mean someone's hands are in your body robotic means there's that gives me about what this man has a high risk cancer why is it a high risk\nBecause as PSA the blood test is more than ten is Gleason score is\nEight these high risk you came to us\nAnd they can tell you that they came to me\nTwo years ago sent by one of the most famous surgeons in New York\nAnd why did he come because he wanted better treatment he wanted to keep a sex life you wanted to keep his urinary life you wanted to keep his life\nAnd I saw him this week and the answer is is PSA is zero is in remission with our achievement only only our treatment pinpoint non invasive treatment\nOur treatment only his ex wife works is urinary life works He is happy he is doing well he is content\nAnd this most probably would not have been his story iffy had opened a robotic surgery\nSo lots of things to think about why does so many men come to us with prostate cancer because they want the best possible results and speaking about prostate cancer another man Seventy three years old from Trinidad\nConstruction worker pipe fitter was married with three children came with his\nWife he went to one of the other hospitals they found a PSA elevated the eight hundred and forty five yeah you heard right normal PSA prosthetic specific antigen as for his was eight hundred and forty five\nIs painted the hip

little better that would have been to come to see us years earlier about prostate\nAnd many men come to us for prostate check out many women come to us for breast checkup for good reasons they want the best possible care\nSo he didn't know what hit him he thought he was a meal I guess that comes with a PSA eight hundred and forty five is scans would show ... lymph nodes and the power of us in a regular prostate he's got\nFlowed out of his lungs as X rays of his chest show phone metastases as a deformed ribs probably metastases and terrible pain\nAnd we got to buy but he was at the big

or maintain your home you come to the right place how smart radio up next I'm Seventy seven WABC\nDiet dot com\n\nRecovery in Florida search in Turkey I'm Christopher cruise\nPeople in Mexico Beach Florida on the Gulf Coast say they barely lived through hurricane Michael this week hurricane came ashore on Mexico beach Wednesday as a category for storm it destroyed some homes moved others out their foundations and sent debris flying\nAnd this year is a perfect example we had a ten percent correction at the beginning of the year on the same fear interest rates are rising and then the market went on to new highs so you know your point about these corrections don't last\nThat long so it's like if you will take advantage of it while it's here you're gonna miss the boat\nBut every time there's a correction ride a thing that comes out immediately is fear and uncertainty and the four most dangerous words in the history of investing if they are different this time why does everybody always feel that it's never going to go back uh\nI mean I think that's ... that's why we do a soul segment on financial propaganda of writes dear cells and I mean that's why it's so hard to be a long term investor let's face it I mean the market has done phenomenally well over our lifetime or parents lifetime their parents lifetime you\nJust had to be in but it's because we have this volatility along the way and we're only makes it worse is the financial media only make to second guess yourself and only creates the kind of fear when ironically that's when you should be buying when all the fear is is being talked about and emotions are running high\nWell just blows my mind I mean I have financial news on all day long because you're on all the time so I Want to see you on national television but\nYou know they have all these analysts they come on they're telling you about what to buy now except for when the markets at a better price they're saying oh you can't catch a falling knife or be careful and maybe you should take some profits you're a gym Kramer was telling people that maybe is still a profit don't be afraid to take some nice and everything's about not investing\nSo but I always market correction you know it's so easy for us to say you know do become fearful you know stay the course it's the right thing to do you know it's really hard when you feel the markets are so volatile but you know here's my advice rye slow and steady wins the race that's all the winter's\nYeah neutral words misspoken pops a coach on that later that was so good\nBut I also think you know the other thing this is a good reminder that your asset allocation may be too aggressive right now if you saw the market go back this week and you saw your portfolio with outsized volatility it might be a sign that you're probably not position properly and we've seen this a lot you\nKnow people that have come into our office where\nYou might be getting close to retirement or in retirement now and if you're poor ... has like eighty percent in equities this is why it's not a good idea to have that much money in the market when you're getting close to retirement a new retirement because\nNo one would have predicted this week the market was going to sell off the way it did let's face it all the news has been very positive Bob so something like this really came out of left field and that's why you can't predict the stuff ahead of time and you already have to have a portfolio that set up are geared towards retirement\nYou know the same message we send out every week where I you can't predict you have to be prepared and a short large company growth dominated by technology it's been a big winner over the last ten years but\nIf you have too much of a good thing as you found out this week it turns into a bad thing it's always good to be proactive in rebalancing your portfolio making sure that you don't over concentrate at any one area we talked about intel back in two thousand and you know the month before a top was a twenty percent\nBut a month later they had you know little negative outlook on on their business and\nOh you're the company dropped in half yeah last four hundred billion dollars in one day\nWas that reminds me of Bob because that was the second largest stock in the u._s. stock market that time Amazon today is the second largest stock in the u._s. stock market today and same thing it had a huge valuation it was a very expensive stock\nJust like intel wise and let's face it I mean as I keep going up here it's come down a bit in the last week there's no reason why that stuck couldn't go down by half\nAnd still be overvalued versus the market it's very conceivable and you have to start thinking about those things\nWhile you have to start to selling at a hundred and fifty five times earnings which means that the way overvalued lesson to grow a lot you know become the value that it is today unless I check doesn't pay a definite that's good stuff out yep\nWell just a change gears there for a second down to press about Amazon\n[laughter] I found an article\nThis week Bob ... you know it's hard to believe that Wells Fargo was in the news again and it's not good news there PR firm should be fired [laughter] like that doesn't have bad new they don't have news at all\nAnd recently they were sued by a farm owning family and they were sued for breach of their fiduciary duty at a lawsuit that alleges that a Wells Fargo advisor engaging churning life insurance contracts racking up over five hundred and Ninety seven thousand dollars and commissions\nFor himself and his employer leading to financial harm for this woman who wasn't that financially savvy and I think this is a big deal because I've seen a lot of his lately I've seen a lot of insurance products being sold\nNot bought sold and the broker or the visor gets a big commission and a lot of times these insurance contracts Bob are really not appropriate for your situation\nThat's probably have with with the White House in banking industry they're\nThe people that work there are called producers right I mean it's like it's your big producer and what are they producing commissions they're not produce Sherry's which you have one in registered that's been advisory firms like ours is your salespeople and they get their name up on the board if they produce a lot\nSo the culture dictates that you know the person who sells the most gets her name on the board and they get all the recognition and of course their manager or the overseer gets promoted based on the amount of production that comes out of that office so it's really a bad strategy for for him to have because it really does promote bad behavior\nYeah I don't think I Want I don't think so and caught a producer as my ally [laughter] you know it's like it just sounds like they're coming at you with the you know you're in now and they've got a hammer [laughter] it's ah it's just you know one one after the other there I mean that's it's just such a bad connotation\nAnd you know to your point Bob\nLook the world has changed a lot in the financial services world has changed dramatically over the last couple of years and you really need to understand the person you were working with are they really are produced Sherry and you need to ask that question point blank\nIt's kind of a buzzword in the industry right now but for do sharing means by law you have to act\nIn someone's best interest not having the opportunity to work with someone who's a fiduciary in this day and age I have to say is it's going to be shame on you at some point it it's just the opportunity is so great now to work with somebody who cannot and your best interests and you should do that\nAnd if you're thinking yourself I Need a fiduciary I Need someone who can act and my best interests I Need to make sure that I have the right asset allocation in these ... markets to
