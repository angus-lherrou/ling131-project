morning here on it catches corner\nA couple of weeks ago at the hospital we had an outstanding speaker Matt Cooper from University of California San Francisco talking about the new ways of screening for prostate cancer he's an expert he's a professor of neurology and he came out to speak [noise]\nOnce a year we have a big visiting professor or lecture ship and Matt Cooper came out and really was I I told them myself as this was the best prostate cancer lecture I've ever seen it was unbelievable\nAnd it was nice to see and hear him talk and confirmed a lot of the things that we're doing here and why you went through that's being done a out at a other medical centers and clearly as I've mentioned cheer on chapters corner before the\nUh the TSA controversy and a lot of the urologist that are involved in this again deal very strongly as I Do myself about continued screening because he mentioned in you know he has access to the national\nData of prostate cancer and he himself has said that now that some of the doctors are not using\nTSA regularly we're starting to see more men come in with medicine static advanced prostate cancer\nI mean that's horrible I mean and some of the recommendations that have been made\nYou know a ... to not screen or men that are even over the age of sixty nine and I I think that there is a role for that especially men that are healthy that aren't don't have any other significant medical problems\nAre and we're starting to see now men that are coming in and the seventies eighties that haven't been screen that are coming in with the essays in the hundreds\nI mean and you know those patients are gonna wind up with disease and the bone is gonna be bone pain is going to be bone fractures\nSo come on I mean you know we need to do a better effort here and to broadly state\nThat we shouldn't be screening men over the six going on at least the you know the United states preventative task force which ... originally came out I think it was two thousand eleven two thousand twelve and said\nNo one should be screened now they've changed their recommendation and say well you know between the ages of fifty five in sixty nine okay we have to we can screen man and have a ... you know a long discussion with men about ... discussion about the risks and the benefits of screening for prostate cancer\nBut I think it's clearly needed\nAnd has made a huge impact on so many men and end their lives one eight hundred and forty WABC is the number one eight hundred eight for eight to nine to to to\nUh over the summer at the end of the summer I was invited to give a lecture in Paris which was wonderful and actually got to go this time too and I hadn't been before to Normandy which if you haven't been a is an extraordinary experience to experience something\nIn our history the biggest battle ever in our history\nA and you know just very moving and emotional so I spent a day out in Normandy\nAnd then I was asked to give a lecture on a focal cry oh therapy which is a modality that I've been using in a in the practice year and I was using it before I came to to winter if I was using it at Columbia and um it\nHas been now accepted and the idea of not treating the entire goal and we do this for kidney cancer we do harsh on the front of me what we can just take out part of the kidney [noise] uh and then\nHe would not using it for prostate cancer\nAnd it's really turning out quite well and there was asked to go over there and are in Paris and talk at the end do you ... society meeting it's an out patient type of a procedure where\nWe can now place very thin needles into the area of the cancer and a blade or kill it using coal technology using it are gone gas\nAnd we can do this for patients that have had prior radiation and have a recurrence in one area or if you've never had any treatment at all\nOr or if you've had a radiation for other conditions maybe Colin rectal cancer and can't have additional radiation it certainly can work out quite well it's an outpatient procedure is covered by now by all the insurance carriers including Medicare\nTakes about an hour to do [noise] um and it's really

Twitter I teams or wherever you listen to ...\nAnd you can also join us by asking a lesson to play the program\nConversations on houses now a ... interview with documentary ... conversations on health care\nFor speaking today with Dr Maria ... director of the department of public health environmental and social determinants of health of the world Health Organization which seeks to address the root cause of environmental and social threats to global public health\nPrior to that doctor Neeraj served as vice minister of health and president of the Spanish food safety agency\nShe served as a medical coordinator in Honduras and Salvador for science on front to\nDoctors Without borders Dr ... was awarded the medal of national order of merit from the French government for her work in global public health cheered or medical degree at the University of of you do Spain and her masters in public health\nAt the pier and Marie Curie University in Paris she received an international diplomacy in emergency preparedness and crisis management from the University of Geneva Dr ... welcome to conversations on health care\nThank you very much you know the world Health Organization told the joint session with the United nations addressing report that garnered quite a bit of attention recently in that report looked at global due to around population health and pollution and concluded that pollution kills more people around the world\nIn a given year than HIV aids malaria and TB combined\nAnd I wonder if you could share with our listeners the scope of this a revolution in how pollution and specifically impacting population health and mortality globally what\nIs the day to show the figure is dramatic we have more than ... six million that\nCory ... every year and that those that are caused by environment or Fox\nWhether these air pollution are unsafe Walter or this bullshit to set up some type of can make like ... the size of NATO to arrive this is from a report that only ten years ago at the situation with dirty water ready we the the new one by one year ago almost\nTwenty five percent of all global that we tend to associate that with these\nEnvironmental pollution means respect us call me from our daily environment and we stuck to that could be easily remove which is the message I Would like to to give\nDr ... all of us who work in the service of advancing the health of people and populations are often struck by just the the challenge and the weight of social determinants of health whether it's poor air or water or food quality lack of access to decent housing\nBut really there's a unifying factor that comes into play whenever we look at populations health issues and and that's poverty right poverty is\nSuch a common thread and we'd like to ask you to talk about the connection between poverty exposure to environmental pollution and higher risk for poor health outcomes and how we can balance the need to promote economic growth\nWhile at the same time protecting human health from the harmful effects of pollution\nThere is not a surprise to any of us that the if you are vulnerable and fewer poorly if you are who are living in a poor country you will be more as opposed to ... like a\nIndustrial pollution or the thought that you are missing a lot of safe water and sanitation and you will be more exposed to questions related to a\nA climate change and global warming and the basics for your health\nNow each scared as well that uh in order to have they could not make a development that you need to think these people out of poverty you need to do it on our way yet that you will not destroy that that that that that environment where you're living on and we see that now for instance\nIn China which was one of the countries that were polluting the malls and responsible for\nFor ... air pollution that was affecting the lungs of they've seen these and now they've realized that you can go for that\nGoods and ... to ... development we felt\nDestroying them polluting the water you drink or the air you breathe so I think this is the key message\nGet people out of poverty you can do it on a sustainable way that will be even weaker on their way that you think people out of poverty they will not be as opposed to do so incredible uh risks called me and from pollution we saw children now or eating in many countries in Africa\nRecycling a lead from Carter by dirty is\nThat really bothered development and this is really polluting the next generation and\nI think understanding the role that this social economic and environmental it there is a far where health place effect critical one for governments for ... cents and of course for people working on global health in global health gr\nSuckered near a climate change is also exact a toll on human health and this year we've seen widespread devastation here in North America from back to back hurricanes\nWe've seen deadly wildfires as well and mudslides have destroyed entire communities in the wake of those devastating fires so we're getting an uncomfortable dose of climate change reality here and as you assess climate change around the world how do you view the growing threat to human health\nFor us at the world Health Organization and know the synthetic organizations\nWe have a plane ... demonstrating that the global warming and climate change is really devastating human health as well\nNot only because the heat waves and the slides and droughts or we have a very direct threat contribution to to death because they take human lives\nBut this will be colas of their situation that they we create the climatic effects on the culture for instance the race in temperature up to see this responsible for changing the part that is of rainfall and therefore they we are expecting decreases some grownups\nA yellow sing many developing countries we will have a major demand to food supplies we're already seeing the programs of modern ... if I could a cultural production caused by these\nDirect or ... the effects of climate change and global warming of course if you have to fly you will destroy your life but you will destroy shelter you will force people to go on migration and mean and displacement\nAnd we see as well that many of these pieces that have been representing on the lookout for\nHandling and monitoring our waste production better energy for the building the insanity of fish and a non polluting fuel is uh\nSteel production that would not affect or wherever the pollution in the places where we live that is a big challenge to gather we've known communicate with Lucy says I think ... fired on mine have and don't communicate with diseases are the big challenges we're facing and\nWe need to go next to all of those within the sustainable development in bottom to climate change and so\nWe've been speaking today with Dr Maria ... director of the department of public health environmental and social determinants of health\nAt the world Health Organization you can learn more about their work by going to W. H. O. dot org or followed them on Twitter at W. H. O. or at Dr Maria ... and that's an E. I. R. A.\nDr ... we thank you for the work that you do and for joining us on conversations on health care today I thank you very much\n\nConversations and one of the audience to be true you know when it comes to\nHealth care reform policy was winning journalist and managing a war zone tortoise known amateur promoters but in terms of destruction you were told to learn from\nThe mid term elections are less than a month\nAway and we are seeing ads on healthcare in several races for instance in the tendency Senate race a democratic ad from the group majority forward spins the facts and claiming that representative Marsha Blackburn voted quote to give members of Congress healthcare for life\nIn fact lawmakers already had received a health insurance retirement benefits before the twenty twelve vote in question there was a possibility at the time that lawmakers could have lost to the benefit but that never happened\nThe vote was actually to repeal the Affordable CARE Act when the health care legislation was being debated an amendment by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley was added to require that members of Congress and their staff get insurance coverage through the a C ... exchange it\nAs opposed to lawmakers continuing to get insurance through the federal employees health benefit program the idea behind ... amendment was that if the exchanges were good enough for other Americans they should be good enough for Congress federal\nEmployees can keep their health care coverage once they retire provided they are eligible to retire and had at least five years of F. E. H. B. coverage immediately before retirement or coverage for the entire period of their service\nBut once the AC a within acted in twenty ten it required members of Congress to eventually moved to the ... exchange it which held the first open enrollment period in late twenties Thirteen it looked like lawmakers would lose their health insurance retirement benefits\nSo when House Republicans voted to repeal the law in twenty twelve Democrats made the argument that the vote would reinstate the benefit for Congress\nA few months before the AC a exchange coverage would take effect\nThe office of Personnel Management issued a final rule saying that lawmakers and their staff would still be eligible to join the federal health benefits program and retirement provided they had five years of continuous coverage through either the F. E. H. B. or the AC a exchanges\nThe ad doesn't mentioned that eligible lawmakers had this so called healthcare for life benefits before the CIA and they still have it today and not to my fact check for this

and you're really in the United states a quarter of the routine at least ten pounds gain during their pregnancy those numbers go up significantly for African Americans Hispanic and to low income women\nSomething about weight retention during this period after having a baby that increases lifetime risk of health problem cardiovascular disease and metabolic problems so\nI was interested in finding a way to help women during this time because regardless of how much that when the games during pregnancy weight gain during this period that is that kind of independent risk factor recall at\nCalifornia Polytechnic Institute researcher Dr seuss and failing wondered if a customized intervention designed around the Supplemental Nutrition program for women as well as the women infants and children nutrition program might help such women should post ... see\nAbout thirty percent drop out and it's no surprise women during the ... part of their busy with their baby they've got the erratic unpredictable schedule or that's really hard to get engaged in our standards this now face to face interventions so our team got together and we thought you know let's try something on line\nPer team designed a website with features such as weekly lessons or Web diary instructional videos computerized feedback text messages and mostly face to face groups at the clinics\nTwelve clinics were randomized to the WIC program or the standard care group or the WIC program plus the twelve month primarily Internet based weight loss program\nYeah so the the intervention and target as healthy eating and physical activity and then behavioral strategies and so we provided and then you plans on line that women could access and use that would\nPromote modest weight loss and we gave them holler eagles dependent on if they were breastfeeding or not and the altogether and physical activity goals and which were thirty minutes most days of the week\nAnd we gave behavioral um tools to including salt we've promoted self monitoring daily recording of their their food and take which they could do on line or we said they could do you know even writing on a napkin\nAnd the results were significant more women with the Internet intervention fifty seven percent lost weight than were purchased since alone thirty six percent\nNot only that we got weight loss and we got a greater proportion of women who lost the five percent and ten percent of their body weight which we are clinically on significant than they reduce their their waist circumference which is a health indicator for long term long term health risk\nBut the women routine weight differential eat around the waste it was exciting that we we prevented that and even reduced a waist circumference in this intervention\nDucked your family says that even though the weight loss amount seems relatively small about seven pounds on average the last translates into a statistically lower risk of later weight gain and the long term risk for related health issues such as diabetes and heart disease that accompany\nOn the other key finding as we got a greater percentage of women return to their pre pregnancy weight\nAnd that is a goal even though many of these women were overweight or obese before their their pregnancy and the fact that we got them back to their pre\nPregnancy weight is really exciting because that doesn't appear to be where the risk is when you if you retain way above pre pregnancy that the risk factor for a long term health problems severe excited to increase the number of woman he got back to their pre pregnancy weight\nA low cost guided online nutrition and weight loss support program designed for women receiving snap and with benefits for post part of nutrition empowering

quick introduction Christian ... is an author an educator he's fourteen books he's conducted research over thirty countries again he's been on was Oprah and friends and Dr oz Chris welcome back to the show\nThank you so much pat it's always a pleasure to have a great conversation with you\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly it could be drawn to you know with all the different supplements out there now Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this besides good multi vitamin\nInsufficient well maybe a few other things go into the street super hot nutrients you've been so jazzed about maybe\nWell I'm happy to do that pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called ... apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigated the is in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor Rick I've been deeply involved with ... researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza there a trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay on South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field and meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit\nAnd ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human spiritual why did you want to combine to read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other works better corner real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all\nIn separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kinda like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems to they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resveratrol\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press and you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity\nIn whole blood you to sign on to recap some of these headlines of chill me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume that don't actually\nWind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among\nThe most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on\nWhen we take in the right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are\nThe right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue the thigh bone so you've taken the green tea extract you build the anti\nAccident activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called blue to fire on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nRight let's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found\nIn the new green tea combo formula would be offering free brought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human what'd you smelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most powerful supersede on the planet\nYou can positively influence R D an AA meeting joint comfort Chelsea inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible\nHeadlines on human and tell us why you use this and we talked about this off year a few minutes ago just patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of Kirk human which seven times greater insurance\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know the term Kirk human\nThey may well note tumor wreck route which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying ... and its derivative Kirk humans since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied is this a couple of thousand\nStudies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it has a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon\nIt greatly enhances joined tell so if people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor recruit\nAnd drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that every day most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of three of the biggest superstar protective health and Hansing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm\nSimply saying that you can get in the capital in a good liquid soft gelatin capsule what you'd otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine and are now in this new green T. C. R. formula purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to you know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brain ...\nWell I especially like\nThe liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact\nBlood studies show the newborn babies contain two hundred industrial pollutants in their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning super\nHealthy very strong liver we might not think about our livers that much but we need that ... and we know that Kirk human protects the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps a strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint we have in numerous ... studies showing overall improvement in joined health and relief\nAnd stable inflammatory activity\nBetter joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk him and I like the brain protective studies as well you know I think everybody wants a sharper\nClearer mind and Kirk human delivers all this so I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware path that most people are not going to eat\nEnough rock tumor recruit\nTo get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated Kirk human extract\nI don't want to remind people digging coal now to get started with the free bottle green tea see our dirty products this is their unique green tea formula\nWould see Kirk human and the spiritual you Jeffrey bottled today just before Ninety five for shipping coal now operators are standing by one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five again one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five year old son right back to the show Christian I don't want to get to technical here but these ... oxygen green tea or classified as ... females and there really aren't super powerful\nAnd well respected by scientists but in his green T. C. R. formula there's more it's got the green tea ... human the spiritual to be talked about clash grape seed extract pine bark\nBio ... vitamin C. you talk to me about this is ray of really super anti accidents poli funerals for this one\nWell yeah I won't say that we kind of went over killed but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here\nGrape seed extract and pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds\nThat not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for\nExtra boost in antioxidant activity but also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the curriculum and then there was there a trial the bio flab annoyed and hence\nThe overall activity of vitamin C.\nAnd vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen if we put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C.\nWe realized that we would have an orderly superior formula and just to reiterate pat\nI Want people to experience dynamic health I Want people to feel great this formula the

his complimentary bottle today our listeners to get started for free that's great value what what people expect to pay if they bought all these separate room store\nWell I think if they bought high

green tea see our formula and they still wouldn't get the grape seed extract they still wouldn't get the pine bark extract the ... the vitamin C.\nAnd Chris what kind of results people expect to see what can they expect to see a once they start taking this morning\nI think that people will feel greater joint mobility and comfort\nI think they'll feel more energy because these ingredients also help to stabilize and maintain natural healthy blood sugar control I think they'll have more sustained energy throughout the day and I would just suspect that people will have an experience of greater vitality\nWhen you detoxify the body when you have a more highly functional immune system\nYou just feel more energy and better overall it's kind of you know like those days when you get up and
