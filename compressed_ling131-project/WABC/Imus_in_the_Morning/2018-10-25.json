I don't know that wants to make Trump and his administration look even worse\nLess than two weeks before the midterm\nIt's possible nobody knows and the people prominent should not be rushing to judgment\nNow coming up you you mentioned a bunch of great guess we also had some debate last night Seventy plus we love you can actually debated does senator Menendez that got ugly another Florida potential governor's debate between the centers and Gillum yup and today\nWe're going to have but we're going to drill a brand debating uh our friend a chilly fall yes so anyway we have a lot of audio and we have a you know Megan Kelly sobbing\nAnd a lot of good flood it gives the city and I we did a Riley's pod cast yesterday and ah we kick that we kicked us right we did\nIt was great one eight hundred aid for eight WABC one eight hundred eight for eight Ninety two twenty two we definitely want to hear from you guys today who do you think is responsible and don't feel bad you're just the arising that's all no one's going to take you to task\nWhat do you think happened yesterday and as you move forward you're going to love this show today stick around burning and sit on a Thursday back right after these\nWhat are the bomb partially detonated morning [noise]\nGet old maybe right now get up to forty percent off genes out are wearing tease plus grab stylish new genes for this Eighteen bucks for adults twelve for kids and old navy and old navy dot com valid ten twenty to ten twenty eight select styles lonely\nA lot a lot more so as widely Lynn Good men but not kill recall stopping by today we open the show with yesterday's events in New York City\n... we both said that we don't know what happened who did it we don't know what might feel you know stand by it is that but what could be a cycle on the left to be a politician I don't know but somebody on the left orchestrated this to make Trump and the Republicans look even war is just a couple of weeks before the ...\nI really just don't know who did what I just do not know but a lot of times you do have to ask yourself who benefits that is where you have to ask yourself but uh\nAnd it could be a a nut cake a toothless Grover down in a you know or or some some guy like what's the Unabomber was probably a good type like that and an Appalachian as I said or it could easily be some CNN and boy\nWell look you saw my tweets and we opened the show together I didn't say hey this was somebody on the line I made a very good I have no idea who it is so right it's just\nThat's what we do which everybody speculate and not out there this what they call false flag a theory\nWhich is essentially a hoax theory is out there that that they did that just to make a different thing to give the Democrats an issue that get this stupid caravan it's hurting them off the ... the erase the cabin on memory and habit that these are crazy right wing Republicans that terrorists and don't vote for that\nOne of these bombs that have gone off Bernie and God Forbid I mean God Forbid\nHillary or Iraq or somebody got hurt or God Forbid even die God Forbid\nThen I Would never ever ever in a million years even hypothesize as to who may have done it but when you got six bombs in different places and none of them detonate that says to me that this was more about sending a message\nYou know you want to kill somebody we saw this idiot and Chelsea\nHis bombs blew up the guy in Austin his bombs blew up amazingly all these dams on the hit list and none of these bombs ...\nSome of them didn't even make it to the ...

I'm going to send a pipe bombs to different people money the capital thing was a month ago is not going to take more than a month to make a pipe bomb it very ... and by the way Eric Holder being on the list he just said the the kick 'em remark\nWas just what a week and a half ago yes so it could have been a quick ad hoc thrown together sort of plot if indeed it was somebody on the left and not some toothless a nut job of Unabomber type from ah\nMississippi law was in Brooklyn he's on line three good morning lieu\nOf burning and said how you guys doing although no\nListen absolute and total false flag lets you point out something CNN is a an organization that could not make the word and keep a come out of their mouth for three years and then when finally they had no choice to do what they did was they turned the story into you can't call these people a mob that's wrong\nRight or did they defended violence that's right\nWe have eight eight and almost president who sat there with the smog smirk on her face like a ... thing you can have civility back when when we get\nThe government that's well said well that's exactly what he said yeah her and then a senator Cory Grover general up in their faces of course the the infamous Maxine Waters you know you see 'em out their public go yeah\nHere's Mike islip Long Island online find good morning Michael\nCould wind gentleman later on this ... this is an amateur hour from the start or you could tolerate from the rich who what what true politicians would stand up there and thank people from CNN for having a good evacuation right out of the gecko\nThe blood and they don't call All right this\nThis ... this choice to where George Bush got the letter remember back that troops that were not there for two thousand for what the fake letter from the to the left side stand that they they just they just saw the time nobody's gotten hurt\nRight now we're looking at what where's the Cory Booker store you guys spots that at the other day I haven't heard anything from it yeah that's right he had these on the Senate arms are used on the search district read it doesn't do anything with it\nI'm like ... ... ... they should have been all over every paper\nThey should have been I mean if we're going to be fair somebody made an allegation a again but it was anonymous but a ... that Fox News did report some of it than the president tweeted about it but for the most part people have been silent on\nSoul is in Brooklyn as well he's on line three good morning Saul\nGood morning I think of every morning you and me through my day I'm here I don't know what am I right wing that might be a left leaning towards that but what I couldn't do it\nFor a week fairly fairly media has been covering Kevin McCarthy getting Rockport through it window has been reporting ... women are getting assaulted for him for any of that and more time on it\nThen they end up clean and half of the Congress jacket and getting shot but I don't know what lecturing yesterday by that point on that\nThey even blame back then saw some of the people blame Trump or ... that basically his rhetoric and the way he talks about people led to this violence even though he's on the same team as Donald Trump they blame Trump for his college that showed that\nThey tried to and to add to it solves list the violence in Portland these\nCrazy antifa nudge nudge takes\nYeah no coverage by say the F. or mentioned now indignant and outrage CNN no coverage at all the other ... and again don't call the mobs though don't you dare call them up there protesters there just takes exercising free speech as they put their boat in somebody's face [laughter] I mean\nThis is so anything plausible right now anything it could be again it could be some the antifa guy uh sending all these things are just the head of the election as it says because everything in life is timing\nSo it could very well it's plausible enough if the bloods when Cuomo want to go out there right out of the box and blame President Trump wild than we can blame the left and say that that's plausible as well that's right for great gas the Megan Kelly ... and again one of those guys Bernie Carrick walked out of CNN yesterday\nAnd it points rights and what we're talking about he's going to tell you why don't change the dial we'll be back on burning and said right after\nThe

is really where the militia yeah which is where she science you know who knows what's gonna happen but again I think the fact that I'm she's brought in an attorney if this is true is that probably suggesting\nShe's like basically like a Jew in a mosque over again is basically that don't vote sure please don't which is not having to make a lot but I oh God no I I seriously\nDoubt that Ryan freedom I guess his name oh they do good guy I'm Juliet that's under ...\nThis is Brian ... the one in New York City police commissioner and you're listening\nTo show on seven seven where the\nGoing

CNN yesterday\nAnd he's going to tell you why demand a porn star did such a great job along with Mayor Giuliani of restoring normalcy protecting us after nine eleven say what you want about Carrick he was amazing for this city result of bombs the ...\nAnd when ... had been anything but on the city they couldn't carry this man's job right he'll join us coming up in about ten minutes and will do the Megan Kelly stuff as well plus you've got three other great guys stopping by but well now wrap up the phones at least for now on this topic\nWas out in a hunting came on line to good morning I'll\nTake a morning how are you going to thank you out\nHey what's up all I've been following you guys for Venus I just wanted to say that I'm\nA lot of this stuff is kind of like ... and I'm not either get really specific but there's a lot of things that are to to general like we all know so she's not going to put on his robot flip flops to go to a mailbox and all these targets hearts they target that you can't even ... even if you were in media or you were in politics\nAnd and that's true that's a fact that it is to another\nAnd another thing is that they're trying to persuade people the common people and I'm not talking I money smarter than anyone else\nBut uh in general the general public doesn't understand that um to go to these routes you have to have a plan now they're trying to see that okay we don't have evidence they can persuade people to based on the assumption then we have a presumption of guilt [noise]\nSo you got to be very careful in how these kinds of these days I Would look at people who are choosing their media I Would look at people who have some type of\nPsychological operations\nKind of profile of background and I would definitely look at plan B ...\nThey're learning from all of these mistakes and then they're rewriting the political warfare game especially when it comes to Cuomo and he's talking about identity politics we all understand what's going on right now\nAll of our thank you I'll visit outlook the bottom of the FBI with all of these clues out there in these different venues that these pipe bombs have been sent to\nThere's DNA galore on these things that has to be if not video video tape or wherever they went to mail them exactly or is it just fingerprints from a taping up stuff right and DNA of course yeah so the FBI has to act fast\nThere's gotta be they I mean if if they want to\nRehabilitate themselves from the bad image they have right now this is talk of good find out who did it and clear this up quickly before the election\nHere is Dan and duchess county on line three good morning then\nI was going to say something along that same vein I mean I have a I have a video camera at my house I live in a while junction can you tell us your story doesn't have a video camera\nLike Hillary and bill in in ... it's actually they didn't they did they stay there for one second for the guy's point that just called from Huntington\nIt was in ... sources mailbox that he actually this multi mega billionaire walks out to his mailbox I mean that that just doesn't have well he could have actually put the thing that himself a lot of Tony Soprano\nYou know going out to get the [laughter] doesn't have\nAny almost got shot a couple of times Tony Soprano doing that that's right right but sorrow doesn't do that day and I'm Sorry go ahead\nThese liberals have so much to lose coming up I wouldn't put anything past\nThat might not last my point see when I when I put this on Twitter last night and burning you saw it\n[noise] guys like Chuck Todd my friends love love 'em to the semi messages like don't go there what do you mean don't go there the left as have done some things including shooting up a baseball field which is a lot worse than anything Donald Trump May of implied\nAnd nobody rush to judgment at that point nobody on the right did know prominent person like the Blasio when Cuomo who disgraced themselves at the microphones yesterday before noon yesterday nobody did that in the in the uh baseball field shooting\nAnd they've got a couple of brutal weeks the cabin or thing definitely hurt the Democrats the caravan thing is not helping the Democrats they are desperate they really are and they wait every single day whether it's Jeff Zucker at CNN or Hillary Clinton trying to find something else to make this president look bad\nThere as a of a previous caller described that their panic strictly that's that they've got to have a ... twenty sixteen election I read ducks in a less than two weeks well really really\nDoes look that way so look if it turns out to be like ... said the group or on the right or even a shooting tai chi on the right I'm not going to be surprised I'm not going to be surprised but right now oh my God just a secular like Donald Trump but right now gone through my head if I say if you're you're gonna die\nI'm sitting in the left it is yeah\nI just like it could possibly a possibly if we want to if you want to speculate alec Cuomo and the Blasio that could be Jim Acosta\n[laughter] we can speculate troops I should tweak dot not adjusted are going\nTo get even more mad at us and then and Tom Arnold will say [laughter]\n... have you lost your mind if\nI lost my mind he spends every moment W today is trying to like tapes so Donald Trump is a psycho his crazy\nBut still one more to Mike from New Jersey you're on the Bernie ... come on if you Mike\nHey this is like a like a badge of honor for these people getting these bomb ... to them like getting locked up at a an anti war rally or something like that\nYeah well that's certainly what Governor Cuomo a felt because he was when he he indicated he got one of the bombs and it turns out no no you didn't stupid it was actually a thumbnail device you did not get above you're not on the list of victims so shut your mouth and try to reduce our states taxes would you please you know my dad just sent me a taxi so\nCute he's like sun while I wholeheartedly agree with you wholeheartedly that this is a less operation be careful because these people leave dead bodies in that pet let me say this to die and everybody else\nI pulled out all the Martin from what he does every single day and I'm so angry the Megan Kelly apologized to him I pulled out these politicians on both sides so the nearly three years I've been with Bernie I'm not intimidated I'm not scared I don't care if somebody wants to come after me\nOr Bernie at some point I ain't gonna change is not going to change our own opinions and not going to stop us so I Love you that I Love you to that and I appreciate your concern\n[laughter] I'm not going to change a damn thing though the loved ones will come after me\nI'm

right I never call it you know I never say a journey because my journey to Saks Fifth Avenue\n[laughter] um [laughter] you know what I call it the ride so I I've been on the ride for seven years and I have incredible doctors who look out for me and I have become really sort of an expert on what happens to my body\nYou talked to us here in New York 'cause they know they're all in Los Angeles Los Angeles right yeah so\nUm I have incredible doctors I'm a doctor David egg us and Dr Philomena Mick Andrew and they have literally they have kept me alive and saved my life in the past seven years but they also said to me that your attitude is Ninety percent of your ...\nYeah and I do not believe that yeah right it really is I think like I\nSaid to myself all the time it ain't going to get me it it's just not and I just I I I don't feel myself fighting I just wake up every morning and I think to myself I live in the now I don't live in the future I don't live in the past I live right in the now and I think that that's what is that what's\nOn a stage of fifty four below and seeing an audience and knowing that this happened to me six months ago so I think to myself I Am one grateful unlucky\nLane courageous citizenry bread is the correct what's going on just do what you do\nI guess you could say that some people just ... curl up in a fetal position and just ah you know give up but look you use your persisted I read that yesterday's six months ago you had that and I couldn't believe you're you're coming out and you're doing all these things get\nGod Bless you still listen to book or just by the way more than a loft in Studio Judy Collins' daughter of course she wrote a book a star is born it's just I don't know Judy Garland and the film it got away it's a beautiful picture book all about the movie stars board all of them\nAll four of us all four of them ... it is yeah because you're you're mom's movie was was great so then in Seventy six Streisand and Christopher sitting right with us from you know with Cooper and Lady Gaga following Dave Chappelle dice dice he's fed and\nThis is great right it's when you look at it but I\nTell you something the whole movie is fantastic just I mean they took it into the future and they made it there\nAs much as you said that because I'm the type of guy like with my kid burning them on to your kids not as good as my kid I'm Sorry don't take the wrong guys my kids better but\nFor you to be able to enjoy remakes of your mom's movie and give them credit to fuel maturity and my immature\nNo no no no [laughter] I think that when you have to\nGive credit credit is due\nAnd sometimes we don't like it and sometimes you have to give you know sometimes the devil is do and sometimes you have to do that but I thought when I went to see I went to the movie with an open heart at an open mind and they have made it there were moving them so it's still the same old story they say in Casablanca\nBut they they've made it their own and I was absolutely just blown away by their performances their generosity towards me and I just loved it and I encourage everybody to go out and see is the new stars\nAnd how about we were speaking of which the one with Chris christopherson Barbra Streisand does that rate as high as this one yeah\nNot in my book well yeah I I really love this one looked more because I I I Love the fact\nThat there were certain things that they paid homage to ah for the fifty four version like for instance one Lady Gaga for I'm not going to do a spoiler for you but when she comes out at the very top of the film in the alleyway and she has her could turn you really can't see it's her\nAnd she sings eight bars of over the rainbow nice\nAnd then it says a star is was on the issue is awesome yeah she's amazing she really lovely what is a great person what\nYour mom was a wizard of Oz of course we still my kids I mean God hundred years from now too and just there's still going to watch your mom plate or the that's that's gotta be incredible marketing says come on the radio it's nothing compared to that but I Want to do\nBut obviously ended a ugly like your mom and she died tragically you have to deal with that all the time what what what are you really feel\nAbout the way your mom died and then other people along the way that you find to be I don't know almost insensitive not necessarily giving her the credit that she deserved when she lived well\nI have to tell you something I don't think her audiences are ever felt anything but love and joy and grateful knows um when you lose a parent at any age it's really hard I was sixteen when I lost my mom wants to yeah and ... you know she made\nI'm thirty nine movies and she died at the age of forty seven wow and so it's just extraordinary the the amount of work that she left us with all the recordings and TV shows and all the film and the\nAnd we got close were you guys very ... very very she wouldn't leave you for months at a time they'll never never\nNever we were we grew up on the road\nAnd and she was the best mother she knew how to be but we are still struggling with addiction today and that's not going to go away for a long time and we are still struggling with the doctors over prescribing medications to people that\nMay have the genetic ah distinguish a distinguished of of being ... position you know there's just supposed to that I shouldn't of being an addict and that's still going on uh the only thing is it's out in the medium so I mean not a lot has changed but the thing that has changed or\nWe know about that now and now there are facilities and there are doctors and they are we have the help that people can get so my mom didn't have that no so we have the education we have the facilities we have all of that\nAnd you know ... you know that if you're in trouble All right you all you have to do is get on your phone and looking at an AA meeting that's what you need to do and it's there so that you can get you can start that journey into sobriety\nSo number two it my mom didn't have any of that though and so that's why I think to myself that's why I'm so\nPassionate about people getting help and realizing that there is something out there for you\n... the the border of Judy Garland done um\nSo I can tell you something I I just want you know on a different subject I just you know I was caught up of course you know in in the ... that happened yesterday in the city and I just have to say\nI Want to thank the NYPD I Want to thank the CIA I Want to thank the FBI ... I Want to thank the governor the mayor and everybody who kept a safe yesterday I Am so glad that nothing happened Jimmy O'Neal the police commission\nI Jimmy O'Neill yes I Want to say I mean I was just down at a you know right at Madison Square garden and I I I see the the the I guess or their armed police some of them I say thank you to them sure all the time because people just walk by them and they don't realize that they're doing an incredible job\nAnd I I have friends at CNN and I just can't imagine you know who would be that sick to want to harm people and I don't want to you know a ... it just it really made me incredibly sad\nBut this city is amazing there really are they're really really is because when you get caught up in it and you watch the police react\nBoy I'm telling you this city is extraordinary\nTotal professionals Laurel if we're out of time but but the daughter of duty goal of course the book is a star is born all about the various stores born movies and the subtitle Judy Garland and the film that got away or stores born which got butchered it's a beautiful picture book again great picture of Judy and all the stars in the various movies\nAre so low to love you'll be fined science fifty four balls tonight and you'll also be at the metropolitan excuse me the metro graph on November fourth a Ludlow Street\nA screening the Judy version of a star is born at three o'clock and then a Q and a and a book signing\nOutlier notch my what are we not when you went to Columbia smarter than us\nHe uh he is he's a very modest it's an amazing story a kid from Columbia here in New York goes on to play for four teams in ten years in the national football league and by the way he's very good player ESPN not count on me and he's he's done a whole bunch of shows and actually like I'm not unlike most guys in the business\nSo he really is make news have you on the burning and said show my son is one of the good morning my cell is\nA good morning guys I'm Glad I'm an outlier in terms of your friendship as well and the\n... [laughter] you don't get along with a lot of guys now you\nKnow the thing you've been great on ESPN and now a flux sports when you've been fantastic more sales we actually do lawyer you your\nCommon sense I don't get along as a ... a lot of guys are jealous of me 'cause I'm In New York in a better so we get upset moments muscles you yeah that is right\nI understand you're paying for a little bit of\nFun ride a trust me in a love my experiences out their Colombia's world man and there were moments where no one thought it would go any farther than Baker field out there to Eighteen stream but I Want to keep it going\nI Know the feel very well by the way a more sellers such to Eighteen to Columbia listen even before that said yeah I just more sellers grew up in South central LA yeah in Compton but\nHis family his mom and dad Marcellus correct me if I'm wrong they instilled a ... a work ethic you knew that serve you well throughout your life\nYeah they did I mean it was principal based uh uh my parents my mother was a stray too and uh but at the same time she had two kids by the age of Nineteen and my father was just a stable family man and uh they were there for us every single day making sure we had the proper values\nTo deal with the circumstances in in the neighborhood and the drugs in the gangs and the poverty and and the lower ... mission that was just surrounding us in eating people alive or they wanted us to aspire to be something greater so I had a responsibility I put that cable on at a young age man and made sure\nI was responsible my choices to get us out the\nMost telling spent four years in Buffalo he was actually the the guy that had no place Bruce Smith that ain't easy but he did it\nAlso spent three years in San Diego one year in Dallas I think probably sells was there and done two years in Jacksonville young on land more centers when your wind in the book you use the Janet Jackson has an inspiration to lift one more rent but John Jackson rice and it's\nVery you know about that man was sitting with my wife and my brother and I loved her and it wasn't even\nJanet Jackson to rural artists the finger it was Charlene from different strokes if people\nCan go way yes\nYes it was top Britain's his girlfriend so she was really my girlfriend but I say ... for the show and it was just amazing man out she was so inspiring to me so we got to that night tear wrapping the wait was too heavy are best friends are bored with say one more for Janet baby and I was like I got to get it\nWas awesome and also I appreciate you talking about the end of your college career playing Ivy League football at Columbia and you won your plan is to games and the very last game in November you beat brown\nAnd I'm cinemas hold on this is the guy that actually went and and really lived up to the Bruce Smith expectations in Buffalo and he's talking about feeding\nBrown not USC not Alabama cell is prone\nTo vote for the day week they call it the toilet bowl that's our big old gay rights so everyone's like Columbia brown the toilet bowl\nAnd a book that was a meaningful way for me uh in four team and and we were a team that was\nStarting to play ourselves into high expectations we could have won the ivy league but we fell short so we wanted to finish strong man and who knew that my last game at Columbia biggest brown and then months later I'll be playing the different Broncos mile high stadium right\nHere's something you and I share your body but there's no never forget my name's Rosenberg nobody got me now [laughter] and you would take a number of fifty two\nOverall the Buffalo Bills on April the nineteenth which by the way it's my birthday\nOh man that's a look at that connects you may not want to like and some of it I'm going to go by accountable vision [laughter]\nTo ... you know more so so you had an interesting transition from Columbia to the pros you were invited to the combine and uh the ... what you did there your big guy of course but you bench press or if I'm not mistaken two hundred twenty five pounds twenty eight time oh I mean that that\nMan I went to the combined I knew what it meant a lot a lot more to me because I didn't have the game found that people respect it as you guys just pointed out it's hard to get the scouts to fall in love with you when you're playing brown and darkness so I had to go out there and show that I was a physical specimen like the other big ... big time college prospects\nHey so when you get to the Buffalo Bills in talking to my roots may have been here you want to coming out of an Ivy League school and again even taken since the second overall not second overall did you feel more sellers men's among cause I I I remember watching the milk type of show the world months before you point this out when they go hey\nThis guy widely this guy can make a major impact\nAn NFL team and you're going oh me me\nA river those moments man and they certainly gave me ... it's\nA it was weird I felt a lot of pressure but not to the point where our burst or I wasn't the first round her\nAnd I have Bruce Smith in front of me which was going to give me runway not only to learn from him but by my time in my growing pains so I didn't feel tremendous pressure but certainly\nI wanted to feel like I Belong because I was around all the guys from the big school so they knew football better than me and I was a new player at the position I just play the end\nMy junior or senior year of college so\nI didn't even have all the technique that I didn't hold my crap oh there were guys in there who are much more fundamentally found me\nBut I was this young raw talent that could just go out there and make plays and had tremendous energy because I was a running back my entire life so being a late bloomer really paid paid off for me uh ended up being just big and fast that was just a combination that worked for me and the things started to work after that\nOne your career for use in Buffalo three in San Diego you eat you go to Dallas and you put in the book where\nThe cells when you read the title of that chapter one subtle about\nYeah that's about a ... a lot of layers but one how Jerry Jones the bill Parcells didn't see eye to eye on personnel decisions so you could be a Jerry guy could be a ... hour that Jerry guide I miss Jerry said hey I Want this guy so we're going to have that guy\nUh also it meant a were built for ourselves in terms of his enthusiasm for me being there\nAre far cells was smarter than all of us he knew that I was on the downside of my career so he was a fellow invested in that that I was on his team but he did have one of the uh the most inspirational moments I had in my life when I did it in his office\nOr you got to read a book for full details but it gave me a story in comparison to Lawrence Taylor and some of his regrets and something to inspire me to see if I still could achieve greatness so a much respect the bill parcell for the way that you always knew how to push a button\nNo doubt Marcellus wildly on the burning the Jones Seventy seven WABC subtitled the light opinions and unexpected adventures of an NFL outlining the book is titled never shut up more cell is wildly more cells let me ask you this question\nIt seemed to us seemed to me anyway the whole Neely controversies dying down and then over the weekend you had Malcolm Jenkins in every greed when a little bit\nUh so what is the status there and I know you're on smoking on this I mean you have\nYou ever thought about it so tell us about that place\nYeah I'm a I think right now or the movement has monetize the movement has\nTurned into resources which is always the goal of anything that you bring awareness to or protests so uh those than of money talks about the NFL gave up a hundred million I think that's the beginning\nNot the end in terms of their support for this cause but we also know that there's some some legislation that needs to be respected or we know that this has to turn into a true value to those people\nOr affected by the social injustices and the the powerless and voiceless that said we still showing it but ... not in a bill and still so one NFL so expect a settlement on that front or just because I don't see thirty two owners\nTestify under the penalty of perjury or give themselves\nSo I think they're going to make sure that they avoid that at all costs but like any protest any movement and he calls it have to turn it to resources for those who\nSee this is perfect not only just tell you that I Believe there is a cause out there I really do uh I don't like the messenger I don't like when it comes Saudi myself and I'm like the fact that these guys use the football field to do it but it doesn't matter of fact is you have that opinion we don't and you just did a great interview you wrote a great book\nWe respect the hell out of you could you imagine more sellers if these types of discussions\nWhether it's capital Nick at the White House with Donald Trump or any anything like that actually took place more often instead of the hatred that gets viewed every single day whether it's sports or politics can you imagine how much further\nSociety would move if there were conversations like just now between widely ... and Rosenberg\nRan a standard brother but it's hard it's on the social media at one of the negative side of it is hard to separate the signal from the nose\nWhere there is a drug we're obligated to give you money back\nAnd said you died putting their money
