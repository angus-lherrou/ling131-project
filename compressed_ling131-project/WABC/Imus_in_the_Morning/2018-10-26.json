think there's some people that have jumped the gun because it's two weeks before the election and they want\nTo make people think are worse than the president okay they're doing it for political gain I I it's a hundred percent true there's no doubt in my mind that that's the motivation here that still does it mean he's not pressing the United states\nI look I got I got a I've got a family that flick sitting there going what should we up in the front door open I think the Amazon [laughter] yeah so I mean I I'm not you know so there are people that are rattle that are angry left or right there are people that are simply Randall\nSo I what I'm saying is I look I think you're not wrong about the hyperventilating by some part of\nBut I guess at the end of the day the president and I said you have to take more Arabs than most people are this is where we may disagree and I think maybe even the president I disagree on this is that I think that\nYou have to take more arrows than the average human being that's just that comes with the job and you sometimes you have to suck it up more I I Would look at why I was critical of Obama when he would reach out to Congress bottled come after me said where do you mean they don't reach out to me and I'm like you're president eighty percent of the job of reaching out to president shop\nRight you're president of all the people say that the philosophical disagreement which I think we can debate I don't disagree with I think some of the outrageous\nHigh hyperbolic jumping after him without waiting for the ...\nYeah that's right and and again that the montage that we open the segment ... there there there were all media people and even though the CNN reporters they weren't outside if they got exact waited from CNN headquarters\nThey were having more fun they will get even Anderson Cooper an MD Cohen on New Year's eve blaming the players and the president ... when we got um no we don't have to cover the stupid ... and I mean they would do this\nIs what you're saying this is what you're trying to get bring that up I have felt that left and right\nThat people are just upset that the story changed right or vice versa that you know last week it was a trip lose two which covered in the Caribbean right on the left or the food that you know it's like a high degree like everybody is I mean this is what\nThis is why I think we we everybody should agree that we shouldn't jump to a conclusion on who did this because again\nIf you're a foreign power\nTried to disrupt us for whatever the hell of a job on around\nUm which tells me that a foreign government or foreign entity who has been messing around with our politics could easily be turning Africa\nWell that's possible I got to tell you when I heard you say that I I'm not going to lie I was like not is very very plausible Alaska this oh two weeks away from them in terms\nOf again I'm I'm not a huge you know this is talk I'm not a huge from ... but I have to admit that the one side the left has been more over the top done the right so my question to you is when somebody tells you\nWhere you say for what it's worth it I think independently\nEverybody they apply to all of my left vague the less the exact same thing\nWith ... listen I allow my here the politicians on the less I hear the Maxine Waters on the recall ... basically asking violence I don't I don't remember people going up to Bernie Sanders when ... got shot in a baseball field I don't care what the ... my question to you is two weeks away from the midterms\nWho's more desperate the Democrats or the Republicans\n[laughter] the good parts of the state that depends on the state you live at [laughter] because I think it is I think it is sort of any side\nI tell you what I think everybody needs to realize now though is it the country can gauge one thing I learned that there is people are fired up and like I was running into people I was in ... weeks I've been ... Tampa Dallas Phoenix\nAt Las Vegas for sort of ... places in the found out that really Texas um but but the other three for sure and it's funny you say that I guess I Would\nThere's probably more anxiety or anxious on the left\nAnd there is more I Would describe that feeling that way and I know right I Would describe it more as frustrated determination\nYou know a little bit of anger a little bit of like the cab nothing really ticked me off things like that so I don't know I guess you could say in some places in Texas Democrats felt more desperate frankly in Nevada Democrats the more desperate but in Florida I could probably the Republicans do a little bit so really did depend on the state and I think ... their local pop\n... every news event is what are the ... election as what colors every news event it's the cab who's going to have the last October surprise a lot of work going to affect the voters walking into the booth and at this point or the or the Democrats are all the ... and the cable news pundits we just heard\nIn that montage they seem to think it's going to be there's a bomb thing if they don't apprehend anybody and find out that it's a hoax from some ...\nI just say I'm surprised\nWe're usually pretty good at this I'm surprised we don't even have a ... yeah me too yeah I mean that's what I'll be honest that's why I jumped from one conclusion you know a

manhunt intensifies to find the serial bomb maker and again ten bombs were sent out overall looks like they are now they are now centering on a place in Florida I guess that's one post office or one one location\nThat they are the majority of the bombs went through right according to the ... the leaks that they were here and we really don't know\nWell they said the I did see something that I didn't the only member Bernie was during the break there was no sound on it was in the newsroom but we're CNN or MSN no MSNBC was talking to Eugene Robinson deer Democrats can do this you cheat\nBut it was either CNN or may have been good morning America and they're talking about fingerprints\nAll over the package sent a bite in uh the tape the way the wires were actually I'm a configure waited on the bombs\nBelieve it or not going back to the discussion we had with Bernie ... yesterday and Chuck Todd moments ago ... bit surprised they haven't caught this person yet they seemed to know a heck of a lot more than we do I'm sure I Believe they're getting\nClose and they're not going to tell us I mean they're going to get a tip their hand said to the suspect or suspect or whatever it is but it is clear it it seems that the bombs were not intended to detonate that's right it seems that they were were intended just to\nSend a message to frightened somebody maybe ... manipulate opinion right to divide us all it seems to be that the latter than the former not to do any damage but just to to to play a big head game on the country\nAnd a ... and they got they got the FBI has a chance to rehabilitate they're bad bad image right now catch this effort quick I\nGot to say it's not even seems to be it is what it is I mean\nYou know looked at idiot and Chelsea settled bombs are here in New York last year the guy in Texas and those guys won't even we'll produce a County Texas was a little more uh was better with that stuff and the guy Chelsea but my point is if you want to kill somebody you're going to kill them\nSo it wasn't it doesn't seem to be they got ten bombs none of them went off nobody got hurt\nSo I'm going to go as far as to say it doesn't seem to be that the intention was to hurt nobody but either to really scare the folks on the left or working for the left make sure that nobody got hurt in their effort to embarrass the right\nIt it does seem that way but uh but the media still they the the the we played that montage going into Chuck Todd I mean the full on all in pointing the finger at\nTrump is ... ... and attacking the media now yesterday you had on CNN they actually had these uh tyrants graphics\nManhunt for serial bomber going after Trump's targets in other words the he's taking a cue from the president that's the implication but that John King at another point uh you know ... is the CNN anchor he's actually saying well we're not blaming the president while he was saying that while he was saying that they had had a headline running on the screen\nThat Trump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber\nHe has no plans to claim personal responsibility for inciting the bomber\nThis is a headline I'd say so you wonder why he's white tweeting he's er he's reacting that say listen the media has a responsibility to tamp down their\nVictory all ... and their anger in their hatred nearby is right and this comes on the heels by the way I didn't want to mention this to Chuck Todd NBC's headline that the President Trump praises Confederate general\nI mean that's clearly implying that he's racist they liked the confederacy when they had to apologize corrected and said no he was praising general grant\n... who who go beat the south right the confederacy and CNN also\nA President Trump says that it's a bad time to be a white man in America he never said that he said it was a bad time to be a man\nIn America they intentionally or they put that white in there they stuck in and had to apologize and correct it now want someone when people are incessantly call you a racist and it's the media yeah the ... going to be a little pissed off well was it ... I Believe he is guilty often\nDuring his presidency of overreacting to certain people you know I Do too but I'm just a W radio so don't say you're just like him he does have a bigger responsibility\nAnd I do believe there have been many times during his campaign and presidency where he would have been better served just shutting up seriously but in this case and this is why would you only get Chuck Todd when we have this type of event\nOkay which really should be an opportunity to unite and it doesn't take the asshole mayor and governor in this state and city ten minutes to blame him and every single network it wasn't one guy who is only one guy if it was only Chris Matthews\nI Would say the Trump let it go but wherever he went on Wednesday media politicians widespread they will blaming Donald Trump and like I said the Chuck look when Sean Hannity came after you you went after him\nOne person imagine waking up on a morning well your job is to quell the fear and have half the country and all of the media chicken you know when the\n... meanwhile while he was being very sober and thoughtful and a very circumspect\nIn his comments a yesterday and yet and then the media comes out and like you said kick him into the you have a montage of what ... of all of these left wing or is basically sounding like they want to incite violence against Trump\nOh I I saw it Maxine Waters soak it played a homeless or go play that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nIf you had any second an elevator with either then found like pets or Jeff Sessions who wouldn't they [laughter] that's one of us have to come out alive [laughter]\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [laughter]\nI'm In the face of from Congress people\nSelling really says that you know when they go low we all know that they go\nLow we can't press our our ... our ... you know I was in high school I can take a behind the gym [noise]\n[noise] I have an awful lot of blowing up the White House\n\nHey they said that you have a Corey Grover Madonna Johnny Depp talking about assassination of president hey do you know that just yesterday the New York times ran a fictional as they just yesterday in fact it's still on their website\nAbout assassinating a president I thought yeah about assassinated I Know I just yesterday it's unreal and that and they are they\nWho else what are we doing what are you talking about record yeah you're clean like a ... Al Sharpton talked about the blueberry pie you got to verify out on your face and you're telling your mother I never had ruled Barry Attack that I Do and that's the press they got blueberry pie all

WABC\n[noise]\nMegan Kelly is reportedly out\nAt the today show and several sources say the one time and be the Golden Girls is battling top boss that you want her out and the network completely now one of those sources actually NBC herself there was a story that had seven eight minutes ago actually on the NBC News website\nIt said conversations have you gone about Kelly's accent not just exiting the shell Megan Kelly today but the network completely\nOr they will reportedly been negotiating a financial package more on that in a second but I mean it's not so shocking fall from grace insiders say the company soured on her early on in ...\nGunning to get rid of her her criticism of not Lauer and recent blackface tobacco over the last nails in the coffin meantime the post and TMZ reporting that Kelly wants Ronan Farrow should be involved in her exit talks pharaoh is an ex NBC and play of course he's writing a book about NBC's handling of sexual harassment allegations\nAre against people at the network including Matt Lauer\nPage six though is reporting that pharaoh has no idea what this is all about uh also TMZ reporting that nagging Kelly's attorney Brian Friedman is going to have a call today with the buses and he's going to demand that NBC pay her out the full terms of her contract now NBC in this article that just\nCame over the wire about ... now nine minutes ago she said twenty three million dollars a year she has a three year deal it started in January of twenty Seventeen so I mean I'm terrible map that what it's like over ... million\nOr TMZ also reporting Kelly will file suit\nIf she doesn't get her money and will choose NBC of gross unfairness she'll point out that that reportedly that she wasn't invited to a town hall meeting on Wednesday with NBC talent so she could defend herself she also point out at the current host joy Reid had made homophobic comments and she's still there she was not punished by the network\nA there are also reports that Megan Kelly will potentially mother she's going to see for breach of contract essentially finally Geraldo who is her former colleague over at Fox News stuck with us weekly he says he loves Megan either families or friends that are comments about black face for grotesque still he says that\nPeople make mistakes are good people occasionally they can do something a bad thing\nAnd he says look they're killing her on this I mean she's about to lose her job her career or you know just by people saying she's going to walk away with millions and millions and millions of dollars and should be happy you know others say look it's it's everything she's worked for in her life and her career could now be over so\nWe'll continue to follow the story in other guys want to talk about it I'm Juliet that's entertainment\n[noise] Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words [noise] I'm Sorry [noise] ah we may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes [noise]\nAnd that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker to make a costume complete of course it's okay I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume food okay\nWell I was wrong they weren't I Am sorry why one of the great parts of sitting in his chair and says getting to discuss different points of view\nAs I talk and sometimes I listen\nBy John McCain caving in to the woman ... over the world just there's nothing wrong\nIf you want to dress as a specific black person Diana Ross Michael Jordan OJ Simpson to make the opposite complete those people or black\nThere was nothing wrong with that but you caved and you have the for network which one of the way I wanted to fire you months and months ago because the truth is they got sick and tired of listening to you defend all these ladies and the me too movement when they in fact\nHas their own issues with people like Matt Lauer so you turn them all from Dave wants so you won't loud roar when he was from Fox yeah\nRoland Martin Geraldo Rivera to say that's grotesque rather sounds like a moron which grotesque about it\nShe dressed as a black person so she made herself black she didn't dress as you know with a with a hat on backwards and baggy pants on a bottle of booze walking around like some drunk or making fun of African Americans and we'll see specific person that's black\nYou're talking about the real housewives ... they'll listen to make until they're just stuck with that she wouldn't be in this predicament right now but she ... her first comments were generally about wearing black face and she was she would say black say it's not\n... I don't know what she did the fact that she did and it is it is the third rail in this country and it was insulting to a black people and the those wounds\nTo blacks are still raw this ... I mean maybe it's too soon is too soon to three hundred years is too soon notes that three hundred years it's it's it's fifty years it's it's it's it's even less of that come\nOn the twentieth century I'm On I'm ... I'm just saying to you that somebody in her position should have been aware that they're not going out of the full force and blasted defending whacked by now to defend the real housewives\nWho dressed up as a tribute to Diana Ross that's a different animal greed but but that's what she did\nNot get it did she did two separate things she did the blackface thing first and then she circle back to the real housewives Diana Ross later\nAnd I think that's where she made her mistake hey\nLook or you know why she got fired I mean it's just it's just complete no no it's true she she you're right about that that they\nThey they hated the fact that she was a a a warming up the Ronan Farrow she was criticizing Andy ... for his treatment product\nOf Ronan Farrow spiking the Harvey Weinstein so and plus the they all hate or for displacing camera and all that a black lady that's right and plus she came from the hated it because you came from Fox News and on top of that they paid sixty nine million dollars at least the nine million people are are they were cutting\nGrass and ... and she wasn't getting great waiting so bullish that she also had a history of saying things like the Santa Claus is white Christ is white that this that the hired\nHer without history before I Know that but the people there they were they were angry about it I'm just I'm I don't know I Know that this woman Kirsten Powers who used to be a colleague a woman who I Know that on TV with many many times\nShe she came out with an article yesterday USA Today\nAnd said that uh Megan Kelly was like that on the air and off the this is her or former friend and colleague Austin Powers yeah\nSo she said she was basically a bitch I I I Know I read it at a racist you know she used the ... well she said also that she's the last person she talks about the me too yet she pointed out specifically that she's very nasty to women\nAnd like I understand little white girl there's a million reasons to fire her get all that um I just don't like the fact that she gave this or this um this race paid or rolling Martin\nYeah he ... the hell out of desperation ... let's say gosh let's get fat so fat had bad mouth in here and moved wakes up every single day to find them make a start a fight with white people only joy sickly or has his own home before problem himself but let me get 'em in here and gravel\nThat'll solve this well it didn't know you got you got voted in by the way the White House communicate a communications director right other cubs guy who used to a ... which was what if any Scaramucci was his name is bill ... love him and he used to run Fox News\nAnd his wife has come out and said that uh hey Meg in a car with a bitch because of ah she she's she's claiming that a mega lied about what Roger ales the blood blood or do you even at the White House now involved in the Megan Kelly ... bills or his wife she doesn't have a lot of friends I get it she doesn't have a lot of friends but\nAnd I don't even you know I I don't even care that she's gone I I really don't I just just the way it's gone down and and for a white person to have to defend themselves\nBy by actually dressing up as somebody and be coming back person if that person is on the other lady called the other day and I found this to be really insulting I dressed my red headed son as Martin Luther king but putting a suit on them\nAre you kidding me what what headed white kid that's Martin Luther king 'cause he was wearing a suit\nWhich according to I mean does she couldn't color his face she caught up in this this day and age finally get expelled ... it just looked like a whole cultural appropriation think way too far you can\n... the fact that that your your racist if you put on his own brother on cinco de Mayo and drink a a you know uh surveys the whatever the hell it is that I get mad about or put on feathers outfit I mean all of that is so stupid\nWell let's keep caving that's all the key catering ridiculous but let's keep caving let slip the rolling Martin's or ... let's let him dictate what we shouldn't shouldn't do what's what these horrible open more I mean I don't want it to us as OJ Simpson okay\nI Want to justice OJ I'll be a nickel part of Buffalo Bills uniform and don't change the color of my face I'm Joe purchasing not OJ Simpson trial\nBut what am I just said unlimited advise you not to put the black guy to go out in public because it is the third rail and the weather you like it or not I mean what happened to making Kelly could happen to anybody else because that no just the way the world right\nTo ... thing but she did say she said black face I mean she she did say she said two different things and that's what got in trouble I but I think the people like gold and Martin\nDon't even think it's okay for a white person to dress up as any black person looked at ... I said at the cultural appropriation thing is gone way too far but the blackface thing in particular\nIt was meant to it demeaned ... fairly recently as as minstrel show a foolish characters and if you dress up as that guy the chosen that's different\nBut go dressing as a real person he didn't she didn't make that distinction ... and her her initial comments and that's what got her in droves salt so when\nBut here's why I don't get lost in the way it came on the way more defensible but you came up to ... let me just a there was a guy or a Mac ... remember the song thrift shop yeah oh yeah I like I'm On the\nRight well he was dressed up or\nHe put on a big nose and sort of hair and stuff and ah\nAnyway he got criticized as being anti Semitic 'cause you have a big nose because he put that you put that out for the economy the way up you have a big nose well\nListen I'm just telling you what happened or how you got the even the even your boy sets Rogan call them and anti Semite for doing it so if you if you if you're going out to look to demean a race or something like that which black face a lot of times\nIt used to anyway and those wounds overall it may be too soon\nSo you so you're white person I'm just a kid dressed as a ... that shit because they'll use all still to a lot of given up trying to give you a context give everything I Do not understand and I appreciate it but I think it's complete nonsense and I think the more we came into this\nI mean it's almost become impossible to live in this society it just it it's impossible you can't say anything about somebody you can ... somebody so I understand the context\nWhat you're doing is informative and great what I'm saying is at some point we need to turn the tide I think it is disrespectful to but to be black face but the trust of Michael Jordan was a Adam ...\nIs really a ... which\nIs wrong here is is there again I hate to use the word ... so it seems right now double standard\nYou had the Jimmy Kimmel on his show dress up as Karl Malone yes in total total blackface and was it meant to be demeaning well you'll be the judge just listen to wait Jimmy ... the way Jimmy Kimmel talks\nWhile he's wearing black face yummy Kimball in Utah Jazz uniform as car home alone living under the\nPillow every body out their TVs how this is Carl Malone of a Utah Jazz here to tell you about home alone home state Louisiana some time in life all all across the sky and say what the hell's going on out there for another planet phone hold on to us and all that\nYou see the broken English the wrong they just totally made to demean right totally where was Martin for that Jimmy Kimmel in black and Jimmy Fallon just just a couple of years or twenty Seventeen Golden Globes he actually dredged up a two thousand video\nOf him on Saturday Night live impersonating Chris Rock\nIn full blackface I see just pulling my point pointed rolling doesn't care about all I mean these are Democrats but I'm not proven you what I'm Talking about a double standard\nYeah well we shouldn't be okay with doubles and I tell you with it that's what I'm saying let's start to tell people like Roland Martin\nFU instead of sitting on television and crying in an effort to keep your job when you did nothing wrong\nLet's not do that anymore let's start to tell these peep when you have no you're not sorry we're not sovereignty and don't even know\nWhat would you have organizations like NBC that have their their own agenda right I mean they run the media\nThey don't want to pay people Seventy million when they get paid ratings and ... and talk badly about their\nOwn president if you happen to lean in any way shape or form right there looking for any little excuse a to a touch your legs out from underneath you and that's what they did have a Jimmy Kimmel\nColeman old he just told lived in a time when black face you know what I mean it was as offensive as you could imagine the only thing he did more offensive than doing not Jimmy Kimmel\nWas go to the beach and start touching Fifteen year old girls to asking them to see is peanuts right now but he's ... he's okay but Megan Kelly right she's that double by by\nClays author like Don ... from all of\nA brand new ...

perjury for a ... essentially lying or accusing him and falsely of rape\nBrazil have there may be some that's right they may be some uh it may be a turning up the going on I\n... the reason why it's\nVery gutsy for him to do that as it does bring the whole cabinet thing back up to the surface which they kind of want to forget about it but I think it's fantastic and I can remember once a case that I had\nA where it was a domestic violence case and it was a violation of or protection and they kept saying that my client was violating our objective was going to his wife has when he wasn't

why not rode horses white ... oh so yes I Do think that for the majority of the people who are making legitimate claims they should be\nFerociously pursued and then the ones who are totally full of

life if I may jump into the making situation since I heard you guys talking about it and did you enjoy a conversation\nI did enjoy your conversation and I I I see both sides of it I mean the truth is I Am I going to kill me for saying this but my my one of my favorite movies like really top three is\nPulp fiction great well hold on just a semi all jobs I mean what what\nI mean look the bottom on Bernie you're right my mind is the third rail but he's what's in someone's heart that really\nIn touch you know we were on the same page job I'm all of the only five seven right exactly half\nOf the rights you spend it I just said on all sides of the week it let's not evil man let's not forget Tropic Thunder Robert Downey junior he's another one that got away with that we got away with dressing and he did as comedy but uh never return and I'm going to have a hey as as\nA cultural appropriation charges literally ridiculous\nWhat I'm trying to do is provide contact says oh you're you're a hundred percent of the ... the the way the way black people feel about black face because it is it was very recently it was insulting to them recently and the wounds are still rural and so you have to take that into consideration I'd pointed out a Michael Moore dressing\nMaybe she'll give him you know the benefit of the\nDoubt Asian or is it I I I I'm not a lawyer now there was plenty but we both found it odd that the judge would admit to the papers before the trial that she's a fan well she may\nShe admitted in open court court well I was I've listened to his show look it's only supposed to be about in the courtroom is supposed to be about transparency supposed to be what's going yesterday I was on the phone with an assistant us attorney and we're going to appear before a judge\nAnd I just said listen I just want to let you know I I went to law school what this judge ah we we were we had a nice friendly relationship we weren't particularly like best friend and I didn't want to our house ever went to my house but the judge is probably going to bring that up and I just want you to know about it you know it's all about ...\nYou're not there at first it was funny but it doesn't open the door for an easy appeal or on the prosecution's part the result of\nAll I ended up quitting also is ... judgment man is known as being a pretty hard on defendants and and and of course we try to make sure everyone is even handed but I don't think he's going to be given current any gifts okay this is why I don't even know that would raise the level of rise to the level of having some\nSort of an audio like Daniel was in front of her on a Tuesday for the ... district and all those cops in New York City you're standing in front of judgment on Tuesday but I'm also in this trial a cartons Robert Gottlieb is trying to convince people that Joe meli who's already serving a seven year term he's the bad guy and Craig was a victim\nNow when I when I was there was a list of a hundred and three people who thought it was a term and victims and quite cotton was one of those victims yet\nThe price of case the prosecution had his name removed from the list and the judge came out and said the government screwed up here\nYeah she actually said that he's you use the words I totally screwed up and there's a lot more you know what that happens\nLike the people make mistakes like a like a friend who said in that clip about ... good people make mistakes and look I'm short Robert Gottlieb is going to stick up their nose and say listen you and him down on the list is the victim life and here he is now ... now he's the defendant how does that happen I mean\nAnd the ... but the judge even agree that's gotta be Craig I'm up until this\nMorning I'm reasonable doubt has to slip in there and I'm Jill you'd better watch out [laughter] I Wonder if I'm going to be on ... that that next the next two weeks and that\nCourthouse got leaves going to be on trial there\nAre the um one of the police officers who's accused alongside of\nOne of the city ah orthodox community members\nOf bribing police officers and they they were big donated to um mayor de Blasio and all the cops were involved to police officer I think have already pled guilty that trials going on I have a trial of a guy who's he owns a candy store and the ... they were going to open a candy store next door to him and they said he burnt down the candy store\nSo it's going to be an action packed a couple of weeks in the southern district of\nNew York learning you know very true but let me just give us a above WFAN because you're represented the job and then going we're talking about credit card and\nNeither one of them were convicted of anything but court and got fired and bingo was suspended before any proof I mean is there is there any recourse for somebody like a carton if it gets acquitted to ah take against WFAN around a job and NGO\nBecause you serve it needs to pass these legally you serve it

employee of the things that\nThey would I miss I mean legally there was no reason but what happens is a they can do with Arthur saying and be in ... case there were I Believe I have a tie soon as I talked to freak out a little bit that affects the bottom line\nThat's that's true and that's the difference with your whole Les Moonves situation is CBS didn't lose any advertises CBS stock went down for a day and went right back up there was no real damage done to CBS but what what ... even with with um\nAll right Bill O'Reilly dealt with that you know a lot of advertisers pulled out of certain things you know when it affects about ... it's all about money I Wonder if that's the bottom line that's when corporate America\nBut they got paid or by like gets caught and getting paid from\nAll around the fire ... cause with me you don't get a penny you don't even get to everybody's there was a convicted not all ... they recorded he wasn't convicted\nIn it it all depends on it individuals for cause language in there a contract\nAnd there is an argument that can say that can be made an indictment is for nothing left over here in a diamond means people have heard the facts and fifty you're fifty one percent guilty you're not beyond a reasonable doubt but enough to go further to go to a trial that will be determined\nIn the middle ... does but the cost things the costs thing is basically a morality clause by there and got arrested by the feds there's an issue of morality\n[laughter] but they may be an issue of morality WFAN but not at Fox News but it ain't WABC is one thing
