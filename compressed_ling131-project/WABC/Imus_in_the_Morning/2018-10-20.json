between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells that\nConnects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding the support structure that holds\nOur body together and of course we've been getting a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and\nOf course the fountain of youth Stillwater he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like a jello a type of a water balloon filled

Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue casa means sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement non drug stores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about highly ironic gas it well it took Thirteen Years for the consummate it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are going to take this to the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts\nWith patients and people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these

nerve all of these are going to need the special cushioning that ha can give them\nThere are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware\nHe found this purity joint formula and were telling you it work miracles for him why because purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called high drops that's taken from olives no pat you notice\nYou can put a bowl of olives on your table in a year later come back and except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there\nThey didn't shrivel up and waste away do the fungal contamination so there's something very strong and olives we've known it for a long time Dr Roberta Korea an Italian\nResearcher who is now here in this country doing some research\nTaxi Tyra saw extracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules do the trigger like

that whose ears don't perk up after that how exactly does that work anyway\nRight right well crew lawmaker fifty plus remember this is the combination of cruel world with the high omega three highly concentrated they should also which is much higher\nAnd omega threes than most cruel oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the higher omega three fish oil we're talking about support for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy youthful flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation ... heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that's being nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little ... oh what about triglycerides that becomes so important so\nThis criminal fifty plus supports the heart in so many ways and you know the bottom

absolutely for brain health we must must get these lawmakers threes back in there you know when you think about omega threes and you think about brain health and memory and mood and feeling sharp you really want to single out the D. H. A. component that do go\nTo ... you know what Steve your brain is sixty percent fat body weight and up that twenty five percent twenty five percent needs to be D.

D. H. aid for normal structure\nWill use this for one brain or on to communicate with another to build out the brain and made the serotonin the doping mean older feel good neuro transmitters so must must habit must get it back in there so important and what this cruel omega fifty plus we've increased the level of th have because we concentrated omega threes and they're now\nWith criminal fifty plus you're gonna get a hundred and thirty ... milligrams of da tree preserving Steve\n... leading brand of crude oil you're gonna get twenty four excellence twenty four\nAnd a leading brand you to get a hundred and thirty with chronic or fifty plus that's why this is so incredible for the brain\nThis is absolutely exciting I got to tell you though during the last real show that we did together you're totally shocked me doc\nMember civically you said tell me all the time I see what did I say you\nAnd I remember that the studies show that Carrillo improves joined comfort in just seven days now if the benefits of the brain on a higher than ... Myers up that certainly would that would touch on this study and tell us how this works\nRight right those are great study\nIn fact that's the reason I started taking crew loyal about five six years

Ropper when I read that I immediately went out and bought my first\nBottle of criminal but after thirty days they were thirty eight percent more comfortable the researchers didn't stop there they looked at the flexibility of the joints they looked at function of the joints all improvement a cold is the crucial oil advantage so if you're out there and you're taking fish oil fish oil is great I mean ... in here it's so important but\nYou're not going to get the same joint advantages just started ... you're not going to experience this joint comfort benefit that we get specifically from the

genetic test\nThere is a genetic test looking at the genes see six seven Seventy\nAnd if there's a defect in that gene then you're not making an enzyme to get the conversion of B. twelve intimates will be twelve for it to work\nRegular B. twelve can't work unless it becomes a mess will be twelve that's like standing outside of the mall and you can stand up there all day long if there is no key to open the door you can get in so realistically if you're not converting the metal into regular B. twelve you're not going to get me a result\nSome people have a high be twelve in their blood and they don't convert or metal late\nAnd then I've been told that just sitting there and just can't get it and so we always want to look at that and correct that and everybody that I've seen the thick enough will be twelve shots when they come in and once a week or so if they live nearby the office or we teach them how to do their own shouted that Ronald ... which is relatively easy to do so or have you know someone to do it for them\nThose are the people who say wow I had three for the days of energy from that shot so you know we document every bit of this and that may be a little bit of a\nPain in the back to the patient staff to write it down and I hound them to do it because I Want to prove in show how much benefit they're getting but you know that's the way it works we have to be really scientific with this\nGuy that okay well thank you very much\nThank you for the call have a wonderful day yeah I even give myself ... shots for vitamin D shots are especially if I Know I'm going to go do you know some long in in during the sort of exercise or my Tuesday night folks\nOut there ... minutes just to the area sure and those patches as I mentioned with the ... to suit but we have to make your body strong just you know to stop at Marshall multiply so that's why we you know we do a comprehensive political forward\nI add one more question sure he'll have no\nActive Hail Mary Kay or panic attacks on\nWell most people that have shingles typically don't have it right away or don't have it again and less from your system is really shot but your immune system is going to try to make antibodies to recognize itself and it wants to pop up again your body should have some ability to recognize it but again you you know I Can't tell you\nA vague comments about the specifics of your body so I don't know because I haven't tested you so realistically my patients that have had it or that have come in as a result of having it to want to do something don't get it again\nA ... that are on it and it can only on one side and that goes to like ... and I don't want to\nHave you ever being theoretical so no so that I mean is is that it lives alone the better the nerves and it comes out on that branch of the nerves all the nerves in the right side of your body don't cross over to your left that something human bodies born hold the nursing you less I Do cross your rights if you get it on the right side of your body\nIt doesn't then jump across to the left side so\nI didn't get it let's say on your arm or you know like on the I'm going to get\nYou typically wouldn't typically most people get shingles have an outbreak on that one side and it doesn't jump to the other side thank\nYou so much for your call would love to help you out give us a call at the office five or six seven nine four zero four zero four phone lines robot if you'd like to call them and do so now one eight hundred a parade WABC one eight hundred eighty four eight nine to two to let's go to ... in Roseland however you\nThank you for taking my call ... ... You're welcome or how are you ... you reach ... structure mhm and I had a day late at a price or can you recommend anything you do anything\nI'm not sure there there's really a nutritional or a vitamin therapy this going to decrease in inflammatory cascade within the research and\nUh we have to kind of take a look and see what maybe behind that of course to test people with inflammatory conditions for heavy metals for infection a wide range of things but I Can't off the top of my head and say Oh yes there's a virus or that fires so we have to understand a little bit more about what's going on in your body\nI think some of these auto inflammatory issues occur when people have significant heavy metal exposure when people are smokers\nAh when people have chronic levels of vitamins are hormones that are low so I can guess I'd rather have your body telling me what it's doing and correct it from there\n[noise] so actually you have to that's me\nYeah of course we've got to check your vitamins and minerals heavy metal levels through blood and urine so there's a lot that we do\nOkay I don't smoke and I don't drink\nWell that's good but there's reasons for why you have your little stretcher and Ninety percent of the population doesn't have it you know we have to figure that out yet to find out why\nAnd are usually you can help with that\nWe can I I don't know until we test you know they're always asking me what will be the outcome I don't know that's like asking me what are the causes I don't know until we test you so I Can't predict I Can't tell you know no one person that might be one thing and someone else that might be five different things so you had\nPeople without conditions yes and they have any help with\nThe significant unproven yes but I Can't think if I had to enter a hundred people with serious will stricter over Thirty years I Can't even tell you their names much less no no no\nWhat their results were so that's why we do the comprehensive medical nutritional approach so yeah take a look at the website Dr Cal dot net you can pull Garden City your claim you would love to help yeah thank you for your call let's go to Bob in Queens how are you\nHey back a great show a good question\nUm I have friends who swear she never get fall she never has a sensation her so she just keeps eating and eating and she never fearful that she's gone through it and I can August type task okay well\nI mean if she overweight and and that's the issue she just eating too much or\nShe does Jan and she works out as hard as she can um she yeah somewhat overweight but she says it's a struggle\nYeah I think what happens in some cases over time when people eat or they eat a lot of carbon they released a lot of insulin the sugar drops and they're hungry so they might be always hungry and never fold because their blood sugar keeps coming down low because of\nEating the car and then having low blood sugar for mental release also people that worked out a lot\nOf your body is going to want to have more intake of nutrients in foods because the exercise depletes things in your body's responses to want to eat more and every athlete I've ever seen or or worked with and even for myself the more I work out\nThe more hungry I become because of that work out so there may be two things playing a role there also when you hormones decline\nIn your body doesn't have the same ability to burn the sugar and burn the fat and you're maintaining some of the extra weight correcting the hormones can burn the sugar and fat alone with the exercise low carb diet and that person could get into you know ... and we want them to but it depends upon a variety of those different parameters\nSo I think everybody that I've seen loves carbs and over the years as you get older and your hormones dropping maybe you're not doing the exercise the excess carbon take you know creates a problem you start to have high cholesterol triglycerides gain weight but that's part of the ... and so we would look at all of that\nSo and that is football was thanking her die if you thought that\nWell I Can't get us I mean I'm not a wizard but you're right maybe as simple as cutting the carbs down the diet correcting cloning thyroid THE a even testosterone women's needs some of that how old is she\nI think she's in her late or\nWell I mean your hormones are not perfect in your late thirties that's when they typically start to drop so I Would look at those as well fibroid ... idea of one so I look at all that\nOkay thank you very much already thank you for the call\nPhone lines are open if you'd like to call in now do so one hundred aid for eight WABC one eight hundred aid for eight knowing to to to let's go next to Fred Hi there how are you\n... great\nGreat [noise] um my ... my daughter who is diagnosed with that ... can hurting twelve ... twelve yeah I'm and she was prescribed rather than taking the term lighter roles supplements muscle the trout charities that sufficient as opposed to the little\nIf it's horrible typically not because most of those people as I mentioned in the beginning of program who take oral or siblings will be twelve don't get a significant increase in energy from it because the doses to low so it's like saying if you're a B. twelve levels in the basement 'cause you never were able to get the conversion done\nThen it takes a lot to get you to come upstairs the first second or third floor so the reality is when we do mess will be twelve injections people will say wow I start to feel good and sometimes it takes one or two injections to maintain their or get to levels up higher\nBut I don't think you can get your levels up high enough to say wow I'm doing better with oil or siblings that's because I've seen thousands of patients that will do the Orleans or some legal and then when we do the shot it really say they get the energy because it's just a you know much\nMore direct does because it's going into your muscle and it's a larger dose comparatively\nOkay and how how long should one way to have people like ... ...\nWhat was most of the vitamin deficiencies 'cause we look at all of them it was within the first visit second visit we make recommendation for nutrients and usually within a month\nWe re check those things but we make people write down a symptom checklist so they may say a brain fog I have to have this or that\nAnd then if we're correcting the vitamins are doing the B. twelve shots we want them to write down day to day how those symptoms that they're feeling are changing and most people with the shot over the course of a couple of weeks we'll say wow I think I'm doing you know much better some people do the shot twice a week initially then go to once a week so it depends upon what we're working with\nA\nGreat thank you for the call phone lines robot if you'd like to call them down to ask a question you could do so one eight hundred aid for eight WABC one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two to let's go to Dave how are you\nMore than ... enjoy your program and uh I think ... ... question now with regard to a elevator proteins and I had my blood work come back on it was normal exception of that um\nI I was the protein above normal\nOr above normal I don't it was nine point in your memory serves me correctly\nAnd what is your lab range on that because sometimes the lead ranges nothing if it's ... it's nothing you know so\nI think it was six point something ticking point one I Believe\nWell they pull one to nine point is really not a big change I mean of course if you're fighting an infection you going to have more antibodies and that would point towards more proteins in your blood okay there are people however that could have\nYou know other issues that can cause of it in protein so sometimes protein electric freezes has done to see what kind of proteins they are\nOkay and it's out of power walk past mhm okay\nThey'll look what type of proteins they're okay I mean I Would probably repeats of regular test just okay if that's normal 'cause every now and then you're going to get a blood test that's not in a range and if you read test that it may be back in the rain so may not be anything really yeah I've\nUm as I've been saying this I've done a comprehensive medical nutrition approach this is the most thorough technique and testing to understand what your body is doing this is not throwing vitamins at you or medications actually\nThis is doing a real thorough blood tests that can get vitamins minerals hormones cardiac risk factors being peak electing looking at biomarkers that costing tell a peptide looking at a twelve part thyroid paddle to see whether or not you have antibodies or if any of those twelve markers or out of whack instead of looking at to\nAll of your vitamins as I say the H. E. A. testosterone I. G. S. one we look at absorption digested ability with Heidelberg test in concert with the blood test\nWe can do cardiovascular evaluation looking at the carotid echo lower extremities abdominal thyroid sonograms trans cranial see if there's plaque in the blood vessels at the head neurologic testing allergy testing\nWhich is important because a lot of people have allergies that they don't realize because the majority of reactions to foods for example or delayed reaction is so you might be eating something every day and not knowing is taking four or five days six days\nTo have enough antibodies to bind to cause symptoms and that's another cornerstone of this meal plan that I've created we know what your vitamin D levels are so we know what good food you should be eating to help your vitamins besides taking vitamins will know in advance what you're allergic to it so we can pull things away from your diet\nSo there's no diet plan that exists that as specific as this because we have all your blood testing done in advance sort of looking at your vitamins and minerals your hormones allergy digestive absorbed ...\nWe're looking at all of that so that's the best way to start a diet plan with the full knowledge of what your body's doing so that's why I've taken the time and the effort to do it this way\nOnce again phone lines are open one eight hundred a parade WABC one eight hundred eight for eight nine to to to give us a call before the end of the show\nAnd we'll check let's take a look at another interesting article\nUm let's see another article and be told efficient even talking about because of all day so we'll skip over that one omega three fatty acids implementation reduced the depression and the elderly\nYou've been hearing me talk for years about the major threes and good for brain development for children for adults and has a great study talking about or maybe three decreasing\nDepression scores for those people who are\nElderly now I imagine these individuals that they're talking about according to this study are sixty five years and beyond we have people that are functioning poorly in their fifties and forties so although I think\nYou know using age category is nice I don't look at categories I look at people and try to improve every part of their function let's go to Mary in Pearl River how are you\nHow can I help you marry\nCan you hear me well

very red and handling knock off\nHeld pan fry it or not but I have found out that a parent or a trip that will grow up more of a fight or flight allowed all of them had for a\nWhile we have to determine what's going on in your blood that can set that up I mean food allergy can do that\nAlthough some people have a a a sort of an immediate rash like that when it's hot out because they're blood vessels dilated the antibodies to the allergens can leak out of your blood vessels near ... but I think the same thing holds true for when people go out and the cold there's also\nA cold gluten is things that can cause inflammatory cascades as a result of being exposed to the cold so because it's sort of a quick thing that happens when you're out in the cold and it may dissipate afterwards but that ... sensation I Would bet I bet the farm that it's allergy so that's what I Would do some testing to see what you're allergic to\nWhere the things that you're eating or chemicals and things that you're eating or even inhale substances\nSo allergies should be the more significant underlying cause but of course as we do all this we check her vitamins minerals hormones absorption digestion will look at the whole picture\nThat guy didn't enter our task can ... can be twelve ... herring and a lot of how national thing and Tom Scheck\nYeah but if they don't know if you're converting be twelve or or not to be tough shots may not be worthwhile at all you'd have to do a gene test to be able to see if you're converting be twelve or we'd love to help you give us a call thank you we got a bunch of calls to take let's go to Steve from New Jersey Hi there how are you\nHi doctor I have a procedure for bladder cancer coming up they put me out and they go in through my area threat they take

God Bless you all have an amazing day I'll be back here tomorrow six or seven pm\nOn the incredible an amazing WABC [noise]\nThis program was sponsored by cc medical services the views expressed by the preceding ... those are the laws are not necessarily the opinions of Seventy seven WABC or cumulus media [noise]\nDiet diagnosing the\nSaudis explain jak pot grows I'm Christopher cruise President Trump says he believes Saudi Arabia's explanation\nBut journalist ... she was killed in a fight at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month Turkish reported it ... was killed in dismembered bike Saudi agents\nAnd things need to be re assess because tax laws change state planning rules change so\nYou know you need that maintenance of your portfolio and guidance to really make sure that you're always on track\nNow it's so true right that's why you need a do share a not a stockbroker and not a salesman you know someone who wants to keep lots and lots of clients that generate lots and lots of commissions you know you need a process driven advisor who's going to help you get from your point you're going to be your goals your dreams are your values\nYeah exactly right you need a partner you need someone that you have a good working relationship with well how would this Bob I've heard this statement before I went to a dinner seminar with a financial adviser and found him to be very entertaining engaging much more so than my current adviser is that a good reason to leave your advisor\n[laughter] I don't think subtly personality is a reason to stay or leave an advisor in somebody who's engaging might be just good at entertainment right so it's not necessarily the right place to be\nThe one thing you should do right now is go to dinner at the end are a broker check and make sure you're working with an advisor who doesn't have a poor track record in terms of you know having problems with the SEC\nYeah that's a great point because now it's very transparent you can see especially if you're in the interview mode with financial advisors that is a good idea to see like do they have some sort of spot on their record for things they've done in the past and that's something you really want to know before you engage with especially with a new advisor especially if anybody is like a steak dinner\nEntertained all the great things are going to do well you just want to go past\nThat superficial reality and see what their track record actually is now more than ever it's accessible\nThey like anybody could have a thing on the record ride but we transferred into ... the other day who's advisor had sixteen actionable complaints\nWhere with the majority of them they had to settle with the investor and pay out of pocket finds a you know just getting bad advice or inappropriate advice so it's a good place to start is to look and make sure that your current advisor or someone you're considering as a clean track record\nLaying here you see here Bob is just because someone is charming doesn't mean they give good financial advice now you are charming and good financial advice I Would call that the best of all worlds\nThat I don't have any problems with my record on broker check so that's even better but you know write a best buy the scammer has the best personality right the biggest cheats in our business or the people who are smiling as they're sticking a knife in your back\nYeah exactly I better do some more homework another thing that we hear often I think this is actually a very big red flag is the market crashed and I lost a ton of money in my portfolio\nYeah that's usually a sign your advisor has not been managing the risk correctly and sadly the only time you really know is when the market goes down on my protected or not so I think that's when you really gotta make sure that someone's actually addressing risking your portfolio\nYeah you're right that's what it's all about it's about a process you need to have an advisor who's checking on you on your process on your portfolio and make sure that you're not taking more risk than you signed up for\nTheir rights you had a portfolio just back in twenty fourteen that was forty percent in the stock market and sixty percent and bonds and you didn't rebalance or do anything that should be done on an annual basis do you think your asset allocation would be right now\nI mean right now you probably have way too much money in stocks and the problem is when the market finally does go down at some point like it did last week well you're going to feel the pain no pun intended\nYeah it was good wake up call for you know because you would have ten percent more in Stockton you signed up for and that's what happens when I look back at all the crashes that have occurred my career you know you look at investors who got hurt the most for people who just allow their asset allocation of drip\nAnd allow their portfolio become overweight it in the winner's right the stocks that were overvalued and they didn't realize was overvalued until they had that disaster state income in the mail you need someone who push your interests first you know what that's called ... it's called being ...\nYou got it you need to produce Sherry stockbrokers annuity salesman you know avoid him like a plague\nAnd if you're thinking to yourself right now I Need a real financial

seven five to six six nine to that's a four four seven five to six six nine to this is Bob I'm with right where the pains of no pain\nNo gain an actual radio [noise]\nIt's done it with a weekly no pain no gain market up day with a team that have Capital Management here in New York City [noise] good\nMorning this is Bob paying the chief investment strategist that pain Capital Management\nAnd friday mark the thirty first anniversary of the greatest stock market crash in us history that's right back in October of Nineteen eighty seven on the nineteenth the Dow dropped twenty two percent\nNow if we were having the equivalent drop today the Dow would be down over fifty five hundred points now study conducted at Harvard and Boston University predicts a drop like Nineteen eighty seven could occur once every one hundred and four years\nSo it's possible that we want experience another Nineteen eighty seven magnitude crash in our lifetime or course\nWe might have one next week since no one can predict the future\nNo one knows exactly what the market's going to do on a day to day basis in the markets are dominated by large investors when they decide to simultaneously get out of the market for whatever reason the market will drop and in some rare cases like Nineteen eighty seven actually crash no stock market\nActually over the last couple of decades have actually been relatively calm\nMight not seem that way especially after last week's sixteen hundred point decline and this week five hundred point update and Thursdays three hundred and twenty seven point decline\nI always find it amazing how much the talking heads on financial news channels learn so much during the course of the day the very people do it nine thirty have no idea what's going to happen or why it's happening or then really expert at four o'clock when they know exactly what the market did and why they did it so this week is no exception many dependence on national\nTV or according to the Federal Reserve interest rates China terrorists\nOr the turmoil in Saudi Arabia for the recent volatility but just like in Nineteen eighty seven when the market crashed twenty two percent markets simply went down because they were more ... than buyers back on Tuesday\nWhen the ... went up five hundred points we had more buyers and sellers and on Thursday once again the sellers dominated the trading\nStill keep in mind in the short term the stock market is a voting machine\nDriven by the short term emotions of large buyers and sellers but in the long run it's a weighing machine\nAnd it's all based on economic fundamentals and right now they'd never been better\nBut remember you can't predict but you can prepare you certain that your portfolio is appropriate to the current environment and always remember famous quote those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it now if you're\nWondering do I have a portfolio that's appropriate to the current environment is it

and caught the biggest offenders of offering obscene for fame financial guidance to help you protect yourself from making any ill advised financial\nDecisions so Bob what did you find out there this week and the hard world of financial propaganda\nYou know what I found the financial truth and I found in order to Ruth entitle nobody knows nothing\nAbout proper English or not but what it talked about is that market forecasters are often wrong but they're never and Dale\nAnd that there's absolutely no financial wizard there's no talking head out there\nWho's on national television you know promoting their forecasts who's not really promoting a newsletter were book so it really doesn't matter you know what their experience has been the future and the ability to predict the future is impossible and I think that should be obvious to everybody\nBut there was a doctor ... walk that back in Nineteen eighty five interviewed two hundred and eighty experts to find out\nYou know their confidence that they're sort of to to their predictions and on average raw you know what they found out they didn't do much better than random guessing and the other thing they found out about experts\nIs they tend to make very extreme for cash does that surprise you\nI mean you just have to turn on the TV every day [laughter] yeah I think it's one extreme forecast after another right I feel like the financial media specifically loves to propagate fear which we always say gets in the way I have a really good investment strategy and that's why sometimes it's just more beneficial to turn it off\nWhile you know Robert talking about experts wouldn't you say Warren Buffett's a group\nI mean I Would say he's probably the guru of gurus given his phenomenal track record and the second wealthiest American Me third now\nI'm like well you know what he says he says he has a process in place that guards against magical thinking\n[laughter] I was like that which this process against magical thinking that's a great term\nYeah because he says no one can predict the direction of the markets on a daily basis so he's not predicting what he's doing is he's making investment that's on the future\nYeah and that's what we forget right it is a long term game and well kind of playing into that Bob I found an article that says the big turn for the markets which came out this past week\nAnd this newsletter writer claims that he warned about the glaring bearish divergent stairs in the stock market for the past several months and especially for the last part of September\nAnd this looks so similar to other important tops is what his comments were claiming that he knew this market was going to correct\nOver the last two weeks and he's been warning us for a long time but you know I think one thing we always forget Bob is let's say the market's going down about let's say five percent that's pretty normal an average year the market does correct five percent on average three times a year\nSo someone who goes out every year predicts there's going to be a five or ten percent correction and do they actually have gifted insight or are they just looking at history\nI suspect they're just looking at history so and then I think we've got to remember and remind ourselves from the markets do get more of our tile and things don't look right is this is a very normal type of market you know it's normal for markets to sell off and not just go straight up you know markets aren't linear\nAnd I think it's good to remind ourselves that as these headlines come out week after week\nWell what I loved about my article rise at this guy I spoke the truth you know no one has to get that insight nobody can predict what's unpredictable no one can do it's unknowable\nAnd the only thing you really have the fears recession of course if you subscribe to his newsletter he has a very reliable recession for testing services available for a nominal see these guys can't help themselves\nSacco is always the cats are\nYou know get my crystal ball for you know it just kind of price on a monthly basis\nBut I think it's important though I think last week is a great reminder when the markets do sell off\nThat you need to have the right allocation Bob you need to make sure that your portfolio is structured correctly and we see this all the time now when you bring your statements and we're finding that a lot of times you get one or two problems in one day if you're taking way too much risk you've got way too much money in the markets specifically us stocks growth stocks\nWhich I've seen the biggest sell off in the last week because it's become a crowd of trade or on the flip side and even sitting with way too much cash and you're trying to figure out when to actually deploy that cash and you really gotta look at these pulled back in the market is really a nice place to start to add or allocate money is in your portfolio\nYeah I mean if you have a discipline strategy you look at these dips in the market his opportunity that yes you know from the market God's to give you an opportunity to buy low I mean we all know that you buy low and sell high but it's so hard to do it in the face of corrections if you're listening to these market rivers in other words\nYou need to invest on purpose you know for the purpose of achieving your financial goals not to satisfy you know some short term horizon which some you know market grew route going to try and tell you is going to happen\nYeah exactly right so I think it's really important especially now that you're managing a risk and if you're sitting on cash the other thing is there's been a lot of talk about interest rates low interest rates have actually gone up\nSo it is actually an attractive time if you're looking to get some income for your portfolio there's a lot of ways now to generate income uh with safety you know tax free bonds we talked about earlier in the show right now you know the ... does it come up significantly so if you're in a high tax bracket right now there's a lot of ways to deploy or cash\nIn a conservative way and they become way more attractive than they'd been for quite a few years\nYou know Ryan are combined sixty years the only hedge against market risk of market volatility though ever found his own high quality bonds that has a fixed interest rate and a fix maturity Dayton other words you know exactly how much you're gonna get paid and you know exactly when they're gonna get your money back\nYou know we've been talking week after week about the risk
