also the fact that a\nBomb and then does responded to a ... attack\nThat he basically raped girls the statutory rape girls in the Dominican Republic and also\nFront page of the New York post this morning governor Cuomo's to chicken to ah apparently to debate our guy mark Mullen arrow the Italian kid from Yahoo is running against them in a gubernatorial race\nLast look by the way ... a twenty three point lead over mowing narrow and Jill a brand formerly that lead even larger last look Gillibrand up over thirty points\nOn Shelly ... so that's a new that's New York for that shit I mean they were in before they do or say anything\nAnd they don't have they're not really held to account necessarily because of that right they do a pretty I mean Andrew Cuomo\nThis guy is is is he ... dodge the corruption indictments left and right let's talk about the show though I Know that which would have talked about that at some point oh this will be talking about it is the biggest national story of the day [noise] um I don't understand ...\n... you know knowing these people what the Saudis do and what they've done before\nI don't understand why President Trump\nIs not leaning towards the side of this guy was murdered you know it's great I Want more information I really need to know but when you consider the history and that this guy was in fact critical of the royal family and there may even be an audiotape we don't know ... pale may have heard that\nWhat are you really need to know before you come out there ... all over again you know he was so afraid to come out and attack the Nazis because he had to make sure that he got in ... in there as well well to me that was a tactical error come out blast these people that doesn't mean the whole piece stuff is going to go way yes we've made some\nSome um some strides deal with them that that is great but they clearly murdered this guy what is he waiting for to come out and just say that every now and then these people are savages why don't you waiting for I think\nHe's he's by I think he's just by trying to buy some time\nBecause he did he did develop a a well a relationship with these people any he he ... he tied together this coalition this alliance between us them the Sunni people\nAnd to Israel and all to uh to fight to stave off the Iranian Gemini in the region\nSo we have that that's one aspect that it's very complicated the whole neighborhood is a is a real ruff ruff ruff vicious you talk about the Savage is a rough place\nIs it what about complicated it took us got according to hide in Congress and I'll tell you I'll give you more to also that we have these huge contract with the military contracts\nNo two arms that employ about four hundred and fifty to five hundred thousand Americans and we don't want to lose that you see 'cause they can go to than China and Russia and this is what this is what he's thinking\nEven though the guy was clearly murdered this is thinking he doesn't want to lose those jobs to Russia and China and have rushed to become an influence over there that would only hurt or the state of Israel\nBy the way I could appreciate all of that I could appreciate all of that and not smart but you can't let this guy's Savage murder just happening and and I hate to say there's worry about that other stuff to come out and blast domain and hope that they don't in fact make all these other good things go away\nYou know ... when the Turks are involved it happened in Istanbul in Turkey\nOr the Turks are involved the ... you get the circumspect should in other words waiting for a while waiting for the facts to come and is not a bad idea when the Turks are involved\nAnd the ... the Saudis of course turkey is I don't I Know they do but that's the thing you can't trust anybody know but look at it seems clear the guy was a reform and now the Saudis also or reform is this the crown prince a NBS or I must be or whatever the hell they call him\nHe's the guy who is allowed women to drive he's the guy who said he he you know he's taking it easy on Israelis more focused on Iran\nSo he sort of a reformer along the lines of the guy that they uh had whacked this Jamal ... right but this is your mouth cause Yogi guy also is a guy who's affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood which has been declared a terrorist organization very hateful they called Jews dogs that type of thing\nAnd he also believe it or not I mean it's very complicated he actually cried when we uh whacked Osama bin Laden he knew Osama bin Laden and he cried\nA I don't know if you knew that but that this is how complicated nobody had a he he did say that when he cried he put out of state and he said I cried tears I was so sad\nAnd then he said when I ... I fought with him in Afghanistan against the Russians\nAnd then he said but ah he took a turn towards hatred ... well that's different don't forget he did say that Osama bin Laden was a friend of ours during those of us that much of days\nSo all this guy did was echoed the sentiment of our country but we didn't we didn't cry maybe we didn't crime ... pointed he was a friend of our ... and then it got ugly after what he did a I don't think anybody should be crying because when I got started excuse I don't know if I like this guy I really don't all the things that you talk about\nI probably don't like this but but but it doesn't matter I mean\nThe guy got his head in his fingers cut off at at some point President Trump needs to come out sooner than later while it's getting hot in here and just\nHold these people accountable but based on their history I just you know\nIt's not a rush to judgment at what will listen there's no ... he has every right to take his time I think the president they deal with the nonsense and do but let's deal with the Romney Ryan or going out on\nTwitter saying he's siding with the ... yeah well they don't see they don't care about the geo political ah but the strategy behind it all ... doesn't give a rat's says he wants to boycott as they just give a he he he he likes already wants the Iran deal he likes all his stuff\nI Will point to a wonder historical analogy you say their animals they're savages\nAlso with Saddam Hussein he was brutal\nAnd we went in there and to to to say that we're going to liberate the we're going to bring democracy\nTo Iraq we're going to take this animal out this Saddam Hussein that turned out to be the most wrong thing you could do it cost thousands and thousands of American lives we jumped in their\nWay to quickly and who did it benefit it benefited a rat and nobody cared nobody nobody appreciate it if they don't have monuments or dead troops in Iraq right now I mean the place is a vicious place\nSo a lot of you know taking your time is not a bad idea\nAnd protecting your interest and the interest of our allies in the region is not a bad thing to do necessarily and I think he's going to get around is President Trump to condemning them but he wants to hold together this alliance oh and that's not a bad thing\nWe have interest over that we can't just throw all cost into it to the wind\nAnd uh you know let our enemies benefit because that they did a a stupid horrible thing which everybody over there is doing other Turkish people that hate to Saudi Arabia this uh what's his name ... so this guy's another uh autocrat he's a he's a brilliant locked up all the journalists have bad yeah I heard the\nBad guy that ... that are already have you tried to Killeen his cancer on his whole family that's right he hate seeing this kid he he's gotta he's gotta ... what do you call that the the thing that had an Salman Rushdie he's got a ... ... you just can't er yeah\nAnd the Iranians are no better and they they're looking at all this and they're rubbing their heads right yeah this is great man\nThey they like what Rob Reiner saying we don't want them the enemy of our enemy is our friend as bad as ugly as nasty as it could be in that neighborhood and the same was true back with Saddam Hussein but we didn't realize it at the time we realized it now in retrospect\nOne eight hundred eight point lead WABC one eight hundred eight ball eight Ninety two twenty two I'm sure we'll give him Anthony Scaramucci at some point Donald Brazil stopping by as well

right now make the\nHe says that you say the president is doing a basically doing a bad job but not these people you know who they are we know what they're capable of and it will be nice if the president called them out to see you know that's what your Johnson has with today's New York post\nWell I I have to have to read it I I get a chance to read it but but I I basically I remember he must have had a reporter there at the documentary I\nAt the look of what I what I said to the reporter but I think what I said as a reporter is let's not be hypocritical I was also bringing up the eyes in our situation where the president lied and said that they use to spy plane was a weather balloon because they thought the pilot was dead\nAnd they figured there was no evidence of the fact that we're shooting to spy planes over there so you could\nHave caused a nuclear war\nNow that didn't make it that doesn't make it to the column okay okay so then\nWhat would they would they would have said was they said was you said you've been to Saudi Arabia about seven times and what's not being ... everybody we know these folks play rough\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely true but I but I think I also said they play rough it's a rough neighborhood and so you got to be very careful you're resident it's really not going to go after these guys as hard as some of these journals one or two so I said\nAbsolutely got to call them out and absolutely you have to figure out what to do as it relates to some level of sanctions because you have to always split the baby in a situation like this\nBut I don't I don't think that we we have an eighty five eighty or positive relationship with Saudi Arabia unfortunately they control twenty five percent of the world's oil reserves\nOr your three hundred and thirty five million citizens your population your comedy is tied to the oil markets whether we like it or not and so you know the rough\nUh we've been rough uh I think he probably left this out as well stay sanctions the assassination of a democratically elected leader in Iran both day and night fifty three\nUh we also John Kennedy two weeks before he died he sanctioned the assassination of the south Vietnamese president\nAnd so we can pretend that word we haven't been in the game or ever been in the game but we had been in the game and so my my point to whoever put that in the paper I Love the way journalist cookie cut things but my point was\nA there is a real is I'm going on in the society now you've got somebody with an iPhone it didn't even get them into a skiff a salad so for our listeners what's this give your cell phone your iPhone all of that stuff the materialize you can't really use them to transmit to receive\nAnd they killed this guy before he got in the skin so his iPhone ears I watch is on\nRecording we're in the new age of ... we kept that sugar coat anymore what really goes on in the world because everybody's got a movie studio and the television and a recording studio in their hand so if you want to pretend to stuff has been going on in the world or it's not going to go on fifty years from now we can pretend that\nUh but I I you know I think the president on a good job I have no problem being on the record saying he's got a call them out because he has to call them out he has no choice because you have varying constituencies that are going to have varying opinions but as a leader and as a statesman he's got he's got to worry about the global economy and he's got to worry about the\nMiddle class and he's not going to do much there whether these people like it or not\nAnd the also you you mentioned the gas prices the jobs here with the ah the arms deals and also uh the geo political a situation with the alliance between Saudi Arabia Jordan the Sunni Israel in us all of that very important so as you point out Anthony Scaramucci\nOn the Bernie and said so caution is the author of the day\nNow I Would ask you this Anthony you saw the president on sixty minutes speaking of a journalist what they do pick and choose and ah they may make things look like they're not even with the benefit of a editing\nOr CBS and sixty minutes or they had a hard time making the president look bad on Sunday night I think he came off fairly well in a hostile environment\nWell while I applaud his new calm steam and bill shine for allowing you to do basically you know you could go to our website Scaramucci communications plant you could see the planet we got to put in place\nAnd I basically I applaud them for just allowing him to be him that's what the American people voted for he's a very common sense oriented guy um and so when you get him out there it's it's very hard to distort\nWhat he's doing because he's telling you write to your face where he's going to do what you do it I was laughing to myself\nOn Sunday because he said I thought that the real estate people\nIn New York were rough until I got to this vicious play these are a bunch of animals down here and and I and I tell my Wall Street friends I Want you to address the worst person that you ever bet on Wall street and you're thirty forty your career on Wall street got 'em in your mind that step that person and\nWhy [laughter] I have done that was hilarious and and so\nYou know this is the most vicious diabolical animals and by the way they're inside the west wing he knows it I Know it or he even knows who the specific people are at this point he's just having a hard time because we elect some of these bozos go\nLyndon Johnson said I'd rather have inside the tent teen outside than outside the tent painting in at the jet and so he did he they're saying bad\nI Can't fire some of these guys because they're going to go full ballistic ... made a big terms are coming up next cetera each he's got wind of it he's up to speed with the fish is as that and he looks like he's enjoying it now whereas you know a year ago\nWhen I was with him in the oval office cheapest all upset about it like what the hell is wrong with these people but he's a very very bad people and this is why the American people do not like these people in Washington Valor is just the truth right\nOr the interest you know they don't say let's talk about some local politics Anthony of the color of today's New York post has Andrew Cuomo dressed in a chicken sued because he refuses thirty five days since the primaries\nTo um debate mark modeling out all the Republican gubernatorial candidate and he's going to win this thing by a landslide just like ... and the other Democrats running in the city\nBut the thing that he has a responsibility in this democratic society to go out there and give Mullen are all a chance to tell people why he may be the better choice\n[noise] well I I think he does and I and I think that you know the the woman that ran against if it sticks and he he allowed that debate happened you know he spent twenty million dollars in the primary because he was very worried about a hard left blue wave picky\nAbout uh but I think he looks at all in our already says bad guys smart he's articulate good looking guy charismatic\nAnd he doesn't want that lady's ... diet minutes of the excess taxes the bloated spent thing that all of that stuff that you highlighted in the debate and we know Richard Nixon said this in his memoirs a big state aid\nWas allowing John Kennedy debate here because it led to the rise of John Kennedy and it led to the uh the realization that hey John Kennedy get hold his own with the vice president of the United states so\nYou know these guys are politicians dollars you know you're not surprised that he's wearing the chicken soup this morning I'm just very happy I'm not wearing the truth\nThat's when I was you went into one's a little factoids I'd point down in the Nineteen Ninety four his dad\nWas running for a third term running against a guy named George Pataki wouldn't debate Pataki\nAnd guess what Pataki one just to keep that in mind if any is there and we'll just rather time here on the Bernie ... but a look to the movie moods starting Tuesday on Amazon and iTunes the book Trump the blue collar

I understand that but but but again going back or in retro no I'm not saying they made a mistake I'm Sorry they got a an unbelievable player\nOr a guy back in when games by himself\nAnd they did not make a mistake I refuse to say that you know despite the logic that I just laid off a lot of the logic you've laid out the logic Steve ... laid out the logic I've heard it ten different places\nThe giants got themselves a magnificent player they just been great he's breaking records for to can you win without a quarterback and a good running back to is that the use you know so it but the other way around if you have a great quarterback who could throw passes to ah oh they'll Beck and junior right you could possibly when Jessica\nSo therefore now with that logic change your mind I don't know\nWhat your logic ... you're a hundred percent right\n[noise] oh well thank you for that but no and sell them on so ... was out there yesterday and he was a\nHe was actually being very valiant and uh he was defending Eli Manning who you say deserves all the blame this year not all the blame they have a terrible offensive line yeah they're the coaches last\nI Would say he deserves a hundred percent of the blame you probably gets about forty percent okay well the Barclay he has the biggest in my opinion\nI can point five or six different people and you and it's on the giants but to me number ten yes he's the biggest problem oh Barclay was out there defending him and that was in I think he says it sucked seeing that everyone just trying to put all the blame on he lied\nAnd that's not the case we just got to get better as a team or stop it's a good kid no one's putting all the blame on the line sake want anybody else\nEvery joint pain nose yep ends up line is terrible ... has no idea what he's doing just yet\nThat everybody knows that no one's saying he likes a hundred percent to blame\nBut as I said they've they've won only for the last twenty three games\nHe's not losing seasons even before that cultures have come and gone three of them GM's have come and gone up and some linemen upcoming gun wide receivers upcoming gun and the constant outside of that one playoff season against the Packers a couple of years ago and the last\nSix years has been number ten vacuum I\nBy the way a sit sports Sunday eight o'clock in the morning uh WABC radio yeah special guest Stephen Smith\nHe's coming on and ah you know it's coming in today actually is going to come upstairs three stories because I think he works on the fourteenth floor one of the old time Rangel grapes scored fifty four goals the are the rangers won the cup in Nineteen Ninety four out of graves your lunch and\nWe got we had in mind that are meant that she was a nice guy Madame ... says my question to you is this yeah\nThe jets of course showing some promise there at five hundred right now Donald showing a lot of promise yeah if the jets go on to have a a a good season in a very ... they make the playoffs or boy will giants fans root for the jets\nOr not you know of course not no no not really oh no no no no no that's that's what psyche territory\nMeans atlas wings or violent that that will just make it even though it would make them even more bitter knowing that there's this guy going all that they passed on I guess it's going to be as good is going to be potentially difficulties and when\nJohn me I'm a giant fan Amazon the biggest giant planets anybody will ever meet on a Donald those great great on I'm not I'm not going to go back on the Barclay pick I'm like I\nDon't forget the Barclay pickle but it but what did you you would you would rather see or not you leave you out of it because you are going to want a Super Bowl or will the giants fans root for a while\nAgo when they have new show I Know it gets the judge of\nMets fan I was working for the Yankees when I got into fight giants fans are not going to root for the Jamie hate the hell is is we have to consider\nWhy he you know that's a good question Mike the um I don't know you guys do right are you going to win it was sort of radio you know are they going to win the Superbowl\nBecause listen the giants since Nineteen eighty six I bet the five okay eighty six Phil Simms they beat the Denver Broncos Nineteen Ninety\nSeven hundred dollars a Yankee the buffalo I Know we want to be like so we didn't lose one to the ... to the Baltimore Ravens so they're just going to make a superstar doesn't apply also cares they haven't been to assume well if I\nHad spent years yes as jet fans care oh that's great if if ah we get there will be very happy leaving wary me oh just won't reject ... yes\nOh yeah we're going to hate it we're going to hate it when we don't like it we don't like you and you ... for the giants Bernie\n... yes I Would in fact I had been rooting for the he's a very but none of it in New York fan I'm a I'm a New Yorker yeah in fact I I can easily I it's easier for me to root for the New York giants than it was for me to root for the New York Yankees would be quite honestly is that right yeah yeah I like the giant organization I think it's a good organization\nThe

funny look look look how well you have done the right now Donald\nBrazil former DNC chair but you have a book out and it's called for colored girls who have considered politics and it's about among other things are above black female politicians am I correct none of\nIt it's about women who dared to make a difference if our journey for a women who have worked in democratic politics for the last Thirty years\nWe describe our journey working on a Jesse Jackson campaigned being inspired by women like credit Scott Kang Dorothy Height and that the Maya Angelou in Sicily Kaiser who by the way showed up at the ... or a couple of nights ago to celebrate our book I did Thomas by the way it was\nAlso in the crowd when we came through New York so it's it's really about women or who they are to make a difference and taken out of the political Tejpal\nSounds clearly going to tell you one of the ladies that you know very well do you work closely with actually doing the last election\nShe um she said something a couple of days ago about how to really upset you of being that you want to Jim in fruit for women don't do a very good job with that\nAnd ... who will do do spouse I'm married twenty six years I Can't imagine what my wife has to say every day just to protect me I get it but when Hillary Clinton comes out\nAnd talks about each other as to whether or not to Clinton used his power to seduce Monica Lewinsky that was one of the dumbest and most responsible comments I've ever heard and quite frankly Donald Hillary should know better\nWell you know let me just say this um and I I was there Twenty years ago not in the marriage not in the White House but I was there Twenty years ago when the American people educated what happened inside the oval office\nBill Clinton had to apologize to his wife to his daughter Chelsea\nBut he also had to apologize to Monica the American people he was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice\nI Would hope that we would uh spending time more time focusing on how we are getting along as as as Americans and not a particularly going back to someone's married I think it must be painful for her to continue to talk about this and to be able to\nTo try to sort this out in the public when it was a such a private or deal and properly and embarrass\nOkay was it was a very public or do we know our homes have done it but it was\nPublic for or you can imagine what happened in between the two of them you you think she or he went home that night and say honey I got something to say to you what she said well honey I've already seen it I've heard it let me tell you what I mean come on it's been twenty it's it's it's personal and I'm sure it\nIs grueling I've never had an opportunity to talk to\nA you know center a Secretary Clinton or about this a privately publicly but ah when whenever I see if she wins says and then she speaks her True Blood whether it's millennia Trump in the White House dealing with what she had to deal with over the last couple of years with all of the sag and all of the conversations\nStormy Daniels writing a book or a Hillary Clinton we need to give these women opportunity to speak their truth tell that story respect them and then move on\nWell speaking of ah women telling the truth the Donald Brazil and it is about women in politics the book is called for colored girls who have considered politics\nYou can get good at Amazon and did did it right now for colored girls who have considered politics then you had to Hillary Clinton has said ... what does it just mentioned and also a ... Warren's a disastrous DNA the story all is coming just before the election not exactly what the Democrats looking for\nA two and a half weeks three weeks of the ... from the midterms right\nThe funny thing is that I watched Ted Cruz invade or or work a debate the other night and you know what no one is talking about Elizabeth Warren's DNA no one is talking about uh anything other than kitchen table issues whether or not their premiums will go up health care is a big issue this year\nWhile the economy is doing good there's still some community there the suffering\nPeople want to talk about kitchen table issues they're not interested in this what I call the beltway endless a soup of partisanship in gossip\nYou made me when I knew there was a poll taken no just yesterday that said although the issues coming up for the midterms of Thirteen percent health care is still the largest is the biggest issue and quite frankly\nA Republican from all that you know they spent all these years you only complaining about Obamacare which I don't like either by the way but if you're going to complain about it or at least we'll be able to do something with it and the truth is not the Republicans have not so in this big issue that those inside maybe bode well for the Democrats\nLet me tell you something my hundred and thirty two million of us have some pre existing condition whether asthma a cancer diabetes you name it we need to strengthen our health care system we should not be one paycheck away from bankruptcy if we go to the doctor and learned that we have an ailment\nWe need to have the bad health care in the world I'm tired of the United states\nBeing a a lack of when it comes to health care and protect and\nWhat I Believe to be the health of all of its citizens we need to do that if either way when you have extra money in the bank you try to make some improvement in your life you try to go out and say okay well you know I got a couple of extra dollars a month to get some storm when I got a couple of extra dollar them fixed that garage door or whatever but\nHere in this country when we get a surplus you know we do we we blow it next year we're going to have to raise the debt ceiling again because the tax\nCuts that we couldn't afford it going to blow up big a big hole and the deficit we need to focus on our priorities I Would hope that if the Democrats are able to take back the house the Senate whatever we're still we're so far in the wilderness we we just take a cabin okay\nSo we need something right yeah\nThat's something we need to fight for the American people dressed in our health care system strengthen Social Security and Medicare we need to do something to make sure all of our children have a decent education that's what I'm about that is what I've always been about\nWell and that's a good message Donald Brazil the book again is called for colored girls were considered politics and speaking of a couple of extra dollars the unemployment rate\nAt historic lows right now fifty years anyway a three point seven historic lows were African American money in the bank and the message of may resonate that the jobs is with which is better than any democratic social program that ever came out of Congress\nJobs not moms could be the Republican slogan this year and then my job but the older well for them\nWell if we can get rid of the culture of corruption I mean the president promised to drain the swamp and electric got some ... some new mouse is around I\nI Would hope that we would make sure that every American is able to what I call come back to the circle of hope we have so many Americans who've lost hope\nTen years after the great recession lack of wealth was decimated after the great recession it's going
