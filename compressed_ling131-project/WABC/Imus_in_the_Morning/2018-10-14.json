sorry about that hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou're one of the things that's critical inside of the financial markets is just to understand the timing of things understand when to buy and wants to sell so that we can buy low in so high and really generating consistent income whether it's passive income or whether it's active income ...\nThat that's a really key topic that's really key point being able to start and stop at the right time they talk about in the real estate market how is that the three road rules to real estate location location location well the three rules inside of the financial markets are timing timing timing\nBy low so high and being able to time those wholesale prices on those retail prices are really will help you generate that passive and that active income but Larry what are some of the key points you really having our students focused on right now to make sure that they can really generate that income that they are after\nWell our students are actually preparing right now for a decade wide opportunity a windfall so to speak [noise] give me that we haven't really seen since two thousand eight about every ten years\nWe've seen statistically that there is going to be a correction so our students are trained and by the way you know right and we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over a quarter of a million students have gone through our academy right now and the beauty of this is\nTheir learning how to take action when this opportunity arises it's very different than most people out there are listeners who are basically poor and when I mean by poor\nAs passing over opportunities repeatedly\nRight now our students have been waiting Wall Street has been waiting for this decade long windfall the last time he saw a major correction was in two thousand eight\nWall Street made more money in that year and then they had in the prior ten years same thing's going to happen again you're going to see people become very very wealthy simply because they learn how to prepare to take action when the markets go down now we really haven't had that experience at all\nMarkets have gone a little sideways the past couple of years\nMostly up and again I always laugh because everybody knows how to make money in a bull market what they can't do it sustain wealth and make sure that they're preserving this hard earned capital when the markets go down and again now what's funny is our students are going to have the best year their lives once this happens\nThere'll be cheering on Wall street\n... everybody involved because they know what's coming but they know something that most of our students know and most unfortunately most people out there don't know\nIt really ends up being what do you have two dollars or two million dollars it doesn't matter we want to have that money consistently growing and that money generating consistent income now we have two dollars we're going to be focusing on the active income side of things so we can build up that well\nIf we have two million dollars maybe we're more focused on the passive income side of things but it's all about generating more income through the financial markets whether the markets are going up down or sideways and the market falls about three times faster than it goes up you know they say when you take it along physician it's like taking the stairs and when you\nIs short position if like jumping out of a window hey how fast it goes down so think about that not only is he down market an opportunity to generate income it's an opportunity to generate three times as much income roughly in the same amount of time\nWell give me an example back in February we didn't have anywhere near the correction that we could be having now Goldman Sachs make two hundred million dollars in one day\nThat's one day ladies and gentlemen imagine that if you had it just a portion of that but you were in a position like Goldman Sachs to learn how to make money when the markets went down which is known as shorting the markets\nThis could be your entire opportunity to set yourself up once and for all for retirement or for income that you've been waiting this could be the difference of freedom of finding a job change that you really have been wanting to do for a while\nAnd right now we have a half day class coming up in your area and have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent passive\nOr active income what do you have two dollars or two million dollars you're gonna be able to see exactly what it takes to get your money generating that income you deserve and really reached that point of ultimate financial freedom and it just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes if you're driving now is a good time to pull over and get that phone out\nIncluding with your passes is our professional insiders kit now this kid is

even worse offenses there we've got to take a quick break but Larry what do you have a force was talking about that next piece which is how you make in\nDuring these aggressive Marcus just in general most wanted to learn how to make them without necessarily meaning another job income generation with Ryan and Larry we'll be right back [noise]\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer

luxury of not working so hard\nTo have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share but there's all kinds of stories here's one one recent graduate had to say\nI bartender that a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed my time I needed my life\nAnother student says ...\nHappy and career and try to make something that I had always wanted to death and so as I said that but at a chemical or start that changed my life I've\nLearned more visitors on line at O T a Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com\n[noise] welcome back and if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of a structure development and top instructor it online trading enemies the brains of the operation and if you weren't with us over the last segment let me tell you what he was talking about we're really spending some\nTime really diving deep and how to make money no matter what direction the market goes we were talking about passive income we were talking about active income whether the markets are going up down or sideways and as these markets start to fall is a powerful it is a is a critical life skill I like to say to be able to generate income\nAs the markets are going down it is very much can be very much of a life changing a life changing skill if you look back at the wave of billionaires and when they were created it's it's incredible to see\nHow many new billionaires are created\nIn these drops in the market and that goes back to what we're talking about just a few minutes ago as far as how fast the market goes down and you see their wealth just expands being able to take those positions that profit on the way down to learn I both touched on in the last segment how Goldman Sachs actually had over two hundred million dollar day\nAll of the market was going down their position to make money if the markets took a big step down they took a big step down and Goldman Sachs is portfolio took a big big big\nStep forward whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come\nAnd learn a lot of our listeners or you know they they call in and they talked to was a lot about how much they love all the income conversations we haven't and some of them are looking to replace their income with trading and investing and a lot are looking to upgrade their lifestyle with a little bit of additional you know kind of supplemental income and some are just you know really looking to fire their boss I remember about a month ago I had a couple of students coming in saying\nThey're number one goal was to fire their Boston so they're looking more for a primary source of income or out of these financial markets but whether it's\nSupplemental income whether its primary income whether it's passive income whether it's active income one of those key points you're having everybody focused on her one of those those are ... and those told us that you are given out to the students right now to make sure that they're really heading in that right direction no matter what their income goal is\nWhat we teach our students a simple step by step simple investment strategy designed to help them understand where the big banks are buying them whether selling once you understand and you're able to understand something as simple as where the buying and where to be selling\nYou could start to learn how to generate additional income sadly when I speak to students it's no fault of their own especially people listening to us right now they've been told their whole lives the only way they can make more money is by getting another job well here's your problem here's the rub most people coming to the Academy of wanting to learn how to trade\nSo they can leave a job they don't want they want to learn how to preserve capital they worked so hard to say maybe spend more time with your family go on vacations\nThere's no way possible that they are going to be able to create that freedom that they're looking for it they're going to work yet another job that is taking them further and further away from freedom to a lot of our students what they're learning right now is how to generate income in the markets you mentioned this many times Ryan\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visit us on line at oh gee a Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com [noise]\nWelcome back and if you're just shooting and humid Larry Jacobs and director of a structure development and having structure it online training I mean these are shed some light on how to generate more income\nWe're talking about passive income we're talking about active income we're even specifically really talking about primary income versus supplemental income and one of the things I was mentioning I Love so much about just talking about supplemental income is\nIt really does start to emphasize more than one piece of income right we talk about\nSupplemental it supplements for this and supplements that maybe we start to have our we still have our job we still have some income now from the currency markets some income from some derivative you know whatever that ends up being but as we started projecting supplemental he was he okay a little bit here from this a little bit from this and it really does start to really push towards\nThat multiple streams of income which when you go back through the average millionaire there's I think it's that the average five\nDifferent streams of income and so being able to have\nThat are that consistent flow a little bit from here a little bit from there is what takes that financial pressure off it makes it so easy for somebody to really operate in that space which is known as\nFinancial freedom well whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for for the whole show I get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are new to the markets they're just looking to get started off on the right foot and some have been investing for a while and not quite really reaching their goals and one of the things that we hear a lot from the individuals out there is is that they are um\nSome of them or don't have enough money right and the ones that do have enough money are saying hey I'm not quite sure how to even safely uh invest this what are what are some of the golden nuggets what some of the guidance you and the instructor team a really kind of laying on for the students right now\nWho may be falling to maybe maybe both of those categories or just want to start from one to go to the other you know how they generate more money or how do they safely invest really what\nThey have to keep to our theme of timing awareness today and if you take a look at time the biggest question that you have to ask yourself is when do you want to retire and do you have enough money right now to do so\nMost people don't realize when you look back in two thousand eight and go back to two thousand the tech bubble it takes about on average now five years for the markets recovered just to break even aware prices were before correction well here we are now way beyond the normal cycle we're much higher than we were in two thousand two thousand eight\nAnd so some people out there are predicting that could be a sixty percent correction right now\nHow many years you think that's going to take to get your money back and we can't afford it\nBecause all of a sudden if you were thinking about retiring and you thought maybe you had money then you've got to keep in mind is the price of everything that you're buying right now is going to go up just think back to your childhood nothing is worth the same as it was back then and if we're going into the future prices of things that we consume gas food energy everything will keep going higher and higher\nAs far as awareness right now the biggest thing our students get an a ha moment from is realizing that everything they've been told about how they're planning for retirement is wrong we give you an example Ryan some of our students come in thinking that by listening to their\nFour one K. administrator or their benefits office all you have to do is this let me tell you those words are the most dangerous words you're ever going to hear when it comes to ... financial planning\nBecause the bottom line is when I talked to students and they start talking about how much money they're actually generating every single year in the markets it's nowhere near what they want because unlike dieting a one size fits all does not work\nIn terms of how much money you're gonna have to make are you going to be aggressive are you going to be conservative and sadly all you need to do is this put everybody in the similar bucket and they find out by the time of retirement they are grossly underfunded and what they're going to need to live on and this is why sadly so many Americans now find themselves\nHaving to go back to work years after they retire because they just outlived their money\nYeah and it's a it's a harsh reality that the that spans across the globe you know I I've spent a bunch of time in India it's been so much time in Canada sponge a bunch of time in\nUh Europe and Asia and it's and it's something that hits everybody and we we we fail to plan which means we need to plan to fail really is kind of the ah the kind of breakdown of that and and it's very it's it's very interesting how a lot of the times\nWe are recommended to have what I call the ostrich strategy just bury our head in the sand and just hope we don't hope that we make it through the storm\nWhere where the traders and investors out there\nAre are skilled enough where they can make money is the market's going up or down\nTheir retirement continues to grow the market started to pull down the economy start to contract you know we have\nCurrency issues be of interest rate issues we have all these different things that were look we're staring right in the face right now inverted bond yelled curves all these different things that are that are classic signs of the next kind of\nDrop in the market and that doesn't have to be viewed as a bad thing I Would see a drop in the market it's actually very normal thing now can it be normal instead of bad yeah and is that good yeah that's good for to for it to be viewed as normal what's even better\nHave it be viewed as a money making opportunity a way for you to generate more retirement income as the markets are going down because again they go down almost three times as fast as they go up so if you made\nX. percentage over the last year and your retirement account what if the next down what's the next year the down your and you made three times as much in the next year as you did last year just because he knew how to make money as the market going down\nCalculate those type of evidence on what type of return you can get by becoming a train a skilled investor who knows how to make money as the market's going up as a market going down and as a marketer going sideways one of the best places to really get introduced to these to these skills into these tactics\nIs that at one of our half day classes we've got a few passes sitting around here Larry how about a giveaway let's do it\nRight now we've got a half day class coming up in your area and they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes truly generate that retirement income that consistent retirement income whether the markets are going up whether the markets are going down to whether the market's going sideways whether you've got two dollars in your retirement account or two million dollars in your retirement account\nYou're gonna be able to see exactly what it takes really get that money working for you and get you on track or even get you to a higher level of that financial freedom that you're after now just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these have their classes\nTo get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over and included with your passes is our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more\nThe professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now\n... when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three that's eight seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nLarry when we're still in this kind of retirement ah this this retirement topic an income for retirement\nI always like to look at that as an a lotta times I'll I'll say you know the their income for their income for tomorrow which one you know I always stressed that it's always income but it's always about income now it's about generating that income so we can uh so we can reach those levels of financial freedom right financial freedom today would be the income for today or financial freedom tomorrow which is that retirement type of income\nNow what are some of the what is the key points where people can kind of cross that bridge from from that passive income that supplemental income into that retirement income state or what are some of the keys they need to be focusing on to make sure they have enough money when they do get their\nFirst and foremost you have to invest in yourself you need to get educated right now because the good news is if you make your self aware of where you're currently at today you can fix this this is reversible\nThe whole idea of understanding and being aware of what you need to retire because let's face it nobody wants to work their whole lives and on their deathbed go gee ride I Wish I worked in the other day right also the bottom line problem that most people faces they just don't know how to do this and so think about it every week now you're depositing money into a retirement account\nWhich you're doing it at an all time high so as a result of the majority of the money that you've been saving the last couple of years you've been buying that at an all time high and we have a three time\nFaster correction it's going to wipe that money out versus students were learning not only to adjust their portfolios to meet their need what they're going to want to live on so they can outlive their money but more importantly\nThat if they can get out it not near not an all time high but near the highest like they could in two thousand seven more importantly imagine that you have\nYou're sitting in cash at basement bottom prices like happened in two thousand nine when you can be picking any stock that you want to invest and there were people out there buying Amazon near a hundred\nYou had all these opportunities to ride stocks up to these astronomical highs right now so it amazes us that there's so many people out there that just don't address it one of my favorite movies rye and the pursuit of happiness Will Smith portrayed Chris gardener his mother in the movie one said the cavalry ain't\nCome and you have to realize that right now they're predicting that Social Security could run out by twenty thirty for most of the pensions out there are a completely under funded by trillions of dollars so that's on shaky ground\nThe only way you're going to protect yourself into the future or your family is by getting yourself educated and fixing the problem before it becomes an fixable\nYeah and in my and my dentist office Dr our book will give him a quick shout out this week at my dentist office as a kid there was a a plaque up in every single day in every single room and it said don't worry about your teeth and it'll go away and unfortunately we don't really\nTake action until it's almost too late you know until we've lost our investing capital you know all of a sudden it it shouldn't take a thirty or forty percent hit inside of our retirement account\nFor us to decide it's time to learn how to manage our money right and not only just that that type of hitting a retirement account what we could say that type of a hit again inside of our retirement ... already happened before\nGo over and teach your students how to do is\nHow to live the life intentionally that you're looking for so many people out there right now believe this is hard and Wall Street's done that to intentionally they've told you this is hard they said you can't do this because if you learn the simple skill and you can learn how to trade like a professional does will be buying where to be selling\nThen there's no way they can make those commissions and feeds off of you but so many of our students come in\nThey're excited to say wow once I can do this I can start actually trading on vacations\nActually take vacations and we owe them of course\nThere's not a lot of stress to this you could put in a small amount of time in fact\nWe teach our students something called a three hour trading day\nMost of our students are making money in the first three hours of the market opening think about that so you're not sitting in front of your computer aimlessly staring at it all day long no you're giving yourself an opportunity to generate income should the short term in the long term and you're blind yourself back time\nBecause that's the one thing we can never get back Ryan and so many students come in and now the fact that we have the opportunity through technology to trade anywhere in the world any time because we're really now and a twenty four hour market depending upon what you're trading\nYou can learn how to make money and some of our students have done very very well I have a student in June and in fact she jokes all the time that she's going to start sending us postcards while she's golfing in Costa Rica\nNow it's funny because she says I ain't gonna trade before or after she goes after the morning and play around them golf and come back and trade\nBut this is now open the door to so many people who are just miserable in their current situation and it really starts with getting your self educated because ... once said you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nYeah and you might be in a situation where things aren't that bad but you want them to be better or you might be in a situation where where maybe you do feel like you just need to make some changes to be a little happier and have a little more financial freedom and\nAnd and he was talking a little bit about the money side of it earlier but then the my favorite part about what he was just saying was what that money can do for you it's really all about spending more time doing those things you love whether it's out golfing whether it's spending time with the kids you know ... no matter what it is\nThat's really that that point is that financial freedom side of things getting that point of financial freedoms means we'd get to do the things that we want to do rather than the things that somebody is telling us to do\nRight and one of the first steps in reaching that financial freedom one of the first things about kind of upgrading that lifestyle or continuing that lifestyle without any stress is really getting educated really understanding how to make this all happened and no better place to do that or to get that ball rolled out of one of our have to classes Larry are you ready for give away let's do it\nAll right well right now we've got to have their class coming up

some passes there\nLarry whenever I'm looking at um\nYou know that lifestyle side of things whenever I'm looking at how do we fit this into our life\nThe thing that I owe at the point I was like to make with everybody is this is not about creating another full time job and we talk a lot about that on the show you know anybody can go out and just get another full time job but that really takes away usually from the financial freedom right to financial freedom conversation is two parts it's financial and its freedom right going and getting another job\nAdds to the financial but it doesn't add to the freedom right learning how to trade learning how to invest appropriately learning how to generate that passive income and that active income inside of the market is how you get that kind of win win scenario where you get that financial aid and it also comes along with the freedom side of things where some of the key points\nYou guys are helping the students with as far as kind of bridging that gap between financial and freedom and making sure that they have both of those working seamlessly\nLets us about realistic expectations ride I always ask students would you guys be okay with an extra hundred dollars a week that's almost five hundred dollars more a month so it's not about killing it and breaking the bank on day one I'll give you an example about how this could change your life we had a single mom you know her Gabrielle up\nAnd she came to us because she wanted to put her two kids through college she was really nervous\nAnd as a result not only was she able to learn the skill but her kids to college but she wound up buying or self her dream car or Mercedes that's all she wanted and what's fascinating to me is that people are now starting to realize\nThat by simply taking the time to get themselves educated understanding that by learning how to trade like the professionals do they can find freedom in their lives that's more than any amount of money can be put into words and on top of that Ryan imagine this is a skill you can pass down to your kids to your grandkids\nThere is an opportunity here to change everything you've been talking about for years\nAbsolutely and now setting those goals of financial goals at the beginning of the year I Want to make X. I Want to spend more time doing this but now you can actually build out that blueprint of exactly how to get there and that's one of my favorite things\nTo do with new students as they come out and they say this is my goal my goal is I Want to spend more time doing this okay well well what's it going to take to get you there well I Need to spend less time at work okay well how much less time and how much how much money do you need to offset that now you can reverse engineer things it's actually a\nVery simple process to go in and figure out\nHow much money we need in order to do the things that we want to do and then figure out what we need to do in the markets to be able to generate that money and maybe like you were saying realistic expectations maybe it's not something we can do overnight 'cause it's usually not right learning to trade learning to invest learning to generate income in the markets is a process\nNot an event it's not like you just throw switching here we are right but at the same time we can reverse engineer that and set a pathway to success and build that pathway or that blueprint to financial freedom and one of the key points and being able to really generate that income is to have the knowledge\nAnd have the skill right the knowledge the understanding and then the skill to go in and applied implemented strategies inside of the financial markets and there's no better place\nTo get started building that knowledge building that that road map and even building that skill than inside one of our half day classes and we've got some half the class is coming up before we do a quick little give away I got to get the permission from Larry Jacobson Larry are you ready for a little give away\nThe electorate some people's bucket listen to a bucket lives\nThere we go right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half their classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate that consistent income whether the markets are going up the markets are going down whether the market's going sideways and whether you have two dollars or two million dollars you're gonna be able to see exactly what it takes to get your money generating the income you deserve and get you closer to financial freedom\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these have take classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes is our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top

of an oncologist I gave earlier detection ... if not without its not without issues\nYou know it's not that issues you're right and you bring up a lot of points there about you know screening for cancer and talking with Don ... this morning on breast cancer screening and then you know the possibility of um\nScreening and then finding cancers that you know may may not need treatment right or or finding other lesions that are not necessarily cancer but benign\nNow are you recommending that um you feel women should be screened probably the age of forty or what would that screening be that would still be the standard mammogram is that right\nUh so it depends on the patient but generally speaking guidelines that would be for it gives you don't ... the forty every every year after that for as long as you feel the patient will stand to benefit and that could mean\nDepending on the guidelines that we got ten years in good health after ... performed a and so are there are newer technologies which are certainly being integrated there are certain populations for which I recommend them I think that are\nHigher risk of breast density case are rescue could genetic predisposition but in patients throughout her average rent at the digital mammogram it the best approach\nDigital digital mammogram and now that they thought the mammograms up before now nice using that word because another word called ... are there are some other versions of the Iraq and that requires radiation or not\nA yeah there's a limited amount of radiation with and I don't know\nRight and there's the kind of you you know I guess it did you say well why wouldn't a woman want to be screened I mean I guess the the one reason was you don't want to know or your you know the the false positives like you say you know like with men was a PSA you don't want to get the test because maybe it's elevator but it's not really cancer and is going to cause meaning Jayanti\nBut then there's I guess the potential was theoretical you know a downside um that there is a low dose of radiation and then that's a concern for women and is that you must hear that right\nYeah and I mean that's the\nIn terms of a standard Mariano extremely low dose of radiation however some of the newer technologies\nThey are even more sensitive particularly for mental with Brett denser brass like a ... and these ones have slightly higher radiation doses so this is something that has to be you know kept in mind all the time and why generally speaking for women who are the\nWhat would have the longest chemical evidence for that standard mammogram Allen said having a compelling reason to do other mammograms or or like an MRI are assigned around to enhance\nSensitivity [noise]\nAll right uh and are there any particular uh signs or symptoms for for breast cancer that uh\nWould say well you know forget about the yearly thing I should probably get a mammogram right away I mean the obvious thing I guess would be for a woman that's doing the self breast examination and feels a new lumped there's probably a very common reason why women she get a mammogram right away\nExactly that's what that's correct I wouldn't even with that it's very common to have about ... ... ... ... ... ... ... and\nIt can be it's more like a rally in terms of the time that I'm that painful I any kind of other changes in terms of the skin

wellbeing in every day\nIf you have comments these you know in the in the media I'd see see one not gum or find this on Facebook or two minutes I ...\nAnd you can also here is like asking them access to play the playground conversation on him now for our interview with Thomas conversation I Know\n\nWhat you say was homes McClellan PHD founder of the treatment research Institute an independent non profit organization dedicated to science driven reform of treatment and policy in substance abuse recently retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania\nDr McClellan served as senior editor for the U.S surgeon general's\nTwo thousand and six team report facing addiction he previously served as senior scientist and deputy director of the White House office of national Drug Control policy Dr McAllen holds his PHD from Bryn Mawr college and did his postgraduate training in psychology at Oxford University\nIn England Tom welcome to conversations on health care\nAbout thank you for having me you know it's been twenty five years and she founded treatment research Institute in since then we've seen just as devastating impact of a growing epidemic of opioids\nStill it seems we lack this consensus on both treatment of substance use disorder and the best policies to address the public health crisis in and wonder if you could share with our listeners some insight into why this is still so difficult to do\nYeah I I think the way most of the world has understood addiction for centuries as weak character poor upbringing things like that and now here's a fact addiction\nIs a chronic illness that affects the brain specifically the motivation inhibition ordered and stress circuitry in the brain\nAnd what has happened is we have institutionalized prevention and treatment all kinds of other policies based on this understanding that addiction is something that bad boys two and should be punished for weeks flatly got it wrong\nAnd we're just making that transition now a science is finally eating way but it's going to be tough number one to Institute the proper policies and the most effective and efficient forms of prevention and treatment\nBut it's going to be made even more difficult because we have to displace literally centuries of thinking and institutions that are based on antiquated model\nWhat time you made a lot of enormous contributions and one is that you've written so extensively on this topic of addiction and evidence based treatment and I I think that one thing we can agree on is that one of the most seminal documents you played a role in producing was\nUs surgeon general view that murky very powerful call to action facing addiction can you share with our listeners sweat you in the surgeon general such a set in motion\nSo I I think two things have to be communicated and these are facts back five thirty\nYears of research but first as addiction is not ending tractable social problem that we simply have to live with this medical condition and we can prevent ... cases\nWhen we can't prevent those cases we can intervene effectively and arrest the devastating effects\nIt is possible to treat even very serious cases of of addiction\nWith full recovery now being unexpected outcome the right kind of care so\nThis is solvable problem well you know an awful lot about what to do\nAnd that is both a promise and the petty this pity is it's just simply not been implemented and there's a second point\nThat it is in the interests of mainstream medicine to finally breaks the study management understanding of substance use disorders\nNot only because these are treatable medical conditions in their own right\nBut even more important in the context of the rest of medicine where they're desperate efforts going on to contain costs and improve quality\nUndiagnosed on manage substance use disorders\nAre costing mainstream healthcare over a hundred and twenty billion dollars a year and that's from\nMisdiagnoses way too frequent unnecessary emergency room and and other high cost procedures medicine has been a real ... than a participant in this and\nIt is time and energy and the direct self interests every physician but particularly primary care\nTo learn how to recognize it and manager because they can and because it will not be possible to deliver high quality mainstream healthcare for for most other illnesses unless they do\nIn speaking that you you've been advocate and something that we practice at our health facility medication assisted treatment or M E T\nWhich uses a drug regimen to help manage addiction in the inventory care setting in your research has yielded powerful evidence of the effectiveness of this approach especially in reducing incidents of relapse and there's a lack of uptake by\nPrimary care providers on medication assisted treatment so tell us more about the research on it but also why you see reluctance to start providing this very needed says\nYeah this is where politics ideology and science all meet if I said type two diabetes is a chronic medical illness and it is a good idea to have FDA approved medications\nIn addition chair changing your lifestyle that would cause exactly no star at all and the reason as\nDiabetes has been accepted as a real medical condition physicians are trained to diagnose it to understand it to manage three as a chronic illness we know it's basically not possible to cure it but it can be managed\nPolicy that I Know for those that can bind them and it's an artist\nThe separation between the role of the Justice Department and the role of health and Human Services or police and treatment professionals you can't treat any addiction when\nThey're ready availability of substance in the street is just not treating depth area with when a place where there's polluted water further\nYou can punish an addictive person all you want if they don't get the right kind of monitoring supervision they're simply going to go back to ... and this has happened over and over and over\nSo I favor policies that reduce the sale of ability of substances yes marijuana alcohol and all other shops\nAre not for legalization of marijuana or you can Medical Association of marijuana just because it makes\nA veil ability increase the likelihood of more people using that once you have that you're going to have more this year and you're going to have more addiction\nI'm for policies that expand incentives for mainstream healthcare to embrace substance use disorder is not just Frank addictions but ...\nIt's in their interest for providing high quality general medical care to know something about addiction less thirty percent of American Medical schools have even a single course right okay\nSo I'm for those policies because SATs what science tells us or the best ways to prevent intervene early and treat substance use disorder ...\nWe've been speaking today with Dr Tom ... founder and CEO of the treatment research Institute you can learn more about his groundbreaking work by going to tea research dot org or follow them on Facebook at treatment research Institute\nTom we want to thank you for your dedication to this incredibly important health issue for your body of research and for joining us today on conversations on health care\nWell thank you it's a pleasure\n[noise] competitions and there will be truly we know when it
