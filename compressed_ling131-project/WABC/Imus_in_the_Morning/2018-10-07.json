{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "Now because of this man told me quickly what's going on and say everything's going great I looked at the documents I looked at the scans he had been told this week by us Kamal doctor at that super duper big came a place\nThat the chemo was work and and then I review is documents and the scans and the same hospital the radiologist say the lymph nodes are growing that Kansas is getting bigger the ... not working that's the report\nHe has it in his hand and yet is Kamal doctors telling them exactly the opposite side examine them I got the history I went over the scans of the reports\nHe never got a cancer marker and never got to see a sea aids or cancer markers that help you see what's going on with the cancer he never got a PET scan the doctors didn't want to get the best test for him that doesn't want to get a PET scan to see the best way they could to see if the cancers traveling\nWhy because they were probably happy given came okay most ten thousand dollars a month it's great for the hospital\nIt's great for the doctor it's great for the pharmaceutical industry see some of these hospitals and hundreds of people getting chemo every day\nMultiply that times the number of days in the months times ten thousand dollars a month and you could see wow and this man the cables not work and his cancer is growing and I can tell you that he and his son were sitting there\nShocked I showed them the report from their own hospital that they chose they thought was so fancy\nThey want to keep on giving them treatment not tell him that in fact his cancers growing and I can tell they were upset so what did we do well number one we communicate we explain number two getting fatter scanned number three were getting cancer markers number for going to be back with him\nBut his idea of getting more chemotherapy of chemotherapies not work and it's just poison what is chemotherapy whether they're really poisons they tried to poison the cancer more than the body well in this case\nThe cancers growing which means it's not working so he's spending ten thousand dollars of somebody's Monday whether it's his money or your money or my money or somebody's money if somebody's money that the drug companies gathering and the president the hospitals gathering of the they're all getting it they're all doing well\nExcept for one person now why did I go to medical school I went to medical school for that one person whether it's you or your loved one or this man is for that one person who needs our attention\nAnd luckily he came and luckily you know understands and luckily he has a fresh second opinion of a doctor who was on\nHis side wow and then we'll talk about another a\nPatient who came to me is eighty through eighty five years old is a pharmacist that came with his two sons and daughters daughters or pharmacist he has\nCancer as sad story in a way he ... he had prostate cancer treatment you went to one of the big hospitals they gave a nine weeks of treatment that didn't work and we often talk about that weeks and weeks of ... radiation and\nSurgery that just doesn't work and he had that doesn't work and then they went to the same hospital and he had cry all therapy which is freezing therapy at a took away his control of his ...\nYear and has been leaking year and now for a decade if you can believe that and it comes to me it was found when they had the domino paying with a pancreas cancer last year he went to one of the big hospitals another big hospitals are all big hospitals\nAnd he had a biopsy and he started chemotherapy and it came off for months and months and months and they became deathly ill nearly died his daughter told me he nearly died as and congestive heart failure had a\nA infection of his like his last true so ill as a treatment for more than two months he had cancer markers and see a Ninety nine was fourteen hundred went up quickly to twenty two hundred\nAnd then a drop of water to drop would stop the drop not because of the cancer went away as a matter of pancreas cancer that's spread to his belly button so he can actually feel the cancer and you could feel that the cable hasn't been working so number one of nearly killed him and put them in the heart failure\nHe was so sick and nearly died and it's not working and there's another patient he never had a PET scan never had the best studies as an added no crush them with the pancreas he came to us he also has blood in the urine and they never told him that his kidneys are\nBoth blocked up they're both locked up\nWith the urine backing up in the year ... destroyed the kidneys they never told him that either what's going on in some of these big places one place they never told him the cancers grow it told her everything was fine when in fact the cancer was growing and there's a case where the kidneys are backed up\nThey never told them they never took action they never refer to him to block his kidneys\nAnd he's gotten so sick from the chemo anti nearly died from the chemo and the weather in the heart failure from the chemo and the ... not working as expensive and it's a new since this is the work we do this is why so many people come here\nThey call us up at two and two choices to into two four six forty two thirty seven make an appointment and comment and that's the only way

Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nLarry as we start to kind of continue down this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got that down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the boss biased that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe he could take that into it into a ... expand on that ... for our listeners and even even anything else that that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right in the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own they don't get themselves educated now it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around some education the problem is the very costly less and why would you want to spend all that time energy and money\nWhen you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to try to get like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shorting the markets and so I Want to use this analogy hurting to use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said to you well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the court can only go in drive you can never put in reverse it'd be a pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize soda the markets you can trade when the market's going up\nYou can trade when the market's going down to what most people have learned by coming to the academy coming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process the system\nRegardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's coach shovels somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nWhen you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I always stress inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to do that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approach the markets and and and when I talk to people is very normal that that they say\nIf I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the ...\nAngel markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate the income but once you have the skill you can generate the income but the skill has to come first and it's that the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody a successful or not it's just like I\nI compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard that the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight that that's not going to get you there you have your plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane across the country that's a that's a whole different conversation and\nWe would never get on that plane because that's the life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves\nTo absolutely uh let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income to allies spend more time with your family some people want to move on to do a different type of job maybe one of volunteer\nLocally in your community the thing that we want to do most is get back the time that we don't want to lose and so a lot of our students have been very grateful to come in to spend a little time with us and learn how they not only can generate more income but also save themselves more time\nYeah absolutely we're coming up next to a break when you say we squeeze in another give away let's do it All right well we've got our half day class coming up and your investment in there it's going to be a three hours of your time three hours of your time to come out and see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the markets whether it's going up down or sideways\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nInclude with your passes has got to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency and much much more\nThe professional insider kid makes it so you can get started right now stellar century twenty when you get a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three that date seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three\nIf you intervene colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at ... Ga Wall Street dot com and see if you can force a vast there we've got to take a quick break but Larry whatever force next let's say on this topic ride we've been talking about his generation has talked about how to make without necessarily meaning you have to get a second job\nMore income talk with Ryan and Larry we'll be right back [noise]\n\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills\nOr even just having the luxury of not working so hard to have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share but there's all kinds of stories here's one one recent graduate had to say\nI bartender that a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed my time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... could that happen and career and try to something that I had always wanted to death and so as I'd I'd die for that particular call or start that changed my life I've\nLearned more visitors on line at O T a Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com\n[noise] welcome back you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of a structure development and half instructor it online trading at the brains of the operation here that's for sure he was ... on how to make money and the markets are going up down or sideways\nHow to generate more money how to generate more income and consistent income\nNo matter which way the market is going and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and Larry a lot of our listeners are looking to replace their income with trading in investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole a whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income\nBut there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit of a multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying in the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like well\nStarting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan where we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolution says what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and this is something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example\n... had I mean has taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nThe kid there static because I'm I'm available now and we can eat together as a family um I get my trading dying and that they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visit us on line at oh TA Wall Street dot com that's OT a Wall Street dot com [noise]\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and top instructor it on my training I mean really shed some light on income over ...\nWe talked a lot about multiple streams of income we talked about different types of income\nPassive income active in a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active\nIncome and and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow in a net income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment\nTalking a little bit about the retirement accounts and so one of the things that may be missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more a more generating more income well don't worry we're going to be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation\nWhether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot\nOur listeners and and that happens a lot of social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRose got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different Web and our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics because I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ... one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets into correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier in the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first time you've got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade in mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world the Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss is set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people in senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes will right now you should be thinking about and especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira\nFour one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs he might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThan we ever seen that index have been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work\nWhen you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nYeah and the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high most of what's the probability of buying an all time high as as being you buy low opera opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations there's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher end over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the Bush biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the market's going higher and higher and\nEvery pay the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nAbout through their RSP through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday would just buy stocks well it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we're going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way\nOf of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight a ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down and they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying up these all time highest\nOffsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as I said okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area but happy classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes switch phones ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your past this is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside her kid makes it so you get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three that's eight seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we've got a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward relies so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you had the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what they have in their retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you\nSwitch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating the money you need to retire the right way and again\nThis comes down to getting yourselves educated what I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and\nBeing able to set these things up ahead of time right you're not sitting in front of your computer waiting it it's all about identifying opportunities before they get there but but what are some of the things where were you able to help people's minds shift from that reactive trader the sitting there watching CNBC and waiting for a news alert\nInto that proactive trader that can just identify what the institutions are doing in by when they buy and sell when they saw\nIt comes out to what I like to say it's not about the news it's about the clues your professionally trading you're not going to sit there and chase price\nWe teach our students it's really important to understand how professional sneak it comes back to that emotion versus strategy again in a lot of our students who come in the door\nThey realize that they're there because they want to change something in their life something isn't working through the working too hard they're not spending time with family and so as a result imagined that now we're hearing the twenty first century you have a laptop and an Internet connection you can trade anywhere you want in the world in fact\nI had a student her name was June and she kept saying all she wanted to just play golf in Costa Rica\nAnd so she started talking about how she could pull that off and so\nReally it's really nice about it she can make money training to get herself to Costa Rica and then what a lot of our students do they actually trade while they're on vacation as long as you're doing it at a time frame that won't piss somebody else off and do you do that all the time Ryan is the idea that you can be making money anywhere you go and we have a student her name was Hayley\nShe's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she recently gone through a divorce and what she decided to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough and had time to do whatever she wanted to do a lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommitted to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you can pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody you want to help in the future\nYou know and I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating that full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom and that's that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually come up to me and say why do you go [laughter] chuckle Everytime I think about it he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to a\nPuerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like\nWell yeah and I'm like that's why it gets really pretty cold here in the wintertime when I'm running from it\nAnd that's one of the things that that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection we've joked about it a few times where he went back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I was ... down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a TNT air card hanging out of the side of my laptop\nThat it was almost the same size as my laptop and\nEven my satellite radio down there like it only worked from like ... it only worked for like eight am like noon because that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are from a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fund evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know we had dial up Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge can really go a long way\nWe don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the palm of our hand identify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for price really come down to you\nIt it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know in my grandfather taught me that's when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the price I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away\nAnd that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy ... shares a stock but I Want to buy this price and if I can for this price that's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional one of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education and confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that isn't the half day class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay\nAll right [noise] right now I've got to have to a class coming up in your area the happy classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's gonna be the professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nProfessional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three that's eight seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three if the enemy and colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at oh gee a Wall Street dot com and see if you can score some ... there\nWere some of the other kinds of examples you can share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom\nLet's consistency Ryan most people will come in and they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have to be willing to commit ... will be at a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next\nYou really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back asking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you\nIf you're not happy right now than you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life\nYou know going up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact Einstein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again in expecting a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and she said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nAnd I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being that the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy do what wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nAnd he brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said if you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe it is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know this is the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation and the same thing in the finance\nThe markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach our students how they could identify what the financial institutions during what are the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo that you can go in and just simply do what they do so that you can get what they got now one of the ways that where we start this off when the best way to do this has come out to a half day class invest three hours of your time she can see exactly what it takes to do that before we can do that I've only got what ten tickets left here we're at the end of the show is what that means\nAnd so one of the things is Larry can we give away these final time pass and let's get some people educated changed their lives how right well right now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area\nAnd happy classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live life on your own terms to be able to generate the income that you need to be able to do the things that you want to do\nNow in a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of ... one of these have to classes to get your phone's ready and if you were driving now is a great time to pull over include with your passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit\nNow the kittens packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency and much much more\nThe professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\nThe ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three that date seven seven eight eight one eight seven to three if you had to be a colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ Wall Street dot com and see if you can score\nSome passes there now that is always as we say the fastest our over the week I always blows me away how fast the show goes but Larry thanks for hanging out with always a pleasure I always like to say get\nYourself educated this year make this year to invest in yourself field forward to being with you again on your radio airwaves this is Ryan and Larry and between now and then mail your

congressmen to Long Island Peter King gonna stop by to say I got to speak a chance for material he's always we always say that of\nAnd you're black or become so irritated that like you said you run into the bathroom all night all day long and then it ... becomes a situation where you can't hold it in your leaking and that seems to be your situation is that right\nExactly right and that's it that's common uh how old I re\nUh eighty six\nAnd I blessed shady six years old you otherwise healthy\nUm I'd say I'm I'm I'm mhm the brain is going\n... where's it going [laughter] I'm not going to get it but but I find it a couple of outsiders pills\nI see oh that's tough yeah\nWell um [noise] you know neurological conditions can also be a cause I'm not saying that that's the cause but uh there are patients that have a stroke or um early onset Alzheimer's Parkinson's multiple sclerosis that can affect the bladder\nUm but you're healthy enough I assume to undergo this procedure you need to have a doctor clear you for this procedure you had that done\nWell now\nI see are you scheduled for the procedure\nI'm scheduled for the procedure on November ...\nOkay and you haven't had your eighty six years old you have to have a medical doctor clear you to make sure that you're okay to undergo the procedure\n... that's interesting\nYeah that's very interesting well that's a medical ... okay what's that\nThat says something about the doctors prescribe the\nOkay no no it it it may have been an oversight 'em and you know listen I um [noise]\nYou know doctors get busy and they overlook things and then you know the next thing you know you're getting for this procedure and on the day of the procedure the anesthesiologist is going to say well where's the medical clearance you know at eighty six years old is your you know you got to make sure that your heart is okay I'm a lung your lungs are okay because you're going to have general anesthesia so\nTomorrow you can get on the phone call the doctor in New Jersey I'm shoot assume you're going to have it in New Jersey is that\nCorrect yes okay what you call them and you say you know what I was talking about the cats on the radio he said I might need medical clearance 'cause I'm eighty sick\nWhat do you think uh All right okay right so do that and\nYou had did you have another concern about the procedure I mean the procedure is relatively safe um you you know the eighty six years old I Would say in my hands if you I Would probably recommend that you stay overnight in a hospital I don't know if they told you that but\nUh no they didn't say that the out pigeon out outpatient procedure feature\nThey should I should have somebody to drive me oh\nYeah I mean it can be certainly can be done as an average I'm not saying that that's wrong if it's done early in the morning Fred it's possible you know if you're not having any bleeding and so forth but you could go home you know\nUm but I Would be you you're going to be it's going to be done in a hospital is that right not an ambulatory center right\nOh it's an outpatient center ...\nLike a couple of red flags I'm hearing you know I'm young you know if it's and it's a very large prostate\nOr you don't know I don't know you don't have the right cause a large crowd she\nCalled it a large positive okay well um okay and uh did you have a specific other specific question about this procedure you're going to have\nA ... exactly what does it mean\nWhat does it mean what does it ... it means that it's going to vaporize or steam open your prostate okay team oh\nWell it's not really ... ... you know it it's an electrical I'm a quarter of ... it's an electrical um [noise] you know instrument that goes into the urethra and touches the prostate and it kind of rolls over the prostate and vaporize\nAs the tissue there is a new procedure\nThat uses steam it's called the resume the advantage are easy you and you might want to talk to him about this uh Fred only because the advantage of the resume if you're a candidate for it if your doctor's doing it it's a relatively new procedure but it's done in the office and it's not done with the general anesthesia\nYou know a lot of us are getting away\nFrom using like a plasma button vapors Asian that you're going to you're going to have because it requires anesthesia and they may require hospitalization unless you're prostate is one of those that's really extraordinarily large\nAnd uh and in that case if it was ... you know there are other procedures that you could consider as well\nUm but ... has been you know something that's been a tried and has been well documented to be quite effective Fred okay yes but you could ask him so there's a couple of things you could ask them\n[noise] one is uh do I need a medical parents and two is that my candidate a for some of the newer procedures ...\nSuddenly invasive procedures you might want to write this one down it's called the resume R. E. Z. you am okay Freddy\nGot some homework okay are easy you am right now isn't\nYou know if he does a lot of positive bay for his Asians and he feels you're a good candidate and you can get you in and out of the hospital that same day and you're going to need a catheter did he tell you that\nYes oh good okay you will need a catheter\nUsually are patients with each other they position to have a catheter overnight maybe one night maybe too I don't know how long he's going to keep it in but that's you know to me you know one or two nights difference in that with the capitalization in the long run that's not going to be a big deal but I Would like you to have a proper medical evaluation and that's important\nYou know when you're going to have anesthesia especially when you're eighty six years old and even if you say well my heart is great it's still in eighty six year old hard it's still going to undergo\nYou know anesthesia with narcotics and it could be a stressful situation so I Would like you know to have a medical doctor on board to look at you carefully make sure that everything is okay before I'm all for you to go to the procedure alright Fred\nGood luck to you a thank you very much right to hope that was helpful for you if it was great okay have a good day by day All right\nVery well on the phone lines are open a one eight hundred eight forty WABC one eight hundred eight for eight nine two uh two two and I think you know some of the things that you hear about\nYou know the definitions of so much is there any continent or in sounds like he wasn't kind of because he was wearing pads and having urgency and it doesn't always have to be from the prostate there could be other conditions that short patient recently this actually this past weekend the cause was a urinary tract infection we've had patients that have had\nA bladder stones or stones could certainly caused this there could be other conditions with in the ... that could cause this and\nYou know rarely a especially if you have a history of tobacco use in the past or if you've seen a little bit of blood and urine or you have microscopic but we don't even\nYou know see blood but there is blood under the microscope there could be bought our politics are sometimes bladder tumors and we are seeing a lot more bladder cancer these days thankfully I think overall I don't know the statistics but I ... I have a sense or that the the tobacco use\nAt least among younger people in this area seems to have gone down now I was in Paris a couple of weeks ago for a conference medical conference there were presented on our focal cry of therapy in Paris\nI was just overwhelmed by the amount of people smoking they're both young and old but especially young\nI mean everywhere in the cafes or on the streets young people specifically um young women I I noticed um they all seem to be smoking\nAnd thankfully you can't smoke in the restaurants anymore so it's I mean that is that so annoying I mean trying to have a nice meal and people are smoking but I'm the I'm smoking seems to be rather prevalent over there and I I\nI get a sense and again it's it's just a [noise] I don't have the statistics I Wonder if there are there probably are some statistics about it\nAbout um although I Do see people in the east cigarettes and you jewels and things like that where there's they're taking in just I'm not cigarettes themselves but the ... the nicotine\nAnd some people walking down the streets of Manhattan and smoking [noise] you know beyond the smell of marijuana you smell that but plumes of smoke [laughter] what you know these huge white things for the smoke that are coming out of people's mouths are not tobacco and you know get that\nRobert in New Jersey hope I'm not saying too old here but Robert in New Jersey oh you're having ringing in the air I mean this is a urologist show Robert good morning is that what you're calling me ringing in the ear\nYeah sorry I didn't realize if this was your allergies\nIs well it's it's well I'm a urologist and you know sometimes I have guys talk about different things we could have ringing in the year I mean I Would in the middle ear infection those you know things like that come to mind um in years you probably should see have you seen any anti Dr Robert\nPrimary care and they thought it was ... but they couldn't get it out and um so I have not taken next so\nNext step is an EMT ear nose and throat what do you live in New Jersey otherwise I'd recommend one of our outs that because we we have a gradient T program it at NYU but then have your primary care\nSo I think overall you you did the right thing you had the right indication you had the right treatment you didn't have any major side effects from it\nAnd you have some urine or frequency and getting a one time of night well I mean listen those guys can live with that right\n... mainly I Want to thank you for letting me know\nOh you're very welcome I'm Glad I can help you with that or if it\nThat's great thank you and thanks for joining in I appreciate your phone call [noise]\nOkay uh we have a few minutes left that it's got the two minute warning in my ear a so let's uh I I guess Barbara you have um a question good morning about I guess your daughter's going to have some surgery\nYes okay what kind of surgery she having seven\nMinutes okay\n[noise] we're interested obviously with the\nSame time okay I'm\nGoing to have surgery stitch the area and then come back and put it in the ...\nWell I Would tell you one thing Barbra we have the chairman of a surgery here at NYU winter colon breath away who sometimes a co hosts the show is\nAn outstanding guy for Barry after surgery\nA regionally nationally even internationally and I would trust him with anyone in my family gave him a call tell them you heard about you know a ... you refer to him you know referred you to him or from the show a colon breast way he's the chairman of surgery out here and why you ended up he\nCan give you the real answer OK Barbara but I think you probably can be done at the same time I I mean this is not my field but I think why not just thoughts okay\nI'm Sorry a bar but that's the ... colon breath way to look up and why you went to the hospital on the Internet and check out the department of surgery and you can find blood\nAnd music and the end of the show I Want to thank everyone for tuning in and tune in next week I'll have a great show for a while the weather's going to be nice summertime get out walk around\nExercise take some deep breaths and enjoy the day and go Yankees are I had to get that and see it and\nThe only way to see New York\nIs is that really reflect the views of WABC radio [noise]\n\nCongress nations on health care would not miss any

with Dr\nJohn Holdren gr urgency room physician chief information officer since Nineteen Ninety eight at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston\nAnd international healthcare innovation professor at the Harvard Medical school\nWhere he oversees all educational research in the industry of computing for Eighteen thousand faculty and three thousand students\nDr ... writes extensively on health information technology and is popular blog\nLife as a health care CEO and recently published block chain in healthcare today he\nEarned his bachelor's of science at Stanford medical degree from UC San Francisco school of medicine and his MS at Harvard Medical school Dr Olympic a welcome to conversations on health care will be more to your recently launched this new venture called health technology exploration\nCenter which is seeking to leverage emerging technologies like artificial intelligence tele medicine block chain in the healthcare industry it sounds like a very exciting sandbox to play it and I'm Wondering if you could share it with our listeners\nAbout the new incubator center in your plans to bring some of these tech innovations more rapidly to scale\nUp food and so having better than the Harvard system for twenty five years which you see is an ultimate learning laboratory thousands of faculty and wonderful students patients and data and a sense that we need to make health care better\nAnd you see today in private industry wonderful technologies that deep learning and mobile and cloud\nBut very often these larger companies don't have the domain expertise to actually test out their products that are real health care environments and make sure they're useful to doctors and patients and so this notion of a health technology exploration center is to provide that learning laboratory it's not as if we're going to create technologies to sell to the outside\nWorld it's taking technology is from the outside world and bringing them into a lab\nWith Dr ... you said that data enter opportunities to improve than the standards have to improve first and\nHe said there are three key areas we've we should be able to meaningfully improve the standards in health I T I Wonder if you could share this with us on what you've learned through your experience developing standards within your network as well as working with the top standard experts around the world\nSo the whole standards process is a journey and remember standards are built by consensus so that means a vote of a thousand to one is a tie\nSo it it can be very challenging to get international consensus so as I've worked over the last Fifteen Years on these particular issues of tried to move us from what\nUsed to be some the health care very specific and slightly arcane to something that would be more the standards that have Google or an Amazon would use to create an ecosystem ... products\nAnd so today if your engineer working with a Google or Amazon environment you're using a set of standards called the job a script object notation or Jason and that particular\nA technique has now been incorporated into health care data in a rubber ability using the Oregon not project\nNow they are going to project basically says we're going to take the ... the common kinds of data you use in healthcare problems and meds and allergies in labs and make it so easy that are twenty six year old in their garage without healthcare domain expertise can write a novel apps\nBut there must be security to an addition to those kinds of standards that make data flow and there are certain kinds of standards all off and open id that help us with security and making sure that only their rights actors get access to your data and then finally we continue to work on vocabulary is\nWhat I say high blood pressure hypertension and elevated blood pressure they all mean the same thing\nBut yet we need to make sure that our data flows such that we actually understand what data we received based on what the doctor patient met\nYou know I've been thinking about the the change that we've witnessed since the passage of the high tech which\nAllowed many members of our health care system to switch from paper to electronic health records in fairly short time and with every gift cubs sort of an obligation obligation here was\nTo meet the standards of meaningful used and you said that's placed to heavier burden on clinicians who were overwhelmed by a danger requirements in their daily work for within that to spur innovation that are truly going to be helpful\nWe need to scale back on some of the regulatory restrictions and let the market and drive the next wave of innovation we've sort of developed in her own Weitzman Institute sort of a law of inverse proportion to click the more clicks\nThe less adoption there's going to be so you really have your incubator system really a novel approach to look at how health clinicians think about it in terms of these regulatory requirements that have been foisted upon the health care industry and you're you're quite concerned about it talk to us about that\nWell certainly so let me just tell you how it happened because these are well meaning people trying their very\nBest so as I was chairing these committees in Washington Let's imagine the FDA says we're very concerned about implants pacemakers of things with batteries that fail so we better at every visit have a doctor key in a universal device identifier for whatever implants you have\nAnd all of us said wow that sounds great and then the Centers for Disease Control says a bowl is bad\nAnd so therefore we better documents your travel history on every single encounter and before you know at at the end of all of these deliberations we ended up with one hundred and forty data elements that every clinician must record on every encounter while seeing a patient and twelve minutes\nBeing empathetic and never committing malpractice it's not possible\nSo hence the sense that we need better technology that isn't just more clicks what if Alexa in with appropriate security you know listening to what a doctor and patient sad and then recorded a shark OK well that would reduce bird\nAmazon does by the end of the year plan to have business associate agreement coverage so you can actually transmit protected healthcare information over Alexa but for the moment in the experiments we have done really are\nTransferring things like your name or things that would be used personally identify you and so we probably are safe for the early experiments\nThat huge huge potential for the technology tried Alexa one more time\nAlexa ask B. I. D. M. C. what's\nMy care plan for today you can't play for today include an eight am a blood test ... level and led count at four forty five PM your doctor will be checking in there you go\nFor that is perfect for utilities\nAbsolutely we've been speaking today with Dr John Alaska chief information officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston and international healthcare innovation professor at the Harvard Medical school\nYou can learn more about his work by going to his blog life as a healthcare see I owe ... doctor adopt black spot dot com and follow him on Twitter Ajay Alaska\nDr ... thank you so much for your contributions to advancing health information technology and for joining us today on conversations on health care\nFor my pleasure thanks so much [noise]\nSome speeches and help them want to order you to be true you know when it comes to the facts about health care reform in policy offers to even award winning journalist and managing editor pack checked out awards unknown partners in\nNon profit consumer advocate for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception in us politics learn what if you got for this week\nSenator Bernie Sanders an Alexandria Ocasio Cortez the Democratic nominee for New York's fourteenth congressional district seat are pointing to study they say shows Medicare for all would save Americans money but the author says those comments appear to show a misunderstanding of his study\nThis study is based on the language of a Medicare for all bill proposed by Sanders last year that makes assumptions about reduced administrative and drug caught but the studies author believes those assumptions about savings are unrealistic\nThe study is a working paper written by Charles ... house of the ... center at George Mason University in the center get some of its funding from the libertarian Koch brothers and Sanders and across the court has those reference that in their claims\nThe top line of the papers abstract says Sanders is Medicare for all bill quote would under conservative estimate\nIncrease federal budget commitments by approximately thirty two point six trillion drainage first ten years of full implementation but that's what the government would spend not total health care expenditures Sanders this office points to other figures that show that between twenty twenty two and twenty thirty one\nThe currently projected cost of health care expenditures in the U.S\nOf fifty nine point four trillion would dip to fifty seven point six trillion under the Medicare for all plan that's how standards arrives at his claim that the study shows that Medicare for all would save the American people to ... trillion over a ten year period\nThe studies author however told us he doesn't think that's realistic one reason is that Sanders has built says healthcare providers will be reimbursed for patients at Medicare payment rates projected to be roughly forty percent lower than those paid by private insurers\nAnd the study which he used the text of Sanders are built to guide some ... cautions that the assumption is suspect the report provided an alternative scenario estimate that showed a net increase in health care spending\nThere is a certain amount of guesswork an estimating the cost of something as complicated as the healthcare system we're not suggesting the assumptions made in the Sanders bill are wrong but they aren't the assumptions of them are caught as center study and that's my fact check for this week I'm Laurie Robertson and managing editor effect Chek dot org\nTax

highlights a bright idea about how to make wellness a part of our communities and everyday lives\nCharles slaughter learned the value of entrepreneurship from an early age first as a paper boy growing up in Connecticut then with the bicycle repair business he started to you later he took the passion globally\nAs a field organizer for Mike Rowe finance company trickle up then came as first successful venture travel Smith a hundred million dollar online clothing supply company for serious global travelers\nBut his travels also showed him another stark reality the number of children dying in third world countries from treatable disease is due to lack of access to basic medicine on average\nAnd the countries in somewhere between fifty in a hundred thousand kids failed to reach the one there's only three or four sort of major causes\nOf this a real diseases malaria in pneumonia\nWhat is shocking is that all of those things can be addressed really low barrier is actively delivering what we know\nTrucks water speaking in a school foundation video had leaving his work he wondered how we could put the power of human in the hands of villagers themselves and he realized a successful model already existed\nThe challenge is how can we reinvigorate this idea of door to door healthcare make it\nBoth more impactful and financially viable in places where financial resources are extremely limited I'm thinking about that I Know when the phone isn't there a business model that excels at that and you start to think about Amway and Avon and Tupperware\nFurther research I actually went out and enrolled as an Avon ladies [laughter]\nUm and learn tried to learn from the inside\nAfter training as an even lady himself he founded living goods a company that sells makeup but life saving the central is like drugs to treat malaria and diarrhea and solar life\nIn a sense what living God's does is quite simple we recruit train in support networks of community health promoters who

before the\nGeorge Martin and other giants from from that period of Seventy nine through like eighty one they had no respect for him whatsoever beyond what else he says it would like to ask you to turn off the light switch on the wall and you were a giant you basically said this is what George mark you know you do it\nThey treated him worse than a ball boy it was I was blown away by the story that those early giant told me about young bill they saw him as a disheveled mess as a\nAs a guy who was the product of his father who was established coach at the Naval Academy they thought he was a

told me he was in her room and giants stadium accomplish we once were George Young said that this man meeting ballot check will never coach this franchise\nSo they had no belief in him when he goes to Cleveland and and it looked like they were proven right the players couldn't stand bill in Cleveland I talked to a lot of Brown's in this book who said he just didn't connect with us we didn't feel like he cared about us as people therefore we didn't play for him we didn't win for him that changed the New England\nAnd after the pleasant who played for him as a brown and also the patriots said there was a big change even early on in two thousand one you look building the I felt like he was connecting now with them on a human level and he said I Want to win a championship for you and I know for a fact that no Cleveland Browns ever said that about the Cleveland bill\nAnd hey the guy learned from his mistakes and even though you don't see it\nIn his press conferences the public persona

good Athens right they say that but I Do not always the case then I heard it was a report that young lady from Kansas City you're saying it's going to be nasty out it's going to take away the air attack but I still like Kansas City\nMinus the small number of three you liked him on his story it's tough though I mean he's going to be a tough game the off chance weather's not great but I still have to go with Kansas City to improve to a perfect by by\nJacksonville did lose two weeks ago to Tennessee they rebounded with one over the judge last week Kansas City you say they'll go to five and ... what's up pick number three Danny be\nWell again here's another one a rematch last year eagles they embarrass Minnesota championship game\nThere's not going to be an easy one but I like the eagles okay well that that's right I Do last week they let me down they let me down they moved to touchdown lead it gets kind of lived in ... I had that went into Baghdad was land don't count them till they're all that but I like the eagles at home laying the small number of mine is threatened\nYou know a year that I'm taking 'em you know as important as as all the ones before I think it's a it's one that you like you said I it's a chance for me to prove myself I don't think\nThe fans and and you know the rangers community got to see 'em you know everything that I have to offer and um you know luckily now I'm unhealthy um you know I'm I'm playing a hundred percent and\nUh you know as a player and and the person it's it's just nice to have that uh you know that competing feeling back knowing that you're you're able to play 'em to your full capabilities\nNumber twenty to Kevin shot and killed getting ... rangers and Carol line that third game of the season\nComing up later on tonight don't tell me about the coach you know we talked about the difference between ... and you'll hear into David Quinn\nCouldn't comes over from Boston University everything I've read and seen camp says that he's a real hard as he being easy on you guys for any job coaching job doesn't matter who's gonna break your balls you get it done is that a fair description of coach David Quinn\nYes it is\nYou know it's it's in a good way and I think he he never let you off the hook a and and that's something that's important if you're a young player and an older player um you know I think as you get older and your career you uh you know coaches will tend to to lay off of you because they think that um you know you know your responsibilities but\nYou know pushes you what drives you to the better um you know no matter what doesn't allow you to take a day off and uh for as hard as he can be on new he's right there to reward you and and tell you how good of a job you've done when you do things right\nUm and I think he's he's just a great communicator you know in all aspects so it's going to be great for our young guys he really does love coaching and developing players and um you know hopefully as as an older guy and and being a part of that crew now on the team um we're setting good examples for them as well and and falling and coaches you\nKnow look we know how important goal tending and defenses Ken but you got to school goals bottom line to win games the roster you got right now\nScored a hundred and sixty nine goals in total last year I think what's more than one season so much to be honest that Saudi less than what the buffalo Sabres scored last year and they were the lowest scoring team in the NHL so without getting into the roster will do that shortly you tell me very simply can your hockey team\nPuts up talk of the opposition's nuts\nYes we can no doubt about it we were a team that um this year is going to be hungry or on the net I don't think we got to the areas we needed to get to to score\nLast year and and that was our problem um we wanted to play on the perimeter and um [noise] this year were you know we have guys who have a ton of skill on this team but if you don't work hard and you're not going to score goals and and that's a ... you know that simple right down to even when you're you've player so\nThat's what we're getting back into our game um and I think teams are going to be you know caught off guard when they're losing games four or five nothing through us\nWhile while listen we know about some of the veterans what we expect from guys like local rental even quits cried or what some of these young guys a lot of rain Japan's Kevin very very excited for example for example\nPhillip key told a very exciting player or even ... he's an exciting young players so give the range of bands to give us some of the younger guys on this team that you expect all going to step up and become a legitimate goals scores well\nI think you know ... right now is is one of our leaders on often uh you know he's he's established\nThat have been a job by the way I write he 'cause the\nVantage out and and you know he's someone that we're going to look to play big minutes both offensively and defensively I'm\nPhillip ... is a special player a very dynamic I'm tremendous amount of speed and and what you can do with the puck you know at that top speed is\nAh if what you're seeing a lot around the league right now um and guys like Connor make David and and often Matthews and I'm not going to be a very special player and and you know hopefully work his way up into those ranks um you know it's early now but he definitely has\nYou know a a high ceiling and you know we have guys like bread out and he was a really young player but plays the game very smartly um and then ... is a guy who has a lethal shot a loves getting to those hard areas around the net and he's a bit of a past I think rangers fans are really going to love him because he loves piston teams\nOff um and plays a little salt vinegar\nI Love that now on a second line with ... and I guess that's the\nTalking about Kevin Hays it's funny I actually spent a lot of years down in Boca Raton Florida and I covered the Panthers saw a couple of his brother are so many many seasons down there too but a Kevin or his job ya what the rangers on that second line feel like a lot of pressure on him this year is up there to say\nThere is I think he's a you know he played under a little bit of pressure last year going into a year um that he needs to perform well for for a contract reasons and um you know I think he grew up as well he he mature and he started taking care of himself\nUm you know way away from the ice and in the gym and and diet and you know it's it's kind of instilled in them now and um the thing I've noticed that um you know this year even just a you know early on is that\nHe wants to be put in the big roles he wants to be putting those big situations and he's someone who's going to be a huge part of our team this year I think there's no doubt about it\nUm he's going to play a lot of different roles but he's someone who I think um is a leader by his own right and and ah he without knowing it you know the way he carries himself people just tend to follow him\nNumber twenty two and your wings are program Kevin shot and killed joining us right now the rangers in Carolina game three coming up later on tonight on defense side yeah you've got a couple of veterans guys like McQuade amongst all obviously\nYou're going to be paired up with which Smith right at you and Brandon okay tell me about the relationship between you and blend in on and off the ice\nWhile you know we uh we're obviously both you know new last year coming into the team um and honestly we both had seasons that I think we wish we could turn back\nTime but um you know it's great for us we both are training or in\nIn Stanford the summer with Ben Prentice\nA report a lot of a lot of time and effort in there and and felt like we came into camp as ready as we've ever been um you know we're we're looking like where are you know we're playing with a strip on her shoulder and that's a that's all we can do you prove people wrong and and show people that\nYou know where there's a reason why we've been in the league for so long and and why we're still here\nTell me about ... I mean I I think a lot of people think do you have a pretty good defense court by the way what would you Kevin but a lot of people think Brady Shay can be a superstar tell me about that\nWell life he think he he's he's on his way without a doubt um you know he's been playing\nThe last few years as a you know kind of in Bryan McDonald chateau and and you know obviously he's a good uh Ryan was a good player for Brady to to sit behind and and learn from for the last few years and and now it's this chance to shine and and Brady has\nEvery single tool in the book uh he ... he can shoot he can defend 'em it's just a matter of time before he he really takes that next step so you know it's on us as a ... as teammates or especially me to to keep coaching in and you know telling him some of the little tricks that I Know but\nThere's a lot of things that he does that I Can't do and it's really fun to just sit back and watch them play\nOn the goalie we know of course long quits goes down he will go down Kevin as one of the great old time New York athletes unfortunately unlike Jeter or messy yeah he's not going to win a championship maybe I shouldn't say that he hasn't won one yet I should say oh but he's certainly an all time New York great but I got to tell you Alex the backup goldie I think this kid is terrific what do you think\nHe is he has a I think you know knowing or what Hendrik has done here over the last uh jeeze how many years it's that feels like he's been here\nThirty bucks [laughter] you know it's\nIt's really something that um you know no one really can can test it and it's a it's a tip typically are kept to him and he still works as hard as he does\nIt started it I'm sure as a rookie or that he does today and um you know the fact that Alex is kind of come to the picture now and and he's shown that he's a great little goalie um it's good it's good again it's that's where we have through throughout the line up 'cause we have healthy competition and\nIt only pushes you know the older guys to to work harder and um solidify their spot and I think it's going to do the same thing for ...\nKnow I think Alex is we have some legitimate playing time this year to send work is getting up their own age and his body can't take the uh the nightly abuse so I think Alex will see a lot of action or between the pipes and a lot to be good news\nFor you guys OK last one again number twenty two and your wings are program Kevin shot in Ford's very excited about your season as you get ready for the Carolina so game later on tonight your local kid\nA New Rochelle New York kid so it's a football Sunday okay you adjust ban you would giant fan who the shot and Kirk root for\nI Believe blue baby at all the way through that [noise]\nSo give me more ... you're are you all Yankees giants rangers next what are you\nKnow I'm I'm a I grew up a Mets fan actually my whole family are Yankee fans but ah you know I don't know why in spite of them I just decided to to go the other way but um everything else the non giants fan Nick fan and uh obviously arranges fan growing up\nFantastic we've got the ... exact same teams Kevin met fan of giant fan too butter the rangers have a brand new or pick plan it's a ticking option fans get the ability to pick where they want to sit\nAnd watch games they want this is incredible stuff if you want to see the ... one game when the Bruins next you can do that right now in the pick plan option checked it out folks at New York rangers dot com slash tickets kept listening stay helping\nA good luck and we'll be talking on a couple of times throughout the season you're all great interview by the way so good luck on the ice and thank you so much like you said thanks for having me\nKevin ... shot and cook I should say from the rangers Potter worthy of this speech intruder reports sponsored by Manhattan sports medicine and wellness group dedicated to helping New Yorkers we preserve economic life from pain and I met some willingness to lead on sports we haven't physical therapy visit them at MSN wellness dot com both", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Imus in the Morning", "city": "New York", "day": "07"}
