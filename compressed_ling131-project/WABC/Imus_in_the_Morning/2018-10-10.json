they were the best team in major league baseball\nThey can pitch they got two or three guys in the rotation better than anybody in the Yankee rotation so we can talk about the Yankees losing bowling bad decisions standing striking out at the end of the day the better team won the division and won the series and what that means is\nBrian ... got work to do\nYou want to win the world series\nGet yourself over land or or ... you know wait a yard sale get one of those guys so you can compete I Know they did last year so we can compete on a consistent basis with the best teams in baseball that you have to learn from this series not standing stretching out in the night get pitching\nYou gotta you gotta listen you've got to look back and see what went wrong pitcher and assess that\nYou don't have enough pitching and I'll bet simply\nAll these big batch and all that great seasons\nThey did nothing for two games they scored one one in the race and they wait until the nice thing to score runs in game for the way I look at it they gave us a good Yankees Red Sox October series so I'm grateful for that but you're not a Yankee fan and neither am I so we're like oh that is why I like all that broke up I mean if you die hard Yankee fan you're so aggravated today\nBecause you talk when the Yankees won game to Fenway Park and you were coming home for game three you thought you were going to win\nHonestly the feeling in the city was once the Yankees split the first two games in Boston they were coming home to me not to say if the game for hey nice job guys but we don't care 'cause we're met fans\nBut the truth do you have to look at the series if your prank cash bin ... and then save the truth which is the better team won or not the red Sox were not used in well not the Dodgers we got work to do the bottom of the red Sox afterward in the locker room\nDrinking champagne and playing New York New York sucking up Yankees I think I've ever judges that yeah it was tough\nBut that's it so basically over by by you know what's what's what's great about baseball and every season\nHas free agency the NBA Bernie for example that's become a big deal but LeBron James went to the Lakers this off season\nGuys move around every year exciting moves next year Kevin Duran will be a free agent or Chris pulled I Believe two she'll be NBA all season has become very exciting\nBut the most exciting or seasonable is baseball so even though we're down to the championships series now Dodgers and boards in the end of al ... and ... in the jail you're Yankee fan or a Mets fan\nNot a real point starch what will these teams do to improve their situations come two thousand Nineteen well [laughter]\nLet's let's let's let's let's get out the party hats and enjoy the fun I don't I'm not going to be a slow process others' work to do it's over the match up to hire a GM altogether the Mets don't even have a decision maker right now\nAnd the Yankees guy Brian cash when he needs to shore up that rotation and next time the Yankees are on the spot they're big money guys need to hit bottom line\nYeah a lot of said people out to people who are like and respect or disappointed poor Joe and she was crying this morning no she didn't care and very very ...\nAnd then carry upset ABC will share with us seems should rent but he does get the big brother absolutely are so so people I like ... seats very very ... they don't they don't feel good and I feel bad for them yeah bad\nBut they did I'm telling you came really close in the night then you had the feeling that they were going to go ahead this guy ... started to fall apart never had that feeling you have lots of nights and of course I watched the whole game I Want to say I watched the first inning the whole game I didn't turn it on in the ninth and once the red Sox took the lead\nEven with the Yankees coming on in the ninth unlike do it it was it ... it almost seemed up I think to the last out the big labor tourists are yep and then the review with the umpire\nAlthough he said that was you know the the arms made some bad calls for the president Hernandez was behind home plate last night yeah\nAnd he wasn't very good and see the ... lanes glasses I signed on [laughter] what did they give us and he's calling it for both he's I\nYou know I Can't I Can't stand that so what I don't miss about sports talk radio is again the home team looking for Ninety different things to blame all the umpiring was terrible and boom but\nIt's real simple and we can move on to Nikki Haley the better team on they were the better team from day one of the regular season they were the better team in the playoffs the Yankees are not going to be used in either facing from landed on coal and all those guys so is your brain cash them in my shop one hundred games\nHundred and one really made it to the playoffs one wild card\nGame that was exciting but by catchment got work to do stupid because all you had all you needed was a little voice or a Sanchez and then I thought ... or ... or excuse me a sense then you have to hit a home run or something right and a nice city in the end of the\nGame right there and then he finally even if that happened walk off here and then even if that happened they still have to win a game five in Boston they weren't going to win the series last night so even if that miraculous stuff happen made for TV ending Stanton home run\nThey still got to go to Boston when the game five so that game three laws really destroyed the ex I said it I thought it was one game three was going to win the series I think if the Yankees win that game three to go to games to one I think they went it\nNot only they lose game three they lost in the most humiliating fashion in the history of the organization and they just didn't rebound they just didn't understand\nTony from Beirut [laughter] what do you think\nThat's right well I agree with said Yankees suck prank catchment some more are going to do ... let's have a good day let's go home and there's a big check to\nSee the sports talk radio plus if you guys want to call in today and talk about the Yankees won eight hundred they portray WABC one eight hundred eight for eight Ninety two twenty two of course we're going to take your calls on that what what do you think one ... what do you think you'd have to do during the season\nTo be a better team of two thousand nineteenth but when you when I signed up yesterday\nWe were still here doing a promo for today's show and we're walking in the newsroom I set the bunny I go\nNikki Haley just resign but it's like what and Bernie's expression and the way he reacted is exactly the way every body including people in Washington DC we acted yesterday which is what\nBy the way thanks for helping me up off the floor [laughter] you know you you were shocked I was I was I heard it first from you yeah\nAnd uh yeah I was a you know I like everybody else and it was just there rattled or maybe we love this lady yeah we do we have to ah the idea that she's just going to call it quits yeah you know while she's flying high while everybody's flying high in foreign policy wise is a it's a disappointment\nWell it's a I also don't believe it so I I Know that they came off great yesterday I Love you President Trump I Love you Nikki Haley but like you said flying high up things are going great she's got huge political aspirations she's in a very good position this is before the midterms too by the way that makes no sense to me\nSo I don't care what Trump says I don't care what she said I'm not saying Bernie there's something really devious at play here\nBut the idea that all of a sudden she's burned out if the eight years and she wants to go home I'm not buying that not even at this and here's what I here's where I put my stock in ... which is a that she wants to earn some money she wants to chill a little bit and she wants to earn money she she's not independently wealthy at all\nAnd she can go out now and actually before she runs for office again whatever she's going to do in the future she has a chance to go out now and make a lot of money on the speaking to us so you're buying it you think that she really wants to lead make some money she said I'll tell ya I'm wants to sleep\nShe wants to exercise was keep a tight you know she's a still a young woman and she wants to get paid okay and she's not getting paid a a being as the United states ambassador to the the us all out on the upshot well who knows that they they make tons of money on the side and let's not forget\nAll these politicians who make a couple of hundred thousand thrown multimillionaires over the shift that I don't know what she makes on the side what she does she has nothing to say okay this is a all consuming job she does know no extra you know they'll bust mentality type job okay\nI still don't like it sounds good I mean your stories great she wants to make money she wants to go home I Know you tend to believe the president and why don't you after that press conference I think that was pretty convincing that that it wasn't any room only between the two of that I saw the press conference I don't believe it especially if you look back twenty more people up now run away from Donald Trump\nSo what we both agree he's doing a good job he's a good president\n... for me he's got to be the most typical person talking to you can say she doesn't really work for him of course she does throwing the phones all the time having some of these conversations all the time uh my opinion is he becomes impossible to work with even when things are going well and eventually everybody everybody maybe I started Kelly\nWants to leave their jobs because they don't want to work with Donald Trump\nKept what they said during the press conference yesterday for your doesn't make any sense certainly entitled to that only ... I got the fat behind me twenty four people have left ... well I'm Talking about Nikki Haley I think that uh my assessment I mean a barring any of the facts that there's a void we don't know really nobody can actually say\nExcept uh you know maybe go ... by or on a war take her on a word\nOr but my assessment is yes she wants to just chill out she wants to leave and to make some money okay or not Bernie's assessment you've got mine\nOne eight hundred for rape WABC one eight hundred for eight Ninety two twenty two got a great guess list today\nAnthony Scaramucci on his way to Miami is calling an early this morning in fact in about twenty minutes we'll talk about the uh Nikki Haley situation\nThe I'm the one on Fox Sports that's where the Yankees played last night but the pregame show includes a one guy I forget ... year old\nWho's not bad by the way and Pedro Martinez hate your guts so sad last night was CBS TBS maybe okay what whichever one it is it's the same on every night the same group it Sheffield some guy up\nGot an Pedro now hey Joel is the most uh animated and dynamic of the three\nBut his face got so fast and he's got his his chia pet him do which looks ridiculous it's almost like a an old school Jerry ... yes yes and and the only thing that page has got going and the cat he's animated he's funny\nThe only thing that he's got going for him one of the greatest pictures of all time and even some good years with the match is that only David Ortiz is hard to understand on television than Pedro yes they do have a thick accent\nBut they have a lot of fun oh stop and big Papi I mean come on Arab ... he's a he's like the Shaquille O'Neal a vote ... wherever becomes was he come from\nIt it's funny you say that because I really don't know a Dominican Republic they not only do deal with all the love the shot\nThat all the love jackass I think shock is so bad on the MBA preview show I Can't stand to lose over my right leg point when you can extend the same thing with David around town what happened when I got I got a rod Latino I got last year was Keith on end as a Latino\nPedro Martinez Latino David Ortiz Latino Gary ... year old African American Frank Thomas African American all white guys I played baseball group good guys I don't know what all the Jews there's no Jews I played baseball on on\nTheir all great guys nominal players some of those guys or hall of famers\nBut it's the same thing with John Skipper ESPN write all their efforts to make everything so diverse everything has to be on TV so diverse\nBut it could be that maybe they were the best not bunch maybe uh the the the cream rose to the\nLast talked about you can't even understand the little piece of paper Martinez now that we're ... fun\n[laughter] [noise]\nI'm not stopping I enjoy that yeah sitting there going what do you say well what do you when you're when Gary ... has to be the guy to provide the articulate analysis you know you in trouble that's all I'm saying he as you completely bamboozled that's right well listen\nI enjoyed the guys they light hearted they have fun they break each other's jobs and um you know what can I tell\nYou I'm I'm not I'm not very unhappy you guys are not good outcome watching it for the baseball\nIt's it's a baseball show is not a clue how many days you know I feel his Kevin Burke heart yeah he's terrific he's good so there's a white guy he's the host he's not he's not a former player analyst the host is one thing\nThe whole slash right by the song the whole the whole last night sitting with Pedro All right so there's a white guy to that CBS Fox Sports as Kevin Burke heart you're listening\nBoth stations to host is white Kevin Burke caught and TBS but all of the adelies are all former players and none of them are white I have no problem with it but I wouldn't either I wouldn't either if you are the guys were good but they're not good okay\nSo that's my ... put the radio on\n[laughter] you must put my princess on\nOh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute let's not get crazy wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute there'll be more on what I was in a way it has\nMike here is a blank three it's Bob in North Carolina Good morning Bobby\nBought him a you know one thing that got overlook all lists who bought them this year they were just a great deal of metal baseball team and they had great the parents they are fantastic base crowded and one hell of a manager\nFrom Alex ... your ... your point is exactly every single aspect of the game up an inch deep fans pitching\nManaging strategy in every single aspect of the game to your point Bob the red Sox for better and by the way they were better from day one of the regular season in April not just game four of the playoffs in October\nAnd it looked he put a diverse court and put Chris Sale in the eighth inning yeah a brilliant move to putting a a store like that instead of thinking about well what about when I go to Houston I mean you got to win now\nYeah so I did a great job and of course the moves you made before game three Bernie putting ... second base hit for the cycle putting devil is in a big hit he pushed all the right buttons Aaron Boone pushed all the wrong buttons there's no question corner out managed boon\nBut there's also no question the red Sox are just a better team has anybody checked on a John sterling this morning he doesn't care or you don't think he he gets paid no matter what you get to go home and get away from Susan woman\n[laughter] oh God\nLoves us ... [laughter] how about this guy ... and her\n[laughter] here's pack in Brooklyn on line for good morning pot\nHey guys with morning ... hotel ...\nI I partially agree with you on the ... ... you are right that obviously should work with Trump She had to push back on but\nI think it worked for benefit 'cause now she has a perfect time we\nUm things are going well with everything there is no fires\n... foreign policy so she can step away and then Ernie I Do think she wants to make money but I Know she wants to raise money politically I think\nThe other day they are out there whether or not to say they're not good and they might want to shore but\nOnly for her and her career it all makes you so I she wants to make money but I think that she's going to be able to raise tons of money but yet she wants to leave Trump because things are going good with Trump enrolled for some reason\nThe the only real disagreement over ... only rancor is a thing that I witnessed during her tenure was when the Larry Kudlow said that you seem confused and she fired back and said I don't get confused and otherwise I don't remember any public or a dispute between her and the president and\nI guess what what do you do to hear some Mummers coming out of the White House that she wants to pump pales job when she was upset you didn't get it no she's not going to say that publicly and Trump's not going to admit that so there was some other things that came out of the White House during her say\nThat may make you think maybe then again based on this crazy decision yesterday that maybe there was some things she was holding onto some grudge so anger that made this possible yesterday\nWell let me come over there and joined you're on the grassy knoll and uh we'll talk about it on the Bernie and sister but an Anthony Scaramucci's coming up next Senate has some opinions and inside\nHe's another guy that ran away won't comply with Iran [laughter] other Bernie ... rise\nPretty instead morning [noise]\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTax fund to seven nine six four or five that's F.

run into every time in Washington which is why people don't like wash it yeah\nNo I saw that in fact one of a Trump ... one of those guys go for doing just that for for these slights that but maybe it was priced so I think it was ... he was known for writing about the same time some came out about Nikki that she was enjoying some of the same fruits look we saw something yesterday Anthony we'd never thought we'd see in a lifetime\nYou know CNN Hudson reality check segment on yesterday and during the segment\nThis um this reporter sitting there on CNN for about five minutes\nAnd made a very detailed arguments\nThat last week was a great week for President Trump's Kavanaugh's time from Asian getting kind of involved in the new trade deal the numbers coming up for unemployment GD blunt you want to know whole five minute planned why this is a great we put Trump his past week and they allowed it on CNN about that\nYou know I thought I was actually working out at the gym or it was going on in that I had to go fly by headset to put it on because\nI thought okay where is that they're like\nWhere where what what was the setback coming out can I ask him off that stage\nYou followed that yeah yeah right right at I have to tell\nYou he had a great week and so people can say whatever they want that you have to look at the think objectively\nUh the guy the guy's winning\nYou know now they were probably Saturday Night live is correct or probably throwing in ice\nThrowing already and it does add to the party at the White House with cap it off you know they formed in you know I'm sure they were spraying of champagne that the ugly goggles out they won the championship you know what I mean absolutely I mean the truth him out of the guy had the guy had a great week\nAt a he's in a great food and uh yeah the ... and he's out campaign and let me tell you something like a what we think of this guy he's Seventy two years old he's on the plane every day ... himself all over the country speaking with the same level of the ... in every single speech in every single way\nSo I mean he's going to be very very tough to be I'm I'm looking for the cage match WMA cage match joke by Donald Trump rather get the prize that we've got to get the president on a few slim fast shakes before we could have been\nAround you talk about ... about your friend Michael ... he came out yesterday and said I Want to fight president Donald Trump junior junior junior will tell you\nWhat do you what he wants to look I have I have no idea what that's about what I Love I Love the fact that we have evolved to this situation\n[laughter] sorry calling each other to fight\nI mean at this at this point anything is possible okay if those two guys get in a cage match I promise you guys will be at the front row that\nThat would be going after I'd pay sixty five blocks to check that out yeah\nYeah we're gonna have to wear like a plastic heat shield [laughter] but I got three of us will be at the front row I'll be taking selfies and three of the front row\nSo you you mentioned the president us dumping all over the place indefensible as the ones I used to describe this president now he was in Iowa last night just quickly Anthony's car moved on the Bernie and said show your prognostications for next month's election\nOr in the backdrop you this cabin on a battle when the Senate turned into lord of the flies I mean who's going to help\n[noise] well listen I think the gathering all the help some of the Senate I don't think it helps the er at the house election I think he loses the house election I think he declares victory because they'll still keep the Senate\nOr loses the house which typically happens in a bitter electric for every president so it's not clear to me that this is going to be different if you look at that data the data really doesn't lie or twenty three days out you know data does not look good for the Republican so but I think I think the Kavanaugh stuff Howard him up\nAs it related to fund raising and Howard him up as a related to the Senate but I think that's good news for the president I think you could use this\nAre going into twenty twenty or that the Democrats in the house or obstructing and so on and so forth so look he's going to be very tough to beat I Know I Know his approval ratings are balancing recipes and as a ... fifty other

yours is customized for that specific individual their DNA their blood work their hair rare saliva thereby when a judge doesn't make sense that yours would be the only one that would work for every body\nWell I I mean I think so yeah I mean it's personal life each individual and and that's why we guarantee the weight loss and that's why we have such tremendous numbers women losing twenty five to thirty five pounds and typically in and forty days meant losing thirty five to forty five plus one forty days and yeah I mean that's why we are able to guarantee it because of his personal life each individual\nIt is very scientifically well thought out and again you have a doctor to doctor tour of vets is his name\nHe doesn't have a a you know a bunch of counsellors advising uh the clients like of you know Valerie Britain ... he has a team of doctors and engineers diet the doctor does and again Wellstone scientifically DNA all that stuff it's done a very precisely and it actually works\nYeah we monitor all the patient grave certified how we do have some certified health and wellness coach it that that ah that also uh help out and so forth but everybody is monitored we we look and make sure everybody gets their numbers and make sure that everybody has their goals absolutely\nNo listen burning I end up making a million dollars off this account I Want to make that very very clear\nWe don't old doctor T anything when I'm bringing a mom because hey we're getting a check in the mail tomorrow we're bringing them out because we really we we know we don't believe we know this this this

come I spent all my time chasing\nTrying to become the best sports broadcaster writer in the world I work Seventeen jobs I ... I spent three days a week and ESPN up in Bristol in our new grow up with a ... mile in Detroit yeah him and me were\nBest anyway I hung out you've got his ... across the country but uh you know then I happened\nTo see this old college professor of mine who I was really close with in college and had lost touch with never even called him because I was so ambitious\nYeah and all of a sudden he's on television talking to sixteen years I've been sixteen years\nNow what was your Nightline that night talking about a unless\nHe was talking about dying because he had made a thing about uh he was going to teach his last class to his former students out there about what it's like to die\nAnd Ted Koppel heard about this came up to an interview I happen to be watching TV I happen to flip on rumor control there's this guy who was a really close professor of mine for four years I mean I took every class he offered to you know I wrote my honor's thesis with him everything\nAnd here he is talking about what it's like to die and I felt so guilty that you know I I I called him was going to be one phone call and then you kind of guilt at me into coming to see him as I'll come see you'll be one visit right and then once during the two and two to three and and and\nHe ended up telling me at one point that the thing he feared the most with this disease wasn't the death of the the debt he was going to leave his family because he had amassed all these debts of you dying for two years and you know one way to pay for it\nSo I got the idea that maybe I could write a book to help them pay his bills and honestly guys for all the nice things you're saying that was really the first like kind of selfless thing that I had done in my life that didn't involve in Michigan or anything\nLike that only seven years your jerk and then you became more of\nThat and I I wrote that book and you know nobody wants to publish it and it came I remember that one around here in New York Times and you're a sports\nWriter nobody's gonna want to read a book about you and a professor and we finally found one publisher they gave us the money I gave all the money to him to pay its bills and I was going back to sports writing I mean I was heading right back to my old life and then the book took off really the only reason and it's sort of taking me on this whole other path so\n... it's an incredible I mean if you went predisposed to be the person you are today you you would never have become that but to listen to very humble Mitch album on the Joseph ...

coming up on Saturday Night and they did cover against Maryland last week that's big [laughter] but\nWhat really is going on with a with Jim horrible he has been he can't be a good team he spent it's really been a miserable higher if we're going to be honest Mitch up to this point\nMiserables probably strong but not as only six against Penn State and Ohio State knows what he's won almost every other game it's sort of been had he hasn't\nDelivered what they've asked them to do and this is this the stretch here now Wisconsin and then he's got Michigan State browsing week which is always hard and got Ohio State at the end there there was a bit of a way to buy the Michigan State yeah ... this year yeah\nBut uh I don't know you know the funniest thing about him is that he's a great was a great quarterback\nHe's kind of a quarterback who any hasn't been able to get a quarterback to come to Michigan since he's been there to Ohio State one quarterback goes down another ... steps up\nNotre Dame one quarterback goes down another on America's this kid shape Patterson is brutal but he's also a transfer I couldn't even recruited me out to get them from a transfer so until he gets a really bona fide super star quarterback\nAnd it does what loose saving does with Nick Saban does with you got ten quarterbacks on the roster he goes to one to the second uh he's I don't think they're going to win big and uh I'm not sure they're going to win this game against Wisconsin there there there are good but they're not great\nMitch album the book again the next person you meet in
