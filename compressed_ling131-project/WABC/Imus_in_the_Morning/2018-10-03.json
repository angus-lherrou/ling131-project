are gradations or I'm not so cynical to think that every single program every big time program just outright pays kids become clearly some of them do clearly some of them\nThen we just hear badly and one of those kids at Duke last year the worst some Mummers and went away very quickly I think I was just ... but we just heard something about don't just last year no absolutely\nNobody is pure in college basketball and you know what we have here is the FBI doing the NC double a policing for them they are all kinds of questions connected with this but you know with this particular program with Louisville\nYou know several years ago we had what was called stripper gate at Louisville which was\nFour years of parties and the basketball dorm you know involving escorts that's a few steps from the nose office and again he says I don't know anything about I just don't see a whether he knew or not it's the same question to me how can you know well\nListen to I I Would say just like some topical news that's going on now I mean the guy is innocent until proven guilty unless somebody can prove that he knew you have to give him the presumption of innocence ... all over again the book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino\nA story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nI'll ask you this Michael circle of about Rick Pitino uh is is there any history of this ... prior to this particular instance of Rick Pitino engaging in this type of stuff that you mentioned strip brigade but that he's had a long career or a Kentucky and other places and the other examples of it that you know they're\nNot really there were there were allegations a long long time ago at Hawaii when he was a very young assist tells you the first job actually yeah so no but I you know I'm not sure what what to take from that and by the way the book for me is a sort of a a a look at this whole scene it's not just Pitino\nIt's it's you know it's non fiction but I like to write a book that that people will turn the pages that are all these characters in there you know looks at college basketball must you like boxing is to be back in the day where they're just all these characters you know on the scene on the periphery and ... and it gives you that scene\nWell here's the problem with the whole Pitino story and a federal Bannon who was a very good college basketball player UCLA and once you have to buy the nets by the way your New Jersey he talks about this all the time okay right now it's illegal if it's you know did this it's ... it's it's illegal it's unethical\nBut the truth is Michael you know this these programs makes so much money so much money whether it's Louisville in Kentucky in college basketball or Notre Dame and and and Alabama in college football and the fact that these kids\nDon't get paid it's such a joke and a farce no one's going from education nobody so maybe stories like this we can hold Pitino street to the bio reads a bad guy\nMaybe stories like this will make us come to the realization we got to start paying these kids there's no way you can make an argument that Notre Dame makes a billion dollars on football and some of these kids walk around with twenty bucks in the pocket\nI completely agree with you you know and they take this money and they pay themselves within the baseball coach at the University of Louisville not basketball coach the baseball coach makes a million dollars\nOr ten year ten million dollar contract that's where this money goes the guy in Miami Maurice made even more than that yeah so you know major league managers don't make make that in some cases I mean it's crazy so why can they do that because they're not paying the kids as you just pointed out\nHaving said that uh will you still watch college basketball Michael subtle of [laughter] a lot of drive [laughter] yes\nYou know I Will you know absolutely well the the sport is great the games are great the competition is great I'm so yes like many Americans on I'm going to have a cigarette distraction\nOn the way out then with the trial starting today again we know how you feel about Pitino I don't want to see I I like Rick bunny likes right but it's hard to argue what you just said very hard to argue with that said these guys guilty or innocent when he didn't happen\nI think it's a you know the government almost almost always wins having said that you know the FBI is told a great story um they've laid it out they put names and faces too too long room a dirty dealing but whether it's a great case is you know remains to be seeing the jury will decide that other cases problematic that\nIn this case the victims supposedly or the universities\nI think the victims of the kids but uh you know and as the case is set up it's that they have um given these universities possible ineligible players and therefore the federal crime messed up a victim in this case supposedly the university's we'll see if the jury swell as

teacher who say that he's\nA ... code but that you turned around and there he was the one of those words\nSo that that very very powerful now it's all about the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof for rich Lowry expand on that what'd you boys\nWell this is an accuser her name was male a male or you will and um he destroys her credibility destroyed her on the witness stand with 'em no compunction no uh uh no consideration for her feelings\nUm because one this is our system works and the accused always should get a vigorous defense and be able to confront the accuser something that's been forgotten on college campuses and there's a presumption of innocence there should be that wasn't in this case because the accused was was a black man and Alabama in the Nineteen thirties\nUm but this is how the system it should work and to kill a mocking bird shows not all women tell the truth doesn't mean all women lie I I think most women do tell the truth and they

I mean for instance the show yeah the each show which was aired every single night\nHow much do you think that I got paid for the ... show week zero two hundred though by that's why a hundred dollars unbelievable you know and and and you know and then and then when I asked to have the contract be faxed\nTo my attorney they put the ... or ... or ... you know his henchmen put the contract back in the ... closed it and now the fact somebody thirty and I was off the show either go to our office and apologized for even asking that habit facts only learning\nWell you know in defense of John here also reason is\nWhat Howard said to me you're Howard said yeah journalists and just do what I tell you that\nAnd do listen to Jackie's a trouble maker so our with our was not fond of ... and other people we always one of the first one was the size of the\nBank right and I I wouldn't have\nBeen some people leave that show John what you Jackie Audi audio has been really tough once during the last year yeah so yeah so when you're on the fence it does seem like when people leave the show they\nAlways think Howard but they have nasty things to say about our once they leave and it's not like look here's the truth is is that this is ... this is everything in a nutshell could just starting\nLineup so it's not an ... it's cold it's ... it's like and and people don't know how to be politically correct when it comes to you know last night some girl the restaurant to go to John starting from secret going up to crippling saying live from it [laughter]\nI mean you want to go to John aren't you afraid bark silk but this is how it in\nA nutshell people say to me John is our to is Howard a good guy off the air go he's a great guy off the they go also on the one act like you know off the little ... in other words these greatly just a guy on the air\nIs the real power that's the guy that could say whatever you want some feels it's the off the one that has to hide behind you know that so you know they're scared to to be yeah and then that's the truth but in general well he didn't show the well he didn't share the wealth but he's a talented guy and you know he went on me and he made it\nVery uncomfortable for me when I went to the Tonight Show he could have been happy for me\nThe hardest thing I my kid called me and already line called me about this the hardest thing was watching America's got talent they had a stuttering comic on and this is what I was trying to be all PC and everything you know and get the love of America and\nAmerica is a time when someone into the stuttering comic and Howard was almost in tears going you Howard inspiration you artist rational they'd go and\nHe's been inspiration Tonight Show and you want to tell you\nWhat I Would have helped me to you know and you do when you know you never started you were real snow is growing it's like it's like Carly Simon and milk delicious some possible to sort of wouldn't have gone to like a little known some storms best stuff but I still love Howard today I Do\nWell you you don't have stuff that was will always be sure some of the best stuff ever on the Howard Stern\nShow thanks and like I said like you know that's as this book is not like trash our book you know the true it's true story of I mean I like it it does a lot of great out those about Jay Leno which are is Eric like can't wait to resolve the way I Want is everybody hates you what what happens is that\nThe book you say hey you\nSaid you know when everyone's saying behind your back All right I I only talked to Bernie ... all one easy for you to stay on\nOne very important thing a huge freaking scope use your mouth watch the easy for you to say and again this Friday if this Friday Suffolk theater in a bowl of crap\nJackie Jackie you called back to what the book comes out of rubber ... yet I just I go to Jackie Jackie oh my God I got a ... I said I guess it's all about I gotta quit the drugs that Joan ...\n\nDuring college a former NFL Super Bowl champion signed the most important contract of his life to serve in the Army National guard\nNational Guard and he was a perfect fit around a lot of military my family I think part of what are my family for a long time I want to go up and make a difference I Want to be apart from the vigorous and myself I didn't find that in\nA normal day to day life I didn't find that working behind a desk ... van hands on and being a soldier was something that we can react to give me outside in that environment that I crave and not so much and then the opportune sort of like any any sort of my country was just like okay I Want it in Boise idaho I wanted to be home\nThe national guard given the opportunity to stay right where I was served my country and like it was the best of both worlds real blind Bush plays in the last two and my dad\nI was fortunate enough to him I ... I Want to get helicopters don't want it encourages the Army National guard gave me a chance to fly helicopters and fixed wing aircraft\nTo learn how to be part of the Army National guard log on to National Guard dot com sponsored by the New York Army National guard here by the New York state broadcasters association at this station\nLook into any great business whether it's a manufacturer\nIsn't everything everybody smaller in Japan or does it seem I I've heard that the Anthony what is it like do you work\nOr could be better when you're in the holy unlike me I could play center\nOn the bass I didn't want to bring one of them like that of another\n... like I got another call by state rights that are sitting the tops of every a door [laughter] but you know I had I had I had to get up last night and go through that New York times article good guys read the New York times article yes we do like Susan correct yeah yeah I'm In Austin\nI mean I Know the tactile pretty well uh you know the corporate income person to come back off and obviously you know I did my own taxes and have three or four count like he does not appear like he did anything crossed one so I don't understand why they're going to that direction they want to say\nHe got way more money from his dad started his business and that he told the fed without getting a million dollars I can see taking that and what the story but to say that that he did something fraudulent where the IRS would be all over him\nA prosecuting him left and right I Want a barrier fair but\nI couldn't agree more something I couldn't agree more get really\nThey really just like the guy but you know you just you don't have enough time on the radio but I read that think very carefully I actually call two of my buddies were accounting guy didn't do anything fraudulent so I don't understand why they're saying that about him today but\nIt's the New York times well it's not just in New York times I mean I I actually saw this and I did read the times this morning at any but I saw this\nOn channel seven with David Mueller last night saying by the way the same uh thinking I sometimes at the same level of the source you have the right time but the the point is is I agree with you I I I think maybe his father did give I'm sixty one million dollars instead of one million dollars that may be true by the way his father God rest his soul bread is long dead\nSo I don't even know what the hell this story white even coming up now well what what have you been means\nThey then they want to discredit him they they're they're trying to hit him every\nSingle angle um the level of character assassination now literally it's like they take your toes\nAnd they put it in a sausage gone during the ... you up and we'll start ... you know what happened to me it was like a paper cuts relative to what's going on with Kavanaugh or President Trump's so so they're going to continue to grind him\nA but it's really up and the rivers are already effect you know in the market they call it a residual reversal so when someone's leaning so art in one direction\nOr get kicked typically snaps back and so I think the American public is saying whoa this all out of hand now struck a level of bakery and craziness so so I and they're walking around high five in each other or are we we we got him this time we got this time\nHe is he's out there in ah Tennessee and he could\nDraw crowds like a Elton John it'd be the only guy I met in my life that could dry rock and roll crowd but\nNot play a musical instrument is that possible and and go up to twenty no problem I\nGo out there and and then they perform like Don Rickles to it and then during the Elton John size crowd as you point that Anthony Scaramucci and the Bernie ... from\nJapan speaking of which the down yesterday closed as another all time high but I Want to go to a Brett Kavanaugh Anthony 'cause I don't know if you waited on that anywhere that Brett Kavanaugh situation it looks like the FBI report\nIs gonna be concluded today believe it or not and that will have a vote perhaps starting on friday or what are your thoughts about the whole thing\nWell a couple things ever won if a a justice Kevin O's going back on TV indeed conceal or any of anti\nShine on the [laughter] and he was he was melting down and obviously if you have met a they're portrayed that on Saturday Night so you got to get them a little bit of hair and makeup and not\nDue to Richard Nixon again our\nNumber two as it relates to him personally I'm you know the guy got obviously like beer and it was probably hitting it very or\nThirty six thirty seven years ago so now we have to ask ourselves that question as a society is what are we doing here are we going to judge each other on every microsecond average slice or watch you know\nAnd I hope that's not the case that last point she seemed very credible so you know I've watched the entire testimony\nUm I think something happened to her it's not conclusive that it was him he's obviously strongly denying it and so there's just not a ... not facts on the table related to her to prove that it was conclusively him particularly the situation about not knowing how she got there or how she left here\nAnd obviously the strong denials from the other potential witnesses that were in the room so I think he gets confirmed\nI'm I'll be shocked if he does not get can form because that that'll mean that the Republicans\nReally blowing hard here and I think that'll be a disaster for the midterm so they they lose their base without this was a political thing now guys more than it is a prosecutorial thing and I think the Republicans are looking at a a game theory announces have to conform with\nAn aunt is can from the stuff will die down about him off of that really put them through the ringer\nI got to tell you this is a it's ironic or who the folks on the Judiciary Committee\nThat are actually making a moral poll we talked about this morning and I a lot here in the last couple of days they're making the moral called on Kavanaugh Blumenthal who's like time and time again about serving in Vietnam combat Cory Booker who's at admitted admitted Grover\nA there's other guys on Keith Ellison number two in the Democratic party who just pummeled\nHis ah his love his girl ... these are the people that are calling out Brett Kavanaugh all these other people making a moral decision on Brett Kavanaugh and these are the biggest to generate the got ever created is there not great I only hear well\nIt just add the Seventeen million dollars of confidential slush corny\nOr that your money my money and and your listeners money that went to pay off pages and congressional aides that were sexually harassed and abused by members of Congress so we have yet to see who those people are they got that locked in ...\nAnd so if we're going to go after everybody you can open the ... spots let's see who the Chester molesters are in the Congress right after the million dollars got played so well listen I again I'm not here sanctimonious fully calling judgment on these people are us not sin cast the first stone but let me let me just say this\nUh this guy did not get confirmed talking politically now he does not kicking confirmed a that that blue wave becomes a boost the nominee because the\nThe the electorate will look at that weight I mean you control the house you control the Senate and the presidency what are you guys doing exactly and how many laws are being passed so the president seems to be doing most of the stuff that's going door economic success\nThrough regulatory reform and executive order they've gotten very few pieces of legislation passed\nUm they did get the dad Frank reform which was terrific and obviously the tax reform ah but the point being is if you if you guys are going to let Kavanaugh's clips here to get this was this was premeditated you had the information in July\nYou withheld it until a week before um you're blowing every whistle imaginable as it relates to try and upset a female voters related to the situation I get the move 'cause I I had my eleven day a PHD in Washington\nSo I Know what I Do now and I know how they\nOperate but just saying if he doesn't get the job at this point could be very very bad for the Republican\nAbsolutely right and the Democrats are Anthony Scaramucci ... from Japan a threat the Democrats trashing capital as a drunk as a teenager vis the party of Ted Kennedy\nUpset on that on the way on I Want to ask you this or Anthony Scaramucci not only you had this documentary coming out moods are but also you were actually the answer on Jeopardy the other night I couldn't believe I'm sitting there watching the ... I'm I'm sure you've heard about this\n... yeah and how you guys you guys that I retreated yeah yeah I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm laughing\nAt me they hurt my feelings the party that it was only there for ten\n[laughter] people can't do the math you love and\nYou got to go through the math I got there I got there don't you had me at a nine point one percent of my\n[laughter] or hold on let me get me wrong they got they got they got on there and\nYou know what I loved about the jeopardy question apparently you know my sister told me it was a two thousand dollar Daily Doubles so they were blowing that siren and the whole thing so yeah I'm I'm very grateful to Alex for back for that but what you are you left out one thing before I leave\nA cabin or is also an on convicted ice cube thrower\n[laughter] I just want you to mad I Know that I Know\nYou've got to think about the demonic opposition research they're going back thirty six thirty seven years he threw an ice cube and
