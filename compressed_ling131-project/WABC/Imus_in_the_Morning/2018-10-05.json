that's what people tried toward\nThe Republicans listen don't fall for it it's just a delay tactic they're never going to be satisfied and that's what happened right so now though that the the the allegations the Christine forwarded other allegations have borne no fruit\nPretty much the whole thing now is oh you lied about drinking yeah and his he doesn't he lacks the judicial temperament devise a cause for example maybe that's what they're ... and the fact that uh\nHe lied about both thing and the devils trying that's where we are what what is your book but this is\nAnd again uh I don't know we signed with the Republicans this is me virtue of what he called his virtual ... said to me saying hey I'm going to die bus ride on reasonable exactly no I'm I'm reasonable you you know so but on his own rhythms and that's what we're all signaling [laughter] I bet your ass gauging right because\nIf you follow this whole thing as you do nobody nobody more the new but from the beginning the Democrats set out to do something right\nWhether it's in this case to prove that this guy did something which probably or they can't prove it was the same thing with Russia when they set out they were out to prove that was Russia collusion right now and not borne fruit a sudden they want to obstruction\nAnd that bore no fruit so it's it's been the pattern and move the goalpost they always are they start out trying to do something which they're never ever ever able to accomplish\nAnd instead of talking there to help and eat their legs and saying OK handling\nIt with class they say they stamp their feet and then they move out and do something else they throw tantrums and essentially sore losers that right away it's coming off it's been that way and isn't Trump took overlook they even throughout the long standing principle that we have in this country the presumption of innocence and due process they\nThrow it out the window in their efforts here\nBecause they know they don't have the votes so that they're doing things that even they would have five years ago had said we'd never do something like\nThat well not only the number of votes but ah I imagine one mentioned who of course is a Democrat\nBut he wants to win West Virginia look look let's be honest he wants to win West Virginia and if he's gonna wouldn't West Virginia he's going to vote yes so it's going to be one thing for these folks when Republicans vote yes but when one of their own votes yes that's where they got to stick it never as huh\nWell it's going to hurt them but it is the state of West Virginia where Trump won that state by thirty points or something like that I mean I have a rhyming ally and yet he wants to be elected he's always been thought of as a\nSort of the Susan Collins if you will the the ... the Democratic party and and so he he wants to get elected because the ... there is a little bit of a backlash going on the people see the what's happened what I just outlined the saw losing a mentality\nAnd people are angry about it it's actually this is back firing a little bit other Democrats in that it's it's it's it's galvanizing the other side see I never got its uniting Republican others even the never Trump the people the Republicans who hate Trump there with him on this\nSee I never know that um because it depends what your watch what you listen to what you read I still see plenty of stuff every single day all day long\nFor folks that's where the capital is still guilty no one is apologizing for feeling that way nobody's coming to Trump side the only time will really good to know whether or not there is Donovan icing whether or not people are really upset all elections that ...\nAnd ... we have it I Know you know your cynical about ... and you should be but the none other than NPR PBS Marist Poll that NPR shows that the enthusiasm that the Republican enthusiasm posed this cabinet spectacle is is up ten points yeah but again if I let me go\nTo the polls out what everyone had Hillary up by a monstrous amount before Trump won so is it really found out and say well we're going to use the poll Ramadan\nMaybe not but the the the dynamic works the other way in other words if you support anything that Trump support you keep that you hold that to yourself and you don't you don't say that you don't tell a pollster that you keep it that this is still at the Trump shame or or or stigma a supporting something that Trump support so\nSo if anything it works in his ... the Republicans favorite but I point this out you guys like rich Lowry there's this other guy he he was never Trump or ... he didn't like Trump\nHe's all into doesn't love and buddy's companies come around yelling at actually with his cabinet than another guy he writes for the New York times name is Brad Stevens I don't want to get to inside the weeds\nBut he used to write for the wall Street Journal loads despises probably wrote a column in the New York times thank God for Trump on this issue they got the first thing he said they attacked the press\nAnd so that's Brad Stevens that's a that's what I'm saying is they were there'd be uniting the republic you ought to I Hope so because instead of character assassination just throwing out due process all of this stuff that's despicable stuff and the short losing you lost the presidency\nYou lost the Senate you don't have the votes so what are we going to do not divide us for you in the process of Senator Dianne Feinstein and Schumer holding on to this allegation but they they exploited this woman\nHolding on to that allegation for months and bringing out at the last minute when they could have brought it on a long time ago and had a more thorough investigation if that's what they really wanted\nBut they didn't they exploited are released or a name again against her wishes\nAnd people see all this stuff I I Believe and I think there's going to be a certain amount of backlash come November\nAnd I do believe the guy's going to be confirmed tomorrow and open the Congress a congressional Senate for what time is the vote today today\nI don't know what time they called ... it's going to be some time in the afternoon and then they have thirty hours to the no filibustering though if it goes though right no that's right I'm cannot filibuster this will go through right but the tomorrow will be open for a vote the hundred senators vote\nI mean that's when you the real drama curves that's going to be some supposedly around five o'clock in the afternoon or something like\nThat I write one eight

for when you have the the people who hate ...\nAgain like rich Lowry Brad Stevens I pointed out earlier they're all ...\nThey're not all in there's a couple you name you know Chuck Todd said it's about gender has nothing to do with gender this is all about I Know plenty of women women that loves Donald Trump called for a liar then during the women that hate Donald Trump\nAnd they think the cabinet is like it's nothing to do with gender it all goes back to ... have reading right he's wrong but it it all goes back to\nTry like Clarence Thomas and Trump wasn't around during clerics on the similar similar dynamic to that it's it's a it's a conservative going through the Supreme\nCourt right and the Democrats are doing playing dirty tricks to try to keep 'em off got it you have that drama and Trump is ... yeah he appointed capital but\nIt wouldn't matter if it was Ted Cruz who appointed the capital you would have the same thing but you know because it's a swing vote on the Supreme you always say that I could not disagree more it is a swing vote on the Supreme Court it is important\nBut the amount of hate hate hate but Trump that's in my life that is a factor but it would outweigh Ted Cruz us telling you Ted Cruz was low density I hated Ted Cruz yeah and they would have done to him what they did the Trump they really would have I I firmly believe that an okay and that's why this uh this thing\nIt it just it it it it is partially Trump but it's more the Republican Party and the Supreme Court at a conservative judge getting on the bench\nI think you would have seen it no matter what even it was Lindsey Graham again who now is all in that's another guy a guy who was an eyedropper at one point he was when he supported take grows and now he's all live with Trump and especially with Kavanaugh\nSo I don't know whatever you want to see if we want to take\nA break we'll take a quick break the bones of all it up Matt deal Kathleen Judy victim more Scott

Democrats are actually slightly favor I\nDon't see like almost one thirty I was surprised at times got that right but number\n[noise] yeah so I mean in general the opposition party of any uh election typically um\n[noise] you know is get gain some traction in the mid term so I think part of that it is we're seeing sort of the wave of of Democrats getting him um [noise] you know being up on the generic ballot for two dozen Eighteen so we'll see you know where it ends up for two thousand twenty\nBucks on a second I gotta stop every second because you want the dams you the betting public has the dams as winning back control in November yeah yeah\nThe Donald Trump impeachment odds\nLeno was minus three hundred so that makes no sense to me because if the Dems take back the house they all certainly going to try to impeach Donald Trump so if that first number is right why is that second number so huge that says no doing teaching Donald Trump\nYeah if you're a question and answer clarify um you know these\nAre not the action networks are these are a sports book dogs were just sort of covering them so but um I I absolutely agree with you I I don't quite understand the odds on that because\nDoes look like the buddy market so that the Democrats are a very very strong favorite to take back the house and I would say in my opinion that it's quite likely in in that case\nThat um that Democrats would bring together articles of impeachment so uh obviously very unlikely for Donald Trump to the actually removed from office which is\nThe role of the Senate and it does look like the Senate is likely to be retained by Republicans but I agree with you ... the odds are very often that in that regard so I'm not quite sure why\nI'm you know for Trump being impeached is a it's so often compared to the house on\nYeah that is a very interesting stuff there of course in the Senate they need two thirds of the Senate to a convict and throw a the president and out of office\nAnd you know are we talking to Brian ... sees what the Action Network where you can bet on sports politics anything\nAnd a lot of the stuff I see here uh uh Brian is very it's legitimate stuff but there was some important considerations uh like age I mean you can with people bet on is there an over under on whether or not somebody will be still alive\nSuch funny like a dead pool like that like Chuck Grassley and Senator Feinstein both eighty six years oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg is eighty six freaking years old\nSaying I bet that is if you imagine\n[noise] you know I haven't seen those odds but or maybe maybe you guys can make it happen\nThat will make them on how to be very ... homeless in one more on the way out and uh what can you can bet at sports Action Network they provide you the lines and the odds and all that and it's but you can't but I Want to make that clear I'm On the way out of ... if you ... if you can bet somewhere I'm going to give you a lot Kobe Bryant only one you want to ...
