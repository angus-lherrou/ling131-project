C.\nYeah I Love this guy he was a great met but the truth is it's not a bad season and they could afford to do all this loving it because the games don't matter\nWhat they could have a say clinched the season say a week ago and maybe hadn't played by different story right\nOr as you know who it turned into almost a near disaster because the Mets didn't wait until the bottom of the Thirteen and then they had a speech and fireworks is right way to put the crowd so stuck around the area but what are they going to do what they're going to go\nHave a goal I mean if you're if you're there in the first place you'll be able to get diehard fan and it it was sold out [laughter] I Know but you all your will let me look there's a lot going on right now you got you know the the football season is basically over in New York because both the jets and the giants stink let's just be honest they both stink but\nYou've got so much going on right now but if you're there for a game one sixty one on a team that's going nowhere it took me a clock in the morning you want to leave it [laughter] I mean you want your dog in all David on the ...\nI was happy to see I always ... ... ... people were starting to worry at least the guys in the booth where but it ended by I'd say eleven thirty or your most midnight ride the crowd was a entirely there\nAnd it was funny to the uh he he he back twice struck out more often and on the war was the uh it was a fly ball to the first baseman who fought it right near the seats\nAnd every single time that guy either got up to the plate or was involved in a play he got vociferous leap bowed yeah for catching I'd be ... I don't know what they wanted him to do dropped the ball I guess it was funny in that sense that he was all of a sudden this guy's is this major villain catching a a pop fly out\nIt was funny to see you know and I told you the story before when the match\nYou know Nineteen Ninety nine but are they made it all the way to be and I'll see us and they lost the Atlanta Braves two thousand they want all the way to the world series they lost to the Yankees always under Bobby Valentine\nAnd then that team kind of fell apart that was my Piazza a ... hour light or my campaign and the Mets were really bad like Bobby Valentine gets fired they bring in order to how I'm doing the midday show with Jodie McDonalds I W up my end up to us with I miss\nThat it's something to look forward to those guys are all gone\nAnd now we start to look towards the future\nAnd at that point the met future with two guys in the minor leagues named Jose Reyes and David right yeah and the future came quickly because we're really really bad but he was Jose Reyes who led the league and stolen bases three times as a ... including Seventy eight steals in two thousand seven he led the league and hitting\nIn two thousand eleven get three thirty seven got like the league and hitch in two thousand eight not nearly the storied career that David Wright how does it matter what a brilliant Korea I mean the guy let the league in his batting averages stolen bases\nAnd he was out there yesterday too yeah with David right on the field at the same time\nNobody cared [laughter] that was David right it was Jose it's got nothing they give some props they W announcers did but none of the fans cared about ... ... and it comes down to two things first of all Jose was miserable the last couple of years ago ... personal problems\nThat personal ... talking about hits right [laughter] I don't make sense forgot about that so between his personal problem in Colorado and too bad years with the match at the very end and it wasn't nearly the amount of admiration and love for hosting us for David Wright oh there was\nNo but they were the big duo two thousand six and a yeah I mean they showed each other a lot of love for example on a Saturday Night a lot of hugs lot of a well like when you and I signed a contract to write a lot of that one of those\n... David White never left the match he spent all of your Jose Reyes little league and hitting as a ... in two thousand eleven he won the ... title it three thirty seven and what do we do the very next year two thousand twelve he went to the Miami Marleine [laughter]\nNo rights that Wright was here and in fact he grew up in Virginia a Mets fan yeah there are a triple a team down there I Believe and he felt like a Mets fan and he doesn't\nThat plays never felt like an outsider because he grew up again rooting for the minor league team and then of course playing for the ... they ... he exclusively only ever played for the New York Mets yeah and so it was it was very sad it was very nice\nAh but let's put it this way he won't be hurting for money or anything like no no no no don't say it was ... he got a hundred million dollars to basically not player but but you don't know the real work\nFor the Mets begins first of all\nIn the midst of all this by by David right we love you we love you just put as their highest paid and best up an ... player comes out to basically says\nI'm not sure if I could play into a house in Nineteen [laughter] he's got another surgery coming on October the twenty third then you've got to match let's not forget sand the oldest in step down this year so the match as we speak\nOr in search of a new GM ... not so big deal there saying we're not going to grab somebody from in house it's not going to be ... we're going outside they wanted somebody wanted run darling run well yes I don't want the job even want that so you got a GM search going on just but it's still hurt\nSo again I mean the important stuff is important stuff is not what David White dude in two thousand eight it's what the Mets are going to do in two thousand Nineteen and all of that remains a big mystery so once again it was a bitter sweet\nWeekend for me as a Mets fan because I Love with David right there but I'm always more concerned about tomorrow then yesterday you gotta varies\nI mean [laughter] that's that's the that's the message slogan for real again\nThere is a race David Wright didn't shed any tears the visible tears Saturday and I thought I saw somebody came back out through the dugout are going to show a little bit of a maybe the lip quiver maybe it wasn't a little bit of that it wasn't ... people are looking down the street and something about Mary Boleyn Brett Kavanaugh\nA look look quiver\nBut he was classy all the way and again it was it was just a nice thing that they did very very nice I'm Glad you mentioned but Kavanaugh because we will cover that uh extensively today we've got a couple of big name gets coming on Sebastian Gorka\nHe's going to stop by today's show David Clarke he's going to stop by today so after the nine when wall to wall on friday and I thought we covered it as well as anybody we will cover Capitol again today\nBut it felt good this weekend to go to Atlantic City do much sport show live from there on Sunday escape get lost I got lost and the jets the giants and the Mets and the Yankees in college football and the fact that hockey season starts this week the rangers will host Nashville opening night Thursday night\nIt felt great I didn't watch one show yesterday\nI Know what Lindsey Graham said I Know what you ... up all is said but it felt and I know what ... west did on Saturday Night but it felt great to get away from the Brett Kavanaugh nonsense for a couple of days joined the club all weekend respite from the madness I Can't stand it anymore myself but uh\nWell documented today though it is what it is and I said it is so we'll do some sports with law Salzburg coming up later on this hour as I said Sebastian Gorka and sheriff David Clarke stopping by today going to be a very spirited Monday show burning and sit back from a big weekend back on Monday but if they're these words\n\n[laughter]\nHey folks phones here\nBut it's the first day of October yeah\nI Love this time of

in Brooklyn the only full service and breast care facility the first and only led by the great surgeon Dr Patrick Morgan as I said this is a breast cancer awareness month\nShe's was only a quarter of the way don't you hate to get too dramatic but football season is already over in New York yeah play or was it it is I just tell me this question they drafted a ... he was towards the second round pick but\nThey only gave him they only handed the ball all through um ten times\nHe's like I mean given the ball\nThis guy he's got the potential for an explosive game changing breakout yeah give them the devil both teams and I'm Glad you brought that up because the jets also a band in the wrong way too quickly yesterday and that goes on Germany ... Todd Bowles as clueless he's always been clueless\nSomething this guy comes out and says\nI don't know what else to do you do what we have the audio of that then when you say that by the way you're about to get fire but I'm Glad you brought up the quantum because both up into coordinators the jets\nHave Colin Powell they never talked to the football giants have bought me like you just said\nHe barely touches the football I don't get that you're both teams abandoned the running game when they were still in the game go get it I mean come on just give the guy the ball the jets as you point out that they just got completely ... but the ... well I just a funny I mean Todd Bowles he's always got made fun of them but\nHe did yesterday he was the vintage Todd Bowles and is a is dopey statements listener\nUsually fight them being ball games are usually in every ball game for the show so in the foot two months in the first\nThere you go back to the drawing board at every phase of the fence special things as going back there on or how much I guess they're explaining when we didn't look very good especially when the other side of the boat and they all kinds of science and the first half and gave away too many yards on way too many things that we see every day it was not very good\n[noise] you know he went on to say like the bucket dead which Michael car brought about today I don't know what else to do you say that you're basically saying I'm sort of like do I can't help us anymore\nAnd that is the perfect recipe to get fired but he's right I mean that the defense was terrible like portals looked like Joe name is reborn yesterday no matter what the jaguars are very good team I Know there were awful in week three against Tennessee\nBut we've seen the titans now start the season up three in one they may be better than we thought anyway\nBut the jets were completely out played on both sides of the bowl the giants same exact thing I mean I Know they were only down twelve seven the giants\nAt one point in the third quarter but you never got the feeling Bernie if you watch the whole game like I did though you're never got the feeling the giants were going to mount any ... every day no they never did and it's just\nYou know you've got a new coach and all these exciting players on a billion dollars in and they're still great players back on there's a great player Barkley is a great player but the quarterback is so ready\nFor the little dumb stuff this little three or dumped past because he's scared to death the line is going to get them killed I don't know what it is but every giant up in some places it thinking dunk when you've got big plan makers on your lap and\nI Know and they listen in fairness to ah Todd Bowles a sharper himself the coach of the giants [noise]\nOne of his goats was we need to score more points no kidding right and then he went on we had a good first Dr we got to do more of a throughout that's what I make the game yeah they said they scored a touchdown the first ones that are diving Doug give us a little more insight than we've got to score more point while you know John meikle who you love dearly\n... yes I Do want to consider them family absolutely the very famous update man and a couple of what me on the show their skies made a living doing updates God Bless them yeah well I mean he was doing some soul dismissive out I'm not sure why [laughter] [noise]\nHe was doing college basketball it may have been butler maybe St John ... I got used to do I don't know if he still does he used to do a West Point games where I Am every Sunday football sat on his arm he won't be football I think he thought St john's basketball now I think\nI I did the St john's army he gave up and two thousand eleven right so he does say giants games I say you know what brand in ... right yeah that represented in America\nRight we're going to do the St john's games together ... years ago he just bought the basketball before he was an army football and he was asked\nWhat's it going to take for butler to win the game today and he said they need to score more points\n[noise] I Swear to God and you know he wasn't kidding he was dead serious\nYeah ... ... what they need to go more points on the other team [laughter] I mean you're right I mean fundamentally yeah we do they start simple right to the question is what do you have to do to get to school more point and my fear is is that neither ... with the football giants\nOr certainly Todd Bowles but the football judge has any idea\nHow to do that though and by the way it gets no better for the giants they face a Carolina yeah and then the following week the eagles the schedule is rough they're going to be one in six and the jets have Denver next week so it's over ...\nYou know the Yankees have long run in the playoffs and to me it's very bleak six months or a bed for ... I mean all the sports in New York\nThe Knickerbockers start their preseason tonight against the Washington Wizards but they're not going to be very good\nRangers open up downstairs here on Thursday against Nashville they're not going to be a very good the islanders open up Thursday in Carolina then they've got Nashville in Brooklyn on Saturday they're not going to be very good and the double ... admits an oil rich in Newark on Saturday\nAnd I'm not going to be very good you don't forget the or the New York Mets a moniker just let's go with the you got to believe for New York in general of New York it's brutal except for the yanks except for the Yankees with outlook that we don't want to jinx that we want to keep it exciting listen they had a great year\nThree teams in major league baseball when a hundred games this year the red Sox\nThe Astros and the Yankees they want a hundred games they broke the all time record set by the Nineteen Ninety seven Seattle Mariners from most home runs by one team in a season me Kelly into hundreds of rookie broke Joe Joe ... Joe DiMaggio was record for doubles in a season\nThis amidst all the injuries or the nonsense about Aaron Boone all that went on the Yankees found a way to win a hundred games and hosted the wild card game on Wednesday and yet still\nThey're playing the wild card game than they had they didn't clinch first place was better don't know I Know that but at the beginning of the season that you recall and anything short of appearing in the world series to the Yankees would be a fairly well but\nThat changes what a team wins a hundred and seven games inside your own division that nonsense you're talking about a march look at the Yankees won eighty five games this year you got to go yes but if they win a hundred games like they did and this type of season\nAnd they haven't to lose on Wednesday isn't a disappointment yes what a lot of people considered a failure yes but you went to a hundred games he bought a great season that's the bottom of the good seasons yeah but not a great season it's not a good season Ninety when there's a really good season you win a hundred games let's\nBring a hundred James you know make the playoffs they made the playoffs Wednesday's a playoff ...\nIt's a playoff game it made the playoffs a it is one of the disappointment\n... is a disappointment to a lot of people maybe not you know but that still goes with the expectation is that what was being said back in ... in the spring and I just want to call people to account remind everybody that I Would say okay now a lot of people say a lot of stuff\n[laughter] they do let's see what happens on Wednesday and we'll find out next couple of days who's going to pitch it should be ... I think it's going to be how's it going to catch you [laughter] wait a second I'm not the same room Oh yes you have been\nLost souls were breaks it all down in the morning but Capitol coming up more after these words [laughter]\n[noise]\nHey folks were ready to introduce we've introduced it already the most advanced sleep surface ever created\nThe my pillow mattress top are just like uh my pillow you know and love for my film actress suffered guarantees you\nThe most restful deep feeling sleeve of your life [noise]\nMy pillow mattress offers later freelance by the way I Love this thing just personally I'm telling you folks\nI Love them I told him that for suffers like sleeping on the air I get great and I sleep on it and just hanging out on and I\nAgain it's ... three layers is going to transform your sleep just like his friends for mine but the first two phone layers they provide superior support evenly distributed body weight\nAnd regulate temperature throughout the day all covered with a super durable and softer than so five or ... right off and it's completely machine washable driver\nTrust me if you're friends uncomfortable don't spend your money on a new one you don't need it to five ... instead of my old mattress offer will transform your bed and your sleep and right now for WABC listeners gets thirty percent off the whole new my pillow master suffered and to standard my pillows and one great bundles\nWhen you use ... W. A. B. C. scratching my phone's dot com today you promote WABC for this great this general call them at eight hundred eighty seven Twenty one eighty five that's my whole dot com or eight hundred eighty seven Twenty one eighty five\nSee that yesterday they have the um the ... even similar\nTowers the tunnel or the other five K. wanting more yesterday ended up ... beautiful only for that really was this uh this guy had five kids by the way he ran with sixty pounds\nOf um of equipment on his back and firemen he was on his way\nTo play golf and play golf yeah and he came back he ran through the tunnel five kids ended up dying the towers that day but yesterday we are the animal five K. run it was a beautiful thing\nAnd that does pose this question folks were you in lower Manhattan like I was after nine eleven living working on helping with the rescue recovery clean up for construction efforts\nAnd we've been going back to the spring training talking about the Yankees my biggest fear\nWas starting pitching well now they're starting pitching has to show up Wednesday otherwise is not going to be any tomorrow\nNo there's no doubt but but it is worth talking about the up and you know we feel like we spent so much time talking about Aaron Boone and everything that went wrong with the Yankees but\nThen a season where they launched judge their best player for a long time they last duty they launched Sanchez they lost pitchers they've lost Chapman team won a hundred games this year rush a hundred\nThey broke every up into category they broke the all time home or microchip by the Ninety seven mariners me go into hard actually broke Joe DiMaggio ... record for doubles as a rookie so you look back with all the nonsense and all the talk and they may lose on Wednesday it's one of my keys in ...\n... no question about it and everybody\nGot very excited and probably you know understandably so but because they came within one game but go to the world series last season you know how it is especially in New York okay get ready to win at All right away this year and a list that\nThey ... they didn't have one rookie they had two rookies and they're starting\nLineup tourists and end the heart and tourists was the guy was getting all the Yankees\nAnd by the way Tony ... was the guy that hit the hormone that actually\nDo they do I buy you're right you're right but to me what an too hard on I mean as far as I'm concerned hands down he has to be the American league rookie of the year and and his\nHis home runs and his doubles not only what what what the numbers impressive but he it seems like every one of them was in a court situation like that's a good thing for kids to be able to do\nThat is huge a rust Salzburg on the burning said show but the but the two are sick nice to just sit in my discussion earlier\nThe fact that they they they're going to be one game away from the real playoffs I mean and and they were expected to go all the way to the world series if they lose in this or this particular local game would that be considered a disappointment\nOh and our question is going to be a disappointment now that there's a difference between a Bernie calling it a disappointment and failure\nRight I find that hard to believe\nYou know as I said before they want a hundred damn game you you you can't say you were a failure fit it it will be a an immense disappointments all parties concern\nBut a failure listen you know like like what happens if two guys like two hundred a ... you know you get to the world series\nAnd the two best records in each league a and one guy loses try it it's not a failure\nI think we we have a fan of I mean back porch for some reason we like our team\nIf the Yankees lose on Wednesday sure will be disappointing but what are you going to do you got a tip your cat to the red Sox won a hundred and seven games this year has nothing to do with the Yankees the Yankees out a great year\nGreat here but you got a tip your kept to the red Sox let's move to the giants you were there yesterday I don't want to hear about I'll go back in June you're not his fault I'd watch he was open a couple of times you I'm from\nI don't hear about Barkley I'm Wondering about the opposite of line and you don't eat like manning the giants have not caught thirty points now for thirty six straight games thinking about that guys that's nearly three years with a giant ... has not been able to score thirty points\nAnd we always say this one has been the one constant for the giants who's always been sort of last year for a couple of games\nThe guy behind center at the manual you could take your two Super Bowls you'll fifty thousand yards three hundred touchdowns you'll never noble whole team they take all of that I Am telling you the biggest problem for the giants and it has been for years is a God damn quarterback [laughter]\nGeez talk about this in any failure you're ready to roll out a lot\nLess than that I get it and it has been disappointing but when he was twenty five for twenty nine last week for two Ninety seven to ... days everybody what\nWhat has gone up ... that's one good way in the bottom it it's always so we got one good game between bad games\nWell hold on a second I I'm not saying he's had good games quite frankly the team is had\nThree lousy games and one good game which was last week I mean yesterday was kind of shocking to me because they started out\nThey go ahead on their first possession methodically move the ball down the field as horror cuts down I'm I'm saying to myself listening on on your show yesterday on just one Sunday what was talking about we were talking about if you're going to beat the saints you got to be sustained drives the best way to do the best way to

and everybody else and liberties with the smart people sub was slow down he's got Mexico he'll get Canada next then we'll get your ... and eventually that is going to translate to Russia China whatever's out there he's going to get it done and just as those people predicted\nThey get to a deal done with Canada and that's a big deal did our friend running sonic concur\nYeah daddy I think he said that Canada would eventually come around and so what Europe because you know the detractors like to talk about how\nEverybody hates Trump and they want to do business with Trump instead of seeing the wheel picture what which is he's calling the shots were with him in the United states is holding the car right so it was actually they all have to come around and now Canada came around\nExactly right they did it as a matter of fact that that happened just yesterday late yesterday and they're not going to call it an afternoon going they're going to call it the U.S MC\nAssociate Mexico Canada until the ... euro that what\nWell in this case it's just going to be a a a you know a continental thing here okay and we make separate deals with the Europeans we he's not into multi tight lateral agreements that's his whole that's Trump's whole thing I mean to make a deal with the whole globe but that will be cat run counter\nTo his approach he would uh given his druthers he would just want to deal between the United states and Canada and the United states and Mexico and that's what he was driving at initially but uh this apparently uh we got we will pretty much do we want it because a candidate came around and this is if the yes last week\nSomebody as Trump or what about the Trudeau he's just forget about him I don't like what he's saying we're not we're not talking anymore that was just a I think Thursday and then the alas lo and behold Sydney yeah we have a deal with a Justin Trudeau and uh it's going to be good for American workers from what I understand yes\nSo congratulations to price them Trump from once again getting a deal done and doing it by the way on our terms not yours\nThat's right yeah I Try and that and and also being a relatively restrained in this a cabin or process pretty much staying out saying the right things uh the the the FBI investigation may be a blessing in disguise\nAnd uh so we have we we had that since we left you and I left yeah the big surprise with a with a Jeff Flake\nWho has been called everything from a sucker to Jeff snowflake you've got yelled at in an elevator by a couple of women one of them who works for this guy a George Soros is my my former tennis partner by the way this a very left as the organization that he runs\nAnd the other one claiming to be a sexual assault victim and they were screaming at him as everybody has heard by now I'm sure like I mean what I'm Talking to you right and he was rattled and uh he made a deal with the with with these Democrats now they they call it a compromise\nBut he he agreed that if there's any information found that you know indicates that a capitals guilty in any way he wouldn't vote for him\nBut I guarantee you the guy who made the compromise with Coons isn't going to vote for Kavanaugh if they don't find any\nYou know or any any uh indication that he did something wrong I guarantee you so that's I don't see the compromise I Do I mean they they they gave another week to for for people to come out more people will come out of the woodwork\nAnd make a allegations now it could be again a blessing if the if if the FBI sticks to ... current credible allegations and they already a David interview that woman from Yale\nHaven't talked to the ... Ramirez this one from Yale and sweating it is he a swelling an odd way she's got many problems I mean the once they do is they did a background check on her\nShe'd be so they're not even bothering with her so that it could be a blessing in disguise well we'll see what happens already have one guy from Yale coming out saying that he was he was always drunk and he was black and al ... already out that you know an substantiate it of course but does so they're going to try by by a preponderance of I Know they'll get\nHigh but but the correct me if I'm wrong the FBI looked into this guy six times already six times they found nothing\nSo what makes you think unless you believe the deep state the FBI is in bed with the bad guys\nWhich by the white you're allowed to think that you're based upon you know Jim Comey what's worth a shot clock shut off Jim Cole me to have you called this guy said dirt bag corrupt or a loser but the truth is is six times they found nothing why believe\nSomething's going to pop up on the seventh\nThere was an excellent question I mean the ... the cat and the FBI be trusted I guess\nThis guy ray they could be that as a joke going around saying that a truck should nominate Hillary Clinton yeah this way the FBI do a proper investigation of her crimes finally [noise] that is funny but ah that's not happening but anyway Jeff but they're not calling a foxhole flick the guy got rattled\nAnd he and he actually said over the weekend that if he was running for re election he never would have made this deal yeah with the Democrats but he just looks like a fool\nHe was that this this goes global citizens a rally in Central Park\nWhere he was on stage with codes believe it or not here in New York City there are states get like these two guys traveling like ecological or a lawyer Martin Lewis and he made an elevator referencing the crowd started screaming and cursing at them so if he thinks\nThat he's in great shaded himself with a certain group of people do they still hate your guts they do though I think you know ... wasn't going to face the nation was he was on sixty minutes last night tried sixty minutes a matter of fact we do have some audio from that are right and the new thing with the uh Democrats is they're saying and Coons said this last night the Senate\nDemocratic senator from Delaware Chris Coons who\nFlake made the brokered this deal with\nHe says that ah well look the fact that capital got so angry forget about everything goes well listen to what he said this is codes on sixty minutes but\nI was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a part is an argument that would've been best left to be made out for his advocates and defenders on the committee made you wonder about his suit of building in my case yes it made me wonder about his ability to serve on the bench\nSo that's the latest now flake did step up and he he responded to that and said this\nWhen I heard him hurt someone who I Hope I Would sound like if I hadn't been unjustly accused\nNow see that's the point I mean with all the the the back and forth with flake fact is he did vote for Kavanaugh he did say there that he'd probably be just as angry views unjustly accused right so in the end he really did the right thing I mean\nAre you agreeing to the F ... well ... in in an ideal world you would think if it was the right thing but knowing the Democrats and the way they approach as the sleazy way they did by sitting on it\nYou can't help but think that it's just another delay tactic and that by the end of the process\nIf it's not going to be enough it I mean none of them are going to vote for him anyway right some of the moderates maybe but uh the hardcore ones all the ones on the Judiciary Committee or calling for the FBI investigation\nThey're not going to vote for him at all no matter what if they come out and say the opposite he saved rape victims they're still not going to vote for right so I don't nobody trust them I don't trust them I mean they're all saying the ... your crews there and even the uh the lady from Hawaii they're all saying\nThat he's ... now the latest again as I point out he's an suitable for the court because of his anger and it was a it was a lose lose situation to be shows a righteous indignation\nAt being unjustly accused then supposedly would say okay well that is we should do manned falsely you should do that\nIf he was a tepid a robotic uh you know guy like he was on the Fox news interview they'd say see that meant sounds like a guilty guy because he wasn't really angry enough right you just can't live with these people know you can't win so it's about power\nHow it looked as Trump's that it could be a silver lining for for them all at the end of the process a week\nBut I say uh I say that they're going to come up with something in the meantime to continue and say it's not good enough\nAnd they they actually what else what else can they do I mean what else can they come up with I I well like I said the the one guy from already from Yale overnight they have a week they have a full week yeah to to have people come out along the FBI has to investigate this too bright but they look what are the lawyers the lawyers Deborah cats\nNow instead of uh instead of actually a protecting this a professor Ford they were really just preparing her\nTo be to go public Russia didn't want to write and you can witness the lawyer that they suggested she higher or or gave to her this Deborah cats who tore apart uh Paula Jones\nAnd defended Al Franken rash and and now she's this lady's lawyer and she's the one who's all upset about some thirty six year old allegations it's all political\nOne eight hundred they portray WABC one eight hundred eight or eight Ninety two twenty to the very popular Sebastian Gorka will join us in about twenty five minutes to talk more about this but the bones are open what are your thoughts since recovered this on friday Brett Kavanaugh will all the Democrats stalling\nAnd will they be successful will suddenly come out this week there'll be a big bombshell for the FBI we talk to you what if these words\nMorning [laughter]\nI had a guy like these guys are beauty there's this whole Judiciary Committee I mean you had a\nSenator Blumenthal actually challenging the balls the child's having those credibility he invoked\nThe Latin phrase that false on one thing wrong or you're lying on all other things I mean there's a guy Who Lied about going to Vietnam I mean does he not realize that that's going to be that's gonna come back the vitamin ... ... ... what do you invoke the Latin phrase just like that\nBut his side doesn't care so we'll bottom in the ass when Bernie instead of talking about it\nBut he doesn't care if he talked about book or somebody who sexually molested somebody basically by his own admission Sen Cory Grover yeah yeah I mean you've got to these are the old drunk and girl in high school yeah these are the guys making moral decisions on Brett Kavanaugh when there's some of the biggest scum bags bike Maxine Waters\nSome of the biggest scum bags\nYou'll ever meet yeah there there was a tremendous amount of irony you not to mention the the number two guy in the Democratic party Congressman Keith Ellison right another guy that was guilty of that\nAd but but but the silence is deafening yeah on their part and that's the that's the point I mean it's it's not it's not about as they say overturning the patriarchy it's all about really when you think about it's all about overturning the twenty sixth elections\n... which is what it's always been about right and the level of ... help hypocrisy of what these folks is a it's like something you've never seen I don't care what side of the aisle you're on because I don't I I tend to kind of geared towards the middle\nBut if you can see this from what it is just how the how hypocritical and a nasty the left is in this case in this case then you just never going to see it is very nice\nBecause they don't they don't have the votes they they lost the election and they lost the Senate and the screwed so this is the only thing that they can do is have their feet it'd be very very very nasty\nNot all the news just bet on the left a good friend more modern are all who will be part of this big night for the

I ... I was in that I have no idea whether it's a mistake you know the identity of something else but this one very serious ... with a story\nIf this person didn't have a driver's license and was taken off this incident\nHow is it how is it that of all the things she can't remember she can't remember who got her hope because if this is about to cook and she almost full she was going to be killed ... she the person who saved her from that incident would be has save you a full life she would\nNever ever forget like point a great point it's\nJust like it's just something something is thinking about it I I you know clearly she has some issue here but how she can't remember the person who saved up for what she calls one of the most horrific events in her life I don't buy\nAny of the uh among the Democrats I mean some of them are just a I mean this was the sleazy tactic again Senator Dianne Feinstein sitting on this this whole time as you know\nAnd but a couple of the other people and the Judiciary Committee like Senator Blumenthal Who Lied about serving in Vietnam and then and then questions\nOr questions capitals credibility and us from New Jersey senator or Cory Grover I mean this for these people to sit there on their high horse and a cast aspersions on on the other falsely accused man\nI strikes me as something that the American people see\nCory Booker admits the groping a high school students Richard Blumenthal ... lives repeatedly about having served to combat tour in Vietnam we have Kamala Harris who ... the man who's in his sixties when she's ready for the focal her oh political career\nBenefit and then we have Senator Feinstein hook for Twenty years has a Chinese spy on her payroll and these are the people who are going to take the moral high ground of a man who has\nNothing nothing to be ashamed of in his whole life it's absolutely outrageous and the lesson for all of the list as if they can do this to a man who is this ... this is Brett Kavanaugh they can do it to anybody you included\nWhat do you think about is his friend though the other guy judge and I know that um somebody was making the argument maybe it was ... you ever get on friday\nOr this guy's an admitted alcoholic he's depressed by the way he may be some of those things because of what he did years and years ago between us if in fact he\nIs guilty of anything that's been cited the last couple of days so what do you think about the possibility that his body was somebody who did some of these things not cabinet all buddies buddy judge\nI I don't accuse people of things like that without evidence while he drinks too much how many people in America drink too much of it is absurd the questions about boxing and Kavanaugh's\n[laughter] oh really\nNo you're absolutely right Sebastian Gorka who by the way he was the assistant to the president for for a while there ah yeah so let's move on quickly uh and he's got a book out by the way why we fight why we fight it's a great read\nAnd or will motivate the a lot of people but uh this is a president of ours President Trump\nHe's been pretty restrain through this whole process uh he had the UN stuff and he just completed this trade deal that everybody said he couldn't complete with Mexico and Canada we we did rework the NAFTA agreement I mean he's getting stuff done\nHe's getting stuff done in ways that an eight year

morning\nBefore Fox and friends you're never going to hear this somebody on Fox News actually admitted that Matt Damon was funny nobody did say well you know it wasn't fair\nIt wasn't fair well they go out to protect cabinet but he did admit\nThat the content and the performance was good you have to admit that they are mocking a man who's potentially probably falsely accused well that's what the guy said it's not fair but that didn't stop they don't ... it was good they don't care anyway let's take a listen to he this is Matt Damon ... at the hearings\nAre playing a bullet Brett\nKavanaugh if they heard from the alleged victim uh but now it's time to hear from the hero judge Brett Kavanaugh\nWho I'm told has been a shadow boxing in the men's room for the last forty five

Doritos [laughter]\nIt's pretty funny yeah that's what that's I'm using the sentencing and he's getting a lot of accolades especially serious serious people who are happy that he was you know satirizing mocking yeah Kavanaugh but are those same people I mean some of them have short memories they don't they don't recall that he was one of the guys\nThat helped Harvey Weinstein spike write a New York times story in two thousand four about his sexual assaults\nLeaving him free and clear to continue so whatever how long after two thousand four yeah I mean they've got a little a little of that on as well and I like Matt Damon I Do I like 'em all I didn't write a\nGreat actor um but you got a question a little bit of Louis is\nBesides Harvey Weinstein in his best friend his whole life\nIs Ben Affleck right and if there is the biggest scum bags and maybe Harvey Weinstein but not too many guys or biggest scum bags and ... and not just boys so usually they say who you hang out with that kind of shows you who you are but I Do like Matt Damon but that's part of the issue right but but let's let's not forget\nBut you know ... these these people that are making them into a hero now I mean who are well they believe it I I have a list of people are celebrities who tweeted a Hey Matt Damon you you know ... again\nNot just as performance the fact that he's helping okay you know helping 'em they they hit the character assassination\nThey'll liking that but they they forgot of apparently they forgot this New York times or he's made amends because of what he did Saturday Night which was admittedly funny well but it was it was ... he didn't do anything wrong it's kinda like\nI don't like urban Meyer knew what his office coordinator was doing and he should have said something\nBut he didn't do it or have been Meyer Matt Damon didn't do it no he did the I'm not I'm not going to clubs Matt Damon because I'd rather we still have no idea if he really knew what he didn't know\nHow much she knew what he thought he knew so we do know that he helped a spike the story at Harvey Weinstein teams ... okay so why do you like them yeah listen\nI'll also the er an

earlier most a forty year anniversary of the very famous Bucky Dent told to beat the Boston Red Sox\nNo being naive at all uh I think that the Senate GOP hand the Democrats sandwich that were my understanding from reading there were three\nA key Republican votes\nUm namely Murkowski comments like that that ask for this they put the president in a precarious position what was supposed to say no I mean that he wouldn't have had old should get it through so he was forced into calling for this FBI investigation this is just another delay tactic because everybody knows no startling revelation\nBut that's all going to do is allow Democrats more even more time\nTo shore up their defenses come up with new stuff now that the the the talking point will be seven days is you know a week isn't enough this isn't a serious investigation we need a serious investigation that will be the talking point this a tyrant week\nAnd we'll put the ball back at the core of a Chuck Grassley is to\nUm you know what to do about the the the fact that they're losing the narrative on this isn't a serious investigation the FBI needs all the time that uh that that they want to do is is this whole thing is the rules and and I don't know the the geo pie\nIn the Senate just seems to be clueless about what's going on here they know what's going on but they don't have a counter narrative I thought would Lindsey Graham did mention granted was perfect\nAnd I think every one of those GOP remember sitting on the Senate Judiciary should have said what he said all of the same thing like the Democrats the Democrats run ... good at the stuff they're better than a\nMuch better much better right one of the loyal they stick together they they they they seem to pile on they've got five guys for every one from the geo piece of cork there's no question here thousand percent right bought bought\nThe FBI's looked into this guy six times already and they found nothing right so yeah the delay tactics bad with a GOP yes you're right they don't seem United on a front outside of Lindsey Graham they've got nothing but it doesn't seem like\nThere's anything really here so I'm just curious you started by saying you think is confirmation chances on less than fifty fifty what is the specific\nOne specific reason for that\nUh the the the the Democrats did a great job of of for me a narrative here and calling for this investigation they just kept pounding and pounding and pounding it every one of them that spoke mentioned it every single ones that we did an FBI investigation\nCalling for an FBI criminal investigation uh but I think that's what it is that the\nTiny bubble comes back but by the American public\nBut what if it comes back with nothing in all likelihood you guys going to give it and I'm going through it is I mean there's\nGoing to come back with nothing and I'm not going to stop the Democrats I mean that's why I said this week just extra time allow was allowing them to come up with their new narrative right after the FBI investigation doesn't do anything so right you know I say I'm One of those that believes\nJustice delayed is justice denied that's what's happening to Brett Kavanaugh here there's no justice system all due process\nIn here uh for him so\nYou know when you look at it overall I said it's less than fifty fifty I didn't he wouldn't get concern or come from\nWhat I'm saying is if you know if I were a betting man I'm not you know I I look at this thing is trying to hit an inside straight now and inside St as possible but you want to bet the house on it and that's why I said I think it's less than fifty fifty um this thing\nIt it just the thing that I'm worried about right now is political for tea sitting in for the American people I'm Talking about the people in in flyover country is Philip likes to call us know the people at ground level will look at Washington DC they know this place is broken this place has been broken for a long time\nBut there are a number of people\nAre who don't eat drink and and and sleep this thing like you and I I'm Talking about politics that look at it they wave their hand and just go out to help those people\nThat may affect our voting totals in November more than the Democrats this is energizing Democrats\nI don't know that it's energizing arts I I I think it's you know after a while it becomes a little ... and say hey we did everything asked us to do we gave you a money we gave you a full it's what gave you support and I'll look how you handle is ... and and it's the fact that the GOP\nDoesn't know how to fight I'm Talking politically doesn't know how to fight doesn't want to fight they don't have the will to fight and then even if they decide to at least to punch metaphorically I'm Talking you know it's some\nIt's some little backhanded a attempt that and making it look good they have no fight they have they should have shove this thing through they had the votes they\nShould have a which she didn't respond by by that friday a week ago they should have said time's up that said you had your chance and it could have you know they couldn't get beat up by the liberal media anyway about oh you're rushing this all you know take\nSexual assault seriously or you know there there were seeing that even in spite of them bending over backwards to appease the Democrats\nTo actually write in retrospect clearly now they should have taken it because they it's clearly of a political manipulative move on their part on the Democrats part the Republicans were suckered into delaying it and it continues\nAnd we're talking with sheriff David Clarke he's a senior advisor in spokesmen for America first action\nAnd now you're collecting or saying things like that now that Kevin O's demeanor defending himself\nYou know are being falsely accused illustrate telling suitable ... when the Supreme Court all kinds of things just throwing out there\nThat may stick with ... say I'm a ... and ... and sink this guy's nomination as you point out now I Want to ask you about James Comey the former FBI Director he says that the un along with some of the Democrats the FBI shouldn't have when he calls his shot clock\nI mean this is James calling me saying this the guy who ... all kinds of investigations\nWhile you see what I mean you know this is is that that's the the joke that this thing but\nGoing back to the Brett Kavanaugh he has to do I mean that was a motion was pure emotion I mean how would how would anybody sitting up on that that that panel\n... how would they felt if they would have been subject to their family members would have been suggested a so subjected to what Brett Kavanaugh was nobody was funny for Brett Kavanaugh dammit pardon my language no nobody on the G O P\nA Senate Judiciary committee was fighting for Brett Kavanaugh he had to fight for self wherever they\nDon't I think it's what you know people on our side when I say I say let me be more specific conservatives\nThey liked that sort of a fight that Brett Kavanaugh was putting them no one else is doing one that a prosecutor Mitchell she wasn't doing it you know I don't ...
