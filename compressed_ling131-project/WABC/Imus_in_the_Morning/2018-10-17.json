{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "With Kevin knocks and Mitchell Robinson AKA the skinny Shaquille O'Neal you got to a lot of Neal sites on the next now with that said well the next me lacking cohesion and in disarray or will they be stupendous momentous [noise]\nWell they have to ask for the invite Bessie also have all of the banality mark\nSome nights they'll be like they should [laughter]\nKevin knocks he had a terrific a semi legal Las Vegas but those are that's against rookies\nGear pre season I had some moments but he also had a few bad games\nAnd I think it's going to be an up and down\nSituation with Kevin he's so talented people have compared them to Kevin around these explosive first step is six foot nine very athletic as a three point shot\nBut he's only Nineteen years old and he needs to be get stronger\nAnd you know he got so much hype no in the summer that opponents are really come out of the court or they want to stop to Kevin knocks so he's going to really face or you know some lumps are his rookie year but I think as long as he shows while this guy could be a future store\nI think next fans are going to be excited neutral Robinson he does too great things he block shots\nAny rebounds making three great things any any you know if you throw the ball up by the remedy is going to offer you dunk it but he has no jump shot he has no mid range shot he's kind of a project you didn't go to college\nBut he's show athletic and he was a second round pick thirty six than to traffic could be the steel to draft a and he'll play a little bit in the ... play some with the next but it's so exciting to watch his development I think fans are going to be a\nVery very pleased that the next picked up a thirty\nSix long term in New York Post there doing the big preview today on the upcoming NBA season two big game tonight Nick is hosting Atlanta nets in Detroit with the pistons local season starts tomorrow night talking about the logjam point going into the Knickerbockers would really like to see\nNo Keno come up with a Frenchman in his second year what the Knicks indeed that guy he put on some muscle put on some weight here during the off season to meet you looked a heck of a lot stronger doing these pre season games what about a Frenchman at point guard moving forward\nYeah we'll find out in a few hours ... Togo so\nYou know tell us a after practice for that [noise] listen no Keene I had the best pre season of all the guys at point guard but he plays other positions they could put a shooting guard he could play small forward\nSo does first I Want to start with him at point guard and use a lot of minutes there when he could come off the bench\nAnd he could play the two in the three and a little at the one uh Trey Burke\nFinished up as a starting point guard last season\nBut ah he didn't have a good pre season at All right now I'm torn I don't know which way he's going to go three days ago four days ago I thought he was going to go with Trey Burke but I think there's a mounting a momentum for Frank to start\nA he shot well he defended beautifully he really looks like a different player he's gained an inch and a half he's six foot six he's put on ten pounds\nHe looks more comfortable look stronger going to the basket he had a really bad rookie year I think we're going to be very surprised and happy at his second season\nPay more for him in the best player on the nexus in his cancer now provided that ah the government of turkey doesn't whack them which that they they hate his guts for some reason but he might not even being Nick after this year ride\nYeah he'll be a free agent he's making a play two million dollars this year it's going to be very tough to resign and the only way they got him back is if they are flopping free agency and can't find anyone else he's a leader he grabs off into rebounds defensive rebounds\nThese scores inside is even improved his mobility on defense during preseason he's considered an old school center and that's not the way the NBA is going they want seven foot or should be shooting three pointers that's not Amish\nHe's a great guy with the media you know you you\nProbably come on your show of the oil yeah it was asking him yep um\nIs it just already contacted me to be completely honest either weekly spot I Swear to God\nHe is a terrific guy and loves the media and right now he's you know the guy we go to in the locker room but again the next are looking to be more of a modern team and have more of a center who is it outside threat\nA but for now he's going to post fourteen points in fourteen rebounds and night that's my prediction I think that's what he's going to average ...\nOut on the way out about sixty seconds to go I remember doing the midday show with Jodie McDonald's ... two thousand three one bony and I were not the fan when I miss and you know I tell you is coming any spending eight million dollars on guys like ... you know they just small Barry is getting a billion dollars and Jodie kept saying they got to tell this thing down\nAnd I kept saying it's never going to happen outside the staples center in Los Angeles the niche charge more for their seats than anybody in the NBA they can't camera down\nWell they tone it down and this is Lucy is tearing it down all these guys are kids there's not one that's when big time player on this team I think you guys will find to give the next thirty wins in New York Post but we are here more for him in a lot of us thought it would never happen but the Knicks how toning down\nYeah and I think fans are okay with that they've seen so many bad plans and the ... in the past fail and even though it's been five straight seasons throughout the playoffs they're willing to wait another one\nSo I mean she doesn't actually have the moral high ground here but as a tactical matter and I don't care like you would call a pancake as or a beach ball but on whatever legged syphilis infection but he gave them an opportunity to to seem gave her an opportunity to ah be the victim\nIf you don't know what we're talking about this was the tweet that President Trump sent out yesterday he said federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to full legal fees at Fox News great now and go after\nHorse face and her third\nRate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total\nCon dirty habit do you have a so what are they going to do though I mean it's just a again it's just more noise its ugliness and ... that's what he look what he did a she was she really went after him she embarrassed and buy the stuff she said and CNN and people places like that\nThey did segments on it is a little wiener and the whole you know all legit affair all that stuff\nSo he was he was humiliated and he was mad and ... and the only one he couldn't help himself\nRight but he should not be should she tweeted this ladies and gentlemen present your president in addition to his own shortcomings as a shot at his pain is right he has demonstrated is incompetence hatred of women and lack of self control on Twitter again\nAnd perhaps a penchant for peace geology game on\nTiny Donald ... beautiful ... so that's what you got you got any versus horse race and what is the ... or ... that that's what it costs\nBecause you've called the horse race so he must like dining halls gay or yeah especially gouging\nThat are well maybe in a in a way acknowledge I I don't even think she has a horse face I don't think so I did not attractive no at all she's below average a porn performer but a horse race I I Know some horse race of people\nYou know she called the Simon is more of a horse race category I think he wants to ... to ... by the way\nWhich really pissed off our story yes no nothing that's what he called maybe it was on ... you don't want you know no one strong cause damage that day when I was in the studio ... I never did well who said it than I ... I have no ... yeah so I\nI don't know but uh yeah either way I I don't think she has a horse they know but he was just thinking that he was trying to lash out and I guess I mean he could have been a lot more vicious [laughter]\nThey really couldn't put us leashes disgusting\nBut he wasn't and again you know if you want to fight the ... you know you just I got a small wing or I'm going to call you back I'm going to call your name so you know\nLet's let's do it to the game was on its own tiny it was on when you started with the uh the accusations the lawsuit by the way the NBA seaside yeah all of that is legit and she ended up you know breaking the agreement running your mouth the kissing and telling\nAfter taking the money and so he had every right yes\nYou had a good thing he did it in a solid deal I must say that Daniel last night the cause of the C word which is the worst right that's the worst which is right which is what the Bill Maher called Sarah Palin right I Would have been okay with that and which is what are they call a bunker sometimes I think right I think they did want to know what's the name did a series of Samantha ...\nTrumpet cold um heard of that\nI would've been OK with that believe it or not even though it's a terrible word a horrible word I would've been OK with that but the horse racing just seemed a stupid wait a second I may say stupid but\nUh no she's a secret she's not a C word historian Daniel ...\nThough man to never legitimately even if it's the on the on the left they apparently do it casually cavalierly and get away with it but you you can't call the woman let's see what you can't do that just cannot do that a sucks you know there that there's nothing worse than that I don't think I mean\nThat is a well that\nThat's like the N word while not not really not really I mean if if the of the glove fits the code Johnny Cochrane just as I Know I mean the N. word is racist word this is this some audio I Know but it ... she was close is that the closest I can come to a\n... offensive it is to women when whenever she is what she is what is she I'm not calling us [laughter] I Am how about that I tell you not why not\nBut what is she\nShe is a good woman the sleazy yeah a a liar yeah a woman who uh breaks deals rife us worthy right and she's trying to exploit or her little Fifteen minutes doing a good job even though now she's in debt and cheese and you know she said like Omaha Nebraska swinging a poll mix it\nWith a bunch of ... looking at her but um\nYou just can't call you just that it's not acceptable on us they would have been fine with me [laughter]\nI'm actually more offended by voice face because it's so stupid and doesn't make sense here that I Would have you with a cold or that because that makes sense the worst\nThing I think you could call somebody like her she's a mother is a horrible monitor that would have really hit\nYeah that would really bother well it makes it was thinking about when she was doing anal when a daughter was two\nSix black guys on ... ... what was it was like well it's not like I was even I suspect was that she was taken\nThe daughter on a on a tour on the buses down in the south ... throughout the Late Show all the clubs all the clubs yeah with with with her fellow performers Brooklyn changes performing this weekend by the\nWay the way if somebody were as you say [laughter] I have I have\nNothing personally against these performers strippers or whatever that is the way that they're they're they're out they're hustling regular living it's a free country tough outside I don't make a I don't make judgments on a based on that always it's it's just that if you sign a hundred thirty thousand dollar deal\nI keep your word natural keep your mouth closed quite on the right time [laughter] ... [noise] uh\nBut uh it just it just said he by saying that gave the news cycle I gave her victims status again and it was just again tactically\nNot a smart move on what what what what what could they do in all honesty legally they can't do any thought a damn thing right so that when they say are they doing it for defamation as much as what it all started over some some when they say it's on what's on the other thing is\nThat right I guess I just gave the idiots on TV it gave them an oxygen that's all you know when he had he had that is what I'm saying here to secure a huge victory shut them up and then he gave an opportunity to come back and say oh my\nGod what is right on this and that\nAnd don't forget just like Rosie she started she did started yeah but that doesn't mean the president\nAlways has to finish all I agree with us [laughter] exactly what he's got that say absolutely right around the employers to all of them said there was a couple of they are a couple of low lived yes I mean they really are the scum of the earth [laughter] but now they are not just going back saying\nWell there's a lot more stories you have to cover today by the way there's a bunch of stuff heated debate on Staten Island last night between Dan Donovan and max rose we've got to get to that good our good hour that's going to be great and now it turns out I guess while they were killing\nThis journalist and Saudi Arabia they were playing music that was like an activity yes that's right\n[laughter] there was a [noise] [laughter] I mean it was an event it was\nWhat kind of like when you blow the whistle for the snake come out\nI don't know that's a very good question that well it's like you know if you do blue collar work you do construction or these let's say you're a painter you play music right\nIn the music in the background and with a ... have you know what I'm One of them will put on one of four point three a one on one point one right and you'll is one of the three five whatever the hell it is and you listen to music and they went to work\nThey put music the music and I don't know what type we're going to find out that see a I Can't see Neil Diamond though what Barbara Streisand and killing somebody or something like a some Metallica\nThat's kind of that that's a good one ... that a\nVery good could have been not sure [noise] that would that would work\nSheriff David Clarke will stop by and talk about that story but they didn't have to dig a hole that didn't have to do that no no no hey and by the way one of ... very very good friends that guy that I've known for many years and the guy that at one point try to employ Jill\nHow would dear friend Dennis Hopper off from the bunny ranch in Nevada passed away yesterday at the Seventy two years old so nobody tend to hassle off any longer now more\nHarry Reid pick somebody to pick on somebody else now though that was it ongoing fight forever we go for great yesterday Curtis leave or stopping by of course he was a big part of this show yesterday\nEnvy the really the the old to meet the ultimate forgive\nHe found a way to shake somebody's hand that had them shot six times\n[laughter] this is wacko bird it's just ah I I spoke to ...

that's part of the board of the profession yeah what what's his name was a bit of a mess so he was always on with Nancy Grace\nAlways on going back about Fifteen Years ago how are you talking about the the fat guy who got convicted or for he was he was defending the scapegoat dude Dominic barber was he was he a what's his name is ah no I was a skinny guy who was a skinny Jewish you must always on that very big time defense attorney\nThat we had um and I miss a bunch of times too Mitchell or maybe not Mitchell not come on\nAnd he was one of the bigger ones that went back Twenty years ago he was like the guy\nYou know shark attack opinion uh I I'm older those guys so he was the exception to the rule he was on a Nancy Grace and I used to love to watch our\nHeadline news and um she would you know she was always she loves us by the way she does love us but you're always guilty nobody did there was nothing like I Know especially if you're a guy guilty Kobe Bryant guilty and in fact I used to hate or until she started coming out on us and she loved those meat I even though they shut the robot or in my book I've we flipped on we flipped on them\nBut she um she would bring on defense attorneys and it didn't matter who they work and she would just kill them and it was her show it was her way or the highway and she would just kill him I'm going to say to these guys why do you go on her show\nShe makes you look idiotic even when you are right\nIn the like I don't know it's TV you know but\nIt can't be looked like it like you all are talking stupid right now you all are really sounded like a bunch of dummies to the ... incompetent a whole well a Nancy I don't know I I just it's been a long time it's not getting a goes by it but that's a good Jewish Jewish just any yeah something like that Michel\nMaybe not Michel ... good I'm In Mitchell no novels or figure it out at sea Moskowitz but he was the guy I'm Talking about what's actually a good attorney unlike Michael ...\nWho embarrasses that profession just every day he dressed like Colombo yeah it was more like that right right right right not Danny rooms may not know dance to show that guy that has a shop guy\nHe's lost a lot of weight though yeah he has\nHe's still on good morning America of course he goes back and forth with Nancy Grace I thought all that stuff you know I always liked the fact when we were a making a big with China's MSNBC wasn't in one of the go to guys they're\nUp slowly yes yes uh MSNBC back then was breeding ground for\nA lot of people yeah a lot of the people who went on to a succeed sadly are you guys are too over at MSNBC right now in the morning to their own called there I think tonight uh yeah that's right not unbelievable [noise]\nThat's just unbelievable yeah uh even\nThough they come in third or the ratings in the morning I Believe that either the third a CNN star I don't know what the hell it's it's all change I don't watch it anymore I don't follow it I hate these people I don't hate him I dislike them I hate watching yeah hate them to I hate talking to but I Do have um actually\nHe's talking about in my office once in a while you and I would work

Boston Red Sox tickets and\nHe was on my show in Miami tons and tons but he's become impossible\nHe uh you know it's like the it's the Stockholm syndrome the Patty Hearst syndrome I think if you if you want to stay at MSNBC you have to become one of them if you want to stay and succeed\nIt's the Phil Griffin syndrome get above Patty Hearst if you do you need to make Phil Griffin happy and the only way to make so gripping happy is to do exactly what you're talking\nTo but it's funny like all these people these names that you mentioned like barnacles course ah yeah were you and I both know very very well good guy and I do feel Griffin and I think he was a terrific guy not for long [laughter] so ah\nThat changed quickly in two thousand set ... right yeah but uh Keith Olbermann all those

I could do and he got killed last year\nFrench ... everybody he lied deserves better now you may remember\nI was like the only guy said I'm okay with it I didn't like the fact that the guys who are going to replace them with Gina Smith and Davis went but you may remember I was like I'm fine with this he hasn't played well for years\nI may have been the only New York sports guy giant fan that wasn't furious when the giants bench Eli Manning last year so they're not going to solve this he saw it cost him his job but the truth is he saw it touch Omer bought something else\nAnd Sherman is getting the same results it's not just one in five this year the giants have now gone for and Nineteen in the last twenty three approach and guess what remains a constant number ten but behind center\nBut he did it that his job to decide whether or not he stays it's the front office not what are you still got the ... but he's out there playing I mean yeah if you want to assess blame you have to go higher than ...\nTo me it's about execution people make decisions look if you and I ended up being a horrible show yeah chat Lopez would have gotten some of the blame but in the end it's you and I couldn't perform understood\nUnderstood but they they they bet on him and the vet didn't pay off no\nSo everybody's frustrated so is BJ ... of course he's a joke of course these did anybody think a hundred million dollars was going to make him a chore if anything that makes it even worse but as far as I write it should be he is frustrated\nAnd it doesn't help study a runs his mouth than he blows the cohesion of the unit cohesion as they say yeah so cohesive rolling and five but but going out there talking like that I mean that does a I mean if you win of course that they had won that game\nWith the when the ... they scored the field goal right\nA well then he would have been a genius but still\nYou know he's just he's just he's just a poison in the locker room\nAnd that's not good at it and other people they should have seen the fact that uh that he lie manning was done over\nToast as the former jet Damien would hold them a couple of weeks ago he's like a burden told me is like the ten minutes before they put the rust because ... ... [laughter] the guy says he can't move while you know what the giants or would it lands on Monday Night for the falcons and they're gonna lose again we'll go to one insects\nNow we start to we put those those are the clock on\nAt what point do the giants just bench Eli Manning and play the rookie out of Richmond Kyle all letter to hey\nSee what he's got as a possible unlikely but possible replacement in the future as a giants look towards the draft and free agency to replace\nThe ... that could happen any game along the way right any game where he's a performing horribly Syria they could bench I'm just like they did last year I'm sure they're thinking about it there's\nA couple of bad couple of interceptions and went down fourteen twenty points that's it citizens down and that can be the beginning of a new era well it's time unless I understand the offensive line is terrible I get it believe me I Do\nAnd most plays Eli Manning is is running for his life but that's the thing right there he can't run that's the problem is that all he could get out of his own way I mean look\nThere on quarterbacks who do okay with paying up and supply lines because just they've got a quick release or they're not necessarily Randall Cunningham but they've got good even jak Prescott among homes these guys like that well he's got a good offensive line pat\nBut what I'm saying they can run they can do something they rightly born even without warning just get out of your own way give yourself if if if he manning has three seconds to throw the football because the line is so bad\nIf he had a a just an ounce of about ... feet maybe give themselves to more seconds Philip Rivers Drew Brees they do it he cannot do he can't do it now and that to say the up and said one he's got to figure out a way to give himself a couple more seconds in a bottle with every time he gets hit ...\nAmount of oil he's he's terrified he's rattle and he's just not the guy he he told her I mean you you know what at this point\nTapes but benches asked before he gets hurt yeah then you feel bad time legend I mean if you're a man he was a horse I don't do it um it does tell you about [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] right let me go out you know it's a couple of times a day if it gets injured said they would sure [laughter] they would just put about the edge that funny oh well yeah it\nIt's just too

to get shot right it's like in the boxing ring the idea is not to get in there [laughter] I don't get that that isn't that a badge of courage mistake because I got myself into a situation that I should have realized from my street smart I was walking into a trap\nAnd lucky to get out of it when I jumped out at a young woman has talked about a guy on where you know some of the oil I responsible bought ... I'm street smart enough to know she was smelled bad out called let me ask you this do further this relationship now now there was a handshake is there any chance I mean this sincerely is there any chance up\nOne day you two guys actually become friends how about a radio show even a radio show\nI mean the only respect to ...

against due while God it was on trial for trying to tell you the truth is doing that radio show with Kobe was much more painful than every\nAll the cooking at home it that way [laughter] you've failed to mention the menu averages right come on how much throw them all on your right but that's why this wants to keep a women's TCU or\nI never asked anybody out there in the audience for favorite did you ever hear me all the other side of the other hand we have a favorite said never over tally right floating\nOkay and I like it so I'll call you a sheriff Clarke sharp is also he's also the senior advisor and spokesman for America first action several clock is now\nA chef clerk I Want to ask you this question uh this uh violence we've been seeing around the country here in New York and out in Portland this antifa groups but first of all I see a local TV station still calls and anti fascist group antifa\nThere appear to me of a fascist group they are but the Portland police stood down while the violence was perpetrated how do you think the cops out there the rank and file feel about standing by watching a bunch of low lives a beat people up\nOn this just turn them apart it really is a rips or heard of these people are well trained when I see well trained I'm Talking about\nYour communities find this law enforcement there will train they're well educated they know how to handle these situations they've been preparing for this to keep their community safety do it on a daily basis and then they have these officials come by so this isn't the fault of the the perch frontline cops is is the fault of the higher ups\nWill come up with these soft plans that really put cops in harm's way it really endangers other community\nLaw abiding people property it gets damaged in the millions of dollars how'd you like to be a small business owner come in the next day and find your your your a small business everything you've touched your life into is up in flames or it's been looted\nSo I look at this this group or answer the phone you hit the nail on the hit the body fascism these are totalitarian bigots this is the Democrat Party fighting force and that's why you have not seen one prominent Democrat not once stand up and denounced the political violence that's what these people do it it would add to ah\nThey ah carry out political violence to instill fear and intimidation for the Democratic party law enforcement better get their act together and get their arms around this thing I've been calling this these um\nThese jak voted goons from antifa out for very long time because I understand the anarchist movement I went back\nI did some studying on it from the sixties it's the same animal it's just a different generation of people they advocate for the killing of police officers they advocate and tea for that is for the downfall of this lawfully constituted United States government does is it dangerous group it's a hate group\nAnd like I said law enforcement better get their arms around this thing because you're going to see a different reaction from people\nWho want to attend a Trump rally who want to attend any kind of rally to a patriot prayer per ... bought and Portland\nOr the situation in New York that is a constitutionally protected right to engage in\nA political activities and it's being denied by anti ... who shows up\nNot to counter protests these are not counterprotesters there is not a counter demonstration they come looking for confrontation this is a civil rights violation and I'd like to see more people go to the department of justice in their state\nAnd after the ... civil rights criminal investigation be conducted so we can identify these guys and indict them criminal\nYou know sure David cloth to take what you said a step further you say there has not been one Democrat\nThat has denounced these people in fact it's been a complete antithesis they've actually called but some of this weather with Kirsten Gillibrand Eric Holder Maxine Waters we've got a bunch of examples of politicians on the left that I've actually call center encouraging this type of violence\nYes they are and then shame on them you know and then and then they have the nerve to a bill fend it and I'm Glad that people are starting in the media are starting to an on our side of the right side of the conservative side when actually write the political rights\nAre calling this uh this band thugs all for what they are it's a mob this mob violence and that's starting to get under the skin\nIf you've noticed of of Democrats in the left leaning I'm liberal media who doesn't like the term but that's what these guys are so we have to frame this words matter here you guys know the words matter and you have to frame this properly if you don't frame it properly do apply the wrong remedies which is why I said when I see\nPeople starting to defend themselves\nOr against the sort of political violence I'm encouraged by this I don't advocate for ... for violence but do advocate for self defense of people have a right\nWho that lead singer really what will the goals that he cheated them out of their fair share of money Ford said none and now this was his band all along they were just hired guns\nSwedish judge finally weighing in dismissing the suit and ordering the form of schools to pay for it is legal fees to the tune of a
