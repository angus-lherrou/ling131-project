I mean when the chips are down that's when you're supposed to rally the troops I mean do you think they're regretting now signing him to a Ninety five million dollar contract extension\nNo I I I don't think they're regretting it but I think they're pissed off you know there's different\nRegretting ... you're saying yourself you made a mistake I don't think they believe that but I think they're pissed off and and the flipside of that is you guys are talking about say going Barclay I've been in this town you know covering sports since Nineteen eighty\nEight and I will say I've thought about this I Will say to him directly I have never seen\nA rookie in any sport and this includes the captain Derek Jeter I have never seen any rookie in sports in this town come in with the performance on the field\nAnd carry himself off the field and then the lock them as well as this guy he is the entire package and you know what all del could take a lesson from say ...\n... it was I agree with you though not hurt but I think\nLook he's still on the bus was he was in football he's frustrated at Bernie's right he's a jerk\nDoesn't know how to act he promised a giant it'd be more mature and he's just not he he's just he's not capable buddies are terrific football player and he's frustrated and I wouldn't be too because his numbers stink and that goes back to the light coming up into line so beyond the Yankees they're done you were there that night to Ross\nSo I'll ask you this your brain cash when you've got to fix this team or not the red Sox they're not used in we don't why\nWho was the first couple of guys you want\nTo add to this team so next year they make it to the next step\nWell I said I think I don't think there's any question I I think the mistake\nIs what they didn't do this year we were talking about that from the beginning of this season but as soon as I was going on with you guys\nWhat we say starting pitching they lost because their starting pitching suck it how about this in in four playoff games this is what they got out of starting pitchers who winnings five innings three innings and three innings and you know who that San I'm Sorry that's on Ryan cash you know\nThey made the big move they made a big meal or whether you were a fan of your audio or not I don't know that but they make the\nBig move that they made a replacement\nThey discarded you ride a that's fine after ten years you want to say you know what it's time for a change fine but then\nThey put it out there well you know relax some communication with young players well his lack of communication got them within one game of the world series where the hell are they now\nAnd the other thing that they do too well at all they do play they cannot play small ball you look at that line up one didn't mind it looks like a murderers role\nBut they don't play small ball how sick\nThey put on ... there was don't play defense in there that they don't play small ball they can't brush and by the way you can talk going on about small ball and it's not going to get you should say those last two games against evolving import cello forget about the plight forget about it they couldn't get a score run\nWell but that's the problem when you can't play small or in the post season you know this guy in the postseason its pitching and you've got to manufacture Ron ... case in point the bottom of the night thinning listen uh Sanchez put\nThe ball to the warning track but you know what they didn't need to gamble on and on and dried up [laughter]\nIt's tied the game it's true they lived and died by the long haul as as you just point out on the court to didn't help that to junk coal Stanton struck down in the ninth inning again for for how many so you're saying get rid of cc's above you\nUm you know what listen cc is not he's not the\nProblem he's not the answer to the sea is a spot stuff when I maybe I shouldn't say spots box I shouldn't say spot starter but he's got to be like
