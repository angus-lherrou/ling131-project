to be here with you today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover today packed today we're talking about strengths and power how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now pat a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but\nFor those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly use in the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders\nCollege high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue\nAs we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nIs an amazing story you can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pack what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the power's off the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain\nStrength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're\nWorking at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis or anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young ... who does that stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles now the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team it goes to work or go straight to your muscles absorb easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue\nAnd you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support the memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea teen for years to enhance their strength and performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier\nSports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used it body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coaches of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThat came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now ... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger and stay stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and only like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low and if you're if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan styled are if this is for you you definitely want to add that average wrong\nSide so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus there's like you and me and said let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals okay\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men\nStudy done it several American universities\nOr group of men get this pet age fifty nine to Seventy two hey can we can do that's not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationery bike pack this happened in one week when I think part of that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAlright but what about the women out there did they get those kind of benefits to as well below that actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies gets stronger to\nArabs or ... let's go straight to another study loved the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older women published in the European journal applied physiology thirty women age fifty to Seventy one the course they could either Korea funeral placebo that's the way they do these things\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\n'cause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here creating supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular strength power and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly\nThey go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this creating supplementation without training and the elderly could potentially delay atrophy of muscle\nAnd unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right yeah you're a person\nThat never heard about this and you're listening to us you would think this sounds too good to be true but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies backup what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ever strong formula today plus the bonus bottle of ... energy melts\nJust by calling us at one eight hundred by eight zero eleven Seventy five you just pay for shipping that's one eight hundred five eight zero eleven Seventy five will give that number out again later on the show but first Dr Lehman now listeners can only get ... on this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right\nOh absolutely I Know it combines the Korea teen with the vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit XP moron and for those who don't know talked about how these works so well together there's a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure cruelty and that's a purist find this pre teen from Europe if you brought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D\nAnd it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not going to spend that today that with purity products and your name going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today\nIt for your job is to be one of the first thousand cause\nAnd take it seriously this the flies out the door and the big radio stations be one of the first thousand calls you get your ... and your average strong you just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you\nKnow we want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it\nTry it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing Sherry Barry powder so how do you like to take and it gives people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottom today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at days are days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing has become a very big these days so if you're doing something like that to a jury very powders fantastic you just take a scoop\nDumping right into your juice dumping pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powdered they tested golfers and you're already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFourteen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers called this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula\nThe product we are talking about right now the ever strong power so double blind placebo controlled studies thirty golfers took the ever strong powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our average strong powder for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster they\nGet older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job or you can read five hundred dollars on a driver up five yards right this is a sport team\nYards had people shouldn't just how how about this or your about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and is more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board but again\nThese golfers one month on this every strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine ... you get your bottle of every strong you don't tell your buddies take it for a month and you go out and you're banging the both fourteen yards past them they don't know what hit him\nWhile I Would just got a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team what you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nYou know what pat my one concern with this show is that literally it sounds too good to be true right right like when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up to not possible right you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen\nI almost couldn't believe it I said to myself\nIf it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's just phenomenal and it's as simple as this you're going to get on the strong\nYou're going to try it you're gonna get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror\nAnd see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up these aren't studies with a hamster in a lab somewhere we're talking human studies I called stuffed muscle fertilizer it's that great and of course we didn't just there to create pure Korea Team we've discussed that we are the fruit XP remember that joined health weight\nOf the coffee Barry extract that nominal antioxidant that's more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful and the opposite of protection I

and this has been going on now for uh several years more than several years\nAnd this is very interesting to me because I Am of the age when I came up in the trades carpenter by trade was in the carpenters union for uh several years\nBefore I went out on my own and um it was like pulling teeth to get into the union and get into a trade because you needed to know somebody um you know that there was a there was plenty of guys that were going into the trades\nAnd it was really tough not the case anymore\nThere's a a a an issue with uh the young folks now either not getting the kind of exposure to the trades that they once did\nAnd be [noise] there's not interested in going to work with their hands are I think that they all think that it's all about computers and I want to you know create of Aspen I Want to create a game or whatever it is and not that there's anything wrong with that\nBut we are I'm In a huge shortage nationally uh for carpenters and plumbers electricians and\nI'm ... you name it ah painters a pipe sitters all that is is something that we're in dire need out and the construction industry is doing what they can to try and show everyone that this is a really good career you know\nWhen these politicians talk about good paying jobs and uh you know jobs in the middle class and how you can raise your family\nI Can't tell you enough about how the trades can offer that not everybody's going to go to college or not everybody should\nAnd then so what are you gonna do you're going to go work at a fast food restaurants for you know minimum wage or a little bit above minimum wage whatever it might be that's not something that you raise a family on but a career in the trades now that's something and it's so fulfilling career\nIt is something that um [noise] it is something that you'll be super proud of and you can build on and and only get better so coming up a little bit later on\nWe're going to talk to someone from the plumbers local one on one training center but the opportunities that exist to get into the plumbers union you'll be surprised they'll train you they'll pay you know get you employed\nAnd I tell ya\nIt's it's quite the career and that and I've always had as a me is a a carpenter by trade was had this love hate relationship with plumbing so I always like talking to the plumbers because uh you know they they will tell you and they are absolutely true that the plumbers you know protect the health and safety of the world or in in making sure that\nOur systems are all working properly it really is true\nAnd um and it's really amazing you know we take indoor plumbing for granted\nA but it is really um a quite the quite the trade that has a lot of intricacies in it a lot of technical stuff that involved and so those types of uh opportunities exist and we'll talk and learn a little bit more coming up\nOr just a little bit later on in how sports radio our phone number is eight hundred eight for eight WABC

so there are a lot of things that might help it depends upon what the underlying causes are and typically those causes are easy to find when we're doing such a thorough a blood test\nI take your history I examined you I recommend the blood testing so I Do I Do it all I mean it would be nice if I\nWould be able to have other assistance due to some of this but you know I've never done that I don't think that that's correct to have a non Dr people does it work up and then the doctor come in for five seconds to say blah blah blah I I'm the person who does the exams old physicals on the person who recommends all the testing and you know take your history\nHand I don't know how print of not necessarily\nWhat what would have a lot of talk about family\nAnd show he's of course\nThere are certain foods that they add salt to to make them more palatable and they had fat to to make an palatable but I'm not sure salt is your only issue how old are you know\n[laughter] and what's your weight how much you weigh\nHow well the way it doesn't seem to be an issue but I Would need your body to tell me what's happening residents just say well takeout sold to take a pill or do this or that what are your blood pressure readings\nWanna pay over ... ...\nThat's not terribly high but I'd still rather learn everything about you and then say well look here if we check this change this and correct that your numbers would come to normal range so it's always about you know learning about your body\nCan throw in a short question ... ... ...\nFor people that you're in it a lot of those people might be becoming diabetic statistics on diabetes or\nNext to him on the third call them below the gentleman with the stroke as a person who fell off a scaffold and destroyed his shoulder and his ankle they told me needed all sorts of procedures and he frankly didn't want to do surgery here and it's the Asia and he'll tell you the story about how well the stumps has worked for him and there's lots of other videos there\nHave been alive including injection that first and fix it over like back in time I was horrible I had ... I had three or reaction\nWould lead again as a temporary understanding so I don't know if that would achieve that's putting a number of cream on your skin and expecting them to do something that someone gonna last for a short period of time so that doesn't really make sense [noise] never\nWon anything I'd how horrible in when they got their faction within our own\nUm you know sometimes that's unavoidable because no doctor in the world unless you're Superman doctor can see where the nerves are flowing you know or or existing throughout your skin so sometimes they hit a nerve but the reality is we need to see more of what's going on with your body so I'd certainly like to help you out you can give us a call the office\nWell I have a question because on the ... um report I'm not going to have a ... it had anything else 'cause I I really don't know what the ... narrow for animals\nFor eminently yeah yeah that just means we're your spinal cord comes down between your um the body of the bone and the arches of your vertebrae\nOr when the nerves come out off of that fix spinal cord as a frame and which is an opening like a total dinner of passes through if the disks have been shrinking down then that tunnel gets narrowed unless there's significant nerve damage or you have atrophied muscle the mild Maryland or the frame and doesn't mean a heck of a lot\nOkay where lots of things that we would do to help to try and strengthen your ligaments and then have you'd go after that physical therapy we can do play literature plasma therapy lots of things to do\nWell I have a question with that car you're probably think I ...\nUh not just mild for him at all you know narrow in you'd have to have some pressure on the nerve route from a desk so that can occur on and off depending upon your position so\nOh okay because I had like a ... and my left um\nYeah then maybe during her somewhere between your low back or your your blue you know you're psychotic\nThat are affecting that sensation in your foot that's typically the cause but again I Would need to look at the entire picture to be able to tell you\nAnd also came away with that I'm a stem cell help that or any or care\nHum the annual chairing the disc is too far in there we wouldn't take a three inch needles or try to put the stem cells into the area but we have done stem cell injections into the sick really awkward them is to make them strung hold things in place\nSo again you're asking me questions on a person and an MRI that I've never seen so I Can't go beyond that before I Do the exam on you and tell you what\nOh no no I all I just want to know ... kind of\nLike yeah we don't inject the desk with stem cells I don't think anybody in the world does that so take a look at the videos on my website you'll\nSee some amazing videos and great articles traditional medical articles on the things that I talk about it so they're well documented a love they help you out Dr Cao dot and that's the website the phone number is five on six seven nine four zero four zero for let's go to Daniel in Westchester\n[noise] I've I've got ... I think you can buy ten dollar question I think like a little bit of parenting but yeah when you have a describe how and ... and ... and that but again they go to the areas where they're counting on you know how my my\n... hit the area where they're capturing hey pat not by main argument by buying minute a capillary like that\nOf course absolutely because when you put stem cells into the blood vessel they keep coursing around your body now how can stem cells get to your brain well your brain is not fed by one large artery the arteries break down to smaller or cereals so yes so every Oregon is not\nNot like you're stuck in a big too which is a blood vessel into the Oregon you know in order to get to your cells the you know stem cells have to get to you know from the blood to smaller and smaller and smaller cells\nTo get to your actually smallest most for blood vessels to get your actual cells so that's been documented proven for a probably a hundred years your brain your eyes or ... or you look at Mr tendons your liver kidney pancreas\nYou know got all your tissues of vascular and there are a large vessels going this Miller vessels and then you are right at the level of the cells\nWell where where they flick client that category like dating optic nerve hell yeah\nNo I haven't I haven't asked where and how have products and\nYou're really not writing medical research and our medical research we had a patient came in with macular degeneration the ... part of the retina where the beam of light coming into your eye when they hit your lens are focused down to the ...\nSo you can see so the ... one of the most important parts of the retina\nNow this lovely lady with macular degeneration had no color vision she only had peripheral vision aside such you'd have to turn your head or Turner I get a glimpse of something and we do the stem cells\nAre a few weeks ago could be four weeks ago and she came back in for the first follow up at a three weeks and she said her color vision was back\nAnd she was able to read a line you know when you sign your pay your name on a line she had no vision for that long before that she has the line or central vision is coming back she went back to church and she was able to see the colorful stained glass windows show she's had a spectacular improvement\nNow of course we're sending the videographer to her so we can just video you know video her comments and all the things that she's seen as improving she's had some amazing results\nBy now got a coma for example that quite I direct occurring invasion of optic nerve found\nIn a coma is high into occupied pressure that damages different parts of the eyes so yes of course therapies that\nHave been useful to take the pressure down to take the pressure off the optic nerve in a maximum of course in the whole retina\nYou know lasers therapy to put little openings or holes in the Irish the color part of your eye to decrease the pressure but we know very well that stems cells get to those small blood vessels in your retina we have patients that are diabetic were threatened apathy that have had unproven division as a result there during this time so I have for diabetes we didn't even do\nThe nasal approach on those people but when people have eye disorders or people that have a stroke\nMS Parkinson's Alzheimer's when you do the nasal approach\nThen you have more stem cells directing directly going into the air go through the back of your nasal cavity there's evidence of that in\nA way of our any any actor racket Tasha by what the hell have been banned me\nRight so let's let's go through this again if you have damaged pancreas cells and your diabetic and we do a stem cell ivy the stem cells will get to the blood your pancreas become pancreatic cells that make insulin and that's why we have seen patients and you can see them on a video that after two to four months after stem cell procedure annoying diabetic\nAnd we also have patients with heart failure liver fairly kidney failure we have patience with MS Parkinson's or stroke the videos of MSN Parkinson's you could see people\nThat were in a wheelchair for six to eight years an out of the wheelchair so there's ample evidence of this I thought I'm not trying to force you to believe something that you just don't know who's to blame for that I don't believe Afghanistan and giving and samples of what why and how we can see these organs on these issues that are damaged have reversal\nI thought okay I have one last question why isn't there any advice\n[noise] I call my ... to stand that can kill it\nThere's worldwide evidence I'd have to get on the Internet and look at stem cell therapy for glaucoma you can do that if you want to go to Google or a scholar dot Google and almost every degenerative disease there have been stem cell therapy clinical trials and particles have\nDocumented that did go on and went on a scholar dot Google ... I don't know that\nYou're looking at brain analyze information if you're just doing general searches scholar dot you know period Google will show your research on everything medical and of course that's where I always gather my articles and I put the abstract of this study is on my website so people could read that then click on\nThe full article if they want to read that so\nThat didn't show their actual people who have had if we do that\nYeah of course ... and and just about every new general disorder that you know you'll find red notice pigment toasted there's research on that were stem cell therapy has improved their vision so I mean I Can't go into hundreds and hundreds of thousands maybe a half a million or more a studies on stem cell therapy for every part of your body but\nI go to a caller about Google and ... up your topic look up ... coma and a stem cell therapy look on stem cell therapy in a coma look of stem cell therapy an optic nerve you could look to let up because that's where all the research is is is found on scholar got Google thank you for your call so\nI've been saying this for years and that's why I put the articles of the website um great resource for a wide range of disorders and there's one general fact these cells exist in your body much larger mountain bone marrow than fat once you take the cells were close centrifuge system you spend them you put them back in your body they can get to anywhere\nThrough your blood flow if it's a joint you have to inject enjoying if you have a lung condition we would do intravenous\nAnd typically a nebulizer with a stem cell liquid to put those stems cells in the nebulizer\nGetting topical your lungs are getting a double approach for people that have Alzheimer's Parkinson's MS stroke and many of these disorders in your head you do intravenous and then the nasal nebulizer and then we just drift them into your nose so they can get to the back of the nasal cavity directly into your brain\nI mean I think it's entirely possible because we have a lot of evidence from worldwide literature we have evidence for patients that stem cells will get to the eye and I keep you mentioned the patient with a diabetic written out to be a significant improvement in vision another lovely lady who we saw a we treated about three or four weeks ago and last week\nWith her three we follow up from stem cells and she had macular degeneration so she didn't have central vision she didn't have color vision and now both of those things have returned in a short period of time three weeks is a very short period of time so now you can see things she can signed her name on a line ah we're we're doing a video and her I think this week coming up\nSo that video is going to go on the website within a couple of weeks so we know stem cells can get to anywhere your blood flow does\nThis will be for my health care who you know many years ago was at a car accident and has lost most of her vision as a result of being in a coma for\n... plus days that within a coma and\nWhether you have ... and she has she lost\nWeight by like get a period of a meal clarity and\nWell I mean I don't think there's any drug or surgery that can do things like stem cells can cause you're putting brand new cells in the area um we have a patients that have had significant vision improvement that are MS pockets of patients as I mentioned diabetics this lovely lady with macular degeneration so we know the stem cells can get there\nI remember you know trauma to the brain what happens cells start to die and they're losing blood flow they're losing oxygen vitamins minerals hormones so there may be other things to do as well to try to have to picture but you know we won't know until we start to see\nYou know what her testing shows will look at vitamins and minerals hormones and the best way to see what's happening with you know the therapy is to do it and watch\nThe response but look at the videos the website you'll be amazed at that\nI Will thank you for taking\nMy thank you for the call okay let's go next to Steve in Glendale how are you\nAre you doing doctor or as a um I have got asthmatic cough of what the past forty five years old I probably going to go athletic cough right\nWho could be a like a new I ... I just have more of her own thing\nYeah your body makes mucus in response to things that are coming into irritating it usually allergens so it could be ... could be food allergen so that's one of the first things I Would test a cause that's one of the major reasons to produce mucus in your scientist your nose\nYou throw your hair ways so that makes it very common cause\nI did have attached to her ... her allergy always and how did they do it and it was a a while I I have blood tests on\nBlood is not the final word on algae because it's only looking at three seconds of blood going through the needle into the tube so that can tell you about every bit of blood or every antibody floating all over your body so they'll blood is not a bad screening test it doesn't show you as much as you would if you did in ... testing so\nUh I don't like scratcher protesting necessarily because I think there are a lot of false negatives with that that's what traditional medical literature is documented so ensure during those are the gold standard\n... I'm ... involved\nIt's just sitting down and you know wearing a short sleeved shirt where we would you know do some skin testing on the upper arm of your shoulder when we put\nWith a tiny needle a liquid bump a lump like it's called the wheel W. H. E. A. L. O. the allergen liquid in your skin if we use a very weak dose initially you may see negatives you might see a positive and we may do\nA secondary tests in that second test which little stronger might show a positive so then we know exactly where your threshold for the allergic responses\nI I tried to eliminate every time you\nKnow they can't do it on your on you have no idea you couldn't eliminate something where you have a delayed reaction so you eat everything and you say wow I've had no problem eating the food now but it may take a week to create a reaction\nSo that's why I mean I'm sure sure and you can only make the environment and there's no way you open the door you know pounds allergens come in you have a pet I mean it could be any number of things so\nThat's why you want to test a variety of things your vitamins and minerals your hormones a lot of asthmatics are low and potassium and magnesium 'cause those are important for the blood vessels that are wrapping around your airway so if you're low in those minerals airways might be tied to them they should be but that's why we do the comprehensive test\nAll ... or any way to get over ... ...\n... get rid of the cause a lot of people use ... sort of the device system to flush out the sun is we have to understand the causes first you have to stop the reason that you're having a 'cause that'll be the most important part so give us a call the office we'd love to help you out five six seven nine four zero four zero four\nOkay phone lines robot if you'd like to call in to ask a question let's go next to bill in New

brain it would either need to be a PET scan which can show you know that your lightest but you can't just limited to inflammation in the brain because then you say well what's causing inflammation in

I'm Christopher Cruz Senator Joe Manchin says he will vote yes on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court correspondent Linda Kenya on he's on Capitol Hill for this afternoon's big vote\nAll of your you know credit cards and things where you're saving and get a tally up or what you're actually spending\nYou know which is a lot easier than it used to be because the technology\nIs number one thing that you liked about our three sixty financial Porter whether you're a millennial or you're in that financial red zone where you are retired is the fact that you can have your budget automated for you and download it and tell you exactly what you're spending up some of the benefits of that rye or something to you and I felt we had subscriptions to things that we no longer\nWanted but boy once I get your credit card they keep banging away at it\nYeah and it's kind of like that closet that's really messed you don't want to go into it because you don't want to see like\nHow many things you have to do but I mean really I always think that Bob it's almost like financial therapy right when you come into our office and we sit down and we just start talking about budgeting 'cause a lot of just a conversation and you can kind of breakdown things is that even you know loading everything in initially and just you know getting an idea of what you're spending on a on a monthly\nAn annual basis it doesn't take that long and it really gets the ball rolling in terms of where things need to go with your financial planning which is huge\nYeah it's an unfortunate writes a lot of people let that hurdle you know that one hurdle like I don't want to think about how much I'm spending or how much I Need to have\nYou know while I'm In retirement because you need a starting point right if I'm I'm yeah I'm up in Long Island this weekend so if I'm In the middle Long Island and I say hey right when it comes to visit you at your office and you ask a very legitimate questions like Bob where are you actually do idea are you going to give me directions\nIt's going to be hard it's gonna be really hard and it but I think you know\nFunny enough that's how we do our financial planning right having a portfolio invested\nIs not a financial plan right because if you have a poor boy that's invested you don't know really is it achieving your goals are not right you might have too much cash and you may need more growth in your ... you're not getting it or maybe we're taking way too much risk that's jeopardizing what you're going to be in retirement\nBut unless you know what your budget numbers are you really can't put together a true portfolio allocation that is right for you\nAnd it really doesn't matter what stage you are at your life right now but by not\nSitting down and having someone to do a projection or run a financial plan you don't really know if you're saving properly you don't know all the different ways you can cut taxes I mean\nYou said all the time money saved them taxes is just as green as money made in the marketplace I'd someone in this week who was selling a big piece of real estate matter of fact it was Ninety percent of his network\nAnd for forty years and never put money into a defined benefit pension or put any money into a retirement account\nBecause no one told me could he paid a million dollars in taxes in his lifetime that were unnecessary\nAnd that's the only thing we neglected more than anything else by the taxes right there's probably a lot of things with regards to taxes you could be doing now that can really less and you're not you have to pay to the government but I think it was will Rogers that sets\nAnd I can love the government can fill up the government paying less taxes so it's you know why pay more than you have to\nYeah well I get focused on the wrong things right it's not about achieving a certain network or a certain account balance right there's things we can't predict but you know we can all do we can prepare\nYeah and if you sing yourself right now you know I don't have the budget for retirement I have an investment account but I don't really have a financial game plan that's going to take me

about how human nature is really not conducive for making good investment decisions\nSo I thought it was a good time to discuss some of the war stories that you and I have seen when it comes to investors making very bad decisions about their money and really how do we defend against that and you know one that we've seen a lot\nEspecially when we're in a bull market and we're in a ten year bull market right now is greeted right you know\nAnd now you have some great examples of ah where greed gotten away of a good investment strategy\nWhile row you know the famous movie from twenty five years ago Wall Street that's quote was greed is good right\nWell guess what I'd do it is bad greed is added apparently dangerous or financial health you know that story that a friend of mine that that could uh two hundred fifty thousand dollars into a penny stock ran up to seven million dollars like the most uh once in a lifetime chance\nHe gamble to one and a didn't understand what fourteen and a quarter because he thought the stock would trade it for two to three aids and the sad story is that once the zero and he now lives on Social Security\nIt could be sitting with a portfolio twenty thirty million dollars today just clipping coupons on this missile bond portfolio that's reality can hurt you\nThat is one of those painful no pun intended stories I remember another story above a client that you had back in the nineties when the tech bubble\nThat are now some of the biggest companies in the world that you've never heard of Twenty years ago I mean no one has that gifted insight no one has that ability right I think his\nUndeveloped Bob I think you know most people on Wall street are ordinary people trying to do extraordinary things and we you know they try so hard to make themselves seem extraordinary and your eyes and the reality of it is you know most of these quote unquote professionals that not that good [laughter] well\nHere's the thing that's why we buy the market right because we don't know which company is going to be the best performance shock over the next twelve months but we do know we're going to own it because we own everything has publicly traded so at the end of the year I'll tell you all the great companies that we own ride that have been the best performers but I Can't tell you until January twenty Nineteen\nAnd you see a lot of that right now you know I see a lot of ... and you may have this in your own portfolio were maybe have Facebook maybe have Amazon and it's doing really really well and you have to ask yourself\nAm I that good or might just lucky and odds are\nLet's be honest with ourselves we're probably just lucky and then the second question is at some point and I think Facebook's a great example of this Bob you know Facebook lost over twenty percent of its value in one day you know what kind of risk you have in your portfolio were maybe are sitting on a stock you think's going to be stellar you don't know when it's going to finally stopped\nAnd start to go down you know there's no gift insight when to do that\nWell you know ride like less than it's been learned over and over you know back in the late nineties uh the big winner was Cisco you know the company that makes for hours and the people that a lot of speculators you know made money and Cisco and met with a lot of people I should buy buy on Cisco why do I need anything else and I always had the same thing and I miss Cisco what's the next one\nAnd it can never tell me so it's only in hindsight that we know hell brilliantly yard are

one\n[laughter] so this is it Bob this is the top of the market we should sell everything and finally put all of our savings into gold\nRather ... you know the reason why they think it's a top is because the market made a new high\nWell that's not a real compelling reason because the market can keep making new highs and it has now for you know most of the year\nWell they also cite the fact
