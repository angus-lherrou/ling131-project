but can I Do a liquid rhino plastic and then does it ever prevent me from doing of real Rana Plaza in the future\nGo ahead Dr and when you take ... take this one so that's a great question Francesca [noise] you know the liquid water plus a new idea of what\nTheir nose can look like it's a very simply from doing your lunch break and we can kind of string the hope and make it look straight and make it would really pretty but it does not replace a real vinyl plus it because\nYou saw the little nasal also ... we can bring the hub down and make your nose beautifully street that's permanent you'd have to come in every six months to a year ago done and we could also make your nose breathe better because it does has to breathe as good as it looks\nYeah so one of the things that we do at the time of a nose job is we fix the breathing so um ... if she has breathing problems we can take care of that at the same time\nWhere you can fix my nasally voice and helped me not snore at night\nAnd then we can make it into an opera singer yeah there's a lot of things that we can do Francesca to help out with the breathing problems that you may have already do you have another question for us\nI Do I've always wanted to do my breast also because I wasn't blessed like my sister Kim was so I really want to do my breast can I Do it at the same time\nYou absolutely can do at the same time we do the rapper recovery breast organization system and the rapid recovery nose job at the same time every day\nSo it'll be a rapid amazing operations and natural ski so natural key whether we do a ... to the lives like we were talking about ...\nNatural is important whether we're doing nose or the brass and we do an extensive computer analysis and Sarah does these all the time in our office to image the brass to make sure that we have that natural fit to the breast so we can absolutely a match that to your anatomy\nYes so we can use a special machine to actually take a picture of your body and then place implants I'm\nAs it would look or as it ... it would appear on you can try different sizes on you can put clothes on with the implants you can see different views on and we actually have the advantage of of seizing you and surgery as well we had every implant imaginable here stocked\nA so that we can um put different sizes and one in each breath sticking its knee deep you asymmetric um yeah so we had that benefit alright\nPerfect so the fringes that answer your question\nYes you guys made me a lot more comfortable definitely going to come in for a ... and you made me a lot more comfortable and knowing that I can get back to work quickly as kids so I appreciate your time think you\nAre and I was so much for the call two one two three one nine for nine nine I this is Dr Steven Greenberg although with Dr germ into and Sarah or head physician's assistants there are so many things to talk about today I Want to turn our attention to all over the news director Nick\nWas this um patient who lost about two hundred and five pounds this week and we here at the Greenberg cosmetic surgery centers see tons and tons of patients who have massive weight loss\nI mean massive weight loss as one of those things you guys have to understand what Sarah does behind the scenes she just points to body parts we have to go to blow you has been through the massive weight loss of a thing as well he was very underappreciated under the clothing but when someone loses\nEighty pounds or more or you know a third of their body they developed a lot of loose skin it's a life saving operation or lifesaving lifestyle change but\nThat's where we come into play because we're the icing on the kid we get to nip and talk all these extra skin areas make him look rights because patients who lose a lot of weight can't\nLose the extra skin and that's what it comes down to so they have their ... face to face said their breath said their arms and legs that tell me everything has to be kind of put back and remove the skin\nI think I think Instagram by the way in social media with a ... a big role in this now because people are getting new motivations and new\nSort of knowledge of how to lose the weight how to do it naturally to diet and exercise as being promoted a lot more so we're getting tons of pictures coming out with twenty pound we lost thirty pounds last with a little bit of extra skin below the belly button or extra you know loose in the press\nThat need to cut you because you just can't lose out with working out\nYeah it's impossible right there to lose all of this way and we see a lot of these patients\nYeah it's a big accomplishment to lose that much we I mean even just to lose ten pounds unfortunately you can't always lose a skin that goes along with it um and in fact your neck and Dr Greenberg said that's where we come in on and you can combine multiple surgeries and one and a lot of patients don't realize that\nThey think that you can do you know maybe your breath and your arms at once and that's it and you have to come back for a second or third surgery on but we can do your breath your belly your your legs your arms all at once on and give you a whole body make over so I mean you literally can have a total body make over after losing all this wait\nA minute makes patients feel a lot better they lose the weight and they're still unhappy because of all the extra skin that they have\nNo question it's impossible to lose on your own so we put together a mess of weight loss patient package and we have a lot of different packages we have the mommy make over package for the moms out there we have the starting over package of people\nYou know who went through a um you know getting a new job and things like that the divorce package\nAnd obviously the massive weight loss package as well so there's tons of things that we can do to get the body back we put them altogether and by the way for those of you listening from overseas we have the fly in packages well which is an unbelievable package a lot of our patients come from not only the New York metropolitan area\nBut from around the world as well if you do the king of packages real what a package Israel while the packages\nUm where to go right back to the phone lines to one two three one nine for nine nine nine us two one two three one nine for nine nine nine is Greenberg cosmetic surgery dotcom we're happy to answer any of your questions right here on the air or\nIf you'd like to come in for a complementary consultation we can arrange that as well do what the secretary are standing by to take your calls and make those appointments for you All right who do we have on the phone [noise]\nHi my name is Amanda Hi Amanda how are you I'm well how are you good so how old are you on ... and where are you from I'm thirty okay and where are you from I'm from ... New York okay a couple of Long Island people today are perfect what questions you have for us Amanda\nI'm I really I'm missing some ... and my upper body area and also I have some love handles that no matter how much I work out I Can't seem to get rid of [noise] I was wondering if there is maybe a couple of procedures not just um plastic surgery alone not just the cosmetic procedure that would be able to tighten everything for me\nOkay Dr Nick or Sarah what are you guys take that question there you go [noise]\nSo you don't want any plastic surgery you don't want any cosmetic surgery or\nI'm not opposed to it but I'm saying I Know that my friend tells me that there is a couple of things that you can do together in conjunction with like a liposuction or like a smart ... okay so\nThere are some on minimally invasive non surgical options such as cool sculpting cool so thing is a thirty minute procedure that you can come in during your lunch break you can read a book watch TV read a magazine on and get that done in a matter of thirty minutes that's not the right procedure for everyone it's more for patients who are\nUm have a um like spots areas that needs our ... small areas cool sculpting gets revved up to thirty percent or twenty percent of the fat in that area\nAnd you're telling me is there we can freeze away the fat right exactly the way that we can shrink down the skin there's so many things that we can do to make you look better right\nYeah so that's the next option liposuction and we do a ton a ton of liposuction I'm liposuction is a great way to get rid of fat in multiple areas the flanks of love handles the ballet the inner thighs and then we can transfer that on the air but if your ear you send your unhappy with the shape of the year but\nUm so we can translate that chair but and and give it a much better shape\nPerfect yeah and you hear me this look I ... the Brazilian boatlift that sounds like that is what you're really going for there are a lot of people out there who know or the or look what they want but they don't know how to get there\nAnd I think you need a board certified legitimate plastic surgeon not someone who calls themselves one\nTo educate you and tell you how you can get there and if it's safe and if it's right for you to some people coming and say oh I Want to do cruel sculpting\nA but it's not going to achieve the results that you want you may want to do it but it's not going to be where you want to do the Brazilian boatlift is absolutely awesome where we do is we liposuction target is just like the love handles witches are impossible to get to move out or how much where you lose there still say\nWe liposuction those areas we split down we purified and use those golden gorgeous\nAll right so let's just talk about different acne treatments there and what we can do here at Greenberg cosmetic surgery\nYes so talking about the term aspect of acne I mean there are obviously so many medications out there and prescriptions that we can prescribe um to treat the acne a ... you know birth control ... pills that we can use to treat the acne their cream steroids\nWashes antibiotics that you need it on and then there are are other things they can do like facial ... acid facials hydro facial to clear out the port on so so we combine 'em both a germ and the spot aspect for patients who have acne and not\nEven just brown spots or a lot of times it a lot of patients who come in with scarring from ... so boxcar scarring or or ice picks ... those those deep hit its kind that you get\nA more used to have acne or or cystic acne um and and patients are really self conscious about that so\nI think it's really important to to go through what we can treat active acne so there's tons of patients out there that are just that their wits end and there are so many things that we can do for active and is also a ton of people who have scarring from acting\nThat we can see it as well you hit it perfectly so there's the the active phase the maintenance phase and the quiet phase right and we have to treat those old differently I we had a patient come in a few days ago who bought like a four hundred dollar package for active acne on line and it did nothing\nAnd I was reviewing them I said you know what this is acne is not something that's so simple that everyone has the same type of acne out there\nBut when our dermatology division saw that patient\nThey completely changed the regimen to get that actually under control to quieted down to get those little you know plus jewels and the little Komen does to come down and then they switch the regiment to somebody to maintain the skin so there's different phases has to be treated differently by a medical doctor not just by Amazon\nIs so it's a combination of different things um that we have to kind of kind of treat so the active and the other types of acne two and a late acne or whatever so let's go right to the phone launched two one two three one nine four nine two one two three one night\nFor nine nine I we have tons of course if you don't get through or if they um if you can't get on the air come on down the stairs for complementary consultation myself doctrinaire Sarah we'd love to see you I'm In person do you make an appointment of one of our offices\nAnd that could be in Woodbury which is on Long Island Manhattan South Hampton in Florida if you're hanging out down in Florida as well All right let's go to the phone lines who's\nOn with us yeah if I may name is Martha uh Hi Marisa how are you I'm good thank you very much perfect how old are you where are you from ... I'm thirty one from Manhattan okay perfect what question do you have\nUm I was just asking about the breath augmented last okay perfect so let's go through that a little bit Dr Nick about breast augmentation and lifts of breast which is something we do many many times every single day here at Grand ...\nWe do it so much because it's so common you know if you're a mother who's had a child\nGone through the obviously the the birth given process and ... but you must have taken a hit it's taken a change for us expand during that period the contract afterwards or you know six months after delivery and you're maybe that's a stretch marks for extra skin or the nipples me for or the fleet\nYou'll notice it because the bra size changes since late ... will not here okay good\nI was just checking so their breast deflate me and they lose volume after having kids and the the hormones take away the breast tissue they're not like walking down the street or in the subway and all of a sudden the Russia popping up of an air comes up yeah exactly no it's a little difference as to you losing volume as you either age or your um having kids or whatever I\n... I think we have a patient on the phone but yes you're right yes we we do is okay let's go back to the phones photos and find out exactly what kind of questions yeah so how how droopy or your breasts\nThey're not where they want where I Would like them today okay and um and are you going to have any more children\nNo alright perfect so you're the perfect candidate to do a breast implant\nAlong with a breast left or just a breast lift alone those things are pretty simple in office procedures and we can definitely boost John up by the way regarding an input as you mentioned a lot of people say I don't want to be big I don't want to look fake\n... we don't use breast implants to make you look big or pick which sometimes you recommend breast implants because we need a foundation to lift your breath sons and most of our patients you don't see an implant it doesn't look like him Anderson he stood on breast look it looks really natural we should we actually have\nHusbands of our patients who don't even know their wives have implants in them I don't I don't know so what do you think about\nYeah I mean people are always afraid that they're going to look to bag always always always they always say want the natural luck I don't want to look too big I don't want them up to my chain I don't want a really big cleavage\nOn that just because you're getting a laugh then we're using implant like ... that doesn't mean that we're using it to give you a huge breath um we're giving it to give up or poll firmness what that's basically just a little bit of upper poll say your breath darn sloping or you get that ski slope lock\nOn so again we always strive for the natural luck and we can use the busy and machine\nAs we spoke about before it's actually show what a lift looked like as well as an unplanned um so so we have options to show you what you what you could look like with both\nTons of things we can do and computer imaging will definitely help we'd love to see it for a couple of tree consultation so come on down to one two three one nine for nine nine nine if you can't get through us on the phone or if you want to just come and see us we're happy to evaluate thank you so much for the call\nAnd we'll see in the officer thank you I was the soon All right so we're going to take a short break we're coming up right here on nip tuck Saturday on W.

U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know which one of the most powerful super\nFeeds on the planet you can positively influence our DNA AA meeting joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible\nHeadlines on human and tell us why you use this we talked about this off year a few minutes ago just patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of Kirk human which seven times greater insurance\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know the term Kirk human\nThey may well note tumor wreck route which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying ... and its derivative Kirk humans since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied is this\nA couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is\nPowerfully antioxidant we know that it has a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined tell so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these agents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff\nYou get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion is one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies\nBack it up now Chris I Know that we turn to him or the ... the green tea in the ... humid in your new green she she aren't liquid soft you know formula which purity is giving away for free today the first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the rich rich room which is super hot right now there was no some of the headlines and the science behind your spiritual I Know it's from red wine and the French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just said to shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in grapes in wine grapes that also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like curriculum and extract it's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in to issue an insulin sensitivity resveratrol helps to protect against\nThose things so it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's\nConsidered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine ate a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair\nBut was there a trial appears to be key in that an additional lay there is a brain benefit like\nThere is with the Kirk human\nWith blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resume or a trial you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that were just playing take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Chris let's laser in on how this wonderful formula you created to judge Judy ...\nI Know that purity it's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years ago ... reading from the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottle of this green T.

C.

need to know about this we'll stay tuned Dr ... eleven is on the line here Dr ... eleven is a chiropractor he's a nutrition as he's a longtime advisor for purity products welcome Dr eleven so great to have you back on the show today this is a big story isn't it Oh absolutely\nSteve and let's go right to the chase here that discovery\nYou talked about at the top there\nIt's cruel oil because Grillo oil is simply amazing for us it's great for the heart great for the joints fantastic for the brain for the eyes I mean I have people coming into my clinic every single day and they want to feel better I mean they want to feel physically better stronger they want their joints to feel comfortable but they want to stay mentally sharp\nThey want to keep that brain thinking like it did when they were younger they want to protect themselves from a coronary heart disease and maintain those flexible health a youthful arteries for wonderful circulation hasty they want to boost their energy and you wind not I mean we deserve it and that's what we're going to be talking about here today with this cruel omega fifty plus which is the\nCutting edge combination Steve of crude oil\nWhich is so fabulous for us but we infused the cruel well not so important we've infused the crew or with the high omega three concentrated official you need to do that when you're dealing with cruel because cruel just isn't high enough\nThey don't make it through so many other important parameters and virtues but\nYou got to get that high omega three fish are on there and we've done that so this is now the best of both worlds but we didn't stop there for the fifty plus years we've added some vitamin D we doubled the antioxidant power and Steve we actually increase the amount of ... sixty seven percent so this now becomes the finest omega three nutrients in the world as far as I'm concerned\nThis is very very exciting this cruel oil sensation I mean it is all over the news docked in the eleventh grade studies are out there are many experts are declaring that cruel oil is better than fish oil so give us this low down on his girl omega fifty plus formula\nRight right right the you know if I told you I mean we did talk about this before the show that there's this one tiny pill that benefits the joints and the brain and memory mood coronary heart disease wonderful for the arteries makes your hair showing great for the skin I mean what would you say that\nHey where is it working I get [laughter] right and\nWe have it it's cruel maker fifty plus and we're going to give it to everybody for free today and that's really cool because parity want everybody to try this because they know they're going to see a huge difference but get this\nOn top of that for the first thousand people that call today and we're giving way second gift\nBecause I just demanded this you know we're dealing with the fifty plus her and said hey you know if you're forty and you feel like your energy is low this is for you also but for people fifty and over we're also giving away free beat twelve energy melts I demand this because hey as we're getting a little older we don't absorb that beats welders well and I want you to feel\nThe benefits from this Crowell mega fifty plus or to Jack up those B. twelve levels for you today as well you know what a value proposition\nNo when it comes to your health it really is a win win this is amazing I heard you say that this can actually reduce the risk of coronary heart disease I mean when you hear that whose ears don't perk up after that how exactly does that work anyway\nRight right well Crowell maker fifty plus remember this is the combination of cruel world with the high omega three highly concentrated they should also which is much higher\nAnd omega threes than most cruel oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the high omega three fish oil we're talking about support for the HDL cholesterol\nHealthy you pull flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that stay nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little ... oh what about triglycerides that become so important so this\nCruel and I get fifty plus supports the heart in so many ways and you know the bottom line is we need to think about this because as we're getting a little older fifty plus maybe mid forties certainly sixties and seventies it's decision time I mean you know your body's not working the way it did when you were in your thirties\nEnergy might not be there you need to make a decision or are you going to take it laying down and just let yourself get old or are you going to do something about it you're going to stay physically active all you're going to do the things you need to stay healthy\nAnd getting these omega threes that crude oil the vitamin D the antioxidants makes such a difference this is a game changer for anybody in that fifty plus age group\nNow this is absolutely great information I Know that a mega threes talked about that just for a second her best known for their cardiovascular benefits\nAnd there are certainly also known as bringing food now we've discussed this in some of the past shows if you would touch on the brain benefits for our listeners listening out there today and tell us why you say that supplementing with omega threes isn't just a good idea for the brain but an absolute necessity\nGo oh this is such an important point that you're bringing up absolutely for brain health we must must get these will make it three's back in there you know when you think about omega threes and you think about brain health and memory and mood and feeling sharp you really want to single out the D. H. A. component to that do go\n... you know what Steve your brain is sixty percent fat body weight and up that twenty five percent twenty five percent needs to be the age you know what I use an analogy in my practice people understand\nCalcium and bone health right if you don't have housing in your diet and you don't supplement with calcium your Bones Are going to get brittle and weak you understand that right\nRight exactly that's what happens to those bones need house here for the normal strength and structure\nNow with the brain and the same the ha for normal structure we use this for one brain or to communicate with another to build out that bring me the serotonin doping mean old feel good neuro transmitters so must must habit must get it back in there so important and what this crew lawmaker fifty plus we've increased\nThe level of DHL because we concentrated omega threes and they're now\nWith criminal or fifty plus you got to get a hundred and thirty ... milligrams of da preserving Steve while the leading brand of crude oil you're going to get twenty four\nExcellence twenty four and a leading brand you to get a hundred and thirty with chronic or fifty plus that's why this is so incredible for the brain\nThis is absolutely exciting I got to tell you though during the last real show that we did together you're totally shocked me dock\n[laughter] whatever [laughter] civically you sat around the time I see what did I say that\nAnd I remember that the studies show that grill oil improved drawing comfort in just seven days now if the benefits of the brain on the hard didn't ... Myers\nThat certainly would that would touch on this study and tell us how this works\nRight right that was a great study in fact that's the reason I started taking crude oil about five six years ago a pilot study double blind placebo controlled exactly what you want to see out of the journal of the American College of nutrition not participants got three hundred milligrams of crude oil or placebo now remember\nIn Columbia fifty plus we're giving you even more giving you five hundred milligrams of cruel also even more potent but\nThe participants in this study that got the grill loyal got some amazing enjoyed benefit Steve\nGet this and just seven days and you remember this from the last show but you just seven days they were twenty eight percent more comfortable than George drop or when I read that I immediately went out and bought my first\nBottle of criminal but after thirty days they were thirty eight percent more comfortable the researchers didn't stop there they looked at the flexibility of the joints they looked at function of the joints all improvement a cold is the crucial oil advantage so if you're out there and you're taking fish oil fish oil is great I mean fish oil is in here it's so important but\nThat's what that's what I got a few of\nThe nation staff people are going to appreciate working with purity there are fantastic company they put their money where their mouth is they give out free bottles and you try and you're like wow this is great stuff thank God for purity\nLet's talk about the heart health for a moment it's probably the single greatest concern that people face as they age so\nAnything that we can do to boost heart health becomes really a top priority you know this I Know there's in those books out there and others as well and I know you mentioned earlier that omega threes literally lower our risk of corner heart disease you I have that correct 'cause that's a statement\nYou know absolutely protecting the Hart says what put omega threes on them back back in the seventies Dr ... discovered it you know how protective they were for the Eskimos by the way is a wonderful guy had\nLunch with them a year or two ago great conversation but bottom line is omega threes protect our heart in so many ways they promote a smooth rhythm mikel heartbeat important for the bodies normal inflammatory response in the heart muscle inside the arteries and beans\nThey promote those youthful flexible arteries so important for circulation they promote healthy blood platelets activity help your red blood cell activity who support healthy blood pressure that's very important triglycerides so they do so much for the heart so simply amazing\nCardiovascular protection with these omega threes\nAnd it just keeps getting better than a you know I got a better in mind when\nPeople I have patients come in here all the time and I'm like\nAre you taking your omega threes I Hope you're still taking your omega threes you know they're afraid to say no\nYou don't like the omega three doctors take your omega threes in fact if there was only one nutrient that I could take Steve honest to God if there was only one nutrient that I could take hands down to Jamaica for his first most important nutrient indiscriminate fifty plus the love the way to combine the crew oil with the fish will she even the best of both worlds can't beat it\nI've got to

average Seventy eight years old at this point they did MRI's scans of the women's brains\nAnd what they found Steve this is so amazing\nThey found that the brain volume for the women that had higher omega three indexes are in other words they had more omega threes in red blood cells the woman that had more omega threes and they're red blood cells\nThey had higher brain volume they were actually maintaining more of the youth full size of the brain their brains were bigger you could see it plainly any MRI measurements that's really cool but not only that there is a very important part of the

McGill is a higher rate hell so\nShe and she should water ... back then you know you've got to be careful how you put it puts me on the ice\nOn it you can't say that any more than\nI Do I say we\nThe playwright town I did grow up with really wonderful ... but the problem was that my mom cooked in a way that didn't work for me as a young mom and\nSo I but I realize that there was that it was smart that she had she just went to the grocery store and bought what what's on sale what within the then what look good and she says agree at home and she took the ingredients and apply them to the techniques and the formulas that she had internal I of course\nSo but the problem was I didn't have the kind of time that she did to like put a pot roast on early morning and let it simmer that better part of the day I needed quick quick formulas and said that what inspired the original [noise]\nBut you know that with two thousand and Eighteen years have passed and we've as you well know at things have changed dramatically in terms of the way that we eat in a way that we cook and in two decades ago it was time to give the buck a second [noise]\nI Can't uh you know looking and imply all the stuff that I've learned in the last\nTwenty years Eighteen years um started\nBeing a foodie and being a professional has\nIn this real pain by the way has written at least seven cookbooks one major awards for it and it was the executive editor of cook's illustrated which really was a pioneering ... despite all the elements of food magazines that were out\nYes you're so right you're so right I Would and I was part of the original staff that got that magazine up and running back in Nineteen Ninety two uh and I was with that magazine from Nineteen Ninety two to Nineteen Ninety nine zero\nWas great and it took really into account the way people who want to cook and made it easy so I was a huge trained but you growing up to where you grew up food was the way to do was aren't always want you want to do\n[noise] uh yes it was and from even you know as soon as I sort\nOf launched in the world I took a regular day job but at night I was catering and on the weekends I was cooking for people so it was always that direction I wanted to go and um\nAnd and still is I you know once it's sort of in your heart and in your soul\nYou or you go what sense yeah you do you're so you're saying might have a ... point\nDown pans which is such a putting truth\nBad no matter what the rest of the thing is he's usually I'm quoting you now a variation on his team yeah so he should have been a technique how to put it all together rather than how to read a complicated and ...\nThat's right if you can just look if he can just look at a recipe and say what is this you know [noise] nine times out of ten you can and I know that I Know from experience because I Know the Washington Post is getting ready to do a very uh this this very story and that people just\nAren't comfortable sort of substituting or flooding another ingredient said you know and I'm here to say that\nAs you just quoted mate recipes are just variations on techniques and formulas and if you can internalize the technique and see the recipe as a formula than you really open yourself up and allow yourself to complete freedom and the kitchen\nWell explain let's take something very simple and you know shopping tries stir fry for example\nStir fry is you know that you know when you go to a Chinese restaurant it's not a\nThey don't have like twenty different recipes going there and make a stir fry and it's based on you know my ... got a pound of protein a pound of vegetables or a flavoring sauce and garlic and ginger and and and an onion and if you can\nSend it said that if you come home and you've got shrimp in the freezer and you want to make a Trump stir fried that's\nThat's great if there is a stake in the ... and a refrigerator you can make a steak stir fry if you\nHave tofu and the and the refrigerator you can make a stir fry based on to choosing your flavoring sauce and then using whatever vegetables you have a round it's it's pretty simple\nYeah when you make an easy\nAnd when you make your tomatoes very simply you buy the best tomatoes yes and can you tell them how to crush them I knew ... how one little pot of tomato sauce can make three meals\nYes I mean because I think a lot of people go home and just think about what do I need to get on the table at night\nBut if you if you take four cans of tomato sauce and it's not that doesn't take that much more time\nTo crush four cans and squirt in you know I'm a tuba garlic paste as opposed to just three or four garlic clothes and then you've got the basis for so many different meals and not just pasta I mean you can use it for a ... to ... to talk to your pizza you can\nYou can use it to make as a base for chili or for chicken ... marsala or\nCountry captain or there's all these ... and you can also\nNew new tomato sauce into soup I'm like a pasta official or and you've already got the simmering part down so then it really becomes easy the next night to make dinner and one of the chapters that I\nAdded this time which\nI mean I I feel like I got rid of the appetizer chapter that desert chapter 'cause it's like we don't need that during the week what we need are more techniques and formulas that can help us\nTo get dinner on the table so but I did add a major chapter and it's truly the way I live called a little me and it's just a lot of little things that if you can get certain things done\nAhead of time and have these things on hand dinner really can come together quickly and as well as um you know the leftovers for lunch the next\nDay and age and you want to jump in your mum\nHad more time than you when it came to that she could make a pot roast or something would you have a whole section of putting everything in the pot and letting go\nYes I got I got to tune formula is like that one is kind of a\nA a a petite roast dinner um which you can have a complete roast dinner ... lots of vegetables a little piece of meat\nA in about thirty minutes and it just choosing the right to cut you can do sausages you can do rack of lamb you can do a thick steak you can do us I'm\nJust ruining\nJust put that in and do a sheet pan of vegetables and you've got an amazing um amazing dinner and unless you're a huge family there will be leftovers and I mean I Love\nThat my my leftovers of it having a pencil arrested vegetables there's just so many things that you can do for\nThem even example so you make roasted vegetables you use your sheet and it's good and then the next day or the day after\nThe next day or the day after you if if he made a pot of simple tomato sauce you've got you've got your base for pizza and then you can take those rusted vegetables and throw them on top of the pizza and ... again dinner and and\nHe's done it and how your chicken curry which people guard lumpy chicken curry but who's got the time\n... well you start off with a couple of rotisserie chicken I don't ever just by one rotisserie chicken because I feel like you squander it you basically pick off it and throw the carcass away if you buy two rotisserie chicken and you've you've gotten\nLegs inside dinner for four and I created a bunch of different glazes so that you're not if\nIt were and when you reverse that chicken or chicken legs and put a glaze on top of it tastes like you started from scratch so your legs in size are taken care of for night one then you've got 'em for whole chicken breasts that you can use to make a chicken curry\nUm and then you've got all those leftover bones that you can make a beautiful ... to me the best stock in a world starts with rotisserie chicken\nOr but she and I don't do a lot of people are going to be surprised to read that that you you you take all the meat on for ... for your various Russian abuse and take those bones you not like raw chicken which a lot of traditionalists to you know German upon\nYou use those bones river rotisserie chicken in December of them\nYes and and ... in it it makes for and I use chicken broth and water a mix of the two to pour over those bones and ... if you only have ... thirty minutes for the phone system or that's enough\nUm and you've got a full I mean that's kind of stocked it turns to jelly when it refrigerator right it's delicious so special and and you know the the things that that\nThat also make the meal special I I Try to take time um when I can to make a big fan of criminalized onions a ... and you can throw those into your simple tomato sauce along with maybe a can of beans or or some some or vegetables\nI don't know how do you do your own you know our moral and a little I'm most ... artists\nDo olive oil and lots of onions and my instead of doing a skill at this is a ... one of the things I've learned over the years instead of using a large scale it I use my roasting pans set over to burners to double my\nInterest in space\nHey I'm your age my surface my cooking surface said that I'm able to do for a very large onions at one time and cut that down and I just I start 'em off high and sort
