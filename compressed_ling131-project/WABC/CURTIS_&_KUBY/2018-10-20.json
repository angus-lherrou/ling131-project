A. B. C. let's go right to the phone lines to take our next caller who's on with us\nMy name is Rachel, Rachel euro with Dr Greenberg and Sarah and I'm Rachel then I added a I'm Rachel you have a question first first of all how old are you where you're from well I'm just so excited to be here Dr Greenberg and I've heard so much about you and I think if anyone can help\nIt would be you and thank you so\nAnyway I live in the city and New York city and you know it's it's a heavy heavy hectic schedule and I feel like my face looks like I'm eighty my body still okay\nCould use some I guess probably a little nap and talk but my face needs more than enough and talk\nWhat we can definitely have to now do you have extra skin is your next bothering you is it the whole thing\nThe gel line is really starting to bother me my profiles really starting to bother me and my eyes are really starting to bother me\nOkay so many things that we can do to help that out of first of all we do a lot of many faceless and read your face us where we actually pull the skin up we can pull the gels up and really rejuvenated and it's not like it used to be Sarah where it used to look fake we do really natural looks here at Greenberg cosmetic surgery\nYeah you're not going to look like and I I Know we always ether as an example Joan Rivers you're not going to look super pulled back really tight um again Dr Greenberg prides himself in the natural up a little poll to get rid of that I'm ... I'm\nUnderneath the ... area there the neck on the ... especially a lot of people complain about that\nUm and and just a light gentle poll to kind of just bring everything up\nA lot of times people will also do their upper and lower lives as well so they'll do their eyes on a lot of times we'll have skin that hangs over its called putting of their skin and those bags underneath the eyes that's quick and easy little incision on and remove the fat and the skin on\nSo many things will yeah now will surgical ... non surgical to help out to make the fish are driven is you know a lot of people ask us I'm Rachel about not only the polling back to the skin but the skin quality as well what is a skin look like particularly after the summer\nYou know do you have ... and all those things how's your skin looking\nI definitely had too much fun in the sun and I definitely need to find my right shade for foundation for this time of year and I'm noticing that all of like my hand and half still there and a half not still there and I'm having a hard time so I think I Need some help on my skin is well\nKnow in our skin spas at a river cosmetic surgery centers we can get for example where the brown spots on the red spot and you know clean up the skin consider really people have some scarring from acne or even\nLet me tell you though the male knows guys noses in women's those are very very different\nYou know guys those when you're doing a rhino plus your nose job it's about keeping them masculine making the nose nice and strict uh keeping it not to petite and also refining the tip of those without making them appointee so has to be natural has to look like a guy and guys by the way\nAlmost always have a DVD it's up to them their noses are always ... on the inside I don't know why but this was a snore and they just don't have the proper airway so odds are we may have to do a little bit of some ... some work to make sure that he couldn't breathe and look great but\nDifferent a women's noses ... you know we can make them look more feminine so we can take on the hope we can bring the bows and a little more we can from the tip and make it look nice and refined as well as do that's up to them to make 'em breed but the most important thing with a guy's noses to keep them to have a guy's knows [noise]\nYeah and and the recovery wise it's not too bad right we see patients after after getting the Rana Plaza is and it's like five days of this plan so not really a long period of time we take this month off at five days I'm no exercise or heavy lifting for one month but it's really not a bad recovery I mean\nNot not at all recalled the rapid recovery rhino plastic because\nYou can't go home does not hurt it feels also give us a call to a bit of congestion and a piece of plastic gonna knows five days or that comes off you feel like a person you feel great and you can kind of go back to your thing with no time for the only thing we can have is you have you know having mental list noticed the no working out\nYeah no no question and it was indeed do you guys were saying this is a we're getting to the phones are ringing off the hook right now about this doctor Dick happens to be I joke about being a nose king of the country does a lot a lot of noses and they look awesome so not only does he thinks the cosmetic aspect\nBut the breathing aspect as well and it's a really as as you said it's a really simple recovery it's surprisingly easy to recover from these noses docked in that\nRecovery I think is is there was ever going to because it's a close run and plus the inside of the nose there no scars from the outside we don't take apart the knows it's very nice and conservative and it's really easy to recover from\nNow you're too young to remember this but um when I was young\nA couple of years ago the nose is that we're done with these really like these ski slope noses and we don't like that stuff you're a Greenberg cosmetic surgery\nYou'll like a nose that's absolutely natural where someone's going to look in the mirror or someone's going to see 'em and say well what kind of make up did you change do where what's different about you're not the oh my God your nose looks over to\nThe ski slope the downward knows the pointy tip\nAnything where people can see from across the street and for that guy had a nose job that's all we're doing any more if it's only about being natural now has to be natural we like to make the nose is nice and straight and I want to keep the men's noses mass killing the women's ... but it has to look natural perfect\nYeah I see a lot of your patients and follow up after getting the surgery done and everyone is always so happy I mean I'm not just saying that I mean he doctor and he really do an excellent job at the right of these and the best part is and people\nAlways ask that for some reason there is no packing involved here that's really important for a lot of patience and they always ask he get a pack my nose and I got to have these things in my nose for a week um I you know I Can't I Can't do that I have to go to work this that and now we don't ... I Know that that may sound crazy but um that's really important for a lot of patients or have hockey yeah executives\nAnd when they when they shove things in your nose just uh I guess ... hill I never pack I in fact a woman who has to breathe or you know in the recovery room and that's where they worked around with a nice deep breath and because they couldn't do that before him\nYeah and I'm sure John was wondering that for no we definitely do not packing\nWould or do you have another email first Greenberg cosmetic surgery dot com two one two three one nine for nine nine nine is the way to reach us you've reached myself Dr neck as well as Sarah here at Greenberg has makes those or if you don't get through to get on the air today you will ... call us and make a complementary consultation see myself a doctrinaire\nOr Sarah we were talking earlier about I'm a doctor and if we were talking earlier with Sarah about the new mommy make over\nAnd Libya plastics and that when you're the Libya per se genius along with Sarah is now you have that nickname explain it to the right of course you can't get away with version genius I give both you know ... so um we were talking earlier how\nHow it's really a hot new not even new it's a hot thing now to get to Libya per se and visual rejuvenation I think it's\nThe fastest rising most rapidly rising surgery cosmetic surgery I I think that's where the stats for sure why it's not because it's new is because I think women now it's no longer taboo to talk about it and they actually seeking help because it kind of never existed that way before\nYeah I think women are realizing that there is something we can do for those issues they didn't think there was much that we can do for them um and and they're and they're talking about it sometimes but I think now that they're they're hearing more about it and seeing you know more video clips about it and what not they're more interested in asking about it\nUm and it's really not again not a bad recovery I Know it sounds I specially the woman it sounds hard to go through it's it's really not honestly\nNow it's actually very surprising to know that the recovery is so minimal because once you know there's a recovery room and we kind of get the women on an ice on it's really not about at all they got to go back to the routine\nPretty quick or you know I think what's changed in a lot of the things that we do um here Greenberg rapid degree because my surgery is Dr Nick and myself do these rapid recovery systems for a lot of the things whether it be a facelift whether it be um\nYou know a nose to nose job they were talking about earlier abreast of augmentation or the visual rejuvenation the rapid recovery programs that we instituted here are so important um to get patients back to normal activities really fast that the whole goal\nIs to have minimal you know change in your life should we come in we do need to do and get you right back to the routine of such as possible\nI have a question here about darn email question about what can we do instead of liposuction to get rid of that\nOn the body and we have here in the studio with us or our cool scoping um

exactly what cool sculpting is because we do a ton of it here at Greenberg cosmetic surgery\nI feel if they ... they but it's a great alternative for patients who are not a lot who are not willing to go undergo a surgery like us action they work they don't have that down time and sculpting is non surgical FDA approved\nA factory dachshund treatment and it's natural and still you know downtime with that\nAt handles absolutely love handles the abdominal fat\nAnd how it works and goes to minus fourteen degrees Celsius\nPretty cold patients actually feel the coolest when you're when we're freezing it away right\nWithin five minutes and for the rest of the time and it's very comfortable they don't feel anything because the freezing makes the tissue or to go numb and once you know you don't think people very often works\nTheir treatment and a two lines and sometimes even sleep\nSo we're talking about cultural thing and that we do a ton of it at Greenberg cosmetic surgery and it freezes away twenty five to thirty percent of the fat right from each one of the areas\nYes each time you do it is to twenty five to thirty percent of the south is gone and you can come back for their treatment and you can't even see more reductions so you can do it more than two times even\nSo the areas around here that we do a ... cosmetic surgery cool sculpting are the abdomen the love handles the thighs any other areas\nThat actually very interesting part right now that many guys right now come to me it's the guy and he called ... which also is a breast tissue for the guys\nAnd um guys work out all the time and they tell me a ... at the gym and we don't want this extra tissue nothing would we do a no no not any kind of weight really walk stiff muscle in that area and the fat it's disturbing
