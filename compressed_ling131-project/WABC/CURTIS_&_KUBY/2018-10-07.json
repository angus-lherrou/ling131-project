foot forward really gets the whole process started and I think budgeting is probably the the first place to start with the financial planning process and the nice thing about now it's easier than ever you know we have our three sixty financial Porto which we talk about a lot\nWhere it's really easy to load in all of your you know credit cards and things where you're saving and get a ... for what you're actually spending you know which is a lot easier than it used to be because of technology\nIs number one thing that you'd like about our three sixty financial Puerto whether you're a millennial or you're in that financial red zone or you're retired\nIs the fact that you can have your budget automated for you and ... downloaded and tell you exactly where you're spending up some of the benefits of that rye or something at you and I felt we had subscriptions to things that we no longer want it but boy once they get your credit card they keep banging away at it\nYeah and it's kinda like that closet that's really messy don't want to go into it because you don't want to see like\nHow many things you have to do but I mean really I always think that Bob it's almost like financial therapy right when you come into our office and we sit down and we just start talking about budgeting 'cause a lot of it's just a conversation and you can kind of breakdown things is that even you know loading everything in initially and just you know getting an idea of what you're spending on a on a monthly\nAn annual basis it doesn't take that long and it really gets the ball rolling in terms of where things need to go with your financial planning which is huge\nYeah it's an unfortunate writes a lot of people let that a hurdle you know that one hurdle like I don't want to think about how much I'm spending or how much I Need to have you know wild in retirement\nBecause you need a starting point right if I'm I'm yeah I'm up in Long Island this weekend so if I'm In the middle Long Island and I say hey right when it comes to visit you at your office and you ask a very legitimate question like Bob where are you actually do idea how you got to give me directions\nIt's going to be hard as can be really hard and it but I think you know\nFunny enough that's how we do our financial planning right having a portfolio invested is not a financial plan right because if you have a poor boy that's invested you don't know really is it achieving your goals are not right you might have too much cash and you may need more growth in your ... you're not getting it\nOr maybe we're taking way too much risk that's jeopardizing what you're going to need retirement\nBut unless you know what your budget numbers are\nYou really can't put together a true portfolio allocation that's right for you\nAnd it really doesn't matter what stage you are at your life right now but by not\nSitting down and having someone to do it projection or run a financial plan you don't really know if you're saving properly\nYou don't know all the different ways you can cut taxes I mean\nYou said all the time money saved in taxes is just as green as money made in the marketplace I'd someone in this week who was selling a big piece of real estate\nMatter of fact it was Ninety percent of his net worth and for forty years and never put money into a defined benefit pension or put any money into a retirement account because no one told him he could\nHe paid a million dollars in taxes in his lifetime that were unnecessary\nAnd that's the only thing we've seen neglected more than anything else by the taxes right there's probably a lot of things with regards to taxes you could be doing now that can really lessen the not you have to pay to the government I think it was will Rogers that said you know I can love the government can fill up a government paying less taxes so it's you know why pay more than you have to\nYeah I might get focused on the wrong things right about achieving a certain network or a certain account balance right there are things we can't predict but you know we can all do we can prepare\nYeah and if you think yourself right now you know I don't have the budget for retirement I have an investment account but I don't really have a financial game plan that's going to take me through retirement here's your shot to get that analysis done if you're one of the first ten callers\nAnd you have over two hundred thousand dollar saved for retirement myself and Bob will run for you are famous total financial master plan it's not an investment plan it's a total

your portfolio\nAnd we're going to look at diversification\nWhat risk you have in your portfolio you don't know about if the market has another crash like it did in two thousand and eight are you're protected is your portfolio bought proved we're going to show you how to do that\nAnd the red tide altogether in total financial master plan\nOr we're going to determine that age old question are you going to outlive your money or more importantly is your money going to outlive you you laughing strategies now we've worked on for over forty years to take your family from point a to point day with the least amount of risk in a high odds of success\nOr you have to do is text or call aid for four seven five to six six nine to that's eight four four seven five to six six nine to if you're one of the next ten callers you've saved over two hundred thousand for your retirement\nOur team will run for you your own\nPersonal subtle financial master plan now there's no obligation and there's no cost because there's NO PLAN unless you call or text a four four seven five to six six nine to that tape for four seven five to six six nine to this is Bob paying on with my son ride pain\nAnd we're the pain of no pain no getting around [noise]\nIt's done it with a weekly no pain no gain\n[laughter] well here's the thing that's why we buy the market right because we don't know which company is going to be the best performing stock over the next twelve months but we do know we're going to own it because we own everything just publicly traded so at the end of the year I'll tell you all the great companies that we own ride that have been the best performers but I Can't tell you until January twenty Nineteen\nAnd you see a lot of that right now you know I see a lot of ... and you may have this in your own portfolio or maybe you have Facebook maybe have Amazon and it's doing really really well and you have to ask yourself\nAm I that good or might just lucky and odds are\nLet's be honest with ourselves we're probably just lucky and then the second question is at some point and I think Facebook's a great example of this Bob you know Facebook lost over twenty percent of its value in one day you know what kind of risk you have in your portfolio were maybe are sitting on a stock you think's going to be stellar you don't know when it's going to finally stopped\nAnd start to go down you know there's no gift insight when to do that\nWell you know riding lessons been learned over and over you know back in the late nineties uh the big winner was Cisco you know the company that makes for hours and the people that a lot of speculators you know made money and Cisco and met with a lot of people I should buy buy on Cisco why do I need anything else and I always said the same thing and I miss Cisco what's the next one\nAnd it can never tell me so it's only in hindsight that we know hell brilliantly yard are speculations but when it comes to achieving your goals you want to be a speculator investor right\nYou you know be Bob I'm a very conservative guy so I always go with being an investor I Know when I'm lucky and I'm usually lucky not good when it comes to picking the right stocks\nWell see that's the problem with financial propaganda I mean we get a week out they put out rains and rains and rains of information or why you should not be a smart investor while I used to be a speculator why should trade you know this week Wall Street journal came out and said we're not call it tough for sure looks like one\n[laughter] so this is Bob this is the top of the market we should sell everything and finally put all of our savings into gold\nRather ... you know the reason why they think it's a top is because the market made a new high\nWell that's not a real compelling reason because the market can keep making new highs and it has now for you know most of the year\nWell they also cite the fact that there is mergers going on mergers and acquisitions happen all the time but because there were three big ones this week with Comcast with serious radio with Michael corps they're saying that's indicative of a market top\nAnd you know what there's something called hindsight bias and it tells you what happened you know after the fact how many of these financial propaganda articles are trying to tell you what's gonna happen because of what's happened in the past it doesn't give me any gifted insight into the future\nNo it doesn't and I think you know the best example is Bob you and I both worked at Merrill Lynch and you know let's face it I've I left Merrill Lynch in July of two thousand and eight which only months before Merrill Lynch basically went out of business right they were bought by bank of America for almost nothing and I can tell you I was in that company\nAnd no one gave me any heads up that even being in that company that they had problems and you know the stock was going to plummet over the course the next couple of months\nAnd I think that's where you have to really really be honest with yourself especially if you're going to use report for for retirement have you made decisions in your portfolio you know written a stock up that you've done really well with is it lock are you good and you know what kind of risk you really have an underlying portfolio that could jeopardize your retirement\nYou sound like Clint Eastwood and and dirty Harris you feel lucky talk [laughter] you know you want to try and just be lucky about your investments or do you want to have a strategy to gives you the highest probability of success\nBubble they said that because those fancy myself the Clint Eastwood of investing a handsome man hey I don't think mom says that so that\nI have a face for radio but no it's a book if you're thinking yourself right now I look I've got a lot of risk in my portfolio I Know I have underlying risk I Know I've been lucky with a sock picks that I have I don't have a real investment plan I don't have a financial plan here's your shot to make sure you're on track for retirement we have a couple of slot slapped\nIf you give us a call right now and you have over two hundred thousand dollars safe retirement

I was sweating and eating because I was putting so much data and because\nThey had so many different accounts and that was one of the problems right is like the spouse was just like how am I going to deal with this if God Forbid something happens to my husband and that's such a big ...\nThat's what they called it [laughter] unfortunately when I took a deeper look at all those different holdings\nA similar theme kept coming up which was large cap gross [laughter] as we see a lot large kept grows cash and stable value fines says three different areas in Nineteen different accounts so that's not actually diversification\nGet the great irony right it's like you think okay I have my money at lots of different institutions I must be diversified but the reality of it is when he put it all on one spreadsheet you look at it from a bird's eye view a lot of times you do a lot of the same things there's just a different places that's not diversification\nBecause the big issue is you know when when it's up\nIt's not that's awesome but the big issue is\nWhen it's down you have all these accounts acting the same and that's not how you want to you want your accounts to have you know different asset classes and you want your your accounts to actually be allocated differently you know you're not going to have a Roth account allocated the same way and your taxable account\nYou know you want to take advantages and different accounts and use you know different tax benefits to work for\nA really good points Frankie but what exactly did you recommend they do different than what they were currently doing\nSo they say is consolidation we sat down and we said hey out of all of these you know Nineteen accounts we can get you down to less than five that's a big consolidation you do need to have Fifteen different areas\nA lot of the ... the spouses face like lit up when we said look we're going to be able to have one logging\nShow you were all your different accounts are going to consolidate like you sat down to five accounts but she was so stressed about not knowing where things were and you were able to go to this one place that we can log into and she could see everything and shouldn't have to worry about all the different places her husband happen to be you know ... away money per se and that's\nWhy you know like anything else I think what a lot of you do is you'll put money into different accounts with different you know targets in specific reasons for having that money investors specific goals but what really works is to manage your money in concert with every other dollar that you have\nNow there's nothing wrong with having your miserable bonds and your personal account writer having growth stocks in your retirement account but you need a coordinated plant and you need a simple view\nYou know by putting this all on paper it's crystal clear what needs to be done\nBut by having Nineteen different accounts there's no way in the world you can understand what you own and more importantly while you or what your grief Reich\nI absolutely agree into Ryan's point also you know having that one portal is nice but it's also nice to kind of have this team\nWhere she has support or we can walk through it God Forbid something happens to her husband but she has a team that she can depend on and that was a big thing for them he was working with someone they can pick up the phone and say you know I Need help I trust you that\nIn the worst thing to do for your spouse if you handle all the finances and God Forbid something happens to you and you know maybe it's with lots of different brokers are financial representative you have there's not one central person their spouses comfortable with you know it's going to be able to walk\nYou know him or her through everything if God Forbid something happens to you I mean that's huge in terms of taking stress off of a grieving spouse Oh absolutely adored\nRiley say financial planning is about love if you love your spouse isn't planning done because if something happens to him or her and suddenly they have to manage their finances after being in the dark for forty fifty years boys are going to be hell to pay\n... and that's the way and also you know during that time that's blessing that should be on your mind is now where's the checkbook right that's that's not what should be your your focus still\nMissing her nails is Frankie as the income went up dramatically they're going to have just because of your repositioning you know an additional three point four percent a year that's a little nervous amount of cash flow that they didn't have before\nAbsolutely and using it to their advantage and using it to compound because of what they were really fortunate West is one of the few people in this world Bob who have a pension so not able to you and\nI have right now for Bob and Bob yeah [laughter] that's a good long enough but it's a good ...

or if you're if you're a body water is law when you're walking around with a bunch of water and you're walking around with a book with drinking water all the time and meanwhile your water's low uh you're gonna that's gonna affect how your body metabolism is going to work\nIt's going to affect a your muscle is uh like the engine of your metabolism\nAnd so if that's not happening um because your body isn't absorbing water properly maybe one of the reasons you can't lose any weight so and put you on that machine will be able to see if that's the situation there so I just said and Jake dot dot com it's only twenty seven dollars and you can schedule appointment come in\nAnd we'll get you go in on the road to health and on the road to possibly shopping different particularly\nAt so I got you beat on that one what what what was your number your number one I don't want it for days and\nBruce was sixty days fifty six pounds and succeed\nHigh I got you beat on that one I got I'm yeah I'm a I'm ashamed to say well I'm not ashamed to say I don't really know his first name because he's in the Brooklyn office this man and and so and I I Believe that his pictures has the foreign actors actually on our website already a sixty four pounds in sixty days\nOh yeah I Know you're talking about yeah sixty four pounds and sixty days yeah yeah and he took great profile picture of himself the temperament is wearing a white shirt and tie and so the profound pictures fantastic so if you guys get a chance definitely go to and Jay diet dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four times in sixty days is very impressive\nMan and woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is\nThat um [noise] it's an ...\nNumber in my opinion is officer Amos and I I think something to that effect again I don't know the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but\nAh you know this is just staggering number and really just the health benefits of gas officer and he's chasing criminals around I bet you can do it much easier sixty four counts down I Would think so I definitely I think that's probably a much better situation for them especially in the heat that we've got\nGoing on them so we improved we've we improved the safety of our cities\nIs yes that's correct if he can chased on criminal ... yeah I Know you know when I went wow yeah when when one at a time right so but you know the the pound great but I think that um\nA lot of what we see in our office is really the health benefits of what happened then um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and um what you are a blood tests are and where your numbers are so\nWe had stand who are just um was in and he's on day thirty three out of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nOut which is a twenty seven pounds in thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that um has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however lover pound however his\nA health uh results or hit overall uh health um benefits have been ridiculous sell his blood pressure\nIs now one oh four over sixty four\nWhich I Would say probably a lot [laughter] not apply right his cholesterol ah\nWent I'm Down to one oh nine\nFrom from two twenty eight wow so his\nHDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven\nHis triglycerides are now a hundred and seven down from two fifty\nEight\nIs his day thirty three of the ...\nWell I mean I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day into the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do a blood work and all that other stuff by his appointment looked already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not\nWrite so hit primary care I fell off the chair absolutely at just blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you know a couple of months ago\nYou know your your numbers were a disaster basically you know and this case I can understand I have so much energy I'm doing this and doing that I feel so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days and and\nLiterally and he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma or it's tremendous tremendous um\n[noise] so I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office yeah fine\nTo the health part of it is the best part land and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and uh we were able to look at you know blood work in a functional level and and and uh\nSee what supplements what support people need and and it's so everybody gains weight and different areas for a reason\nThe body is generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone a disruption and so you've got the different body types you've got the name of the floppy overhanging belly fat where it could be an adrenalin shoe\nProtruding hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that side Roy issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid were imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be a Ninety number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from parents lobby used blood work assessment tool or to see when a functional level to keep to keep a ... to keep the body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nAh basically get people into the secular state of fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detox of flying itself\nThe hype asylum is which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of the body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat as basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat punching somebody to say that somebody too\nSo that's what we were able to do the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight is their thermostats at a two fifty and no matter what they do they're going to stay to fifty\nSo then we get them their bodies bouncing get him down to let's say two ten than reset the thermostat a two time you're going to say to ...\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well so if you're going to you know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if you're waiting pops up to three pounds we tell you how to what to eat that day drops the weight back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over a year you know day forty or or they sixty earned a program where\nSo ah you know it's a system it's personally from the beginning of ... at the end at the end we also use DNA\nTools or we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating a types or exercise for each individual uh the central the need for central vitamins and minerals are different or metabolic factors are assessed so we're looking at over forty different genetic factors\nTo help people not only help keep lose the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end this personalized each individual because everybody's going to be a little different it can't be one\nOr can't be a one or what one thing that sets everybody so it's got to be a little bit there but it's not one size fits all Israel to switch these things up and get the people get people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and your body is bouncing the health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight five five five\nAnd J died twenty five five five six five\nThirty four thirty eight and that's a schedule of free go over the system and one of our local five locations in the New York tri state area\nOr the best way to do it I think is to go on line you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in will do a ... an appointment with us a body composition analysis we are going to look at not just wait\nAre we going to look at body fat percentage were going to look at body water percentage were going to look at your ... your your metabolic ... so you're going to look at your basic metabolic rate and how about you and your daily caloric intake so those two numbers needs to be close to each other for you to be able to lose weight we've got people routinely coming in\nUh the solution can be there you can stop using that that thing um\n[noise] I mean at least worth given a shot you know what's the worst case scenarios we lose forty pounds and [laughter] you don't need anything anymore so a real easy to do a without any shots without ...\nWithout surgery without hunger that's how this program works for getting your body to burn three to two to five thousand three to seven thousand calories of its own fat for fuel people don't realize that you know ... pounds when you're talking about somebody losing a pound a day\nYou know plus the reading on the program so losing one pound to lose ... pounds thirty five hundred calories we routinely see people losing a pound a day plus three so we're talking about the body burning anywhere from four thousand\nAround four thousand calories a day minimally\nOr to to to lose the weight uh so you're not you we re route where your body's basically using for fuel your body's just using your own\nToxic fat for fuel so to to get that done at say five five five and Jay diet one eighty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight or that's good\nTo schedule an appointment a for free go over one of our officers now when you're calling and you're talking on the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee you that uh that's why we were moving all the ... and just come in and get a check up get a get a check up and all that\nUh and so just don't get mad at those people were people yelling at them all the time all the time uh and so just come in and and and uh\n[noise] and see us are there and uh but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven dollars normally signing nine dollars only twenty seven dollars\nOr you can um come into the office will do an appointment with one of ... with one of us\nAre you also will do a body composition analysis will take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage of body water percentage of visceral fat rating your metabolic age your basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things or body water so important that should be closer to sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time and drinking a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight gain a and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people\nCome off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully the body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just has some a lot of barriers that it can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers ... the personalization of the of the program the buyer energetic scans a parent's live a sample for that or blood work functional assessment a DNA testing or that shows us over forty different metabolic factors that we assess\nOr to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had to face healthy as possible so\nReally the N J died dot com or when a five five five A N J diet and wanted to tell you about a Sondra\nAre we talking about sleep I guess sleep with some some sort of a lot of people coming in with real sleeping issues and you know I Wonder why people are walking around with trouble to triple ... lattes well sleep eat off these from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation is having like a to think or ... no I Know and there was uncomfortable and one of the most awful things you can hats\nYeah but ... so people are coming in I guess they ... they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily some sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they're even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving\nA center came in a thirty nine year old female or she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a\nHaving a lot of getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's in the journal adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter solo so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to cortisol as grades it's a\nIt's produced by the adrenal glands and and so\nIt's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if your adrenal exhaustion issues a lot of times you'll see the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit on to that\nBut what's great about it is that she ... she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she's basically been sleeping like a rock\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed will arm weights or up at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she's just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom rich already started day\nRested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon a much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep so you see when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction I'm\nTwenty four pounds sleeping like a rock she came in we did the herring saliva sample or a bio energetic scanned blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support hype a family support we also gave her adrenal support um got they've got the body work in the right way and ah now we've got the results that we see\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more that\nI'm right between the ages of like thirty nine and forty one a lot of things change in the women's um body you know ... and cycle right and so it's really it's interesting that every ten years right away is that place I think that it's interesting that um\nYou know you brought that up but speaking of at the health benefits so we've had this happen a bunch of times in our office but this just recently happened again\nUh Michelle I'm who am I Believe she's in her mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really really a lot of weight eighty pounds eighty pounds well what happened was um she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so get a lot of\nYou know I'm hormone therapy type stuff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these drugs are really am known for um they'll put that might help put that dealt with a ton of weight on Yammer them and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and I'm also a very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive because of that\nUm she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then\nAfterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know are these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful as her first but she was about\nEighty pounds heavier than she had started out before so she came to us\nShe did to a forty they rounded basically means she went pound for pound them both of them um and that's very um you know it it's common because this was not her regular weight right this is wait put on with your mind right so that's why she went pound for pound because her body really needed it really needed to get rid of all it's great for pound for\nPound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound packs a day for a woman is absolute\n... we've had a number of women without an atmosphere it up\nSo anyway so she comes and she comes in 'em and she says um\nShe goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for hands saliva test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no hormones great now I I've E S no ... no nothing on she says I guess my\nGot rid of all the taxes of all the extra hormones I dropped all this way\nYes and now I'm pregnant but it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know I don't know at times I Would say yeah half a dozen a dozen times where I Am you know but she by the white completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know where settled with one child and happy and the baby healthy and so\nNow she's about to have a second one and she said I Can't believe I'm going to have to lose weight again but you know what I think it's going to happen to be honest with you is probably ... now they're not the average regulator bodies more regularly our probably gain she'll probably Jay has not gained a ton of layer already\nAnd she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different she feels so much healthier and really feels good and not as much knowledge I during the pregnancy she's really she says it's just a whole different experience for her\nOr be how much you know better they feel without those medications on a daily basis and listen I you know being married to a set of pills every morning is really really um\n[noise] depressing and a lot of ways I think um and I think that that's what our patients\nAre really start to realize if they hadn't already realized that before they came to us but one of those things and one of the benefits as when they come in and like you know hey I don't have to take that medication anymore my doctor told me I don't have to do that for us it's really great and you know you don't have to be best friends with your pharmacist\nReally don't know you know you could be best friends with someone else who provide positive things for you you know it's true\nI'm Shauna came in and she was down so shot at it or to the program she kind of a good in a weird way she looked at it for thirty days then she had a two week vacation\nSo she did the program for thirty days stopped the program two weeks short before a vacation to get a little ... to get to reset couple of days and then she came back in and she did another twenty days of the program she's just a total of Fifteen days are and what should the coughing as she was away so she stopped the programs for thirty days or lost a bunch of weight\nLoss for twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that in ... in the thirty days went away on vacation for for ten to fourteen days and didn't put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then she came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically she was fifty days of the program\nAnd lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat's pretty impressive yes that's great to vacation and where the occasion in the middle of say you must you must have customize that one for her well yeah we have to add a\nLittle bit of fun so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plans she had been away and look I'm not going to tell somebody that's going to be ... so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way um and ... which grade is she no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels are normal so she doesn't need that Juanita firewood medications anymore or and when she came in we we were able to do we did the hair on saliva\nBy energetic scans gave her a hormone support give her thyroid support she needed pancreas support also and she lost she lost that way or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used also to help keep the weight off to keep her ... to keep\nHer as as healthy as possible uh and you know when your thyroid ... you know is really important when you're talking about people that are coming in a lot of times with mineral imbalances in and things like that\nUh that affects the thyroid a lot the thyroid really that I dont gotta get bind with sodium to get into the cells of the thyroid or to eat fruit to even work so that's why you know people have a sluggish thyroid a lot of times you'll see weight gain and the problem might not even be with a thyroid problem might be but the fact that your body's not is has a mineral imbalance and the and the uh\nThe the the iodine may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so\nYou know that conversion the tea forty three the Israeli get that's the that's sort of the the gas pedal for the metabolism so to speak you know if that's what happened the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance and ... and balance\nA meeting your body isn't absorbing water properly before because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you've got thyroid issues and just not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid\nNot being able to get the even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get to the whole process going so that'll slow it down also so it's important your body is just a ... an amazing amazing mechanism but unfortunately here and there will see\nA few issues come up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going\nThe wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then conversely speaking you get it moving the right way which is the body heal so great on its own though once you get a deal in the right way or you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to help them stay on the road health so\nReally easy one eighty five
