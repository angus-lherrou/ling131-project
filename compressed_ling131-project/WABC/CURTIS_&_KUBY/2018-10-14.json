New York city is a little bit different than some small town in let's say a North Carolina for instance\nOkay so I'm gonna understand this if you have a a portfolio of\nStocks which are very volatile as you saw this week and you want to have a safe part of your portfolio what can be more simple than making alone to high quality as the tuition where you get interest every six months and then when the bond comes do right you get your money back on the wall street managed to screw this up\n[laughter] will also face of all she was very good screwing a lotta things up let's be fair they didn't screw it up but we're really wouldn't be Wall Street but no the ...\nThe dreaded investments and we call bond funds is that for the investors benefit or is it for Wall Street to line their pockets once again\nI Know it's shocking Bob but it's typically for Wall Street's benefit and and that's the problem is and you might have noticed this this last week interest rates went up significantly last week\nAnd when interest rates go up bond prices go down and the problem is if you're in a bond fund you might be in a bond fund right now because you're trying to add some safety in your portfolio is bond funds don't come do right we sort of bonded alone\nAnd the idea of alone is you have a payment of your loan down the line you don't have that luxury with a bond fund and you know what happens Bob is you end up seeing the prices go down and you don't necessarily have a day that says I have price protection on the portfolio and that's a real problem\nOf cracks me up they call it fixed income right nothing sticks the coupon interest that you get is not sick maturity dates not fixed and and then just to make more fees for themselves they go out and they sell these leverage the investments we had a doctor come in with his pension fund a couple of weeks ago thank goodness\nI just looked at some of the closed and funds that we liquidated and they're down Fifteen Percent year to date right Fifteen Percent and ...\nRight yeah that's all you're owning bonds for safety so presumably that can go down Fifteen Percent in value because that's like a stock market investments so you're telling me Bob I could own a bond fund and I could see the same volatility of stocks but I'm not going to get the same great returns of stocks have over time that's a bad deal\nSo I call my head you lose tells you lose investments right you get all the downside risk of the stock market without the inflation hedge and the ability to increase your income over time because in stocks you know didn't go up over time\nYou have an investment where you're taking all the risk of the equity market without an opportunity or a chance\nYou know to get the superior returns that the stock market's given over time so you know what rights so many different things right it's not just the the bond fund structure a lot of times they're in they're buying these Puerto Rico bonds that were riskier they're buying land city bond that have been downgraded\nThere by junk bonds you know of course they don't call them junk do they right\nThey called them high yield which sounds like something attractive and sophisticated you shouldn't invest in but when you actually look under the hood it's a lot of junk Bob [laughter] not really a quality Barnes\nHere's my rule of thumb rye if you went to the bank right now and you needed to borrow money to buy a home you wouldn't pay any more than five percent\nSomeone someone comes to you with a bond investment where you're going to get guaranteed supposedly you know somewhere between ten and Fifteen Percent fast herself a question if I can borrow at five and I'm just a small retail investor why does someone have to pay me Thirteen percent to get money\nYeah exactly it's you know the old saying is if it sounds too good to be true\nIt probably is and you might be thinking to yourself right now you know I have a lot of risky bond funds my portfolio look interest rates went up big last week inflation is kicking in which means interest rates will probably continue to go up the economy is doing really really well it's really important to know what your own why you own it\nSo here's your shot to get that second opinion to make sure you don't own bond funds you have the right portfolio in place if you were in the next ten colors and you have over two hundred thousand dollar save for retirement myself and Bob will run for you are total financial master plan\nWill do that with no obligation costs it's a full holistic financial review simply bringing your statements bring him off the printer your statements came in this month put 'em in a folder bring 'em in we're going to go through all of that we're going to build your own personal life financial portal\nSo we can be your whole financial picture at a bird's eye view and you look at all the critical components to your portfolio we're going to look at the is there's a lot of hidden fees and bond funds lots of different investment products skin knew it is mutual farms Bob and are going to show you where the hidden costs are in your portfolio how to reduce them\nWe're going to look at income income is so critical and retirement what is your income gap wouldn't come to you need to replace we're going to say how to optimize or increase the income on your portfolio and we're going to look at diversification\nMarkets were extremely ... this week is your portfolio protected when the market has a correction it goes down what's your downside risk Bob are not going to say how to protect your portfolio there weren't a title together in one total financial master plan\nWe're going to determine that very critical question are you going to outlive your money or more importantly is your money going to outlive you utilizing strategies now we have worked on for over forty years to take your family from point a to point the with the least amount of risk in the highest odds of success\nSo all you have to do is call or text aid for four seven five to six six nine to ... eight four four seven five to six six nine to if you're one of our next caller is you've saved over two hundred thousand for retirement our team will create for you your own personal\nZero point zero percent Bob every correction we've ever seen the stock market markets have always recovered and go higher\nAnd this year is a perfect example we had a ... percent correction at the beginning of the year on the same fear interest rates are rising and then the market went on to new hires so you know your point about these corrections don't last\nThat long so it's like if you will take advantage of it while it's here you're gonna miss the boat\nYeah but every time there's a correction rider thing that comes out immediately is fear and uncertainty and the four most dangerous words in the history of investing if they are different this life why does everybody always feel that it's never going to go back uh\nI mean I think that's because the yourselves Bob and let's that's why we do a soul segment on financial propaganda right fear cells and I mean that's why it's so hard to be a long term investor let's face it I mean the market has done\nPhenomenally well over our lifetime or parents lifetime their parents lifetime you just had to be in but it's because we have this volatility along the way and we're only makes it worse is the financial media\nOnly make you second guess yourself and only creates the kind of fear\nWhen ironically that's when you should be buying when all the fear is is being talked about in and emotions are running high\nWhile it just blows my mind I mean I have financial news on all day long because you're on all the time so I Want to see you on national television but\nYou know they have all these analysts they come on they're telling you about what to buy now except for when the market a better price they're saying oh you can't catch a falling knife or be careful and maybe you should take some profits you're a gym Kramer was telling people that maybe it's still a profit don't be afraid to take some\n... everything's about not investing\nSo lively market corrections you know it's so easy for us to say you know do become fearful you know stay the course it's the right thing to do you know it's really hard when you feel the markets are so volatile but you know here's my advice rye slow and steady wins the race that's all the winter's\nYeah no chores misspoken Bob ... coach on that later that was so good\nBut I also think you know the other thing this is a good reminder that your asset allocation may be too aggressive right now if you saw the market go back this week and you saw your portfolio with outsized volatility it might be a sign that you're probably not position properly and we've seen this a lot\nYou know people that come into our office where\nYou might be getting close to retirement or you're in retirement now and if your portfolio has like eighty percent in equities this is why it's not a good idea to have that much money in the market when you're getting close to retirement and in retirement because\nNo one would have predicted this week the market was going to sell off the way it did let's face it all the news has been very positive Bob so something like this really came out of left field and that's why you can't predict the stuff ahead of time and you already have to have a portfolio that set up are geared towards retirement\nAs the same message we send out every week where I you can't predict\nYou have to be prepared and a short large company grow dominated by technology it's been a big winner over the last ten years but if you have too much of a good thing as you found out this week it turns into a bad thing it's always good to be proactive in rebalancing your portfolio making sure that you don't over concentrate at any one area\nThat we talked about intel back in two thousand and you know the month before a top was a twenty percent\nBut a month later they had you know low negative outlook on on their business and the value of the company dropped in half yeah last four hundred billion dollars in one day\nWe'll that reminds me of Bob because that was the second largest stock in the u._s. stock market bedtime Amazon today is the second largest stock in the u._s. stock market today in the same thing it had a huge valuation it was a very expensive stock\nJust like intel wise and let's face it I mean as I keep going up here it's come down a bit in the last week there's no reason why that stuck couldn't go down by half\nAnd still be overvalued versus the market it's very conceivable and you have to start thinking about those things\nWhile you have a stock the selling at a hundred and fifty five times earnings which means that the way overvalued has to grow a lot you know become the value that it is today and last I checked doesn't pay dividends that's good stuff out yep well just to\nChange gears there for a second down to press about Amazon [laughter]\nI found an article this week Bob ... you know it's hard to believe but Wells Fargo was in the news again and it's not good news there PR firm should be fired [laughter] like that ... doesn't have bad news they don't have news at all\nAnd recently they were sued by a farm owning family and they were sued for breach of their fiduciary duty at a lawsuit that alleges that a Wells Fargo advisor engaging churning life insurance contracts racking up over five hundred and Ninety seven thousand dollars and commissions\nFor himself and his employer leading to financial harm for this woman who wasn't that financially savvy and I think this is a big deal because I've seen a lot of this lately I've seen a lot of insurance products being sold\nNot bought sold and the broker or the visor gets a big commission and a lot of times these insurance contracts Bob are really not appropriate for your situation\nThat is probably have with with the White House in banking industry they're\nThe people that work there are called producers right I mean it's like it's your big producer and what are they producing commissions they're not produce Sherry's which you have one in registered desperate advisory firms like ours is their sales people and they get their name up on the board if they produce a lot\nSo the culture dictates that you know the person who sells the most gets her name on the board and they get all the recognition and of course their manager or their overseer gets promoted based on the amount of production that comes out of that office so it's really a bad strategy for affirmed to have because it really does promote bad behavior\nYeah I don't think I don't want I don't think so and cut a producer as my ally [laughter] oh it's like it just sounds like they're coming out you with the you know you're in now and they've got a hammer [laughter] it's a it's just you know one one after the other there I mean that's it's just such a bad connotation and\nYou know to your point Bob Look the world is changed a lot in the financial services world has changed dramatically over the last couple of years and you really need to understand the person you were working with\nAre they really are produced Sherry and you need to ask that question point blank is kind of a buzzword in the industry right now but for do share a means by law you have to act\nIn someone's best interest not having opportunity work with someone who's a fiduciary in this day and age ... to say is it's and it's going to be shame on you at some point it it's just the opportunity is so great now to work with somebody who can act and your best interest and you should do that\nAnd if you're thinking yourself I Need a fiduciary I Need someone who can act and my best interests I Need to make sure that I have the right asset allocation in these ... markets to make sure that I'm retirement protected um retirement ready here's your shot to do it if you're one of the next ten callers have over two hundred thousand dollar save for retirement\nMyself from Bob will run

A. Y. N. E. for the record that specific retiree or a couple of had with their retirement planning and you and I actually worked on a case together about a week ago\nSomeone who just gives run down and some of the issues that this certain couple and we we really know what the husband he was having what he was looking for and then how we help them solve its problems\nSure absolutely so like you said we met with this really nice couple the Seventy is wife of sixty nine and some of the the big things that they were focused on we're lowering fees and the overall experience in their portfolio\nThey aren't a lot of income so they were really want to trim down on their their tax burden and really just focus on lowering their taxes lower and their fees and are having some kind of you know tax shelter plan to leave money for their heirs\nYeah which is a very common questions they have and then you know when you went through and you actually ran our portfolio analysis are are when I carport for X ray you know what did you find\nWell looking at just their investments um we did notice they weren't a lot of high cost mutual funds or as well as something to do it is so that was really ramping up you know the the fees and overall expenses on the investment side as far as the fixed income portion of their portfolio they were invested in a couple of Bob's favorite they were in bonds bonds\nWell there's a reason why I'm known as the national financial advisor against bond funds\nAnd had been for Thirty years is because they don't work right they're not fixed\nYou don't have a fixed rate of return you'll have sick maturity date and for a financial advisor financial planner like you it's almost impossible to make well projections 'cause there's no way to know our estimate what the returns going to be when you don't have a fixed rate of return on your fixed income portfolio can be a problem\nThat's exactly right Bob and that was another focus you know as far as lowering their tax burden in such a high tax bracket\nOwning municipal bond portfolio outright is a great way to help with the tax burden at like you said really accurately run wild productions and do some real planning for them in terms of their overall risk where they take more risk than necessary or not enough\nYou know I Would I Would say that they\nWere taking more risk than necessary and their investments and really you know a good portion that we would focus on putting in fixed income investments was really just in and money market accounts and an end cash you know what your mind my can be more risky over the long run because you're really not hedging yes inflation\nAnd that was crazy part he had forty two percent which is very common by the way sitting in cash right now\nEarning virtually no return I remember and it was just like hey you know you need this money to grow over inflation and right now he had almost half his net worth just sitting there and I think part of the problem was he just didn't know which way to go because he thought like hey\nMy advisers charge me too much money I think I don't quite know I mean it was really just kind of perplexed about where the money should go right exactly and the other thing too is which I thought it was interesting you made a good point and is\nThere was a lot around just getting some real financial planning done a big thing for him wise is a way to save money in taxes which we all want to do I mean we talked about some creative strategies especially because he has those big irate distributions\nYeah I'm into your point you know he's already agreed income yes these big IRA distributions that you know quite frankly he doesn't need and doesn't want but it turns out talking to him you know he's very generous guy loves donating to charity but it's kind of a no brainer he can max out his distributions per year at a hundred thousand dollars out of the IRA\nAnd he can donate all that money to name charities and have no tax liability whatsoever\nWhich he was very impressed with that strategy because I thought that was it was just great planning on your part and then I think that's the big thing it's like okay you have an advisor ... lots of hidden fees but where's the financial advice\nThat was ...\nThrough your analysis I see that rebel to substantially reduce the overall management the by eliminating some of these hidden cost and then by taking a catching getting invested in a high quality municipal bond portfolio increase the income by over thirty thousand dollars a year that's a substantial increase\nYeah Bob it's really incredible what the percentage that we can we can increase the income I mean if you take that money compound it over the next Twenty years you're talking about almost a million dollars\nWow [laughter] yeah and none of us are taking more risk taking less risk and having you know more consistent income so it's not a matter of if that portfolio will grow just a better when\nA great job in

look at you know visceral fat rating body fat body water uh the body water so important the body what it's supposed to be around sixty percent people don't realize that sixty percent of your body should be water people are coming in with forty percent thirty five percent forty five percent\nAre particularly it affects really are obese people but it's certainly ... women obese women in general or if you're if you're a body of water is law when you're walking around with a bunch of water and you're walking around with a book with drinking water all the time and meanwhile your water's low uh you're gonna that's gonna affect how your body metabolism is going to work\nIt's going to affect a your muscle is uh like the engine of your metabolism\nAnd so if that's not happening uh because your body isn't absorbing water properly maybe one of the reasons you can't lose any weight so we put you on that machine will be able to see if that's the situation there so\nI just said Andrew dice dot com it's only twenty seven dollars and you could schedule appointment come in\nAnd we'll get you go in on the road to health and on the road to possibly shopping different ...\nSo I got you beat on that one what what what was your number your number one what phase\nAnd Bruce was sixty days fifty six pounds in six\nTo ... I got you beat on that one I got I'm yeah I'm a I'm ashamed to say well I'm not ashamed to say I don't really know his first name because he's in the Brooklyn office it meant and and so and I I Believe that his pictures has the foreign actors actually on our website already a sixty four pounds and sixty days\nOh yeah I Know you're talking about\nYeah sixty four pounds in sixty days yeah and and he took a great profile picture of himself the temperament is wearing a white shirt and tie and so the profound victories fantastic says you guys get a chance definitely go to an J died dot com and take a look at that profile picture sixty four pounds of sixty days is very impressive man and woman it doesn't matter how old you are I mean it really is\nThat um [noise] it's an ...\nAn astronomical number in my opinion officers mission I I think something to that effect again I don't know the patient personally because I don't go to the Brooklyn office but\nI you know this is just staggering number and really just the health benefits bass officer and he's chasing criminals around it but you can do it much easier sixty four comes down I Would think so I definitely I think that's probably a much better situation for them especially in this heat that we've got going on to them\nSo we improved we've we improved the safety of our city to yes that's correct if he can chased on criminal ... yeah ... ... you know when I went wow yeah when when\nOne at a time right so but you know that the pounds of great but I think that um\nA lot of what we see in our office is really a health\nWhat happens and um\n[noise] you know just losing ten twelve or Fifteen pounds can make such a huge difference in how you feel and um what you are a blood tests are way your numbers are so\nWe stand who are just um [noise] was in and he's on day thirty three of the program he went from two Seventy one to two forty four\nOut which is a twenty seven pounds in thirty three days which by the way is not a tremendous number for a man typically you know for a man that\nAnd has a lot of weight to lose you know in thirty three days we'll see anywhere probably anywhere between thirty six to forty pounds however lover pounds however his a health uh\nResults or hit overall uh health um benefits have been ridiculous sell his blood pressure\nIs now one oh four over sixty four\nWhich I Would say probably a lot [laughter] if I write his cholesterol ah when I'm Down to one oh nine\nFrom from two twenty eight wow\nSo his HDL is at forty six and his LDL is at forty two down from Ninety seven\nHis triglycerides are now a hundred and seven\nDown from two fifty eight\nIs his day thirty three of the ...\nWell I mean I I I Would think well that's basically what his doctor actually said too because I guess he had um a doctor's appointment like\nThirty three day and to the program which we usually tell people you know wait until you're done with the program and then go to your primary care physician and kind of do a blood work and all that other stuff that his appointment was already scheduled so he figured he'd go why not\nWrite so his primary care I fell off the chair absolutely at just blown away he asked him what he was doing he was like I don't understand he's like you were here a couple of months ago\nYou know your numbers were a disaster basically you know and these guys I can understand I have so much energy I'm doing this and saying that it feels so good\nAt you know but that that's really what's cool I think right thirty three days and and\nLiterally and he's basically almost off all of his medications trauma it's tremendous tremendous um\n[noise] so I think that those are the coolest results right and we talk about that in the office yeah fine\nTo the health part of it is the best part land and we're able to do that because of the personalization of the of the of the system and\nPeople come in with his hair and saliva or we use blood work analysis we use DNA Analysis as well and from saliva and ah we were able to look at you know blood work in a functional level and and and uh\nSee what supplements what's support people need and and it's so everybody gains weight and different areas for a reason\nThe body is generally trying to protect those areas because of heirs hormone\nA disruption and so you've got the different body types who got the name of the floppy overhanging belly fat where it could be a journalist shoe protruding hard belly fat deliver 'em the day that that ... issue with the apple shape apple shaped generally thyroid ... imbalances\nOr the pear shape reproductive imbalances doesn't really matter\nOr it could be in any number of things are and so we're able to use the buyer energetic scans that we use from ... to use blood work assessment tool or to see when a functional level to keep to keep a ... to get the body functioning better not so much diagnosing disease\nAnd so then personalize the system personalize the supplements for each individual to help get that one person or into fat burning and unable to\nAh basically get people into the cell you let's say to fat burning and then the body starts bouncing self out body starts detoxify ing itself\nThe hype is ... which is the uh the main hormone controller and the main thermostat of their body starts resetting itself so when people are done they're not going to put the weight back on because the thermostat is basically re set at a new number just like a house thermostat punching somebody to say that somebody too\nSo that's what we were able to do to the problem is that the reason a lot of times people can't lose any weight is their thermostats set or two fifty and no matter what they do they're going to stay to fifty so then we get them their bodies bouncing get him down to let's say two ten and reset the thermostat a two time you're going to stay to tax\nAnd then we give everybody tools going forward as well so if you're going to you know if you if you will give you ten different ways to eat if your weight even pops up by two or three pounds will tell you how to what to eat that day drops the weight back down so you should never really be above two or three pounds over your you know day forty or or day sixty earned a program where\nSo ah you know to the system it's personally from the beginning of the first place at the end at the end we also use DNA\nTools or we do a DNA test\nAnd so the DNA shows a different eating uh types of exercise for each individual uh essential the need for central vitamins and minerals\nOr ... different or metabolic factors are assessed so we're looking at over forty different genetic factors to help people not only help keep lose the weight but also how to keep it off going forward so\nIt's basically all encompassing from beginning to end this personalized to each individual because everybody's going to be a little different it can't be one\nOr can't be a one or what one thing that fits everybody so it's got to be a little bit different not one size fits all Israel to switch these things up and get the people get people work and get their bodies work in the right way and then when you lose the weight and bodies bouncing than health problems start to go away as well so\nIt's really uh it's all it's all about getting that weight off it's all about getting healthier\nAnd so the number to call for that is one eight five five\nFive and jade diet twenty five five five six five\nThirty four thirty eight and that's the schedule of free go over the system in one of our local five locations in the New York tri state area\nOr the best way to do it I think is to go on line and you go to and jade diet dot com and that's normally Ninety nine dollars for only for only twenty seven dollars right now you can come in will do a ... an appointment with us of body composition and now since we're going to look at not just wait\nAre we going to look at body fat percentage were going to look at body water percentage were going to look at your ... your your metabolic ... so you're going to look at your basic metabolic rate and how much your and your daily caloric intake so those two numbers need to be close to each other for you to be able to lose weight we've got people routinely coming in\nOr and they're burning off let's say two thousand calories a day but their bodies function which are taken in three thousand calories a day and they're only eating Fifteen hundred calories a day and they can't figure out why they can't lose any weight because at the end of the day you still ... calories\nSo once we get the body work in the right way to get your metabolism reset a little bit then you're actually going to be burning off what your uh\nYou know plus reading on the programs are losing one pound who's one pounds thirty five hundred dollars we routinely see people losing a pound a day plus or eat it\nSo we're talking about the body burning anywhere from four thousand around four thousand calories a day minimally uh to to to lose the weight uh so you're not you we re route where your body basically be using for fuel your body's just using your own toxic fat for fuel so to\nTo get that done it's eight five five five and Jay diet one eighty five five five six five\nThirty four thirty eight or that give to schedule an appointment or for free go over one of our officers now when you're calling\nAnd you're talking to the folks at the at the call center there they're just an appointment they're set appointments right so they don't have all the answers to your questions I can guarantee you that uh that's why we were moving all the ... and just come in and get a check up get a get a check up and all that\nUh and so just don't get mad at those people were people yelling at them all the time all the time uh and so just come in and and and uh [noise] and see us are there and but you can also go on line A N J died dot com and that's for only twenty seven dollars normally signing nine dollars only twenty seven dollars\nOr you can um come into the office\nWill do an appointment with one of a with one of us\nAre you also will do a body composition analysis will take a look at your weight will take a look your body fat percentage your body water percentage of visceral fat rating your metabolic cage basic metabolic rate daily caloric intake we're looking at a bunch of different things or body water so important that should be closer to sixty percent\nOr if you're in the forties you can't lose weight and you're wondering why and you're walking around with a bottle of water all the time and drink and a hundred ounces of water and you still can't lose weight\nI guarantee your body isn't absorbing it the right way you have a mineral or electric light imbalance we see these imbalances with things like yo yo dieting you'll see it with digestive issues or you'll see it with certain medications like directs that are used to control blood pressure\nOr because you're overweight or you'll see it with a with a an acid medications a lot of times you'll see it a lot of times with antidepressant medications it's one of the reasons they cause weight gain or and so\nYou know that might be one of the reasons you're having a problem so we take a look at that and then we can personalize the program for you and you could still lose that twenty to forty pounds more than likely you are not going to need the blood pressure medications and some of the other medications as well so we see this all the time we've seen people come off of all types of different things so there's no limit\nTo what the body can do when you get it working helpfully your body is a is a wonderful healing organism sometimes it's just had some a lot of barriers that er can't overcome on its own it just needs a little bit of push it needs to a few dominoes to be kind of tilted knocked down and then the body will do everything on its own after that so\nUh starts and end with the customers they send the personalization of the of the program the bio energetic scans\nA parent's live a sample for that or blood work functional ... assessment a DNA testing a that shows us over forty different metabolic factors that we assess or to help you use the tools going like a blueprint going forward on how to not only keep laid off but also had a phase healthy as possible so really\nEasy and J died dot com or when a five five five A N J diet I wanted to tell you about a Sondra\nAre we talking about sleep I guess sleep with some some sort of a lot of people coming in with real sleeping issues and you know wonder why people are walking around with trouble the triple ... lattes well sleep it off he's from God Knows where\nHe just sleep deprivation causes sleep deprivation is having like a to think our stomach you know I Know and it was uncomfortable and one of the most awful things you can have\nYou ever ... so people are coming in I guess they they're sleeping and you know they don't tell them necessarily from sleeping issues it when they come in but uh you know when they come when they're done with the price what's cool about the program like people come in and they're very they're they're very very skeptical but they're even going to lose weight and then they stop focusing on the waiting to start thinking about how their health is improving\nA center came in a thirty nine year old female or she lost ... severe sleeping issues she was she was a\nHaving a lot getting up trouble falling asleep trouble staying asleep waking up early tossing and turning just having a ton of issues sleeping\nA and a lot of times it's a neutrino adrenal issue with cortisol levels and and things like that and you know the quarter solo so important uh they're supposed to you know they're supposed to cortisol as grades it's a it's produced by the adrenal glands and and so\nIt's supposed to during the day help you burn fat and the night help you sleep and if you're you have a dream exhaustion issues a lot of times you'll see the opposite you can't lose you can't burn fat and you can't sleep\nOr and so she came and she lost a twenty four pounds in forty days so you know ... you know great usually see twenty five to thirty five with women so she was just a little bit under that\nBut what's great about it is the chief and then she says that after the first seven to ten days at a program she's basically been sleeping like a rock\nFalling asleep eleven o'clock she goes to bed will arm weights or up at seven she says she doesn't even realize she's asleep anymore she was just kind of goes to bed wakes up boom retroactive started day rested feeling great no crashes in the three o'clock in the in the afternoon\nA much less need for coffee in the afternoon which is great which is going to help her sleep cc when you get this thing going in one direction it's going to stay going in one direction [noise]\nUm so you have twenty four pounds sleep and like a rock she came in we did hair and saliva sample or a ... blood work functional assessment we gave her a hormone support hype a family support we also gave her adrenal support um got they got the body work in the right way and ah now we've got the results that we see\nIt's not surprising either right around that age right around the age of thirty nine forty I hear more and more of that\nAd right between the ages of like thirty nine forty one I'm a lot of things change in the women's um body you know ... and cycle right and so it's really it's interesting that every ten years right right exactly\nSo I think that it's interesting that um you know you brought that up a but speaking of at the health benefits so we had this happen a bunch of times in our office but this just recently happened again\nUh Michelle I'm who am I Believe she's in her I'm mid thirties and she lost eighty pounds she did to round yeah I mean really really a lot of weight eighty pounds eighty pounds well what happened was um she had some trouble getting pregnant with her first child and so did a lot of\nYou know I'm hormone therapy type stuff and ... and ... and\nAt ... and all these other things and all of these drugs are really am known for and they'll put on weight output that dealt with a ton of weight on Yammer and really just create all sorts of floating in the body and um all sorts of very unpleasant things but you know she got a baby out of it which is really a great positive but because of that\nAnd she had gained not only a bunch of weight before she got pregnant but also while she was pregnant and then\nAfterwards really hard hard time taking it off so then she tried to get pregnant again and again more hormones and more and you know of these procedures and unfortunately her second time was not as successful as her first but she was about\nEighty pounds heavier than she had started out before so she came to us\n[noise] she did to a forty day rounds which basically means she went pound for pound and both of them um and that's very um you know it's common because this was not her regular weight right this is wait put on with warm ... right so that's why she went pound for pound because her body really needed it really needed to get rid of all it's gross so Shankar pound for\nPound a pound a day for a man is impressive pound for pound for pound a day for a woman is absolute\n... we've had a number of women without ... district up so anyway so she comes and she comes in 'em and she says um\nShe goes you guys wouldn't believe she came in for ... saliva test I'm just one after the program and she says you wouldn't believe what I have to tell you she says I'm pregnant oh no ... no ...\nNo ... no nothing on she says I guess my body got rid of all the talk of all the extra hormones I dropped all this way\nShe says and now I'm pregnant [laughter] it's a really great story but you know we've had this happen at you know how many times I Would say yeah half a dozen two dozen times where um you know but she by the way completely didn't expect that I mean her her her and her husband\nFully like just you know where settled with one child and happy and the the baby's healthy and so now she's\nAbout to have a second one and she said I Can't believe I'm gonna have to lose weight again but you know what I think it's gonna happen to be honest with you is ... now they're not added regulator bodies more regularly our probably gain she'll probably Jay has not\nGained a ton of later already and she even said that with that with the first baby she had gained so much during the first couple of weeks and kept gaining and she said with this one she feels completely different\nShe feels so much healthier and really feels ... not as much knowledge I during the ... really she says it's just a whole different experience for her\nShe feels like crushed south and it's really great and congratulations to her and I you know looking forward to meeting that healthy baby\nYeah that's that's awesome we had a gel also I had a somebody came in was telling me the same thing\nA joke came in and she's thirty two years old she hasn't had a a regular cycle in years she says she would come and go heavy bleeding for days on end and it wouldn't then uh it would go for weeks than it would stop for months and completely inconsistent\nNo really don't know you know you could be best friends with someone else who provide positive things for you ... you know that's true\nI'm Shauna came in and she was down to ... to to the program she kind of did it in a weird way she looked at it for thirty days than she had a two week vacation\nSo she did the program for thirty days stop the program two weeks short for a vacation to get her little ... to get to reset couple of days and then she came back in and she did another twenty days of the program she was just a total of fifty days\nAre and what should the cool thing is she was away so she stopped the programs for thirty days or lost a bunch of weight loss for twenty five or thirty pounds or something like that in ... in the thirty days went away on a vacation for for ten to fourteen days\nAnd didn't put any of the weight back on all while on vacation which is awesome and then she came back and did another Twenty one days of the program so basically should fifty days of the program\nAnd lost so fifty six pounds total in the fifty days\nThat are pretty impressed yeah that's great vacation and with the occasion in the middle of say you must you must have customize that one for her well yeah we have to add a\nLittle bit of ... so she had a she says you know she had a vacation plans should have been away and look I'm not gonna tell somebody about to go on vacation so we just customized before we played with it a little bit did it the right way um and ... which grade is\nShe no more thyroid meds\nAre no more no more sugar medications a siren levels are normal so she doesn't need that ... to ... medications anymore or and vote when she came in we we were able to do we did the herring saliva\nBy energetic scans gave her a hormone support their thyroid support she needed bankers support also\nAnd she lost she lost that way or the DNA we're going to do the DNA is going to be used also to help her keep the weight off to keep her ... to keep her as as healthy as possible uh and you know when your thyroid you know is really important when you're talking about people that are\nComing in a lot of times with mineral imbalances in and things like that\nUh that affects the thyroid a lot the thyroid really that I dont gotta get bind with sodium to get into the cells of the thyroid or to free to even work so that's why you know people have a sluggish thyroid a lotta times you'll see weight gain and the problem might not even be with the thyroid problem might be but the fact that your body's not is has a mineral imbalance in the\nAnd the uh the the the iodine may not be with you get into the cello the thyroid gland so\nYou know that conversion the tea forty three is really get that for that sort of the the gas pedal to the metabolism so to speak and if that's what happened in the right way so if you're if you're having a hard time losing weight you have a mineral imbalance and ... and balance\nA meeting your body is absorbing water properly before because of that you'll be affected on the weight loss ... end of it and now if you're if let's say the thyroid if you ... issues and just not be able to lose way a lot of times we'll see the thyroid\nNot being able to get to even the chemicals the minerals into the thyroid to get to the whole process going so that'll slow it down also so it's so important your body is just a ... an amazing amazing mechanism\nBut unfortunately here and there will see\nA few issues come up a few imbalances come up and that's all it takes really is a few imbalances in getting it going\nThe wrong way and you're going to stay going the right or wrong way and then conversely speaking you got to move in the right way it's just the body heal so great on its own then once you get a deal in the right way you're going to be able to keep it going that way and and and get on the road to help them stay on the road health so\nReally easy one in five five five and Jay diet a one eight five
