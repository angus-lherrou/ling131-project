[noise]\nIn Manhattan\nFor a while you ABC [laughter]\nThe\nThe tri state area especially when you hear about this latest is so bizarre\nSort of I rare polio like illness that's causing children to have a weakness paralysis and their arms and legs and it's led federal officials are now expanding their investigation\nAnd it's basically now three cases that are wrapped up and about sixty plus cases around the country but three of them in New Jersey\nSo what's going on and why is it sort of so secret kids and what is it about this quote sort of a mystery illness joining us here on ... the is Marc Siegel he is Fox News medical correspondent doctor's ego agreed to talk to you my friend how you doing how you doing everything in a while I\nI miss you I miss you it's great to have you here and and I wish it was on a better occasion but this is\nThis is such a weird thing Dr Segal what what do you think is going on here\nWell first of all fear is going on number one viruses always fear in a situation like this\nFear is not a bad thing it's just that is what happens when young children are suddenly struck down and you don't know what to do about it where it's coming from three hundred and eighty six cases over four years and the big ears were fourteen thousand fourteenth two dozen sixteen thousand Eighteen the even years actually\nUm and it's only a couple of hundred cases each year only unless you happen to be one of the people who are families that have it\nWhen the AIDS virus first came out of about Thirty years ago there was a ran about seven week article about the hell was analogous to win the polio virus came out and everybody was panicking and\nPeople were washing down the streets down in South oyster bay a you know people were taken you know extra cautious you know that that that rising crust and the cheese and practicing better hygiene\nOverall and then they concluded the series with the polio infection rate abated with the for the comic for whether that's basically they say how it ended now regarding\nA and I I find I found that wanting to be honest with you very difficult to believe that all of a sudden the changing of the seasons could deplete polio uh and if this is a new strain of polio may be a strain that is able to supersede the vaccines that all these children get\nAnd that's what it sounds like from you know from what Dr Marc Siegel is saying is that it was so far he\nHe doesn't believe it as polio he ... he believes that polio\nLighting not because they don't have the answers let's go to Johnny in New Jersey Welcome to WABC Johnny\nI get off the noon ladies and gentlemen I'm I just it just listening to you guys and I'm not concerned father of three boys or to a newborn seven months\nAnd they're all ... actually right now last five days we brought to the doctors and they got us on antibiotics for two of the boys I just wanted to question is will that cover that kind of disease a virus\nI'm On my second question is that my my sons are always getting the flu shots always up to the vaccines and are you saying that those vaccines could cause this other virus that happened in their body I wasn't really sure\nAbout no no there is a what they call vaccine induced polio a Dr Segal it sure does this could not have caused this\nType of strain but then again how do we know since the CDC doesn't seem to know the origin of this particular paralyzing the disease that's caused young kids who are playing like within a month to suddenly be in a hospital bed incapable\nOf moving and again he sang still get the vaccine is not

continues to a attempt to engage in personal attacks in the white so he'd better pack a watch\nOh All right it's it's warfare\nEverybody and then he also went low to\nThe death of the nation case was a secondary case to the main case which is the case over the nondisclosure agreement I don't think Donald Trump is smart enough to understand that I actually think that he believes that he won the NBA case which is laughable\nMean this is what happens when you elect a more on to the president a president of the United states\nNow ah it was the president big dog we decided to respond to another small dog again in ... and another small dog in terms of Stormy Daniels\nBut allowed dog he's loud I mean he's like chomping at the\nAt everybody's ankle at it but he called on the odds\nMatter a third rate lawyer\nHe called him a third rate lawyer ... what was his own personal lawyer and a con job who who's his personal lawyer that's now cooperating with the fetch who's now a Democrat by the way who just switched parties to show what Mr Michael Cohen well\nOr he was a top shelf five star loyal weddings and the good gracious to the president now he's a third rate lawyer to show it sort of like the last person I Want reviewing somebody each lawyering abilities is the president of United States\nOn the other hand he does have a right to defend I I think I think the dances ... and I'm I'm curious what our listeners think on this who's winning who's losing its one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two to one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two two because\nCurtis I think I Am of the school of thought that I think the president's tweets sometimes they're very effective\nI think also to go after people especially when you feel you had been falsely accused which is what he's still maintains he feels this was a bogus you know attempt and I think that sketch looked like it could have been anybody in America that schedules so bogus\nAnd crazy when you saw it but I don't like it when he kinda gets into I think it's dangerous territory for president right before the midterm elections because you think the repercussions across Congress to right now with two weeks away from a huge election and he when he goes to the point where he talked about a woman as a horse face or go\nTo the maker Brzezinski I don't like that I'm curious what the gals out there think of this in particular because I think going after when people are are belittling you and falsely accusing you you have to defend yourself and I think there are people who don't want to ever see the president's tweets that's ridiculous he has to defend themselves\nBut I think when he kind of goes into the personal stuff\nI think it's very ... yeah and it's also it's there's a personal area it's like the when he made you know made the comments about the New York times reporter who is disabled it when they hit the very personal sensitive I think you're dangerous territory going after a woman's luck\nMegan Kelly blood I mean we can go on and on and on this guy has a problem with women there's no doubt about it\nBut clearly he he had been flushed with the thrill of victory this federal judge ruled on behalf of the president and the United states and his attorneys and told them and that his client Stormy Daniels would have to pay the president's off the lawyer feet\nRight he won he didn't want to say anything didn't\nNeed to all of a sudden started calling\nHer [laughter] he could have done with the hash tag right decision something by the odd she wouldn't go on that I think\nHe is obsessed with Stormy Daniels as we've seen\nAnd also he feels a few you know and listen he still says hey you know it's false accusation he'd do you feel you're involving accuses now for years and I'm just telling me so let me let\nMe ask you questions so he ended up having sex with a horse's head in his bed\nGoing back to the mob thing and my grandmother had sex with Stormy Daniels will he have time one time only then should he has not said that well yes I Know but Curtis he hasn't said that you have any problem he\nDoes is when he is going after someone and I think it's dangerous territory I'll give you\nThat I think it's dangerous territory going after a woman saying she's a horse face or had a facelift or any of that stuff I don't think that if you ask what I tell you why you say he's they're getting that everybody is fair game and he treats everybody well I'll tell you I'm curious if our listeners think that\nIf they think that it's that if it was the guy is it fair game to call them a horse face if it's a guy\nOh yeah but this resident of calls everybody name she's\nSaying then that's where he's coming by one woman he's anti fall thank you ...\nThe horse analogy\nThe president is upset are obsessed with certain people at times and I but\nWhat do you think we're going to buy a horse table at some point is that where you're going my\nArmy Daniels races horses she's had horse farms\nEver seen yet who has Baton Rouge Louisiana\nAnd she's always been pictured with horses now you know doggone well uh when he's a sort of brewing a late at night is probably looking on the computer looking at these pictures and then she she's just like a horse's head and then he's thinking what did she say about my manhood in her recent\nBook in which he said I had an unusual looking penis\nSmall a huge mushroom ahead like a ... well like mushroom Carolyn ... video game so naturally he gets all upset because it's exactly what happened when Paula Jones described Bill Clinton St Pete shed and said you know\nThe angle to the dangle is different than normal\nWell and let me read what Stormy Daniels tweeted out Curtis because that's why it's gotten under his mushroom right she said here let me read the tweet ladies and gentlemen may I present your president in addition to this um shortcomings he's demonstrated isn't incompetence\nHatred of women and lack of self control on Twitter again and perhaps\nThis is unbelievable a penchant for these geology game on tiny I mean I just think it's getting so I I'll tell you I didn't like I think he had a right to to say game on\n'em and we won I think that you know because if he feels he's falsely accused I think that's fair I don't like the horse and I don't like someone saying you know ... listen to the why can't we exam I don't like it on both sides\nDon't we exempt from the beach the Allegheny any sharks because we do know that he would watch English document\nHow you got to got as the president ... and you're right you're always going to do was shot so he doesn't like loan shark right there is going to reality\nWould never have involved sharks whatsoever and I think\nThere was ... I just think it's getting so low and and I don't like I don't like the ... I don't like the comes to women I think it's dangerous territory and I don't like the disrespect to the other\nHand you're listening to you and you're listening and nobody he'll attack women he'll attack man\nHe was like everybody is equal opportunity bat David Into it I can be fading into it\nAnd no doubt there will be other attempts in his final months or a\nLess than a month before the midterm elections in which individuals will try to paint him into changing the new structure\nThat he or she did say Curtis don't go there is someone needs to say OK I nobody can you want to somebody don't go there nobody can ...\nChief of staff Kelly not anyone in the west wing not his wife not even as his daughter evolved and nobody can tell this president into stop one eight hundred eight for

somebody\nAnd the people at work in a hotel wouldn't let me use it that that's the only hotel and the food I Know that they wouldn't let me\nWait Dave give me a break you're not going to vote for Trump because one of his hotels wouldn't let you use the bathroom\nIt's more than that that's just the tip of the\nApple you brought up what a ridiculous example to hear some of them that\nThat's just the way it is it is he has no clue it only for the people in up to ... percent income bracket right those are the people that will probably vote\nAnd now that day you know there are a lot of hotels in and not owned by Trump or any of his family members where if you try to gain entrance and she'd use of a man or a woman's\nBathroom or a bisexual bathroom whatever they call them a unified saying what

temple and mount Kisco have given him the hush I'm Sheila of approval\nAnd you know it's amazing courage is too I mean we've covered a lot of these cases we talked about a lot of them with all of you\nBut you think about the fact that the synagogue the oldest of the two sons are the number of people sitting on the leaders actually played a role in bringing him across the border again illegally um brought them across the border took him back it didn't work the first time they helped again I'm Talking about extraordinary measures\nWhat you see are you would have had an alternative if he would have gone through a conversion process which is difficult to become a geo Jews don't go out there they're not evangelicals and I try\nI don't think that would help them with ice girls\nNot so much with ice but remember if he had become a Jew had gone through all the lessons he could and moved to Israel you see that would have been the difference instead of having to move back to Mexico\nIt's a

here Nigel\nHey I Do encourage 'em long time listener first time caller great um well my question to to go to Mr all had actually he was hired by the city after Twenty years and how would they paid him he was he the income taxes\nActually that's a great question I don't know but I they seem to love them no problems I I don't think this is what I\nIntended to get rid of the ... is that the president talked about ... what do you think\nOh well I Know\nAnd I think he legally come here which basically broke the immigration law so therefore you know ... whatever the the the ... the circumstances or you know that he should be some of the law should be applied there\nSo to bad basically this guy had no record no problems or the synagogue clearly London they actually go to the effort to bringing them across the border I Do bad Nigel that's what you're saying oh well\nYeah you know he he he willfully came to this country illegally know that he's a he's illegally come to this country and breaking the law so you know what you do\nWell in Rhode Island I happened to feel deep in the marrow of my bones 'cause I Know this individual I hated my low them I despise them but at somebody will be writing to his rescue soon and a review led to all of you momentarily but let's go to and\nFirst in New Jersey Welcome to Kurdish and really Cosby he uh WABC ...\nHigh and high Hawaii you go ahead what do you think\nI think we want to hear why didn't they apply to all that time\nNow that's a great question um and he's gotten a number of deportation orders 'em and the there is there may be something more to the story but if there isn't I mean do you think this is the guy who I should be spending their time and we got gang members\n... well that is a guy that was\nDone working twenty year old ... wasn't any had anything else and so on one\nGoal right but how about this because what we're always concerned about obviously and is that nobody will take responsibility for him and his family how about if the mount Kisco Santa gods said we will sponsor him and his family if they are never employed if they never have their own form of income\nWe will cover their food or the rent the medical care he he and his wife and children will not ever become a burden to the American taxpayers would that help you at all\nAnd now it's still not answering my he's not applying for federal\nYeah their their hand brings up a great point because we don't know why he skirted it and didn't maybe there were hearings but maybe not there may be something else there that's interesting and\nLet's go to Mike is calling from queens welcome to Kurdish and really Cosby he uh WABC mighty\nHeard if they're ready to go Hey Mike right All right well listen I'm going to make an exception in this situation because the Kurdish and Rita\nI'm I support us and what they do support Trump's agenda but man who ... toilets Curtis synagogue I don't know if it I said Curtis he deserves that cater to say in a house when it comes back\nHey Mike wait a minute I knew somebody who has the toilets elsewhere I don't think the toilets and the grocer then I uh I think\nThey're reforms I think they have the title\nI email where is our own but I think I think Mike I give you that because I think anybody who cleans toilets and it's obviously so be loved by these people I think we need to give them a break\nOne eight hundred for a WABC the question is will ... give him a break let's go to John in Dutchess County welcome to WABC Johnny, Johnny\nGuys I don't know I I got a perfect solution I sort of read the courtroom and it'd be older son the job that way to send money back home to support his father and that's it\nSo the sun becomes the soil in ten or ... cleaner maintenance guy\nAddress father came face time the sun you know a sky Tucson to maintain a relationship I see so you're in a very Solomon like way believe it or not John you have a sort of split the ...\nA true capitalist\nAlthough

should keep the illegal here in Iraq the leaders of the synagogue for breaking the er at racial off\nWell you know what's interesting Tim and less than they obviously have a big heart they love this guy I don't blame them but it is interesting that they went to the efforts\nNow wants to them but he's bringing them across the border like were they like jumping over a fence or on Wall or or just you know rolling through I I'm curious I Want to hear more of those details\nYeah actually they bought it like I said the rest of the synagogue later but anybody can do whatever they want\nYeah right or maybe maybe now they're going to become like coyotes Curtis you know how like they'll set up a new business a fundraising we're the we're the ones who bring your across the border\nThat's right ah well look weren't the Jews stuck in the desert for forty years\nLike they know how to get out [laughter] they finally got out eventually\nLet's go to Mike in Hyde Park welcome to Kurdish and ready to Cosby had WABC mighty\nGuys I'm nobody's point in the fact out that he took a job for Twenty years from an American citizen\nWell not a lot of American citizens look forward to a cleaning toilets and doing this kind of stuff that's\nNot an excuse you know there are people that are hard up\nThat need a job that would take any job All right so ...\nWhen you're bringing these illegals and not only those countries knock you only so now they're bringing diseases and but you don't know where they're\nComing from now they're taking jobs I pay my work in the construction industry\nHey Mike and there are a lot by the way in construction as you point out but let me ask you this this guy ... you know sometimes you hear these bogus excuses and believe me I've been on the border Mike I've covered a lot of yeah I I it looked like you know barely any uh observation or better ... better\nYet very little law enforcement on the board I'll tell you I we have a porous border I'm with you on that\nBut

Twenty years he's had Twenty years to do the right thing he's also taking Twenty years and on the wrong thing\nI'm telling you I'm telling you Mike He should've taken out an insurance policy with hush I'm shooting converted to Judaism did his ... study Torah\nStudies calm words or if he got thrown out of America he would be accepted in Israel should you know you don't have to be born is your job to
