that his case so it within the same company I assume that if I ever wanted to I could switch to ... that could lead to switch back ass kicking\nSuspicious assumption was that lady the government wanted to increase the deductible greatly in a church has a show where of that\nOr they want everybody Jay\nI'm kind of like asking the Cadillac plan so why not hold on to\nA ... sort of two questions to two thoughts for me first of all even though the same company offers a cheap plan you shouldn't assume it's going to offer it to you on terms as favorable as those that you had when you first got your F coverage is always telling\nOther callers once you're through you're guaranteed access period for Madagascar\nOr depending on the rules of the state where you live and um I'm not\nSure of the

term\nCost of health expenses for Medicare and so they can't they can't sort of say well it was two hundred dollars last year we're going to make it a thousand they can't do that\nUm Congress [laughter] again I say in his wisdom or lack there of Congress can change the rules if they want 'em there's no question that over a long period of time there's a lot of pressure on these programs because they're expensive and there's more older people\nUsing them and um it's gonna be hard for the government to continue to afford the degree of support of Medicare that it's already providing so I Can't really predict 'em exactly what's going to happen to those programs down the road so the insurance\nCompanies are doing this because of the government not because of their own traffic to this is a government knows that I thought it was their motives so I was meeting and they know the government changed\nThe rules and the government decided to ah eliminate these letter C asked and high

mean you know I sat down before today show and made a list of things that I'm uncertain about and I'm up to fifty and I'm sure I'll get to a hundred and five at the time we're finished there's never any certainty here's what certain time passes and markets operate and you can't control either of those facts\nSo you have to have a plan you have to have a strategy to deal with in her and volatility of life\nYeah and I think that's where we talk a lot about having an all whether portfolio meaning that you just want to have a ... prepared for what ever could happen you know I think there's a lot of emphasis on\nWell we think that interest rates are going to go up for the U.S is going to be the best place to be it's a fool's strategy because you don't really know if that's the case and it may not play out that way and it usually doesn't play out the way you think is\nSo yeah I think you have to have a strategy Bob it's almost like the just in case right just in case the U.S doesn't do as well just in case\nThe markets an all time high and then all of a sudden it does swoon in October [noise] are you protected are you prepared for that\nYeah it's not about being right or wrong writes about being invested for total return strategy so you know it's just a diversification is a key that's where you have some certainty and you want to have a strategy that time tested you just don't want to take more risk than necessary\nAnd most people do but if you're feeling it in your portfolio today then that means you probably are\nYeah and it also reminds me of another metaphor Bob ... a a bad apple spoils the whole barrel\nAnd I think that has a lot to do with how are you allocate it right now and I think what are the big problem is is if you're getting close to retirement and you're relying on your portfolio going up with the stock market every year that's a really bad strategy as again you can see what the market goes down that can have a detrimental effect on your entire financial life\nJust having a portfolio strategy that's solely dependent on appreciation of the markets\nYeah I call those one trick pony sir I've seen it over the years one of the advantages that we have\nIs dealing with thousands of people and and meeting with people every week as we see you know where people are putting too much risk right there's you know it's been in the ... trade\nRight before it was was energy stocks nobody calls the about a little stocks and they were ... were a big hot area years ago but you've been warning everyone for months about the fact that there's too much large company grow through too much technology\nIn their portfolio and now it's coming home to roost\nYeah exactly you're probably feeling the pain no pun intended being her last name\nYou're probably feeling amplified right now if you've owned the hottest stocks in the market because the laws of the market are whatever goes up the most eventually comes down to most so it just one of those reasons reminder of\nOkay maybe you're getting close to retirement or you're in retirement right now and do you really want a portfolio that that the whims of the market and the ... of the market can be extremely violent tile or you've got to build a portfolio so thinking about do I want a port boy that's consistent and reliable and it's not just dependent on one or two variables\nIf you're thinking yourself or not I need a real plan that's tied to my goals that's not dependent on big market fluctuations here's your shot to do it if you were in the next ten calls you have over two hundred thousand dollars safe retirement myself from Bob will run for you\nAre total financial master plan will do that with no obligation costs it's a full holistic real financial review where we look at

investment portfolios and now it's hard to believe\nWe're going to say we're all the hidden costs are are going to say how to reduce costs on your portfolio and we're going to look at income having a reliable stream of income in retirement is critical is your portfolio optimized for retirement queen film that income gap we're going to show you how to optimize or increase the income on your

no cost but of course there's NO PLAN unless you call or text hate for four seven five to\nSix six nine to that date for four seven five to six six nine to this is a pain I'm with my son right and we are the pain of no pain no gain financial radio\n[noise] it's done it with a weekly no pain no gain market up day with a team that pain Capital Management here in New York City\nMorning this is Bob paying chief investment strategist you're paying Capital Management only which everybody a happy Halloween trick or treat well certainly wasn't a treat to be invested in the financial markets has stocks globally decline across the board this week on Wall street the best performing stocks leading a bull market\nAre commonly referred to as a general and just like an army\nVolatility well it is and I think unfortunately we are all scarred\nBy the two major bear markets that we had in two thousand and eight and two thousand you know seven years apart everybody thinks that she's normal where in the fact of the matter is those types of declines are very abnormal the very infrequent and\nNo one can time these things but\nThe only thing I Want you to think about right now and I think everybody should be thinking about right now right is that when the market bottom in March of two thousand and nine it rose twenty six percent three months it rose forty six percent in seven months almost sixty six percent in one year so as fast as it goes down it comes back really quickly\nAnd it's hard to see right when you're in the middle of the of the sell off and all the pundits are saying you know this is the end of the world in fact you know what I'm thinking about though\nIsn't this the greatest industry in the world because it has the short term memory you can come out and say the market's going to sell off every year we did wrong then you get a year right once and no one mentions that you were wrong for like you know can be ten times in a row it's like that's completely forgotten\nAnd I think that's just a wonderful thing about our industry it's ah\nYou can you can reinvent yourself over and over again with the same wrong message that's\nWhy we run the segment every week on financial propaganda to warn you again Charlotte's ends like perma bears on there all the time and and the article that I read they actually lied to you about the perma bears record oh well you know he predicted the crashing into eight and get everybody back in and then get everybody back out again last month\nAnd he acts of the matter is they never get in they never invest their not investors\nTheir newsletter writers they're either sell you a book or a newsletter\nMy messages avoid them at all costs\nYeah I mean there's this funny I was I was going in my apartment the other day and in one of the the ... she was in the building and we'd like to talk about the markets and we're talking about the market volatility and she says to me well you know there's a lot of traders make a lot of money in this volatility\nAnd that's BS [laughter] you know there's this there's this fallacy that there's these these market you know God's these traders that are there out there making big bucks it's not true you know there's the it doesn't really work and in you know you always say at Best Buy the fees traders are so smart why don't they as wealthy as Warren Buffett\nAnd as we know Warren Buffett is a long term investor he's a buy a whole you know he buys things in ... and for a long time throughout\nThis market volatility so it's just it's just a complete mess that there's these you know these market trading God's that are figuring out when they get in when they get out it's just not true\nWell you know the market is representative of just all the companies in the world combined\nYou know that are growing their reason should never panic out of the marketplace would be like selling your company right now the only company you're selling it right now because simply because the prices down where if you worked for a big company or your advisory management you should sell the company now because the prices low\nYeah doesn't make any sense at All right in companies have intrinsic value but you know the market pricing is like having a crazy uncle who determine you know each day what it's like you're the price of your company should be one day it's worth a lot\nNext two weeks or not so much\nYeah I Love that analogy it's a crazy uncle or another another do some a lot of the propaganda that's out there right now I I caught an article in there's a lot of articles like this mid term elections loom over the stock market\nLike this is going to be some big events and this goes back to what you're talking about earlier in the Shabaab\nThat when you're in a bull market all the good news gets ignored and the bad news gets focused in on which sounds ironic and I think this is a perfect example of that there's a lot of noise about the mid term elections right now and how that's going to negatively potentially affect\nThe markets yeah well that's just another list that sits on my list of fifty uncertainties that I made this morning right mid term elections I been getting that question you know quite frequently you know from our clients and you know it's a great question because it's you know it's on the news every night but when it turns out\nIs that over time the markets do well regardless of who's in power and typically it's a divided government so you know what the market really loves his gridlock so whether you're leaning left or right you know when it comes to investing you want to keep your political feelings away from your investment strategy\nWell I'll tell you crazy statistic here Bob the S P five hundred hasn't declined in the year after mid term elections since Nineteen forty six and ... on average his clients Fifteen Percent\nSo not only should we be worried about it we should actually be bullish because odds are after a midterm election and the thinking there is that you know whoever happens to be in power at that time is going to really try to goose things up and make the economy look as good as possible you know because they're trying to obviously get reelected some points so\nIt actually is is a great sign wherever the mid term used to be excited that's a very ... based on history\nWell it's almost as if the market shakes out of the market so you don't make any money when all these good things happen you know it's like it's dark is before the storm I guess is what they say right\nWell put by like that and you're in the markets are crazy uncle who got some good good Bob isn't just running around in yourself\nI Need to ignore this noise get rid of the financial propaganda and get a real financial plan here's your shot to do it we have a ten slots for the call right now\nI have over two hundred thousand dollar saved for retirement Bob and I will put together for you are famous total

I I Will like until it doesn't [laughter] so he said that you know Ratatouille\nExactly he had chosen it you know seven or eight years ago and it has done really well which is true but you know these things I mean within that Ninety percent he was Seventy percent just allocated and us large and small kept stocks\nWhich have done really well but we don't know what that is going to look like for the next you know ten years so\nYou're not allowed to emily's is great example of\nYou know the markets ten years older than it was ten years ago but so far away and you know just just like Bill I was you know I was fifty five you know ten years ago [laughter] um\nSo it's a you know we're different than it and your target has to be different your strategy has to be different than raw you talked about this earlier on the show you know you have to have someone constantly reviewing these retirement plans make sure that your rebalance based on the you know the inherent risks that we face in the markets on a daily basis\nYeah and I think there was the most surprises there too besides like I mean the risk is crazy right you're Ninety percent stocks and not only nine percent stocks it's all concentrated in the same place which is just long term a recipe for disaster but also am you'd said that he didn't really know what kind of easy was paying because all the fees were hidden in the plant\nYeah exactly so I mean you know like I said he has and looked at this than seven or eight years and he doesn't have\nYou know with his accounts here he has me calling him you know at least quarterly to say hey we have evidence any count her\nThis is what the market's doing but he had just left that they're so you know in this case he was actually pretty lucky that those things have done really well but nobody was looking at it he was paying somebody but he was hanging on these internal cause to really not even know what the account was doing\nYeah it's like you're paying all these cost this mutual fund company rivers running most of the funds here and no one's even giving advice so it's kind of like you're you're getting no service and paying a real heavy fee for it and the four one K. that's I call that a bad deal Bob\nCall that a horrible horrible\nAnd the strategy you can follow strategy is I'm going to stay with us until it doesn't work that's not a good strategy you have to understand that\nThat the risk is there there's a risk of all till the end that over the last fifty years or less forty three years that I've been advising people and how to do this you really don't give up a lot and a balanced portfolio rather than you get to sleep really well at night and it gets to achieve your goals with a high degree of certainty I think that's really what you want to look for\nYeah I agree so he was extremely overweight at you know and these equities and you know like I mentioned he wasn't even diversified with in the equities he was really just concentrate I had it was you know Seventy percent and that us large and small cap and then\nLike a little less than twenty percent of it was just an in an international funds you know so he needed somebody to be constantly looking at that and he didn't so\nRight off the bat he decided okay I understand to ask you know I asked him in the next ten years do you want to have to go back to work [laughter]\nFor his answer was [laughter] yeah he was like oh\nThat's a situation and I was like yeah I mean if we don't make a change to this and something really does happen you're going to have to have probably you know go back to work part time so he very quickly [laughter] designer that he was going to follow my advice [laughter]\nAnd scale back a lot more and you know one of the other things too that he had and there was the fact that he actually wasn't going to be able to generate any income\nSo I ran the numbers for him and I showed him you know this is what you're making and in his household his wife still works but he is the breadwinner and she's only going to be working for another maybe three or four years\nAnd they're going to be missing out on this it wasn't a huge chunk but there's a chunk that he's going to have to start pulling from the portfolio if he doesn't make up for somehow so you know just an income alone\nBy you know changing it and and getting into a strategy that's much more you know tolerated for him and his situation I mean we were making almost about twelve thousand dollars for him just an income every single year that he's going to be able to use yeah put that in context\nI mean you doubled you you said okay let's stop being so reliant on the market going up every year and I'm going to do all the income to port Floyd generates that you can live on I mean there are the kind of common sense steps you need to take I Would say to get your portfolio retirement ready this great job in this case by the way I mean this isn't really\nGetting just jumping out of harm's way because I mean the risky has in his portfolio\nTo your point I mean the chances of the market going down at some point in him having to go back to work at such a real thing so by getting him agree\nRight I think this is a another total pain Capital Management financial masterpiece\nWow ... ... dollars [laughter] you know if you're sitting there thinking to yourself\nI Need a plan like

office which is really weird I Know it sounds weird but it kind of makes sense now that I Know more information about it so\nThis week we had just one of your off the cuff so now it's ... yeah I Do a lot of the ... well you know you don't remember I set up front right I\nI'm generally at our reception desk all day long so I hear and see so many different things and I really try to tune in and listen to what a lot of our patients are saying when they think nobody actually listening to them right and so this week we had\nUm a number of commercial driver's an hour and you know\nFront desk waiting area and so some of\nThem were current patients some of them were new patients that were just about to get started some of them were just new patients that had just hard to go over we're about to get into a consultation and and what was interesting was that I didn't realize that commercial drivers have a whole set of rules about you know that the health that they have to actually be in for a cheap\nShot with our job driving a big old month strong right if I if you you know you would think were not an either or police man I I don't know like I I\nDoctor should have certain standards that they're you know\nThe guys are driving a giant truck craze sending out there for hours and hours on end and it takes a ton of a ...\nBut you usually don't think of that right so what was interesting is that one of our patients who I was saying these checkups right so one of the patients that was sitting in our waiting room and struck up\nA conversation with somebody who had just been in the consultation is actually signing up and and the gentleman said to him you know does this program working on the other gentleman said you know yes actually it does and and you know the new patient started asking him some questions and and\nExisting patients sad um you know the reason I came here is because I had this I check out that my job prescribed and I was basically told that if I didn't lose the weight because I was borderline diabetic borderline you know very high blood pressure\nCholesterol issues I if I didn't lose the weight and if my health and improve I was basically out of a job that took and no it's not and so what I found to be amazing is that the potential patient turn to him and said oh my God he said that's what I Do for a living as well and he says to Haitians looked at him and he said\nAnd you haven't had that check up yet and the guy said no I haven't and I'm sure glad I'm Talking to you about it [laughter] so yeah so I\nDidn't realize it but you know lo and behold um our existing patient his name is Paul he said I don't recall the new patients name So Paul said to him you know the side does work and it really is amazing it's really easy to follow 'em\nAnd it's really easy to follow the blow while I'm On the road when she never thought that he'd be able to actually do a diet because of that\nBecause you know these guys are always on the road down the road for hours and hours there's not a lot of stops of places to eat it and if there are they usually extremely unhealthy so he says that he's actually been able to find really healthy options and all of these places that he used to stop and now he's eating according to the islands of the program he's almost done with the program by the way I think he's down close to like\nThirty seven pounds of forty days we that's all he really had to lose\n'em an endless amount of tremendous amount taller guy so he carries it well but clearly the health issues where the more concerning novice and and you know just going back to my original point of the beginning of the show is that really what we're doing is we're changing people's lives in terms of\nHealth and that's kind of the most important thing here I'm right because with all that fat last come so many different benefits as far as\nGetting you better feeling better so\n[noise] talking about the commercial driver's ah Jake uh who you actually saw um this week is done with his two six today rounds and he is down a hundred and twenty pounds I'm also commercial driver on\nAnd he says that you know he he always meet up with some of his friends along the way along his route that he does and he says people don't recognize them anymore and\nI was like well listen a hundred and twenty pounds is you know what I'm saying it\nIngests them around sixty around that or to to their to sixty day around the programs I Would have to be the he would be the bigger no he wouldn't end up now for the for the guy who was fifty four yeah already beat him so we had somebody who lost sixty nine and six they often do I know that but I'm saying for the week yeah no not at All right he's\nPretty high up there for a hundred and twenty you know basically a hundred and twenty pounds in a hundred and twenty a day or that what it is right it is up in the middle east opt in the middle reset\nAnd he got caught up what's really cool about his story is you know the great science and between\nThe grounds you didn't put anything on because now you know give them the tools states you're white goes up by two pounds here's what you do here's how you knock it off he's got the DNA test he's got the blood work to help keep his body balance he's got the personal I supplements and he's not gonna you're not going to put it back or\nHe he couldn't figure out how to get enough calories to eat while he was on break from the two six today rounds\nHe couldn't eat enough food yeah sickly or that kind of where that was that but the interesting thing about his story is that what he said to me was his doctor kept track of his blood work the whole entire time that he was on the program for 'em and he said that\nEach and every time that he did blood it just kept getting better and better and better and he\nWas saying that before he started the program he was basically a\nPre diabetic they wanted him to start taking seven hundred a ... milligrams of met for men and just\nYou know it's really lucky at his weight I Know you're\nTalking about why they had a not a very lucky is very very lucky\nBut he told me that I'm at the end of the day all of the medications that they wanted to put him on would've cost him out of pocket seven hundred dollars a month\nWell okay let's calculate that I Believe those gentlemen is in his late fifties and not a hundred percent certain of his age levels him he weighs he lives until he's eighty so let's let's give them another twenty five years ... twenty five years times twelve times seven hundred knows ... and that's out\nOf pocket that's insurance not covering answer and you know what we don't even know these medications are going to be able to control whenever he had going on so that was actually what he focused on just as you understand how much money and saying that I'm like I Do I\nThat's just mind boggling numbers hundred and twenty pounds a hundred and twenty days and we saved a potential seven hundred dollars a month for the rest of it right who\nWants to take those medications even if they're afraid we I mean if the insurance covered all of it who wants to go into and you know most of these things that people are taking the medications for for for obesity they're really you know to every doctor will tell a patient that that\nIt's a hundred per se it's almost a hundred percent curable because they're all affected from so that rather is that all told her all the result of of of being overweight and that's and that's really tremendous so\nYou know these are these are typical results twenty five to thirty five pounds for women is what we see thirty five to forty five to ... pounds for men I mean that's only in forty days it's without shops without hormones without surgery it's all natural solutions supplements that are personalized each individual\nFrom uh from blood work for Harris saliva by our ...\nDNA testing as well a beginning and end and and really you know that's what makes it go with the personalization of how to how to balance each how to help balance each person's body\nWhen they come in and so you can call one eight five five five and Jay diet when they started five five six five thirty four thirty eight so that's the schedule an appointment and one of our offices and we're all excited about ... about prince and opening a lots of people have been coming up\nFrom South Jersey saying when he can open when you gonna open so we're finally opened up the place down there were ever see patients there and it's really great so twenty five to forty five pounds is typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes and the twenty five five five and Jay diet and like when you're calling and make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phones [noise]\nThey're just there to schedule the appointment they really don't have the answer to your questions most of them are just started scheduling appointments so\nDon't yell at them or you can go to Andrew dice dot com it's easiest way only twenty seven dollars just go to Angie ... dot com and uh you can also go to Andrew dice dot com that's easiest way to do it usually it's Ninety nine dollars but right now as a\nRadio lists are only twenty seven dollars\nFor a full body comes a consultation with us a full body composition analysis\nWhere we are going to take a look at not only weight but others certain important things like your your water levels your body water so give me an example how important is so that your body of water is very low and the people with the lowest body water by the way are obese women and\nSo they're usually the ones that are walking around in their bags with water and so and body water goes low slows down the metabolism is your body's not observing water properly disposed of metabolism makes it very difficult to lose weight\nSo we're going to take a look at those numbers so if you're if you're if you're obese woman and trying to lose weight and working out and drinking your water like everybody tells you to instill that was a way of news for your chances are you're a mineral choice imbalance which will be able to personalize some solutions for some supplements will take a look and see if you need\nLighter or and so she's just she says that you know she just came in she's super thrill I'm going on a monster shopping spree she says this is her husband is going to kill her does she go on a shopping spree a and put what's great you know she came and she had a bunch of the history of of of major die\nIt's of issues when she was coming in and you know every time she ate she says within like twenty minutes away half an hour she's gassy she's bloated a sheet and it shows that way for hours this was this beforehand and we you know she came in\nAnd did a concert weather obviously a we looked at a bunch of different things uh we did the hairs saliva or with the energetic ... a buyer and drug testing while we took a look at some blood work that she brought in we were able to do a a ... a toxicity support\nA digester support or minerals and vitamins support and so boom twenty to twenty two pounds um and and forty days which is fantastic\nA little bit below what we typically see but still you know like she said she looks like she's thirty pounds\nShe looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and [noise]\nYou know she's going to go spend some money on somebody get you know get help the economy a little bit of a shopping the shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping at a bind some clothing and uh it's always good right I'll go\nI you know I think that there's\nShe looks like she's thirty pounds a lighter she looks and feels that she's thirty pounds lighter and [noise] you know shouldn't go spend some money on somebody get you know get help the economy a little bit of a shopping yeah shot shot in the arms of the economy a little bit get herself shopping get a bind some clothing and ah it's always good right\nOutta all good I you know I think that there is nothing that feels or um that feels better than I'm buying yourself a pair of jeans size or to size or smaller than you were only like a low twenty thirty forty days ago\nOr so in my opinion it's like you know for a man who is tightening his belt buckle right and and you get to see that mark\nAnd that he's had there for like whatever eight years and now that markets you know now that dumped it on a different a whole and I think that that's I think that's really special and I think um\n[noise] and I think what really matters is the fact that\nYou know every single day you're accountable to yourself now and you know what you're doing and you know and\nYou kinda feel comfortable in your own skin now you're no longer afraid of the snack attack you no longer you know having these cravings and we had Stella call the office this week so she's been off the program for three years by the way\nI'm and she I think she lost about thirty seven pounds three years ago and she is sixty four now so she was sixty one I'm three years it obviously\nShe called because she wanted to know about the DNA testing 'cause that was really interesting to her and also because she gets the complimentary hand saliva evaluation every three months she comes in and she does that and she gets the appropriate ... of I told her about that\nToo but so one of the things that she said to me that really\nChanged her after the program was that she no longer afraid to walk into a supermarket she's no longer\nAfraid to go sit down at a restaurant because she knows exactly where she that she knows that she's completely control in control your eye and she said that this wasn't the situation ... years ago she had completely lost control\nAnd that's a scary place to be at and I'm really proud of her that three years later on and she said to me she goes you know it's a daily thing for me now she says I wake up in the morning and I think about what my days going to look like\nAnd then my second thought as what my days going to look like food wise\nAnd it's an interesting thing right we wake up in the morning we think about what we have to do during the day but why not think about what it is that we're going to eat during the day or ... you know that's what fuels our body that's what determines how much energy we have that really\nDetermines how we're going to feel for the next morning right but a lot of people don't think of it that way but she says you know it completely shifted her paradigm a sink like she's completely on a different\nWavelength in terms of what happens to her every single morning she has a routine\nYou know she knows what she's going to eat she knows what she's gonna do that day and that really helps her in three years later all the way it is still often she's doing great you know it's great\nIt's great and then that's what you do you empower people when you have control your empowered and new you can handle it and you know what to do and and so each person is given ten different ways to get the weight off her each person as a weight set point respect\nEach person or ... is given a DNA test that tells them all these different things for over forty different metabolic factors\nAnd so that's what it's all about without an shots and hormones in surgery we typically see twenty five to thirty five pounds and women are we typically see thirty five to forty five\nPounds with men and that's mostly fat that's without shops without hormones without surgery a without hungrier eating natural food uh you're you're you're not hungry in the program because your body is burning so much toxic side for fuel\nThat were just basically rerouting what your body's using for fuel and then we were out back and and\nSo it's really monitor you every every day you have my personal cell phone number my email address so nobody's ever alone or on this process\nAnd it's really easy to just go to and Jay ... to get started to go to and J died dot com normally it's Ninety nine dollars but as a radio listener uh right now you go on line is twenty seven dollars for a full body composition analysis [noise]\nUh where we take over and take a look at a bunch of different things we do a full consultation body composition analysis we look at not only weight\nBut we're also looking at a visceral fat we're also looking at your basic metabolic rate and so we're also looking at daily caloric intake and so the difference in those two numbers is important because\nYou know if you if your if your body's functioning your basic metabolic rate let's say you're burning off Seventeen hundred calories a day but your body function like you're taking in thirty five twenty five hundred calories a three thousand calories a day\nAnd you're wondering why you can't lose weight that might give you an answer you know and so we take a look at metabolic higher body is working and so then we we then do hair and saliva with and do\nThe buyer and genetic testing uh when decided to go forward with the program we didn't take a look at blood work that people bring in\nTo see what supplementation to support them with\nAnd we look at it a functional level uh we just tighten up those parameters a little bit so it or you know if you keep the parameters within a functional level you have to worry less about being diagnosed with big without the ... by those problems getting worse and being ... God Forbid diagnosed with something so\nWe want to keep it in a healthy range and keep your body balance and\nIf we're able to do that and there's less chance you know upstream downstream if you if upstream you're able to keep the body balance and you have to worry about the less disease downstream\nAnd so that's n J died dot com\nOr for twenty seven dollars for a a a only twenty seven dollars

area or New Jersey New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island and ah Westchester [noise]\nUh that's great and so you can come in and scheduled appointment or you make a phone call\nJust remember when you are calling that the folks on the phone are only there to schedule appointments or they're not there to you know put you on the weight loss program a fish will get mad at grade now now what are

we'll talk to and and and we'll give you all the answers about the program and so forth [noise] um so bill came in this week\nAnd it's really you know it's amazing when you when you\nA lot of extra fat in general and a lot of visceral fat duff decide on the organs\n... levels of visceral fat really cause inflammation in the body inflammation in the body will cause is one of the causes to all the different chronic you know systemic sort of aches and pains so it's not just one area that hurts them a systematic shoulders and elbows intrusion and the joints\nThat's why are people that are obese we're more more of a percent susceptible to arthritis and things like that and just generalize inflammation the body and so\nYour bill comes in and got all these different aches and pains\nOr he is he's got high blood pressure or he's one of these guys you know typical belly\nYou know the body stores fat in different areas to protect their is because of different hormonal disruptions generally in those areas so if you get somebody with like that you know floppy overhanging belly fat you're looking at a dream knows that you're looking at that that apple shape you're looking at a thyroid if you're looking at\nA um a pear shape are you looking at reproductive Oregon imbalances so bill Scott does belly you know he's got when he was skinny guys with a big old belly like everything's in the belly\nAnd no matter what he does have no matter how you lose try to lose weight just becomes a skinny guy with a big belly he's just got a big old belly\nHis hormones are off his body is off nothing's working the right way and when he came in he says you know I just got in front of the program it's just I just got to get the same results I got to do something there's no way I can live like this [noise]\nUh and so you know gave him you know did did all the personalization processes here game which Reno support game reproductive a reconstructed Oregon support all natural type of supplementation\nA personalized for him and so boom forty eight pounds got 'em going fifty days libido is back no more crashing in the middle of the day is barely even thinks about coffee anymore just has like a little cup in the morning\nAnd and he's raw rocking and rolling and and so that's what it's all about so\nYou know thirty five to forty five plus as what we see with men typically only forty days twenty five to thirty five\nWith women typically\nA ... in only forty days and it all natural there's no everything is either um you know as a base mineral base ... supplements that are personalized for each individual based on either by energetic testing\nOr or blood work or DNA as well uh and so without any shots without hormones or last surgery people are on hunger in the program because their body would just turn their body into fat burning machine so we we're out what your body is using for fuel you're going to burn at least\nTwo thousand calories of your own facts for fuel you can't be hungry and and so uh it only forty days twenty five to forty five plus pounds across the board\nAnd so that's n J died dot com right now it's normally Ninety nine dollars as a radio list early twenty seven dollars gets your body composition analysis [noise]\nAn appointment with us uh where we take a look at not only your weight and you could give us out on the phone I mean we look at your way we look at body fat percentage we look at body water percentage we look at just real fat rating I'm against folks if your if your your your body is water is lawyer visceral fat as high\nYou know when you get high visceral fat that's the fat on the organs and makes you more insulin resistance when your body becomes more insulin resistant away your body metabolize is a sugar for fuel is instead of bringing into the cell and burning it your body is taking in turning into fat and storing it\nAnd that's going to make your metabolism work much slower on top of that if you've done a ton of weight yo yo dieting laws and a ton of water too quickly\nA like a lot of times with women that we see your water levels are going to be off if your water levels are often you got high visceral fat you're ... you're in you're forty years old your metabolism is functionally a seven year old you're not going to\nBe able to lose weight and there's no way to do it\nSo we're gonna have to take a look at all those things and and then and then personalized these the solutions that supplements are the the for each individual gets your body into fat burning that's one of the things that we look at it as mineral ballots metabolic age daily caloric intake ah and so\nThat you know that's that's how we do it on the front end and then and then we personalized approach ah everything for the for you for the for the forty days program as well\nUh we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey or New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island are now opening in West Chester as well\nTwenty five to forty five pounds is typically what we see a little bit more on the men's side sometimes and twenty five five five and Jay diet and like when you're calling and make a phone call when you're calling please remember the people on the phones [noise]\nThey're just there to schedule the appointment they really don't have the answer to your questions most of them are

the ground is the same thing with the program you're going to lose the weight you're going to do it so\nWe had and Jarrett I don't know if you remember him he had a quadruple bypass eight years ago I remember everybody I Know but I'm just saying you know just in case you don't just want to remind you so Jared um had a quadruple bypass eight years ago I'm\nClearly not the most ideal situation and really and\nInstead as an working him you know getting fatter and working at um you know exercising more and feeling life like someone up there I gave him a second chance on life he\nWent and they completely other way and started to eat really unhealthy he really felt it was so unfair that this happened to him and he had this quite truthful bypassing all these other things and\nSo he kind of really started to um go downhill and um so he had a checkup with his cardiologist and he basically told him that um\nYou know at he's heading down a not such a good road and so\nYeah so he gets decided his girlfriend I think finally told him that you know you kind of either need to get with the program or sort of you know get out because you know she wasn't going to go through this again what happened eight years ago and and so he came in and\nYou know this was a guy who was getting every one of his meals\nAnd snacks and take out ... you know so he was basically running in wherever eating whatever and and um\nYou know he used to be a runner he used to be you know all these things he said do account is for itself anyway lo and behold a\nForty days later\nHe lost a forty nine pounds wow and uh we are back to running we are back to having known any pain no ankle pain or we are no longer getting every meal out which is really really cool because he says he\nIs my favorite part he gets to spend more money and buying clothes and buying clothes first girlfriend presents for her so you know like\nI tell my favorite part shopping's kid I think and you know he ... and the best part is is that he's no longer depressed because he actually started to feel so much better wants to wait for it to come off that he realized\nThat his life was over you know the heart was sixteen out the bypass worked eight years ago so you know here we go it's like a second chance in life so he really thankful he cooks now um you know he says I Can't believe how much money I'm saving pine nuts\nEating out every meal and you know you're\nGetting it sounds like somebody's sponsoring like a woman's group is sponsoring it had the one\nTime somebody hanging made\nYou had you had the

forty days his neck size went too far from Seventeen point five to Fifteen point five and he says that\nThese were his size is Twenty years ago and what's really funny is that for ... as he puts on

Jones tend to University School of medicine to department of neurology the school of bio science dish will die a biotechnology I mean these were advanced\nResearch institutions I mean this is real proof of brain protection\nParkinson's disease is a disease that occurs in the brain it's one of the more common brain diseases that occurs towards the back of the brain and it affects the part of the brain the substantial negra parts compact them and the base of dangling\nThat controls movement showing people developed Parkinson's disease or they got tremors their head is shaking their hands were
