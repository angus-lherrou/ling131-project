going on a discussion but that vote is east coast time that vote will be over by the time he walks up the eye\nAlthough listen you guys this is let's hear this is what the center has to say about it

I like Montana I wouldn't mind being in a month and God's Country\nAnyway let's go to Andrew in Queens welcome to Kurdish and really Cosby uh WABC Andy high energy\nHigh um I have a simple solution he needs to have a conversation guard explained it to say that too important I mean the two important and shit and whatever she said he should go with it\nNow what do you think the daughter with Sandra

can use it as as cover and say honey I'm so sorry you know I was ready that day but my dad's vote that's a good excuse well yes yes\nBut on the air but also a cheap skate are they willing to reimburse

and\nApparently the machinery the software is not so good at identifying ethnic minorities when most of the subjects used in the training\nIn fact were of the majority group why can't they just say white people and more importantly they've had some problems when the passengers are wearing clashes hatch or ...\nYeah I notice when I was going through the line and this was not too long ago I'm a woman had like a scarf on and I thought it was interesting because it covers the gym they want the full face and they're worried that maybe something's being hidden there they made a big stink and of course people like I don't want to take my scarf off\nEverybody in the line with like lady players take her scarf off you're holding the whole line up she finally did but it was interesting they made you kind of look a certain way they had you kind of oh no it's not a good one can you do it again it it was a bit of a process\nAll right and they promise the department of homeland security that's in charge of this promises that the photo\nThey take today will be deleted\nIt within fourteen days of the flight that you've taken\nThey say we are going to guarantee as United States government to maintain your privacy as they would say in the u._k. or privacy do you trust our government to get rid of your photograph within fourteen days so it doesn't get clogged up somewhere in the massive system of photo\nNow you know that that I got to happen Curtis my friends you know that that system\nMay not necessarily be conspiratorial that they're doing it on purpose but just the government so often it's showing that\nWell you know what you made me think of course these ... was it like Google glasses that came out as it is and I remember I had a friend who sort of got 'em like before everybody else and I'm like well you do and he's like I'm able to go to a party or go anywhere\nAnd just walk down to like go until you know Penn Station right down below us see who is there and kind of get like people's names and if you've ever been on line or somewhere you already in the system and that's almost like what this says\nIt's like they will be able to then scan not just when you're going through in and out they were able to scan throughout the airport okay is uh Bob over here who's overstay their visa if you've over the ... year old and he's the one hand you don't want to go to New York\nWhat happens and maybe somebody out there as familiar with this software there are high tech engineer and they can explain is\nWhen you have like the former governor of New York ... wrote a a facial features or can the software to detect that\nAs opposed to somebody who has to smooth skinned because you view these Jenna show for the world to like Mario such a book called will attend to show for the fact that if\nYou use the ... film micro during my ... to make your skin silky smooth then you can Curtis\nOne eight hundred for a WABC let's go to Mike He calling in New York Welcome to Kurdish and ready to ... uh WABC Mike\n... is that right I Know that a good what what do you think of this\nSide of the security is a joke I went to Ireland a week after nine eleven and I said you have to show up for hours at a time and I wound up and train and a half hours or not they're not if what are we plan to take\nAway the checking in Ireland showing up at a pub in the nearby airport a it was probably crowded to begin with so\nWhy are you complaining about sounds like a pretty good deal\nThat this was a challenge and it was like I'm\nAll wow that's a whole different thing they're like the governor was talking about they're going to spend twelve billion dollars to turn it into a first world damage\nIn the airport a Broadway crowded it'd be\nWe're losing my but by the way ... good bar is still in Canada and ... and my point is if you're spending time and Kennedy you need a drink do when you're young you're on either do this\nOr do you spend twelve billion dollars in turn JFK into a first world airport instead of the third world airport it is one eight hundred eight for re WABC let's go to a man in Connecticut was on the Kurdish every ... uh WABC and I am\nI I I get it

waiting for I felt for I finally was able to get on claimed it was ... I almost like playing a hotel room or anything like that\nBut anyway I now you travel I have a happy redirect number\nAnd they even fat homeland security said that they tend not to shorten might protect female what will happen to me from other countries\nOh my goodness oh no ... yeah I think I don't like they go in your picture could be a good thing because it right away what is shown I Am not her\nHey and what what do you look like do you as it could be do you resemble um you know some of the ...

I'm sure that like an supposed to go to a wedding in Ireland I'm petrified\nIs your last name bin Laden and we just moved here for ... for him then later this is interesting\n'cause you're right the a photo identification system if it would have been in bed it into their software would have clarified that you are and the person you are and you wouldn't have been tied up into and not by department of homeland security\nExactly exactly and now traveling even now I think I Want to you know I Want to call my NBC I don't know what's going to go to Ireland\nOh not that but it's just like you know it\nYou know do a great example of what could go wrong I don't know yet wow jak\nAhead now give you a reason why but first cell phone numbers one eight hundred eight for re WABC is this the kind of technology that we need to catch bad people one especially prevent terrorists or is it too much of an invasion of your privacy one eight hundred eight for a nine to two two now I got flagged in

would fold out so that it would like take up a massive amount of space\nSo every time I'd have to visit in another country they immediately said we see in the computer you flagged by Canada in Ontario that's the province of Quebec they don't flag me none of the other provinces have Canada flag me it's just Ontario so then they would take out this long piece of paper\nYou know for like fifty two I think we study it analyze it and I'd be stuck you know what it has more control we live our\nRemember that story and it really ... hard he was an illegal alien in Mali but he was living in French at
