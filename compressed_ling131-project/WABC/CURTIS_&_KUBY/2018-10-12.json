saying attorney representing the city\nBut you know it's again it's just that this mayor just trying to cover you know cover his tracks to give the oppression he's doing something fair right for the city and he's not this is still a city of ... uh what do you call it a tale of two cities it's for the rich and then those who just don't have a dime to survive\nAnd actually he's disrespecting at this moment\nI've already spoken to a number of the tended association leadership about this particular article and when I say I was temporarily outrage right now I'm past outrage [laughter] you know I you know I'm just highly upset that he would insult intelligence of individuals who live in these developments mind you know everybody that lives in public housing orange you know indigent and aren't broke a poor\nUnfortunately there are folks that have to live there because they can't afford to live\nOr else but they have jobs there the working poor the working class where police officers were people who live in these developments that deserve respect and this mayor just doesn't offer that at all\nTony a lot of people would say well look the folks in the projects when it came out to vote in first time for the ... twenty Thirteen\nBoth in the primaries against Bill Thomas and then in the general election against Joe low to elected him overwhelmingly likewise recently in his reelection saying well why why did you keep voting for this guy bill de Blasio who you never saw the projects\nOr what people say because if you had an election today I think a lot of them would vote for the basil\nActually I really don't think so because if you look at the the numbers it was very low voter turnout in those elections so what he got was a lot of folks who bought into the stupidity it would happen because they don't know any better I don't know whether they understand the fact that they they they shouldn't do research\nAnd had better selections I actually worked on the bill Thompson campaign and that's why I can say the Blasio is not my mayor he may be the mayor of New York city mayor though\nBut I see it from the standpoint that it was both very low voter turnout I'm quite frankly and that's what he won by that very small margin\nA we have to galvanize folks to have confidence to believe that there was somebody that they can vote for and that's what we're working on right now so that we could change that dynamic and that's why we started\nThe organization housing residents first to show that they should be placed first when it comes down to politicians knocking on their door come into their housing developments you know with some uh what do you call it burgers and Franks at their family days and want to speak on the microphone and then leave and never come back after they get elect\nNow speaking of that that's what Andrew Cuomo is done as governor he dish the mayor rightfully so for not fulfilling his ... responsibility to the residents of public housing and he said he was going to come in\nAnd fix up a lot of the problems have you detected anything by the state of New York in terms of following through on that promise\nWell actually I've been fortunate enough to to sit with some folks in the quote ministry and I'm not sure if you know I actually worked on the Coleman campaign with people in public housing um this this election cycle\nAnd what I Do understand is that he refuses to put that money up until\nA monitor a federal monitor is put in place so that these money's on waste it again and having talked to the leadership of housing we all believe that this is going to come to fruition once that monitor is appointed I've also testified\nAt the latest here the last year in prior to the stupidity um with regards to that and and we look forward to that happening and I'm going to hold them to that and if not we're going to get out there we're going to make some noise or with a let them know that if you didn't do what you say you were going to do like we did to Nixon we're going to make some noise and embarrass you\nGood for you and everybody we are talking to Tony Herbert he's a community advocate they're right on the ground who knows the housing projects so well here\nIn the city Tony you know the other thing I it's interesting that they haven't figured out the independent monitor because when I came down and and Cuomo said okay I'm going to take it away from the bonds you know I'm going to put it in an independent hand it's been a while now 'cause it's been a few months where the pressure to say like you said\nOn come on deliver 'cause you can kind of say oh we're looking into her Lynn looking into it and that should happen eight zap\nActually I mean you know here's the crazy part about it is the it's it's in the court's hands now and unfortunately that's where the housing residents at this point ah um their their quote unquote\nThere being able to move forward has been placed um I don't again I'm not going to beat up on Cuomo because I'm going to give them an opportunity was fair minded when you step to us and we had the conversation I'm I'm going to give them an opportunity to put it together\nAnd by the way I applaud him Tony too for doing that too I think it's a good thing that he you know that at least took it out of demands on his hands on this\nWell this is the second time the governor had to come into step in because if mayors and doing his damn job straight up out you know downtown the bigger question though is both\nA the mayor and the governor do not have conversations with President or Dr Ben Carson who's in charge you a hug feds provide Ninety percent of the budget to operate the public housing facilities and the five boroughs\nIf you don't have a relation with them Tony in any way shape or form and you continue to bad mouthing them you don't think that Donald Trump or Dr Ben Carson\nAre going to are going to send any additional money that badly needed to restructure the projects\nWell that and that's the whole liberal thing which you know it it it hurts us from a political standpoint that folks in public housing will not be able to see those additional funds because of the politics being played but at the same time too how do you deal with a maniac that just don't get it to you know get it\nThat folks are suffering out here they don't have the resources or the wherewithal that he has to be able to survive so at the end of the day it it should be a moral understanding opposed to a political one\nThat the Trump Administration and Dr Ben Carson who truth be told has no clue about you know urban development in our communities you know when they need to wake up and unfortunately the stance is being taken as all political and at the end of the day the folks in public housing and New Yorkers are going to suffer\nYou know what I'd like to see a and everybody was talking to Tony Herbert community advocate here in the city\nTony you know as we think about the the one thing I always feel like\nThey are so underrepresented and politicians take advantage of the folks in the projects like hers was saying when it's you know when it's time and you were saying bring the hotdog bring the hamburgers\nI Wish there was some sort of way because what they do have his power in numbers you know the politicians do want their votes I Wish there was some way that they would galvanize in in a very organized coherent way\nBecause to say wait a minute you know looked at all these things that are going to look what they said about us that we basically deserved that you could I could just see the picket lines can you imagine if you had thousands upon tend to ... I mean we're talking to a huge population Tony\nWell let me just say this I'm actually there is a movement hum and we're moving gracefully at this point um and it's an educational thing first and foremost because now we've got to the program them from the thought process that everybody should be committed to the Democratic party because they're a minority that should not be the case at all we should actually be committed\nTo those who want to do the job that's why I support non partisan elections here in our city\nBut when it's all said and done I Am talking with a few folks and we are sitting down with the leadership that which which is denying housing development I'm chair persons\nWho represent all of nature housing residents in where we're coming to some agreements that we're going to get to a level where we're going to start to develop a voter block and that's where we're not far from that make that final evasion of that negotiation so we're working on it\nThe key thing is this is another attempt of the Blasio who claims that he is the protector of the pool or the impoverished she indigent to deflect blame from himself his own malfeasance\nBut that's outrageous I mean for anybody to file that kind of abrupt saying oh it's crummy you should know better you deserve it they\nSaid well where's the backlash unbelievable to you would think that he's blaming the mothers were moving in a public houses are public housing single mothers raising kids and\nAlso people like you just call like Jenny and also cops and and we just sadly as we heard from Tony ...\nFor a lot of people who just had you know a turn of events in their life is teachers\nLet's go to Greg in Warwick welcome to Kurdish and read it caused me Greg\nIt Curtis and read a great show as usual\n... work thank you Greg [noise] now my grandparents\nAre so funny grandpa was Spain nine and was from the Ukraine\nAnd they would never say welfare or even worse they used to call home relief we used to laugh it was so funny when they say either of those words it was like the about the head and thank God that they didn't have to deal with city project\nWow I you know I liked that too but at least putting a positive sort of spin well well we're on\nHome relief if you were receiving welfare and you lived in the public housing projects the many dwellings that exists in the five boroughs they would send inspectors you would get the white glove test once a month to make sure that you were keeping things neat and clean that was back then right\nAnd then they would check to make sure that any of the items that you had\nWere affordable based on the money she were receiving so of all of a sudden you had a Seventy two inch being big screen TV obviously in the fifties and sixties they didn't have it\nBut the equivalent of it Thirteen inch ... you know color t._v. they would say that's it no more homey reef no more welfare because you're cheating assist them they don't do that any\nOf that because they think about how much it's changed since then now it's like now Alex crummy you asked for you moved in there\nYou go out to have any kids eat the lead paint chips right I Wonder if a comrade the Blasio's a landlord he owns two buildings he makes millions of dollars in parts so\nIf all of a sudden his tenants would have said to him hey you know is led painted chips here and they would shoot him he would say to them hey schmuck no make that touch you know moving into my house is that there was that the possibility that you got lead paint chip you can swim
