person were living an unreasonable times and we have a lot of unreasonable actors in the conversation in and out of the media\nIn and out of politics and I'm a I'm very concerned about the vulture

you know uh the camouflage detail huge said no we don't have to announce the winner is that's crazy so one of two women they went through one is for this Powerball jackpot which is what over six hundred million dollars\nSix hundred and eighty seven point eight million not a bad thing to split\nSo that means that person purchase that ticket that digital data convenience store in Harlem doesn't necessarily mean they lived in Harlem buddy over on the point spread is likely that they live in Harlem and there are regular you know a customer and they buy lotto tickets all the time\nThis person is going to have to come front and center so what will they take a week a month\nOr six months to get their personal affects ah in check so that nobody comes preying on them or all of a sudden through Facebook and other social networking\nMummy Harry members Sally I was your best friend in elementary school way I saved your life there remember in high school when you were ready to jump off the third for their cause you failed your SAT's you know what's gonna happen so how much preparation\nTime really do you think whoever won that ah that that Powerball ticket is going to need in order to ward off the barbarian war that's going to want to see some of every nickel dime and penny that they want\nWell I Would say with that kind of a set up they would need decades but I think the reality is there only probably get a get a few weeks 'cause I think they have to report by X amount of time there's a pretty narrow window actually I'm at but it's on debt which greatest hits a west Harlem deli Fifth Avenue near one hundred and twenty six three\nUm you know it that's not you know uh I Love I Love the fact that these kinds of stories because and I I predict it and I just I had a feeling because remember there was a win in Staten Island there is a win in the Bronx between the mega millions and the Powerball some of the smaller weddings and I said it's inching closer it's inching if I had\nI just had a feeling it was going to happen\nHere looking at this as if it's a positive story you're looking as if the glass as half full I'm looking as if the glasses cracked and completely empty\nBecause think of all of our listeners how many uh called up over these last two weeks in a frenzy of purchases first of the mega million tickets everybody was just shock or they all lost their money and now Powerball\nWe're only one winner and it may not even be a resident of the tri state area who knows maybe they were visiting in Harlem and doing business in all and bought a ticket got lucky and then a naturally they went back to their place of origin\nBut that's close to two billion dollars that may have been scammed from places\nThroughout the nation never mind in the tri state area where gambling was fast and furious and heavy towards the very end when they were hyping it hyping it after we they sent everybody the edge ended up there to actually change the way they actually do Powerball and making millions to the point to favor the house even more than they had favorite it before\nYeah they changed the balls a number of balls and the number of numbers but what I Am hoping as remember we had our caller Steve\nWho I said if I Won the big one and I did play by the way if I Won the big one I Would have given him a million bucks and I would have given you something I didn't say anything for Brian among the luge or crush 'em but I did say I would give something so Steve then in turn\nSaid if he wins he would share some with me so I Am praying that Steve maybe is the winner there at the west Harlem deli on Fifth Avenue so stay\nOne I don't let me know baby because I'm In a two and a baby\nThere is no way that the purchase that\nTake that we don't we're Steve Steve might have gone through right that was a low low slam dunk guaranteed save me saved come on what do you have\nI Will tell you the lotto and the Powerball and the mega million er fanaticism got so great I had to check a friend of mine out of ... when hospital downtown\nWhen he was a lot of having lotto hysteria no well we probably shouldn't serious pain him out he\nWas like barely walking and you realize before I put them in a cabin ... on his way and that took forever in ... you had to stop and buy lotto ticket oh crazy is along with all the rest of\nUs that you know what to do it gave them a reason to live and he'll better because the thought of what he could do with that ... and I'm thinking that you will have one ... one baby you're going to share it with me pop another ... [laughter] I didn't\nFeel better let's go to Mike calling from Jersey Welcome to the Kurdish and ready to cast rehear WABC Mike Mike\nI good afternoon ladies and gentlemen or just had a question and a comment regarding how about increasing our odds because like you said it's one of the billion trillion increase the odds of having multiple winners when you have like these huge payouts\nI I like the middle\nThe first question you cry baby you know what I like it when men cry a little bit because I think it shows a little bit of humanity look they it's what fourth championship in Fifteen Years say what the ... out of the Dodgers they deserve to have tears of\nJoy oh there was a place that I Would normally never be you know I hate ...

we're\nWatching the game it's for nothing and it's the Dodgers over the red Sox which would even it up to do it ... and then slowly but surely he come to Boston\nRed Sox just picking away they won that game obviously boom went on to win the world series with David Price\nMy favorite is by the way on the New York posted acres is the post says Dodgers lose I Love that they don't say Red Sox won I'm\nI'm going to even let a New York Mets fan weigh in on this because I hate the Mets as much as I hate the red Sox I'm like Switzerland when they play against one another I'm neutral on that but even even I met fan hates them\nThe red Sox for [noise] Brooklyn\nMet my wife says let's go Yankees\nYeah that's what I said oh you Red Sox fan\nWell that's why I Want to find out where the mayor is we only have one of those meetings remember he went to ... oh he'll be in bombs didn't say that he was going to Goldman Sachs and it's not just him right\nRemember Corey Johnson who is the second most powerful person speaker of the lame council speaker yeah fifty or fifty one did beach in slackers of the city council he's a Boston Red Sox\nBut I'm going to give him a little side because he grew up there I think he was born and grew out of yeah but you kind of ping pong around more kind of as a little more of a of a traditional they have no whom he owns one\nOn the way a Boston Red Sox cap there are people\nWalk around town doing that all day long and\nAnd they last about as long as the ... the place I got like ...\nThey're all they're getting all for toilets because the red Sox won the world

Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers and is that is going on leaders on Long Island or rally together with the Jewish community\nThat were at this place the mayor quickly here in New York City disagree because they came out very quickly and said no he doesn't believe armed guards should be at places of worship\nYesterday was also unacceptable no houses of worship do not have to have armed guards to be able to practice their religion that's not America\nShut out to budge you don't know what you're talking about anyway why at Madison Square garden the great facilities provided to us in order to do this well cash to all of you buy n J died dot com first off\nA synagogue a different in many respects than let's use as an example the Roman Catholic Church of the archdiocese\nShow French and chip cardinal Dolan says to the member churches of the archdiocese\nOh we're going to have security officers personnel in the church is on the first response from uh the local munching yours how you don't pay for that he says the archdiocese is paying for it then everybody has armed guards\nBut none of these Senate ... they're all independent autonomous whether the shitty ... ultra orthodox orthodox conservative reform\nThey differ with one another so that one should\nThey worship God I've been in with their armed guards for every service or they're ... they're stationed outside so this whole argument as to whether they shouldn't be shouldn't be the individual ...\nWill make up their minds within shell\nAnd you know would also if you look at places like Israel and other places you heard all weekend you heard from like Israeli ambassadors and Israeli officials who said\nThat it is required in Israel that they absolutely have it in Israel on and here also Eric Adams Brooklyn borough president a former cop when one step further not just talking about armed guards but saying that\nRetired cops can also play a role\nAnd we heard officers who are trained on how to respond to emergencies how to move to say we have a proper use the police or a fire on if they're even those firearms home I'm now through to them stop re re you're fired on her own home do as I Do read your firearms which are\nNow I'm not sure about that I don't know if we wanted to be like a wild west at the OK Corral what is she talking\nAbout they were all all ready police officers men and women some of whom are armed always off duty others who are not they choose not to be I Would rather than be armed all the time who go to ...\nSays whatever their faces strapped\nBut what he's saying is he's encouraging them to now bring it you know if they weren't they going to bring it all tiny adjusting have we gotta G supplemental president he's a former cop with the you know some authority it's not as though they're already cops who are on\nThey weren't citizens difficult as it is in our neck of the woods or being in Connecticut New York New Jersey to actually have a carry permit but there are citizens who carry when I go to their house of worship\nBut he's saying listen we want more of them and and I I'm not sure if I Want to encourage tons of people but I Do believe that the people who

Curtis and Cosby Twitter page because we started a poll asking\nDo you think that it's time to have armed guards in places of worship not just synagogues churches and elsewhere are so far overwhelmingly eighty seven percent of you are saying yes to denounce some\nIf a house of worship decides to have armed guards inside outside in the parking lot and via because that's their choice I

this by law and say that every house of worship\nHas to have an armed guard inside or outside or whatever you could assign cops outside you can tell them what to do on the inside of their business their business zone and all of them out of their own congregations she'll vote on this I guarantee the Presbyterian Church will vote on it the Methodist so vote on it to the evangelicals alone will\nBe on a case by case right Ray Kelly former police commissioner by the way came out and said you don't have to necessarily have armed guards he said that that's not the solution he had a nother

said what's all these ... now\nYou gotta have armed guards in it and I would make the case what's inside a church and the precious commodity is a lot more expensive than money you have it in ... I mean that's but that's what I'm saying people's lives are more friends are worth more to me the amount of shame arguments we've had\nAbout schools what's wrong with having armed guards inside outside and I think we need to get outside Curtis but I think we need to an\nEnd when the politicians start traveling around the Blasio without armed guards and they don't have armed guards at their place it residents\nThen maybe they can set an example one said look I don't have armed guards I don't travel with armed police officers when I rest a you know after smoking some joints at Gracie Mansion there are no armed police officers protecting me and my family\nThey cross let's go to the caller's this one eight hundred a bore eight nine to two to one eight hundred a for a nine to two to\nLet's go to Sandy in Westchester welcome to Kurdish ready because we uh WABC Sandy\nHi guys you know what if they had armed guards outside that did a God that guy who didn't have the got inside and I don't believe I heard someone say somewhere they could have gotten to inside well that's good you're trying to keep them that guy from coming in at all you don't have the guy come in and you don't start shooting each other all kinds of crazy with it that\nWell I agree and I also think it should be like not scheduled to it should be like a different places different times I think sadly we've come to that it breaks my heart Sandy because I think you mentioned habit but I agree with you it visible visible security right\nAnd and then that might even from coming but you have to Latin that tend to get in China with the\n... doesn't that make sense that if I was to pass a synagogue and I see a armed security officer out ... let's say with an assault weapon or a hand gun clearly visible on his side why\nWould I take the chance of trying to get through him if I Know I could go down the road to another Senate God that is just not to have any security uh what's the other than maybe a camera running twenty four hours a day and that's only going to help you after the fact if you can identify the government\nWell and that's why I think it should be there but they should also be rotating so it's not like on the set clock so you know okay well they are going to be here at this time and then they have their lunch break and next time you know I think I think that's a great idea\nLet's go if we can the Jimmy who's calling from New York Welcome to Kurdish and really ...

live ammunition uh there's always a danger that that could happen are clearly a if you are on the other side of the issue and you wanted to prove a point that it's Trump who is preventing you from getting to America to work\nA few dead bodies along the way is certainly going to turn the tide in terms of public reaction in your favor so there's no doubt in my mind there'll be some kind of caused she said they will try to pressure the issue if they can do all this prevention in advance is good\nOr if in fact I Would stop them on the Mexican side I Would defy the Mexican government and say you're not doing your job\nRight exact and by the way President Trump said to them I'm expecting you to do your job on that side of the border and they didn't\nWrite ... there were so many areas where there is no population at all between both borders you could literally shut up divisions dad said no this is where we're going to stop\nYou so you can't claim asylum gives the moment you step into the United states you have a right to claim asylum\nAdvantage and I'm getting in [noise]\nYeah and then uh they have to have a hearing\nThat that's what the homeland security secretary says to you know getting in\nWell if they do Madam Secretary a and they declare that they are seeking asylum you gonna have to according to the law the way they now exists give 'em that hearing and it could take a month to Sunday so we do you put them in a camp\nOr you give them a ticket to tell them come back in six months and we know they're going to get lost in the sauce in our population as one of the many growing illegals\nAnd they see a moment do here Curtis too because the whole world is watching this massive caravan which is at least seven thousand there's some report that maybe as many as ten thousand people and that is definitely heading closer and closer we got the mid term elections and\nYou know a lot of things at stake Democrats watching it Republicans watching well\nI've heard a lot from our listeners are not so much to our show but other shows\nThat this is George Soros inspired the liberals and progressives want this this is the worst thing that could happen for you before mid term elections if you're a liberal or progressive even if you believe in open borders because some of them will never say that publicly because they realize the mass majority of our population\nEven those who are moderate Democrats and liberal Democrats are opposed to open borders\nRight and they realize how bad that sound especially when you see the image of thousands coming\nRight right but if you look at a young man will lead him as a group you can clearly see that isn't so much sanctuary that day she\nIs work one war\nAnd under normal circumstances if they were coming across in a group just fifty or a hundred we wouldn't pay any attention because they would be moving north to the border to some employment agent who's already secured them work in the fields or in factories or in restaurants or another of food preparation industry set\nRecruit and yes hire illegal aliens\nCruise you hit it on the head that it's mostly guys and you know for them to sit there I don't think they would fit the criteria I'm sure there are some by the way that sit asylum that are seeking just horrible upon horrible persecution and the criteria that it takes to get\nThis island but you can't tell me that all seven ten thousand or ... what are quite a fight assigned writer viral ...\nIf I were from Honduras which per capita per person now has the highest murder rate in the world oh yeah it's a scary place right I Would claim that I was being targeted whether by Amish Thirteen Eighteenth street or other uh divisions within those right\nOkay so that my next question is Curtis if you're interviewing them okay well then where are you married oh yeah and how old are your kids oh they're six seven twelve well where are your kids if you're targeted by him is Thirteen you think it's OK to leave your wife and kids behind which appears to be the case because it is mostly men in that era\nThat number's one eight hundred aid for a WABC let's go to Cathy on Long Island welcome to Kurdish and really caused me he kept\nGoing from I Know exactly what they're going to do it kind of pushed the women and children that they drag into this damn group and put them a hug and lost to do something to them\nOn like in like a real men men put an end up putting the the women and kids in the much\nFrom a strategy that ride with Kathy from a strategic point of view you have to say that's brilliant because then it really puts a lot of pressure on our military our immigration agents who are\nNow Pakistan I'll tell you what they should get is a rubber bullets\nYeah but the other hand kill they have killed before well\nYeah and you don't want and ... do you want that image of like even if it's rubber bullets hitting kids and and women I don't think that's a win for anybody\nLet me just tell you something I think about that but ... says going to get across that if we don't do that so what what do you do\nWell and Cathy I agree with you something needs to be done I mean I I don't\nI don't know how do you think that was kind of like happy about that throwing away I'm suggesting don't\nWaited all border push the envelope move a mile in into the Mexican border set up your provisional blockage in on Mexican territory and did the federal Ali used to do anything about\nIt they're not going to do anything about it or you can see the humor\nLead them to do and and and it's actually a good message Curtis because it sends a message that if they have protected the Mexico Honduras Morehead they protected the other border then we wouldn't be in the situation\nBut he won't do you see that's the point he won't do it and I think it's an option because have you dealt with the Mexican authorities you know if you had to you could bribed them to run away\nIs right you get all of a sudden yeah in some way of securing a pay shows into their pockets\nBy the way I think that would take a just a few bucks for each one of those\nNew scrub she never fun yeah in our government has discretionary funds to the CIA we've seen that suitcases full of money let's go to Cheryl in New Jersey Welcome to Kurdish and read it caused me on WABC Cheryl Cheryl\nHi I have friends that are from door and they\nThey go down to their back to Honduras during the summer on this summer vacation they say they live up in the country not in that town\nAnd there's no violence up there but of course in a town that yet but they also said that people have been down there giving out money encouraging people to get through this caravan\nAnd fair against it because they came here and wait for it and they have a daughter who came here legally and they're trying to get their granddaughter here and they're going through the system the way this first and and\nI I really feel whoever the Democrats or a billionaire forever and encourage throw up their\n... their hand you can you imagine that there are people\nWho already living there\nOr whoever particular ideology that have put together the structure of the organization to get people together and move forward without having to have European money or American money or money from the left or even as some have suggested from the rights because I guarantee you Cheryl\nIf there is a situation at the border right before the midterm elections the Republicans will sweep to victory\nYet but you know to evict Cheryl brings up a great point they'll Curtis because there are people who did it the right way uh you know of course of Guatemala too right there on the border of Mexico Honduras there are people from those countries that are directly tied with what's happening here with the care of them\nThat are upset because they went through years on to do it correctly totally you know they're they're furious and and so I think that we have to encourage proper you know a proper citizenship proper run a greater now this bomber rush thing if\nThey didn't have jobs here they wouldn't be coming so we we go at the workers which is what you always do\nYeah but that's not really unemployed than I Am a ... wage though like the way that isn't that isn't important solution that you're right neither party wants to address but the lord and you got a crowd coming to the border\nYou start grabbing these guys and gals who run these five star top shelf restaurants who hire illegal aliens in the kitchens and as part of their service cruel\nAnd I guarantee you when others see them going off in change in shackles which you never see you never see that then walk in the ... line and facing major federal time in jail you watch how quickly those jobs which drink up let's go to Larry in Brooklyn welcome to Kurdish and read The Cosby he uh WABC left high layer\nYeah Hi how are you there you know I I really think that we're sacrificing American values and I think in this particular aspect\nTrump is a coward because previous Republican presidents would have put pressure directly on the hunt during government and not start analyzing who's in the care of it that the reason there may be more guys in the Caribbean is because men in a in a situation where the gang violence men are the usual targets\nOver there they they are the casualties usually\nHey Larry Larry want to get out and hang on we should\nMove into Honduras with the CIA and do whatever's necessary if they're not going to do that enough to ...\nLarry Larry I'm going to respond to both of those things first of all he did try to put pressure on the Honduran government and they ignored 'em they're their own government they ignored him\nSecond of all I'm you know what yes you're right that you know the guys are typically but guess what happens if the guy's fled and they're after you get the guys and they leave mama and the kids there you think that they're not vulnerable\nAnd also Larry I don't want to CIA involved in Honduras Guatemala el segue\nSay why do we do an Oscar Oscar I get all that and my my parents are first I'm first generation American roots\nThat's where we do without hypocrites we don't go to church on Sunday you shouldn't say one thing and do something else\nBut what do you are not answering my question to ask her what do we do it suddenly seven thousand or bum rushing our border what are we doing here's your\nQuestion what happened in the Eighteen hundreds or people were coming in boatloads from Ireland and from
