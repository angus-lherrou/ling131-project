she's registered to vote in Tennessee Taylor Swift\nAs well as Justin Timberlake which we all discovered when he took a selfie of himself in the voting booth which was against the law they're claiming that no he was going to break that which I support it I did likewise in the voting booted out using tonight she broke on a PS one fourteen\nBut I wanted waiting shaken here he is Justin Timberlake living in Los Angeles yet registered to vote in Tennessee\nAnd I was wondering if anyone else out there understood why both Justin Timberlake you can't get any more successful than him and Taylor Swift\nEnemy Sheikh vision is living in other places but a registered to vote in Tennessee one eight hundred eight for re WABC as one eight hundred eight for eight nine to two two and it goes\nBack to

guests\nThat I think they have picked up on that and so they gave me like a title\nSo the question is she still enthusiastic about being a resident of New York city and that was established back in twenty fourteen why is itchy votes in Tennessee why is it to Justin Timberlake who lives in Los Angeles votes in Tennessee\nAnd does not voting California law likewise Taylor Swift in New York one eight hundred eight foray WABC\nAnd read it\nI think I Know what the answer is\nWell not also give her a little bit of slack Curtis because with Taylor Swift ironically\nI think I may have met her one of her first nights that she ever came to New York city years ago it was that an award there than it was at a at a ... a female awards event and I remember I had to introduce or nobody knew who she was at this time she was just a young kid\nA very very young she was a teenager and I think it was either her first night or her second night ever in New York City and she's a country singer too because she's in Tennessee so to me I feel like even though the ... I think every city would try to own Taylor Swift with our popularity\nJustin Timberlake I got a little bit more of a question mark about being on why is he in tennis world you know I'll tell\nYou why because as much as they promote the Democratic agenda help the poor health the impoverished ... from\nUh attack the rich they are extraordinarily wealthy enriching themselves\nIn the region they maintain a residence in Tennessee is to shield their wealth yeah taxes because then they claim all know look I'm registered to vote in Tennessee I'm not registered to vote in New York or Los Angeles

which the employers are responsible for they rely in Tennessee on sales tax\nTo the tune of about nine percent but luxury items or tax free and we do know that Taylor Swift and Justin Timberlake are going to be buying a lot of luxury items set of facts\nFree and the other thing is Curtis they have to spend X amount of time in there to declare a residency X. percentage there's those standards and we got into all of that with Hillary Clinton\nBecause remember of course when she was running for Senate here in New York they're like hey wait a minute are you really hear X amount of time so it'd be interesting to see if they are really fulfilling their criteria\nThat they're in Tennessee X amount of time to get all those fringe benefits what is happening with Derek\nJeter we were just talking about the implosion of the Yankees and how I'm sitting Chevy here eight days and waiting for the humming caution and come by because of all last of the Boston Red Sox\nDerek Jeter try the same scam that both Taylor Swift and Justin Timberlake obviously a successful with by claiming primary residency in Tennessee he\nBought a big house in ... he put millions of dollars into it and he declared that his primary Russian and she was in Tampa and then you spend most of his time in Florida joining the year\nThe tax man and tax woman in New York state said\nHow can that be playing for the Yankees it's too soon and what you're spending most of your time in New York and the off season we see you are the ... of following you from night spot tonight spot most of the ... in New York they're not in Florida\nAnd so he had to end up pony up millions and millions of dollars in back taxes\nBecause he used the scam three years' worth it back taxes in interest by claiming that his primary residence was in his house which is really a secondary home in Tampa\nIs summer home or as a lot of snow a snowballs and snowflakes will say hey I got my primary residence in New York New Jersey Connecticut Pennsylvania and I have my second home\nDown in Florida I numbers one eight hundred eight for re WABC as one eight hundred\nEight for eight nine to two two\nAnd clearly why Taylor Swift coming out and urging the millennials in hipsters and young first time voters to go democratic in the mid term elections\nThat is where the election will be ... because we basically nowhere baby boomer generation is going ... to the lines of pretty much defined the unknown factor in the upcoming midterm elections is with only twenty percent of millennials in hits this having voted the last time\nHow many you're going to come out this time because if they come out in large numbers it is assumed that they would be coming out to vote democratic as opposed to Republican and then obviously you're looking at their house it'll probably be controlled by the Democrats and possibly the Senate also\nWell and that means that Maxine Waters is definitely going to try to impeach bread cabinet and President Trump\nBut you know what's interesting Curtis that if you look at you know Taylor Swift yes she is a millennial and I do think that her opinion does matter to many millennials around the country she definitely is it influence or I mean she's got it's like well it's a hundred and twelve million followers I mean that's a lot of weight\nBut as we saw from Bernie Sanders you know sometimes you get these huge rallies\nBut a lot of times the millennials don't get out to vote but I think she runs a risk in particular because she is a country star and I think even though she's a crossover artist you kinda look at her and you go wait a minute is she going to alienate because a lot of the country singer is I think that a lot of the ones\nThat you know you and I have talked to over the years and that we've interview that we've had even at our stage Seventeen and elsewhere Charlie Daniels you think about I think that kid rock was down there a national a number of those others most of them lean a little bit red white and blue conservative\nSo maybe she is also alienating some of her ... she's got to be a little careful I think when these you know celebrities Wade into politics\nWell let's go we go to Don in Long Island and welcome to Kurdish and really Cosby he uh WABC Donny yes said oh\nYes I got from Eric how are you guys doing what I'm doing well Donny\nYou know talking about what she don't know nothing I'm so sick and tired of the rich celebrities or or trying to be compassionate they don't really care about ... there there are a bunch of voting living behind the electrified fence is\nWalk around with their body guards I work for a public utility ... put them in the New York where I was and where you grow up for about three months they run like a scared rabbit if there is\nThat is true by the way and also I also think you know we I just want to hear them perform I like Taylor Swift I almost don't I don't want to know what kind of politics she has done I just want to hear her sing and perform\nExactly I like to see these celebrities go up there do you think and keep your mouth shock that's it\nNow does that apply to Kanye West she has been so supportive of the president of the United States Senate was taking a lot of flak for that in fact the president just acknowledge yesterday he's going to be having a lunch with Kanye West shown to talk about prison reform\nWell I'm a I'm a Trump supporter or even though I agree with ... the church and just keep politics out of the middle of it is also\nBut you're right John she may be there like two three days a year but she's not declaring Rhode Island is the primary residence their taxes to hide their New York\nCity the taxes are high so that's why she votes in Tennessee not because she spent any time in Tennessee\nI don't think she is really much consider to countries there any more than ... countries singers you sound like a little yuppie from Long Island\nYeah well I think a lot of people are not going to be happy with our politics John yeah but we're shaking her politics or business I guess\nA bit now nowadays everybody wants you to know what their politics as they were like a badge of courage but is that really going to move anybody in the midterm elections are so many millennials hipsters are just not motivated to do anything because they never would towards ...\nThey don't know about the importance of the vote they don't know about the positions he would be voting on it I'm not holding them responsible\nBecause they've been focused on other things we as a society we never mandated in school whether they went to private schools parochial schools ... public schools that they take up civic Senate leach note a rudimentary elements of how government works\nMany of them don't know that we don't know I think if I have you know they're very bright and do in cash and in other fields\nI think you're bringing you say hey let them we'll give you a free beer for every time you go to the voting booth then they'll come on out\nYeah yeah that a a free patch blue ribbon beer that would definitely get\n... bought operator and British and produce and definitely Christians detention up next we'll be talking about the guy who has been a limited Massachusetts a tax base expansion camp fed but they let him\nOut early in the need to be coming home to much sooner than expected\nGo to the
