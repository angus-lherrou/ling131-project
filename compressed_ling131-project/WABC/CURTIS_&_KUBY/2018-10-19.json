the Republican conservative don't forget to vote for among the reform party line that's the that's the party I'm the chairman of ah but I'm so\nFar and wide should I even bother to vote\nAnd mark Marlon are all dug in and started to attack him for being feckless and folding like a cheap camera and the prospect of debating him one on one\nOr the governor is penned up in a mansion on a hill that that we pay for a ... and you know this isn't a block or two away from here to talk about it I mean he won't agree to debate he barely won at a debate simply annex and he doesn't like being out in public he's divorced from the reality is New Yorkers face\nAnd then he went on to say mark mile an hour all of his opponent and revitalize crumble he has no desire to defend his record\nWho has no desire to have to defend his record was no desire to be questioned about his record his no willingness to answer to people\nAnd that is a continuation of what the line of thought is\nIs that Cuomo does not want to be on a stage with mark mile an hour oh being questioned about his age ... all of whom were his ... all of whom may have been found guilty on different levels of federal corruption\nMany of them who will soon be doing jail time led by his former did somebody teaches wartime constantly area and like like a job with cocoa who\nThe feds or the southern district set a judge gave him five years for bribery and then put cocoa went before the judge and ship a judge okay I did a bad thing but give me some of the bribery money a third of the bribery money\nAnd the judge turn around and said for that Mr Bush cocoa you want to get an extra year not only five years the defense but I'm going to give you an extra year for that what brazen is what role model what hurts but what can we all in what way bull\nBy the way I Would love to moderate that debate remember we did the debate of course with Donovan and Graham and that was fireworks boy would it be a great thing to be able to do the mall and our oh and also Cuomo there are so many things that I Would like the Cuomo like you said he sits in little egg shell Curtis he's protected\nWell if you know as you mentioned Dan Donovan who didn't win the primary against Mikey shoots Graham a heated debate in ... I was in the audience that you're very in high school on friday night a that was not televised show broadcast\nBut the Monday debate excuse me the Tuesday debate was Staten Island community college or our New York one unfortunately a lot of people won't get New York one because ... is a competitor I Know a lot of people have that as opposed to a charter are spectrum\nBut at least a voters had some access to looking at both candidates side by side debating one another when you consider in the state of Texas David Letterman is hey you have a lion Ted Cruz master debater taking on baked ill overall ... pretty good at himself a there\nAre in the bully pulpit as they took one another on on two separate occasions for the U.S Senate seat\nAnd it was a nationally televised because people say this is what politics should always be about debates debates debates\nAnd I'll tell you I think it's outrageous that Cuomo has so far not accepted it and it's like come on this is New York we deserve a debate if he just says okay listen I Need a third term\nFor it to us don't you think everybody he should debate at one eight hundred for eight nine to two to one eight hundred aid for eight nine to two too don't you think it should be mandatory\nThat Governor Cuomo and here's to a debate to explain to all of us why he should continue with office or not\nWas attitude is I'm so far ahead why should I take a chance this is sort of the equivalent of what you'll see Sunday from some of the NFL teams when they play and go and to prevent defense\nOr is a good strategy on Cuomo's part or you know getting stuck with no debates is that the result of good strategy one eight hundred eight for re WABC what's the goal though ... second ascent of money off on top of the ... the first war earlier today\nOn WCBS eight eighty finally suggested that maybe there's some room to move here in terms of debating mile an hour all\nI Am here you want to call me tomorrow I Will be here if you want to do it with Mr\nA mile an hour oh I Will be here if you want a moderate a discussion I Will be here but\nJust let me know because it's my daughter's parents weekend at college so you want to do it the same time same place on here but let me know otherwise you have to go see my daughter\nWhy hold on a second I Know what a joke or is this a lot here on\nOn WCBS and it stayed with her at twenty million people\nWe have about nine million of those people so the rest of the state gets completely shut out and most people in New York City and not going to be up on a Saturday morning at eight o'clock in the morning just to listen to not even be able to watch your debate between ... and mark my lawn Ira\nIt's outrageous I mean how and also to say okay we'll do it tomorrow that's like nobody watch nobody has time to prepare for the debate that is so unfair although red\nBlood that second king Cuomo ride decided that hey look at least some finally here ready to debate\nThey want to debate the idea of the ... ...\nThey don't want to actually debate\nOr my opponent who's now so eager to debate refused to debate in his primary the New York post that now believes debate or the bastion of democracy when the Republican candidate George Pataki was running against a speaker Valone\nA quality public servant from New York City uh Peter Valone a Pataki wouldn't debate and they didn't say a work\nNow on this one the first point of Andrew Cuomo he was wrong mark Marlon RO did not go through a primary to become the Republican nominee\nAnd there was no primary challenger see dead air defenses go rather than\nThem that was living in Maryland right on the ... uh well mainly a deep friendships go and the others did not get enough of twenty five percent or more in order to force your primary and violins yeah right they didn't want to do that\nAnd secondarily he is right though about attacking Valone he could have gone on to say and I remember it well in that very heated second campaign between my very ... change Rudy Giuliani and David Dinkins\nThat Rudy refused to debate David Dinkins in fact it was George Marlin one percent Marlene was put up on long or the conservative party you got one percent of the vote\nIf he had gotten two percent of the vote Giuliani would've lost thinking unfortunately would have been a curse on us for another four years\nBut even Romney chose not to debate and I was very disappointed with him at that point and say why don't you want to go to St Francis college downtown Brooklyn get up on that stage you kick Dinkins but well you know the media because George Marlin\n... and you know what also to at this point and and separate that in the primary issue what you're talking about Curtis um at this point I understand if you're Cuomo or you're somebody who's ahead us everything to lose by being in a debate but we the voters do our best\nI'll give you a a blast from the past ... former congressman veto for seller who used to hold the seat that ten dollar a minute hold on one out\nHe had fencing team count them feminine king debates\nAgainst his Democratic challenger I Believe the guy's name was Hamilton at that time\nSeventeen debates and\nCell or are there was no challenge he was no way he was going to lose that wage one eight hundred\nYou know what I got a good feeling and also after the story that you shared with us yesterday on the air about your buddies that you grow up with I gotta feeling that they will be afraid not to pay [laughter]\n... ... talk to shout each part of actually eliminate Jay enemies in a way in which they leave me high little if any evidence at all but anyway it's angel utilized call them all\nIn the uh since he's been covering it he has raised a total of one hundred million dollars in campaign cash it's unbelievable going for third term now do you think people were giving him the money because they believe conceptually in his ideology because his support of his Democratic agenda which at one point said\nI'm a Democrat conservative and now we might as well be like Bernie Sanders the optic aka a democratic socialist you know\nIt's because they're buying favors\nAnd he's providing them with babies can you imagine he's raised a hundred\nMillion dollar stretch one chance of the mega millions billion dollar jak price than I did not of you are going to win out the election ... except for me ... you keep thinking at you crazy and Gen our way and the rest of the suckers I mean a player shot they thinking that\nThis is how much I Love Nancy I'm going to throw

that's basically it he's a he's a thug\nAnd by the way Neal don't you think he should debate we've been talking to the fact that he has not willing to come on and\nOn Saturday Sunday or whatever I could care less but we should debate and the guy but\nI predict Neal let me look into it I'm ... now I predict he will choose a Saturday Night going into Sunday twelve midnight in Plattsburgh New York upstate New York on the border with Quebec\nOr any will do it on ... ... which I didn't know any still existed so you'd have to have a rabbit ears on top of the aerial that you have on the roof of\nYour house you mean with the little aluminum tends to get ... that's\nThe only way you'll ever get hide nor hear of that debate but just remember angel 'cause he he and his single fans do wish in

it's unconscionable one eight hundred eight for re WABC particularly the timing of it all\nWell that's the thing but he didn't say Hey Chris Yogi whereas rosy said oh speaking of ... case I Would love this this would be the president again that dream that's not care about Rosie O'Donnell a lot of people on the show her show no consequence lot of people on the left the resident of\nThe United states has the biggest microphone the biggest bully pulpit he's the leader of the free world these no longest\nCitizen Trump it's no longer citizen Trump getting into the ring and body slimy Vince McMahon no and yet again small dog barks big dog\nHas to entertain a crowd by talking about body slamming report is an ally make one eight hundred regulate for do does have it for the friars club and it's not as one eight hundred a full range WABC let's go to Martin who's calling from New Jersey Welcome to Kurdish that really caused me uh WABC Martin Martin\nHey I heard of sports was unconscionable you know you've turned it to who\nOh you do you think it's OK Martin\nTo get on a stage where the national forum where the guy who was a journalist just got whacked by the Saudis and then talk about body slamming and other journalists\nThat trade any snow ...\nHe's a tough guy is a tough guy right Martin I'm not a tough guy no no not you I'm Talking about the president and he's a tough guy by encouraging others to do that because that's really the code language that\nThat's ... ... we loved it yes I Want to I don't want you want reporters to be body slammed right\nHe's got here and type ...\nOkay so if they have a CNN Mike logo and they come up and they ask you a question that you feel is out of bounds that you know you don't want to address you should have the right to punch him out of body slam\nWell I don't care if either right or not I don't care about him right here I'm going to do it anyway\nOkay so you're encouraging that absolutely ... and you support Donald Trump right absolutely let's see what I'm saying and I'll bet you there are others out there who think exactly like you Martin\nMillions and millions and you're going to see it and next month\nYeah you'll be fighting in the streets right you on the ... are you on the right in the left is you just be having St Paul's been street battles right one\nNow first of all the Williams recovered themselves with math stuff they could never go up against starts and everything is just we're going to win the election that's coming up we're going to be a massive landslide bigger the presidential election\nSo after you win the election will you leave your reporters along you could you leave him alone and let them do their job\nWell you know the other day I tried to get through you asked about what would happen if you were a person who got stopped by those five people yes let me something I tried to call to cook it for\nI Would get I'm sixty years old I'm not one that I'm going to get out of my car open up the Trump take out a a pretty cool it was for the ... and I'm going to beat the pope out of them\nAll right but you would have declared in self defense dry 'cause you didn't throw the first blow\nA clear guy guy with\nOur okay well then you would have gone to jail because you wouldn't have had a leg to stand up but you wouldn't have started the tack you wouldn't know precipitated the attack would you Martin okay All right All right you're still there's still some civility within your the marrow of your bones\nHe's ready for WWE let's go to James from Long Island James your ear with Curtis and ready to go ahead James\nIt after them and make my point very simple the president of United States is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and the story how is it how is that James\nHe's using his office he is advocating from his office officially for the suppression of press freedoms and for the idea that people who don't agree with him should be silenced and in the end if necessary violently so\nPolite way way way James hang on one second you know his rhetoric we've all seen as rhetoric he he uses it at every event it's a rally he was making a joke you think he would like we're saying OK I'm really want a body slam every single one of 'em or he wants to cut their fingers off like a show good give me a break\nWhat I'm saying is I can quote what the man said and if I attached his by attributed his quotes of Iraq Obama and put it on Congress does that put her on Mitch McConnell that they didn't teach demand\nYeah but ... says wait a say in change you know on those supporter of Donald Trump wasn't it a Saturday mama who said they'll bring a knife will bring a gun to the fight\nI think the devil's in the details that do\nNot oh come on do you have your own hand you have all your artist Curtis way where you just said candidate Obama is right at the end of the United but yeah you\nDon't you think he was wrong for having said that\nYes yes he was ... it was all that's all I Want you to what you're talking about wait a second you're talking about what we are I Know a lot when I was the jobs wrong Dolly advocating you're talking about the difference between a rock show he\nGot into the white ways so he got into the White House and all of a sudden you want to beat him fired him and he never again would mention\nValues and you put more courage to put words in my mouth era or a couple of guys from the neighborhood I understand that but\nThe fact is that Obama when asked said yeah bring a gun to the fight forget that and I said the opposition\nAnd Andy separately from that James what about what's going on now with Maxine Waters all these people saying oh follow them around get them out get I mean the rhetoric on the left and these are people who are in office James earn our candidates they're in office I mean it's shameful on both sides on the upper ... may have raised\nWhere does that get no no no there's a difference between shameful and suppression of freedoms all these people all these people\nDon't wait a minute outing them down at a restaurant following Sarah Huckabee Sanders that's not Russian all\nOf these people are talking including you were talking about a citizen annoying as there is\nNo it's not as it ... it just as a member of Congress pro voting and and citizens are on ... and\nThen let the other members of the Congress bring charges against that congressman we have laws in this\nBy the way I can I say one thing James I actually think that that would be a good idea I think anyone has that kind of rhetoric money and that but that includes both sides\nShow I agree that shorter voting out all incumbents across the board and the short of getting everybody in Congress impeached and getting them out we're going to have to go out and change the way the laws operate in this country because you have a bunch of people in drenched in Washington who are attached to the idea of a hundred and Seventy five grand a year just as a big\nPlus the extra money that they make with the book deals in the appearances in the whatever and they just do it for thirty forty fifty\nAnd I I I'd like to point ... made some sense they're only ... the\nFormer president and met him first lady the Obamas what are you getting like fifty male\nOh yay can ching a ching catching on our\nNATO very skilled on both sides of the ah one eight hundred eight for a WABC Seventy seven\nOf all the way if you\nKnow I thought from Geico motorcycle he took Fifteen minutes to purchase the gas station eggs Charlotte [noise]\nEat
