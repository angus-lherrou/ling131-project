Post as the type of same sees book how's these hook [noise]\nTwo ways Democrats can remove Kavanaugh without impeaching him [noise]\nAnd he lives in a demented third world fantasy of some kind of [noise]\nWhere are you remove Supreme Court justices because you didn't like them\nOn American today hills says Democratic Congress Sunday future Democratic president can still removed cabinet from the Supreme Court if they wanted without impeaching him\nAre two ways they can do this they say a new Democratic president could nominate than the Senate were confirmed by majority vote a justice in this case Kevin out to a different post at an intermediate court say the DC circuit court of appeals where Kavanaugh formerly\nWorked for more than a decade where the perfect record before the vampires sunk third bloody chief and to him\nAnd uh so they have um demoted and they think they can do that that's the trick of some ... and then another he says the framers have be good behavior standard and he could be removed under the good behavior standard I think that would lead to impeachment\nUh these people are they're really insane they're uh they're dreaming about impeaching in fact Senator Dianne Feinstein whether Chinese secret agents on the staff for Twenty years who sat on the Christian Ford letter for six weeks and then abused her\nTo know what they're saying oh yeah if we win the Senate We're going to try to remove Kevin I really think that uh they want things to get even worse it's just so horrible group of people are terrible political party and I'm terribly sorry we're stuck with them [noise]\nNow they are the second country in the world and this is what has confused people people saw for sure oh no the Dutch\nThey had legalized marijuana no not as a country gets in the red light just trawling did not have legalized marijuana nor did Denmark or any of the Scandinavian countries not Norway of Finland and Sweden\nEurope way which actually the first country who would've thought your way in the heart of South America would have been the first country around the world to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and now candidate has followed and they can trust she emails going to be rolling in do soon said all world is watching\nSo the world is going to be watching us here in Canada to see how this works out of the rules work how people behave were just excited to be at the forefront of this and we really do see it as a as a global opportunity\nA and you can trust CEO should we have no idea how huge the sales will be\nA business perspective is no one's sure how big no one is sure how fast rules and regulations and how consumers they have and we'll react to that consumer and the consumer preference\nSo it's interesting Chris because we'll we now take a cue from Canada that eventual because of the borders and so forth the numbers one eight hundred eight for eight nine to two to one eight hundred eight for eight nine to two to one\nOf the problems is is that remember for years Americans should this before nine eleven before you didn't have to show identification\nIf they were crossing over the peace bridge from buffalo a into Niagara Falls Canada\nOr if they were taking the tunnel from uh Detroit to Windsor and you were at a checkpoint Charlie where the Canadian immigration officials were a dash and what is your purpose Sean division Canada desire to sneak in all the time I was not allowed to come into Ontario which shape Iran\nYou know all the batch or any of the Canadian beers and they just wave you through and that is just before nine eleven after nine eleven that changed dramatically but whether it's a main point of entry into the United states or vice versa into Canada where a lot of these rural\nOutpost what's gonna happen\nWhen all of a sudden you're crossing over in Minnesota and Wisconsin or Montana and North Dakota or even a a New York\nNew York think about like Niagara Falls thing about ... especially back and forth and people often see both sides you know\nWe know people are going to have legal marijuana from Canada they're going to be able to purchase it as American citizens already visited share\nWhat's gonna happen if they get pinched at the border let's say any any kind of a stop at the border by American officials that then leads to a church and then they find a you know announced a marijuana or maybe more is this mean American showed probably be ending up going straight to the scout\nAlthough I'd rather be you know whose Gallic in Canada and then go to the Saudi conflict or don't target remember you right [laughter] you know who ... ... but I feel rather be that's right and then American one then in the Turkish and you know in the country ... Saturday\nNight it's right yeah well I remember that one eight hundred eight for a WABC here was the countdown yesterday in eastern province the larger city Halifax as the first joints and first challenges marijuana was so legally through bend to stay\n\nThe first legal receipt I had less\nPeople wind up around the block\n... very happy framing of them do that that was funny it's like I you know forget the award already to oh here's my first joined legal\nDoing ... and he is one of the store owners and highly fact she was saying ... sales are going through the roof\nAnd we're going to keep opening the door so as soon as we can is the first African to move on to the second and third and fourth\nI think that we have enough information now certainly from other jurisdictions that have legalized like Colorado or Washington or where the demographics are fairly similar that we have some confidence that this is going to going to translate\nAnd then remember south of a border Mexico they ah basically legalized marijuana and they're talking about legalizing all drugs because they cannot control the narco terrorists\nMurders are at an all time high the narco terrorists have the military and the police and the corrupt officials on the wrong you imagine candidate to the north legalized marijuana Mexico to the south soon to have all legalize drugs that means everything Fenton all heroin and the whole nine yards\nThat to me is extremely dangerous Curtis when I hear that that to me is I think very dangerous I think the candidate I sort of moving where the trend is you know I had the shoes because the gateway drug and all that stuff but to think that you're going to say hey go already there are so many people going across\nThat hey you know I have a friend these three hundred pounds the government's paying for his hip replacement what does that money gross archery\nAlright but at the top dollar proceeds let let's deal with the reality in the streets if you get arrested for possession of dangerous narcotics you gonna do time that's going to cost us taxpayers a\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars a year no frills in addition to everything else you talk in more than two hundred thousand rehab is a lot cheaper Tom just from the point of view and it's better for the individual that maybe if they get off the Jones you can go back to leading a productive life\nYou know the citizen rate I used to wait for Japanese companies sharp you know do we citizen rate isn't Japan one percent because their presence on our country clubs they actually rehabilitate them they teach them everything from welding and I taught in a trade school as well\nThe evidence from from uh uh uh doing hair to doing welding so you make them productive members my brother worked at Rikers Island in the hospital they get over sixty five percent recidivism rate you know why because unlike Joe Arpaio we give these guys so much food my brother used to eat their lunch she said Tom\nWe buy sides obese someone's getting this a flame in your own it's crap\nThe AARP our prison system is that\nOh there's no doubt about it absolutely but I listen I agree with Tom there are a lot of abuse says to the system let's go to Brian in upstate New York oh welcome to Kurdish and really ... by ...\nQuick comment on Mexico maybe legalizing I Would say maybe an alternative what would it not legal but not criminalize drug like\nBrian to give up their basically what Curtis is saying is they're basically given up I think by saying and I understand lesson I've been down there in the border I've been in a Mexican prison where they were smoking crack cocaine in front of me so I get the the reality of what's going on down there\nBut I also know that you can't say okay too bad well let's just the solution is as legalize it and look to open the floodgates come on\nRight now legalized still make it illegal but not criminal\nWell why and look at the dilemma they ah now controlled by the narco terrorists and they have a murder rate that is horrific and their politicians are corrupt they can't stop from taking a a drug to knock on money\nRight but then you're opening the floodgates by allowing all of it and and it just in criminal ...\nCome up with any answers and obviously the United states where the number one uses drugs that's why the narco terrorists are able to operate in Mexico with impunity\nBecause what do you think most of the drugs shifting manufacturer may go harvest from the jungles go to and going to Mexicans are all Salvadorans Guatemalans Hondurans coming into America\nYup and get a wide and humor but also there are so many corrupt cops and you feel for the cops there because they were like hey I either you're with us or we're going to tell your family ...\nRight up all over America yellow much worse down there in Mexico I Know you could say it was much worse ... was pretty bad time in America ... or any way right now let's get our news

worked together you would absolutely be losing weight um because my cooking is so bad you'd be in the bathroom it would go in one day at all and end and go out the other let me on the show\nOr a ... year old black male from Betty Crocker because you can cook to kill exactly as you I got I take out food said thank\nGod I'm a New Yorker thank God anywhere else in the country I'd be dying but because I'm going to New York and we have such good takeout food I Am the black fellow tribesmen\nTo take out food in many instances will put the fat on your Iraq yeah I'm thinking that thing is key is to eat healthier it's hard to eat healthier take out but you can do it in New York I'm thinking of it in two ways and maybe there are people out there definitely want to weigh in on this because they may even be more expert than you are right one eight hundred eight\nFor re WABC that one eight hundred eight for a nine to two two\nSo if you are in a happy relationship out there do you feel you get a little complacent and I'm curious to is it different with the guys in the Gallup I think um you know you see and I think it actually does go both ways but I Do think there are guys once they get in a steady relationship they start\nPutting a little like pregnant pouch on you know about the ... where maybe they were a little more than that and taught and muscular when they're out to get you know on the day likewise\nWith women when they're single when there footloose and fancy free they may be going to the gym it may be watching their a physical look more so than they they do necessarily when\nThey have a partner but I Believe it's bifurcated this way you have a relationship it just had the studies now where forty percent of the overall population is now born out of wedlock and the United states that's all races all backgrounds all courage\nAnd I'm thinking that when people begin to live with one another or they live with one another with the idea they're going to get married or they live common law that the defining time when both parties gain massive weight\nIs if the woman becomes pregnant and I'll explain this woman becomes pregnant\nSuddenly out of nowhere months into the pregnancy she is eating foods that are so fattening that you are like mind blowing the combination\nThat you you have like the you're dying for the ice cream you're dying for the fatty and you know what and and what they said the worst times which in the way I was in the morning and the guy destitute because they're both up you know you\nWent out there you left out there whether it's through the deli or they are all night convenience store in order to find this list of items that just shady you fat fat fat fat let's\nSee the you know hurt if you got to have compassion because when Dallas are pregnant and I've had many friends I don't have children you know but I have many friends who had had a pregnancies and boy you rarely see you know I had some times and I've actually\nSeen guys go oh you do you really want that are you kidding me but you are eating for two or sometimes by reading for three\nI think what happens is after that first child is very difficult to get that fat off Iraq for many people both for the gal or the guy\nBut I only have compassion for the gal at that point come on you know combat\nBut what I'm saying is I think it's more towards the relationship when you really become sedentary when you're preparing to matched preparing to try to have your own\nFamily and you have that first child and then all of a sudden your metabolic needs a good ... to the core because you are now starting eating foods you normally wouldn't eat for instance once the kids are born and going up psych with Anthony my oldest son hunter or a car or my younger sons\nTheory and all these fast foods and they're eating all these cookies and these baked goods and sugary product which as you get older you got to stay away from it because they're in the house now ... temptation to you going to cover it as your your cookies and see a mellow Mars or whatever they call that stuff which is out\nThere now and [laughter] and it's all there and they can't tell me me me\n... and you you don't want to but then all of a sudden you start snacking on it right and I think both for the woman and the man they really begin to put that fat on Iraq until they have either a life threatening situation occur to them or does it break up you know a breakup makeup\nYeah then they gotta look good for the next to go rent but you know what the study says also curse the study actually says and they're talking more about uh people who are devastated without kids they say and this is interesting and I think everybody's kind of guilty of that you know when you're first dating you go out to restaurants you go try this you do that\nUm but they're also saying that what happens is you say okay well maybe I don't need to go to that party I'm going to stay home and watch Netflix I'm going to watch the movie and I'm going to sit and have popcorn and two bottles of wine as opposed to trying to take them out to a nice restaurant or a party or somewhere you say hey maybe it's fun staying home\nSo you're eating their sort of like you know it's a pregnancy binges but it's more of like\nWell as opposed to going out or trying some new adventure or travelling or doing something let's just stay home and watch movies he buttery popcorn and have the wine have the wind\nWhile he wouldn't have a daughter is your son ethical\nAnd Jay diet dot com and get that fat authorize exactly we're in blissful love\nWe don't we don't need anybody else we just need our Netflix in her buttered popcorn at two in the morning and the next thing you realize you have put on four pounds a year or so that one thing that's interesting Curtis of my first reaction though and this was I had a little bit and I'm curious guys and gals too because\nI think it varies from person to person because I think also when people are in stressful they say when people are in stressful relationship so they're trying to put on like a really good impression they're losing weight but I also know people who are in stressful situations\nWho start eating because I think women sometimes when they're in stressful they tend to eat when they're in stressful situations to just kind of grab stuff\nOr you're working late you're doing this you grab whatever fast and easy it's so I think everybody's different it's one eight hundred a for a ... to\nRelationships which I actually good for one party or the other party because the person\nIs somebody who gets up goes out jogging working out calisthenics I metrics maybe now the partner fields that whether it's a he or she they also likewise you know should be doing that I remember I had a great girlfriend there for a while she was into that jogging\nToo late for that I'm not charging after a chase people you know you meet somebody to\nChase the pocket but now they're going to be jogging around there\nWell as the Anthony and Joe away from the last go round if they were chasing after you then you would be running but but I Will say my my better half time he's very into like green drinks and healthy and that's been a good impact on me I did grow up in a healthy family but he's kind of rejuvenated my interest so that's a good\nOne eight hundred for a WABC let's go to Eric in my wall welcome to Kurdish that really caused the Eric\nGarner grits I mean like you're right about the thing where the people gain weight for different things uh my wife where I met her she was a hundred pounds a hundred and ten pounds and then when she got pregnant\nOr eventually you're going from one time we went up to ... and then one Colombia's a scrape away to the thing that's clear me five years ago but when she was pregnant and the craving and scrambled eggs and sunny side who are on the side\nOn our guard currently about ...\n... less than Eric I Hope you had compassion for because you said she's probably going to come on\nOur credit for the way you're going to be seeing that stuff I Want my own stuff and now I'm climbing on our way through twenty I got a few pounds\nYeah now that ... it's what uh I also went through you mentioned the pizza with the anchovies I Would have been eating the anchovies on the way home from picking it up from the nearby mom and pop pizzeria\nBut you start knocking on the foods that you're going out into the wee hours of the morning to get as a century catch the list is that your wife is demanding you see you never ate that crappy fall\nI say you're going to sound like you're not going to blame it on our because you have to go out and get well I guess like I got her pregnant boys come on\nUp in a camp and ... and the cop who\nWrote the I'm All right so Eric that just don't procreate because that's what the solution\nWell can you know I'm sixty six now in our own she's perfect but back then I might\nGo back and be All right yeah see six you're five ten to twenty you got to get that fat off your accurate but yeah I Know you've got to get it off at\nA uh put 'em on here I Want to get 'em on boy and I write hadn't J died at office records that average information to make yourself useful Christian\nThe key is I think not having the stuff in there but for you guys to be like oh my wife to death you know what you need to do that all ... of\nPregnancy the woman balloons up naturally and the\nPoor helpless man who had nothing to do with getting her pregnant all I had not\nThe guy is showing up all of a sudden he's doing deliveries food deliveries to his own house right like oh\nAnd we're supposed to feel bad for him guess why we got to carry on this big extra weight and we're supposed to do you go without doing delivery under so baby\nThen it's tough for both to lose weight afterwards after the wife gives birth it's tough for her as many women of acknowledge it as planned to do some guy who lose that extra weight they put on just running around getting these foods that were clearly fattening that they would never normally eat but a during pregnancy\nThe diet\nThirty
