tariffs\nOh please don't get it and he's absolutely right girl wimps that all the news media oh that's all that's going to lead the economic depression worldwide all of it was BS all of the sky is

today is red solo cup day I think that uh that Chris plant show today is right we should give away a gift pack of red solo cups or some Mitch McConnell on the floor a screw all those Democrats were

especially good for minorities in the city\nWell let's give you just an example of what's happening to minority students in the public school system is Renault program which was expected to benefit the grade average is both in math and reading and English\nAre dismal let me give you an example at the Fannie Lou Hamer school in the Bronx only twenty percent of the kids up profession in a proficient in English and mostly blacks and Hispanics\nAnd a poultry five percent and mass at PS one eleven in Queens predominantly black and Hispanic just twelve percent passed English less than eight percent past mass\nThat shocking number Curtis I mean we're too shocked when you saw these numbers can you imagine twelve percent English eight percent math that is like that is a great that's a gee that's not even have that's unbelievable\nI wasn't shocked because whether you went to the billionaire Mayor Bloomberg who pumped or millions of dollars into this failing public school system\nAnd he tried all kinds of strategies a he outsourced a to a strategy is coming in and re teaching the teacher's WFDD union to fail teachers\nYou know we go round and round and round naturally we blame the administrators we blame the teachers we blamed the structure we blame is nowhere conditioning we blame the fact that the water may be tainted in the water cause we blame everything other than the parents all parents or whoever it is that the guardian and the child is\nIt not properly preparing them to come and\nHave a normal day in school from nine to three in which they're going to achieve academic excellence so we spent millions and millions and millions of dollars to achieve this meantime if you happen to be a parent read it and you're aggressive about your ... let's say a let me take a a prototype\nA single mother you happen to be African American\nYou live in a district in which you're childish mental you have to go to the district school tough new gauge that each poor performing and the kids are learning how to read or write or do arithmetic\nAnd then you opt out and you say you know something I Want what's best for my child or children I'm going to sign up for a nearby charter school right in which is like an eight to one ratio of children accepted to those who just wait and wait and wait but I I don't know I'm going to hope that maybe my child and my children or\n... and the statistics that will come back from the same state issue test are amazing because you have fifty seven percent of African Americans in charter school who scored proficient in English compared to just thirty four percent in regular public schools in\nMath was fifty nine percent versus twenty five percent Hispanic kids should charges similarly blown away their regular school counterparts Hispanic students in the public schools so let's go to the potential as a whole himself comrade bill de Blasio who somehow justify\nThe fact that he will not expand charter schools he will not give them more more money he will not give them more leeway to get especially black and Hispanic schools into their whole ways so\nThat they also can improve with their reading writing and arithmetic\nWe know when the parents that some of the public schools that received charter schools coming in to them uh actually saw their programming diminished saw the dynamics for their kids diminished we we don't want that imbalance we don't want that on ...\nI mean that's crazy the numbers speak for themselves and and Curtis you know I don't have kids but if I did I Would be screaming mad right now\nDemanding that they get into a charter school and he's got the even Moskowitz and those people leading the charter school efforts\nI'd be right alongside her saying come on all kids deserve fairness especially minority kids in this city this is outrageous the numbers are so different and yet he refuses to because he's so close to the union here in New York City that is right\nMichel mogul uh he is the a puppet of Michael Moore cruel who is the head of the union of failed teachers and obviously hates charter schools with a passion\nBecause you know it's so funny 'cause every time I've interviewed Michael Moore grow a couple of times and I was asking the same question like what grade would you give bill de Blasio\nAnd you could tell part of them would like to give a certain grade but he's like oh I give him a ... you know sometimes you give them an MD never never guess what were the other day with a bowl vine organized for both feathers but he never gives them lower than to be but yet if you look at the numbers come on and\nMore importantly remember Michael ...\nWith by the parent at ... at all or guardians of course at home\nAnd yet you won't see any of the politicians who are elected officials point a finger at the parents\nOf course not they were re oh my God if we in special ed we have some ... or a rainy that's put on the ice tea once why why so many parents may trade a lot of the parents on route ... themselves and they just perpetuates\nAnd I'm I'm not putting anyone down but if a politician said some things like you said they would not be a very successful politician would it be voted off\nBut guess what they'd have better results so and and I thank God Bless you for everything you're doing because obviously you care about kids that's great\nBloomberg spent millions and we got nothing in return and all his college they got padded their pockets got padded because they were running the consulting firms in which these consultants were making hundreds of thousands of dollars instead\nOf ... up a little bit and say hey twenty you parents about preparing your kids even come to school I'm not I'm not going to waste of taxpayer money until you do your job is parents\nBut you never get to hear that you just heard from Isaac was the deal that was so interesting to hear because you're never going to hear them turning the parents in saying guess what happened you know how when they come to school you know hey got to be better they gotta they are actually playing the parents had for teacher right but you know foolish\nDishes you think parents who don't care about their kids and don't put it read their kids to come to school even bother to vote you think that twenty percent of those parents out there who don't even teach their kids to wash their hands wiped it took us with toilet paper brush your teeth are going to come out and vote\nSo when he wants slate of politicians Democrats and Republicans but

Seventeen\nLet's say wait a minute even though Kavanaugh said yeah I had a few little drinks remember he testified everybody he never blacked out he never did anything on toward towards a woman whether he was sober or\nHe just fell asleep where yeah ... yeah the equivalent for many who I've ever drunken shelves chained to sweeping of a blackout\nBut he ... he did not say I blacked out and that one and and legally you understand why he didn't go to work or to do because if he had said I blacked out\nThe next question for any Democrat on the committee would be well is it possible while you're blackout you cant remember that you did act so he had to say I never blacked out I just fell asleep I just fell asleep so now how much of his drinking really goes to his credibility because\nThe question is memories got the buddy mark judge us started talking to the FBI we know that in the last twenty four hours this is the guy who wrote the book called wasted and certainly had a lot of drinking problems himself\nAnd no no it really is a question of of two different stories is this the guy who had a little bit of beer and that's it and still likes beer by his own profession or is this a guy who was a bit of a boozy well this is what\nHis yell classmate had to say this is Chad lugging ten and he said that cabinet was not being truthful when he said\nYeah I never blacked out I never did anything on tour word he said\nThat Kavanaugh was a bit of a boom town\nIf you lied about his past actions on national television more especially while speaking under oath you for the United States Senate I Believe ... should have consequences\nAnd Chad flooding to settle a little more about stuff his drinking times with Brett Kavanaugh\nI can honestly say that in denying the possibility that he ever blacked out and drinking and in downplaying degree and frequency of drinking red has not pulled the truth\nAnd Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer says that goes to the heart of whether we can believe whatever Kavanaugh had said\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen we're looking at his credibility now grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford than judge Kavanaugh smock telling the truth\nSo how much does the drinking and do you believe that he just had a little bit to drink just fell asleep never blacked out that mattered beer\nBeer drinking and bar fighting guy Kavanaugh apparently was\nWell and now they're coming out there saying that uh Nineteen eighty five feet through ice at a bar or after you be forty concert um and that was reported again that that would I thought was interesting about that Curtis even though it was just throwing ice at a bar but that didn't apparently come out in the FBI background checks of him and that was\nYou know we have around because let's face it out now they're checking for belly button way back then they just do basically a top to bottom jak they're not really\nAt if there was a police check that is actually surprising because while he was worried at All right but the police were involved they were called there was uh\nA report so because of all of that it's interesting that didn't find them but does this even if you believe he was a ... you know that he's drinking more than ... and there may be but but does that matter it's one eight hundred for a nine to two to one eight hundred a for a nine lunch at\nThis moment to what the FBI I'm a study continuing to proceed towards friday and I don't know how they're going to wrap it up on friday\nAnd the latest is by the way right before we came there they were saying that um it will either go friday or according to Mitch McConnell he'd like it to be you know he'd like to be right now but it's either going to go friday or possibly go into Saturday barring some big revelation if\nYou if you're doing an investigation for a week and it started last friday that's friday the right way ends friday now it takes a little time to read it and because the Senate isn't shelves don't read anything as we've seen in the past they leave it to the staff\nBut you can bet they're also getting updates along the way listen this is not like it's in a tunnel a low level that you know a lot of adults because he's lived\nSo far every step of the way you know why again\nThere's really no modern program one thing for sure doesn't he sounds rotten will vote on judge Kavanaugh you are so bad on this floor this week\nDoes any sound drunk I mean the guy is always swimming and Kentucky bourbon he sounds frustrated because they are on a mission to move their shell ruined the last thing they want Curtis is it for it to extend beyond a week I think the never ending prime time don't\nWorry about it Kevin ... anybody but I think it's like jury nullification right now for some they've already made up their mind it's a hung jury on Kavanaugh which would mean who'd become the next United States Supreme Court judge 'cause the onus is really on Ford who\nThe onus is on four but they've opened the door to the other guy who was well also the onus is on actually the and the other one is interesting and the second one\nBut I thought was fascinating Curtis is the FBI actually interviewed the second one first because they went and asked who else was there and apparently she's given names this is the one rice said that he exposed ...\nIs like the acronym fix all repay a daily you have to fix or repair her memory loss daily because there are so many voice\nSo again right now we have a hung jury let's go to the phones cell one eight hundred aid for re WABC and it is I'm Mike who is calling from queens welcome to Kurdish every any Cosby uh WABC Mike Hi Mike\nHi Curtis Hi Rita okay listen I'm going to be honest I grew up in Jamaica estates queens guys and uh I I've been on every bar and I put kept many Delhi's in business\nWould you might have been put away by the way Mike I think we all have [laughter]\nUh you know I I still out as much as I used to but the you know on a football Sunday Curtis I'm good for about twenty twenty ...\nOh my God well away might go back\nTwenty you need to be here you can join judging Kevin as a crew oh my God that's a lot of booze\nWell you know if you spread it out you know it goes right for the night game it's noble you've got to work up to it so my point is I Know my dear right and I know ah you know I've been around drinkers and everything and\nI Am for Brett Kavanaugh to get in Supreme Court a conservative Republican or they are but the guidelines you know I think he's got the Curtis what happens when they drink too much you know to get a little ah the brain gets a little more she or something\nOn ... seemed like a smart guy J leg come on\nYou know all of a sudden a ... camera and they can't remember what they said an hour before\nBut he wasn't stuttering that's the thing like he is clearly a brilliant man on accomplishing ...\nWe're talking about when he drinking when he's drunk right Mike\nYeah 'cause you're making it sound like he did it yesterday I think he was I think he was a boozy party guy in way in a high school college now or you well I'm not ... well I in my in my driving it'd be it was just rang wanting to be used today he's the expert let my daddy's not honoring\nRate I've had many years of experience I I I consider myself a a an expert if you will\nYou sure sound like one\nAnd a old Brett Kavanaugh raw he likes to work at the elbows\nAll right so so we so Mike let me ask you since you are the experts in the air with twenty twenty two beers would you you're so you're saying that it still doesn't matter that he should still be Supreme Court justice right\nActually uh I hate to say it but no I'm ... and I'm certainly not blaming it for the cause of discretion I won't call them and this question just being a kid you know college and everything with drinking but I have to say they did expose him for not telling the truth and the next month and on one\nAnd a and he wasn't completely forthright about uh about his uh his uh there's a ...\nA drinking escapade so I Would say at this point no no\nYeah oh that's interesting and it's just coming from a man who's kidneys [laughter] lemonade pointed to\nThe day on game day yeah and there's a lot of game days that is why would I Do my jaw dropped twenty to twenty two oh not a lot of guys you\nHad a beer or two but I I I'm not a big beer drinking found he's got to have\nGreat let's go to Joseph who's calling from New Jersey Welcome to uh WABC Jews that I just have\nA higher there one guy listen the fixes in with this there's not enough time with the FBI investigation I heard on the radio that they wouldn't wasn't taking some of the ... the complaint somebody calls you\nKnow uh I feel the man is guilty if anybody set there like that that Christie for it and went through what she took the test the test and come back and tell me if they ... they think that she was lying why would somebody subject themselves that sit there all at while take a beating five hours and ...\nI agree Joseph I found her very credible I agree with you I still don't think she has proven if you're talking about from especially from like our criminal record that Kavanaugh did it\nYou know I'm tired of hearing from everyone oh I Believe something happened to a well if it wasn't Kavanaugh and I believe her at this moment and they can prove it wasn't Kavanaugh\nWill we how you've got to go to jail while because she had absolutely no evidence whatsoever\nThat area does it mean that she's lying you know you can't prove that\nTo know the truth is the truth\nOh has yet and it was a lot of that going on which a lot of sexual oh my God what\nThat means that if you went to school\nNo doesn't mean everybody who goes to those schools do it but we should\nAll really so but you don't even know what to do it\nOh no I'm looking at him for ... well let me let me punch holes in his story you believe he was a virgin to graduate school rich no\nOkay he trained at first she was a choir boy never mentioned that he was drinking beer when it was brought up about his buddy he never said yeah yeah we used to go out and we used to knock back a few acted like he was a total\nWhy a boy so there are holes in his story too rich\n[noise] yeah but because the guy said he didn't go out and have some direct\nWell no no we show right now let me I which led the FBI\nDo its job Letterman to everyone let them let them just report and then we'll read all of their information they don't come to a conclusion I agree\nWith you will you accept what they say\nYes any more importantly if there is nothing to substantiate why I Believe is true of what a fortunate that I Would then suggests after all it is and you indicated him a hundred percent you need to do some jail time so this doesn't happen to anybody else in the future\nYou're changing your tune you will or a hundred percent for the last few days right yeah ... how can you say\nHe pointed to hey I agree with what I enjoy what something happen\nHard then don't say a budget cuts I yes but but she could also believe that a hundred percent but not prevent a lot of these sexual assault I'm not going I don't I think there are huge holes in your own you know how many like but how many sexual assaults and rape you don't have the black guy should yeah why Gail\nBecause somebody was sure it was the black well pointed about and it turned out it wasn't M.\nB. but listen I'm the first one who said that there were questions and her story here not you know I'm Glad I I agree you are not willing to say she should do try you know if he's wrong it is she is wrong we can prove she's wrong and he lied\nThen throw their hat or improving throws a bite out early interviewing everyone that she has talked about extensively let the FBI do pride in there if they come up with nothing then she objects ... the problem is in this case\nThese were sort of makeshift parties it's not like it was like the huge plant party she's not saying I'd be curious I Want to see what mark judge said I Wish we could see more of a friendship that I had\nA friend said she believes show now but she has no knowledge of what transpired in that\nHouse like because it was a small party and the girls that

you're just like a millisecond never gave you the benefit of the doubt and is that where they really want to be a lab and drive them around and\nTalk to folks out there who got clipped by the red light cameras no matter where\nYou are one eight hundred aid for re WABC that's one eight hundred aid for a nine to two two then we go out to Suffolk County where they put into effect red light cameras because obviously they want to raise revenue but they claim that it would make for say for driving conditions in people's\nSlowing down and all of a sudden out of nowhere a red light Robin Hood emerge an average everyday businessmen Steven Ruth who took it upon himself to cut wires in red light cameras all throughout Suffolk County\nAnd when he was eventually caught and brought to court in Riverhead which is the judicial district there he had this to say about to trick knowledge e a red light cameras\nWere not going to put up with short yellow light trickery for revenue too many people have already gotten killed\nAnd he said I'm only trying to save lives\nYou realize what you're doing is a crime even they call it a crime I close saving lives I never heard from my actions I Believe in what I'm doing it I'm always trying to save lives\nAnd he continues to brag about it and boast about it on YouTube and any then why you decided to break the law and vandalizing cut the wires on the red light cameras in Suffolk County a few years ago\nWill after so many speeches in front of the legislature and I'm turning a blind eye to it over and over and me telling them that I'm going to hold them accountable for serious injuries and deaths and this seems like the only way to get attention to the issue [noise] so that's why I did it and I'm not afraid to go to jail if I see one life is worth it\nSo he doesn't they're cutting off on a tour of this it's like ... and the data no cutting wires and he did the judge basically said he should pay eighty five thousand in restitution and I agree you can't go around down on camera beyond room\nWas packed of his supporters his supporters gave him a standing ovation they did\nBut he says you can't go around cutting cameras that are ... and I realized\nThat I applaud guy because it's just a rip off of the tax evasion one of the most heavily tax counties in America Suffolk County and then there's Nassau County and all\nWhat they're doing in Nassau County ladies and gentlemen if you've been out Long Island and you're being clip by those red light cameras we want to hear from you or if you were involved in monitoring drivers\nCome on you and him and he won't give\nYou an at an image that you could tell us how bad it is in terms of the revenue raising and how bad it is for the drivers who won knowingly just end up going through these costs sections\nBut she can't be doing that see I think and what the key is is this Republican said simply meant a lot of people are saying that the cameras put such an undue onus on the ones who are like a millisecond or a second late I think those people they need to fix that camera where they said do you give them border you know you give enough and you know second tier second there it's\nThe people who are running through them back\nWhile she'll be out there Republicans ... county is you need to have signage installed within two hundred feet of the cameras warning everyone ... signs that there's a red light camera or any you know that you're going to be running into\nI don't get on there I think that's fair I go beyond that because Nassau County is probably one of the most corrupt counties in America it raises the ... most revenue and yet it's bankrupt that tells you something right in and they have feather better jobs and nepotism\nYou live a U.S he said OK to run through Laos that's not going to come on you know why I agree\nWith the Republicans in fact I'm going to be with Steve Levy the former Suffolk\nCounty ... tonight in farming dealt with a reform party managed without ... and I'm going to suggest\nThat because of all the feather betting and creating a visa no show John you actually use relatives politicians hire\nFor road work and you put them out there and they are the flag people five hundred feet from the red light cameras you know with the orange fluorescent vets a vast going red light camera red light cameras so everyone is forced to slow down\nRight but the problem with that and and that's why I actually had sometimes even mixed views on you you're not supposed to go through a red light and how we all gone to read like I've gone through red lights I certainly I told you have a lead foot nice speed sometimes and I know that that's not good but\nI also feel like they didn't get the whole point because then you do okay in the area you know that in that area we slow down but everywhere else we want to do but they claim it's\nFor safety reasons vehicular safety reasons when there were more fender benders because all of a sudden people are stopping quickly\nOur number one eight hundred eight foray WABC let's go to ... who's calling first and foremost from New Jersey Welcome to WABC will and I really am\nHere's what they're doing now would replace a red light cameras there putting cameras up in locations and turning them into no parking zone or practice there or something like that\nThey'll monitor their God somebody's watching it your for your call up their village where you're from a couple of weeks later I was ... weeks ago or two or three weeks ago picked\nUp a guide to the train station waiting are old enough to get my car literally ... seconds ... seconds whatever it is I get a ticket for being an attack on you know several we just\nGot the other day no Elia how ... how much were they clipping you for every forty five bucks forty five bucks a wake up one passenger in New Jersey transit\nStricter but they have a guy monitoring the cameras that he'll go back and monitor videotape and pull up there for any reason jerk it with a ticket in your court for a second you're\nNow let me let me ask you were away and did your passenger offered to split the ticket or pay the ticket and\nI didn't tell them about it but that you know Rome where it was big on a red light beer\nWell just like nor I tell you what I'll bet you the guy who was hired to look at the videotape\nHas your quota a quota to impose on suckers yeah I'm sure a because that's the way they view taxpayers lets see if we can milk um other ways let's go to Joe and ... and welcome to Kurdish and really caused me on WABC Jeff Hi Joe\nGood afternoon salt so here's here's my take on a ... I live in a town in Madison County and uh they installed red light cameras that are real busy intersection and just will will now stop light where they used to go through\nAnd where people yelling springtime about a red light camera or giving you a ticket they don't say anything while actually that no one police officer falls them over and says they went through a red light they argue with the top people bought one of the cold anymore than doing anything wrong\nI as a joke but the problem is the problem is with these red light cameras I agree with you listen I think it's so dangerous when people go through a red light and and I've I've done it I you know I think every driver who's gotten behind the wheel is done it unfortunately it's a terrible thing the problem is\nYou know okay it's like a it's like you know that you're going to get pulled over there so\nThen you slow down maybe we know okay with even if you do a big blaring sign or the guy holding the the lights are whenever you avoid that area you slow down there but then the other three that aren't monitored you go through it\nAll but that's that's also a possibility ... only makes the case more before the red light cameras ever have to have an awful lot less\nAt every intersection yes\nJoe you were living in ... county in America and you ... you want this hidden tax implement did they you know your corrupt officials\nRipple effect across somebody who does something wrong oh FYE into anything\nMade instead of making me tell you pay more taxes they get the bulk from people that knew something wrong\nAnd Joe do you actually think because of this going to roll back the taxes in Nassau County bore you are a soccer they never rolled back taxes anywhere\nThey're not but it doesn't mean you give the people a free pass if they're ... every intersection Janet Hyde Park welcome to Kurdish and read it caused me uh WABC Jen Jen\nHi guys good afternoon I unfortunately a couple of different scenarios I've experienced I just became and don't get five are driving more obviously I'm running into certain situations that it just before I'm\nFirst generation was I was heading I'm off to clear the expressway on the hillside avenue I was in the right man um it was crowded I proceeded to go what this is more about a cop than really a red light but I was going straight\nAnd I didn't stay in the end of the ... the lane that there was a hour that that said right turn out early\nSo I put seen it straight because there was nothing else I could do\nAnd then what happened that pulled over by the ... um I said what do I do he said oh you went straight darn right parenting and your ... and a device I said what the vice because I'm wearing a camera around my neck right here\n[laughter] you're supposed to see the around isn't that\nHow much how much did you get clipped voyage\nThat's a a hundred and thirty eight dollars an hour job you know how ... I didn't see anything that they signed I signed on the left\nLane I said I'm three late overnight he goes well when you're driving it starts to be looking all around\nGiant that is what you call the quota trap that cop obviously was on call to duty yeah no question come one thirty eight legs oh let's go to Tony calling from Long Island welcome to Kurdish and really Cosby he uh WABC tone high tone\nYeah are you doing I'm I live in Suffolk County around and I'm not here and I don't make it a habit of blowing through red lights but every once in a while you get caught\nSo after my lawyers opinion and my wife was either a mound do lake road is very aggressive excellent ... a civil attorney for a personal injury and I'm David reminds me of the Supreme Court order\nFor the inspiration plans to the red light cameras as well as the plans for traffic signals to be released to us and uh the camera company in accounting we're really trying to get that charge\nNow he hates even let me ask you because as part of the probation the assistant da ... said you should pay eighty five thousand dollars in restitution for cutting their cameras you're not advocating for people to kind of
