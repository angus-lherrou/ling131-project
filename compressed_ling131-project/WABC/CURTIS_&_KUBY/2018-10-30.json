the urge to merge in the in between what then becomes of that baby\nEqual wall it's also\nA quarter of those little dicey slice and dice that the ... if you think about it if you're on the pathway here not actually say that you're not a citizen yet so technically youth hall and get your country's your home\nOr you know but you you do realize you're it is the parents will be taking the citizenship test they will be a become citizens and the child who is still in my second grade will have to eventually take their own citizenship tests because the parents citizenship doesnt suddenly transfer to the child\nYeah there are so many issues there let's go to Danny from Rockland Danny you're here with Curtis and read it go ahead Danny\nCurtis how long you guys doing today we're good what are we gave us the lowdown on your end\nThis thing here with the babies there was just a plain theater Rockland County about two three weeks ago they rated because the fact that women coming over here having that they that this house and then there were taking the baby's been living in the United states and the baby was born here\nPeople were making money oh yeah making money in Rockland County somebody's house haven't they haven't\nHey Danny let me ask you know just how much do you have any idea like what they were paying for this uh service you know\nThis was on the news of Tehran files one it was on the news\nI remember seeing that by the way and and ... you know they pay big ...\nDanny Danny Danny\nI Know you a long time from the guardian angels on universe yet you I go to subway what you write a blue uniform on\nAll right but Danny Danny back to the subject at hand I appreciate the memories but\nThe politicians know this goes on and they do nothing the president does nothing about it the Democrats and Republicans do nothing about it because the red Chinese come over with a lot of money in fact they were ready to buy their citizenship they'll put up five hundred thousand a million dollars\nOr to have interest in a business and they get an instant pathway to citizenship Danny so you see as long as you got money they look the other way but if\nYou're paying your slumping across the border all of a sudden they want a double standard or do you pop a baby out your baby is not a citizen but if you're read Chinese national and you come here to America and we all know that we know what you're doing\nWhat you pay a soft that's okay we looked the other way but it's not just the Chinese so my dad had it and now they do a lot on the ...\nAnd also big money too but there's a lot of nationalities that do that sadly you know let's go to Dominic from Brooklyn Dominic you're here with reading Curtis go ahead I'm\nYeah I I agree with the president or a bad anchor babies are first of all these people who come here illegally them illegally are illegal\nAnd the children are these people are illegal also because I'm not sure the sins of the United states they are citizens of the country that they came from and their children are so because of the country that they can\nGo case so I asked you didn't question as I as the previous caller what happens if you're here for five years you've already earned your green card you have a family families tend to have children\nNow what happens to that child your four or five years in the country you're on your way to becoming a citizen you have a green card watched that is that your child have upon their birth\nThat child has no status in the United states because he's still a citizen of the country at their parents\nDo they not he's not a citizen or her mother said instead\nOf ... states because his parents came here illegally\nAre not only in touch up ... ... I realized who just want to go after Mexicans crossing the border illegal but I'm Talking about people who follow the rules they have a green card\nWhich means they're not a citizen five years in today's stay because sometimes it takes ten years they have a child which is normal what happens to the child or they a citizen or they're not as citizen\nWrote that has to be left up to the court\nA machine or are they going to play Solomon\nBut that's the issue now and I just wanted to say because we have so many there even Republicans like Bob ... by the way it's going to be on her show tomorrow a Republican who was running for governor I mean for Senate rather in New Jersey\nAnd he's of course in that race with Menendez he came out he actually just wait it out a little bit ago saying that the president's wrong on birthright citizenship that we need compassionate comprehensive immigration immigration reform\nThere are a number of people who feel that just what you're talking about criticizing people who come here go through the process that that is different than the quote baby factory\nThe anchor baby and I I agree I think we have to separate the two and you wonder why the president's coming up with this right before the midterm\nLet's go to Bobby in Brooklyn welcome to Kurdish and really caused me Bobby\nBut is that on a I have an apartment it's sunny island Florida\nOr Russians in the building they have upon them set up that the girls coming and they all ready to pop on the beach in the afternoon there's at least ten woman that\nYoung girls ready to have the babies they stay awake until one that God and then no one's come to the walk and that's been going on badly seven eight years\nAnd Bobby that's exactly the the kind of people that I Believe as you're saying do not deserve to be us citizens and get our rights I ... I I'm with you on that one\nBobby but uh you're elected officials know that's going on Bobby\nWell what I'm saying it isn't just brown babies from that\nAnd several Bobbie Bobbie I'm asking you a question your local officials there and know what's going on Democrats and Republicans how come they haven't done anything to stop it\nOf course why\nBecause they didn't agree with the rule balls come up Bobby connected dots\nOr hikers how're you doing I read it um [noise] my question is is is the mother and father are not citizens and the baby rather than can get nutritional benefits and medical benefits there's\nBeen a nutritional one you\nSound like it better they get a nutritional law expert nutritional benefits\nRick ...\nYeah no I don't know I Know exactly what it is but you know it's a it's kind of strange lingo for ah for people\nThey can get they can get formula and they can't get medical care if they are completely illegal and they had no status they'll just go to an emergency room hospital now if I did but if they're climbing the ladder and they have a green card obviously they qualify for benefit\nFormulas very expensive oh yeah and you know near the daily news for me to grow up with a strong\nWell hey listen Douglas that that's part of the issue is that the president saying it's not necessarily targeting babies but he's saying all these things are expenses\nOn the U.S up to me to go now what did what parents New Years ago when there was no formula huh\nI don't know\nWhat do you mean you don't know you didn't grow up ball as a formula baby created but now Darwin\nRight and if ... if a woman cannot breastfeed right why does it immediately have to be formula\nThink about that if it was up to me right I Would just makes it a little\nBit of the old fashioned a dairy would milk Elmore milk with a little bit of water and say hey did you go is good enough for us is good enough for you accept\nYour the one who ... you're the one who let your kids the James ... but you're the one who said hey kids play and listen\nYou're right the old days we've gotten so like oh it has to be a certain brand of that has to be a death but all these things his point is all these things are big expenses on the American economy and that's exactly what the president's talking about let's go to Rob from oyster bay Rob you're here with Curtis and read a go ahead Rob\nGood morning or you don't want to talk about the um the Greek heart parents or green card holder and you know what what what is the child how about\nIf you have a status you're waiting for as parents why can't the child status to so if the parents are in trouble or anything but it's become says\nWell I agree with you Rob I agree with your body but that's not the way it does it now you understand that right\nYes I understand that but you know what this is the only way to stop a drain on the economy I'm not saying it's just from from everywhere you know they just drop into the country some of the country and I have to\nDrive but Rob Rob I notice in all of your statement share you didn't mention anything about the rich who come into our country pop their babies out so that it can get citizenship ... politician\nYeah no that's what you said some fly anthem that but I'm Talking about those that pay off the politicians because Rob our politicians have known of this going on\nFor years and no Republican and no Democrat has done anything about it or spoken about the Chinese nationals the Russians and others who do this on a regular basis not once not once but they'll go after the match against popping out babies as they walk across the board it\nHow about going after all of them huh let's get our news headlines\n\nDegrees and sunny on robbed Austin with the stories
