I mean\nIt's clear the FBI is focused on his ... now and there'll be focused on his high school days ... was the bulk of the focus shove based on forge allegations won\nA woman they don't seem at all to be interested in and I think that's really due to the interference or the president and his hate about the ...\nYeah I was going to say this is the attorney for a Stormy Daniels ready you see that he's representing advisers and her allegation was so severe yeah bitterness\nCheating implicate him in a gang rape she just said he was in the uh he was in proximity yeah he what these guys were doing present wife raising us leash question her or anyone she might guide you to\n... she's not ever claiming that he sexually assaulted anybody off physically mishandled any female unlike ... she claimed that he pulled out his private party and when you waving her naturally forward and said that he tried to sexually assault\nBy the way they had the interview doubt Ramirez too and the last twenty four forty eight hours they had the interview that is the second accuser who you talked about the alligators you point you know if they don't\nInterview on each client I agreed ally of all people it's going to go hey wait a minute you know every\nWedding well let's say why didn't you interview her to hers was the least damaging of charges anyway let's go to the phones it's Jesse calling from Brooklyn welcome to Kurdish that really caused me on WABC Jess I guess\nYeah I got this and among those from when I was younger and I'm I'm about ten years older than a cab no when I was younger I'd enjoy myself a beer or go to a party or something like that out and drink all that much\nEvery now and then maybe I have one too many maybe I made bad they're like stumble a little bit does that mean they're ruining the rest of my lot\nHey Jesse let me ask you did you ever tried to sexually assault somebody\nNo I never did something like\nThat okay cause that understanding is that the allegations\nNow saying something about that look at look we can't we're not allowed to say anything about her nothing\nOh yeah I don't know what I mean you know you're not in the high law\nYou can't say anything when scrubs\nA high school a book was took a from a clinical psychologist\nAnd took that was John oil and there are ... feet down low for you is not known for sale or you know you hear that stuff I can see it I had the\nPlease don't say that she asked for it because I Do think she suffered some from outside to Jesse Daniels says yes he is but you get these\nPoint if you go back and everybody everybody has parties they went to I mean I think to to put his drinking under the microscope is not fair and if they can clear around I think the lesson that I think he's going to have\nSmooth sailing in the Senate let's go to Steve who's calling from queens welcome the Kurdish every ... WABC save\nThank you very much you know this this drug is fully aware of the consequences\nOf sworn testimony under oath and it just seems to me too convenient that his daughter would say that let's pray for the ... are produced witness against him it just you know he could have backed off of it not made that statement because I simply don't believe that and if I don't believe this you could you could dish we got a lot of other places\nThough on the road for\nHe's earned Russian no no no no he's a Christian so what seems to me but that's not what is that after I had a little more problem with the drinking then the prayer part yeah way on that on\nTop of the drinking you could\nSee what do we really believe it's ten year old daughter came up to him and said oh do you say your prayers for her dead body and you know anybody who's saying he wrote the whole speech and never ran it by the White House\nCurtis do you think that the daughter had a dark boredom was throwing darts at a picture of a a learn\nAnything nice about this woman are you kidding yeah they're going to they're all going to sit down and pray he's\nA Christian that's what Chris you don't you're not a Christian shots were Christians do my friends\nAnd Christian older that Muslims don't do that you don't do that many I guess I only ... and the only people who don't forgive people according to your atheist right\nNow many people forget they don't they get to but I don't think it's so out of character for someone with his faith to do what I said how do we know what's fake this guy had you don't think he has anything watch\nFake said what does he like a Bill Clinton a moment he gets into trouble he's going to grab onto a Bible and all of a sudden he has faith as opposed to being faithful is we don't know much about this guy's face and say I\nThink he is a faithful man I Do think he was a party boy in college but I think there are now\nNo ten year old girls or boys are going to go up to the WWE and said can we can we prayed for the person wants to destroy your live on ... on your could let me get outta\nHere with the Christians let's go to pat in the Bronx welcome to Kurdish really caused me uh WABC pet\nHey guys how you doing correct me if I'm wrong but I Do recall kept saying that if you did drink too much sleep fine line between the swing of locking out he would not be blocked out nobody else would not be blackouts\nNow I Do and by the way pat you are so funny I noticed that that like he did and it was interesting how\nThe members of Congress were focused on that the senators were absolutely focus because you know where they're going they're going is it possible that something happened that you don't realize and hearing that that's exactly what they were trying to translate into when he was sort of you know damned if you do damned if you don't if he left any grey area they would have seeds on it too\nAnd I'm Glad Claire distant raise\nYeah yeah I I he fell asleep what's the difference between falling asleep and blacking out writers in addition you\nKnow but from a legal or not at all I Am not sure why he did that\nOh no I understand that but that's why I didn't believe anything this cat on was saying\nIt was all parts it was all prepared it was all men to save his one opportunity to get on the United States Supreme court let's go to Peter who's calling from Brooklyn welcome to Kurdish and really caused me he uh WABC Peter Hi Peter\nHey guys have two quick points out one one I wanted to ask a carrot\nIs that your your opinion or you know I mean of course we are everyone thinks it would be a good idea to interview everybody but um if if you if you guys don't don't you have to file criminal charges against or\nFor the fact that ah she she was the only adult in the in the proximity of these crimes and and and you know why did she go back\nMore than ten times it really that that was truly what was happening there and before you attack at one point\nThe other thing I wanted to say as a you know and I didn't hear this from very many media outlets during this process you know even afford herself said that after she was apparently attempted rape or her allegation\nShe saw a mark judge at his job a like a couple of weeks later went up to him and said hello\nYeah at the same way that that makes sense\nYeah money in the media does to me it does remember\nHe he made hungry did us a little equate but you know because he knew I was going to cost you yeah yeah yeah in New Orleans and up to it but you think it did make see I thought it was a little weird that she went over to him but people do odd things and she said he looked PC white when he saw\nNot only that remember she wasn't accusing him of sexual assault\nWhich he was accusing him of basically turning a blind eye and laugh they said if not for him breaking it up but I don't being on the bed twice not intentionally what's it like he went to help her to break it up Curtis\nThe way they were brought up they they will do that because I see it with my grandkids and\nOther alright Sandia Alex chef that on your part I Will do it on the cab well\nI think he probably does that I don't know if he did it that day 'cause he boy was he fired up that day Curtis I think as a rule they probably pray as a family I see that but boy was he fired\nOn any drinking water he was\nSniffling weird by the way that has been talk\nAbout that and that to me was so distracting I found that just really weird the sniffling and the ...\nAnd in fact I Want to play a little bit of Saturday Night probably took a few too many Sudafed yeah when it ... years old Saturday Night live because Matt Damon I thought no perfect Brett Kavanaugh with the aspects cause you and I when we were watching it it was like you could hear the ...\nAnd the grabbing water like the Marco Rubio which is a nervous habit but I thought Matt Damon on Saturday Night live had an affair it as he had them down pat\nMe tell you that I'm gonna start at an eleven\nMonth that can do about the room [laughter]\nTaking to the anger and he went on and also talked about the booze and here's Matt Damon\nAnd usually an optimist [noise] I'm a ... kind of guy\n[laughter] I'm like a full everybody is talking about the whole thing and the anger and Chris Coons at a number of others that you know that that anger actually that sort of mad part which doesn't fit with what we're talking about with a Christian side\nUm but then it show somebody who feels that they have to stand up for themselves you would like milk toast when he was with more than a column he had to fight a lot of people are saying that that showed an angry sign I don't think that's where I'd be angry if I was falsely accused\nThe ab and then he started bringing up the Clintons and everything else saying to myself a judge chill out man just focus on what is happening here don't turn this into\nSome kind of a global controversy involving yourself let's go to Barbara calling from Rockland County welcome to Kurdish and really country here WABC Bob\nHi Rita and Curtis\nCommon fact that mark judge wrote a book saying he worked at Safeway so her man hating lawyer they did their homework and I don't believe anything Dr Ford said it all calculated there's no hard concrete evidence\nWell right and Barbara by the way right now you're absolutely right and that may turn out to be the deal at the end of all of this at the end of the week it may just be this generic testimony from other people that says I don't recall and it may just be her who can't say how she got there how she laughed at Safeway\nThing come on he has a book out loosely based on his life and he said that he worked in say like\nWell and and also going wasted Barbary forgot titled why would they volunteered that I mean that\nThey're trying to pinpoint credibility because he had not see the fake and from\nWhat we know she lived in the area we know all the guys who lived in the area she you'd have to say oh he was working at Safeway in order to prove that he living in the air and\nThey didn't have a lot of credible evidence so they're trying to put on this than that\nSo you think they ... they weaned from his book and that they have credible\nDid find I found her do riveting and I do feel she went through something I I'm not sure she hating\nLawyer and all that lawyers past when we when me and my friends get on the Internet we find out that lady the hater\nMel I don't know about that but she's definitely a Democrat there's no question about that and that is enough to make it you know you can get you to get all that\nOn on the Internet you can find out at a person's life whether they've been a ...\nWoman she's definitely a Democrat and that is that no no no but very active oil you know actually me and independent well you can't be a Democrat or Republican raises they made it raises the spectrum of motive for for the
