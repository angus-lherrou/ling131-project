Brazil Brasilia who had taken over for Debbie Wasserman at the Democratic national convention when Debbie resigned or when she was involved in a controversy after controversy\nI I could buy that but the fact that Brazil is I'm not one of the\nTargeted individual in that one of those are generally hates the most of the nice scale it wasn't as she was kind of pushed into it you know\nLet's go to a show move I Believe uh who's calling from bay ridge uses Seamus so shallow shame is not shoving will hit the cruise cruise he's worried that ... who is\nCalling and oh no no I I Believe that it's a a radical insane Bernie Sanders supporter that's there's better and the reason why is if you look at all the targets\nMany were old players in pushy and getting very out of getting the Democratic nomination and Bernie Sanders did not receive any pocket\nYou wait wait wait how do you explain Robert De Niro and try back I had I don't really know you I really didn't like Trump but I don't think he was anti burning\nBut he was a huge Hillary supporter flowed a lotta money Hollywood, Florida a lot of money to a bill or you're not burning\nWell whoever it is and listen by the way Bernie Sanders sadly remember that whole thing that happened at the ah the shooting at the baseball field with I'm Steve ... last year Curtis I mean that was crazy and that was a Bernie than certainly not tied to burning himself but a Bernie than the endless extremists on both sides for sure\nThat's right crazy guy from southern Illinois I drove all the way to DC started tapping shots on that softball field one eight hundred eight for eight W.

I'm\nNot a weapon jets wrote a my gut reaction would say that China give me an ex lax attack I'm not going to let him do it and bringing it outside\nBut I think that the person that open that ... in our okay\nOh wait wait wait so you think Edward it was an inside job and the Soros Idaho\nHe he knew about it okay was warned about it on a call ...\n... why would I mean ... percent on the right to do this at this point just before\n... sane people there are insane people on both sides that we just saw that with that defined the Proud Boys battling in the streets of New York city\nI mean that's insanity and know what the NYPD right there with video cameras everywhere in the rest in a Proud Boys every other day that's insanity and what so what do you mean of course has seen person on the left and the right wouldn't do it but there are a lot of insane people on both sides\n[noise] well I think the same person would be in Santa pickup truck in which like farm and\nWell and I sort of like a like a security type person because like you know Secret Service guys do that they move it out if something happened you're not going to keep the bomb in the White House you're going to bring it outside and if you're protecting a guy like George Soros that could happen let's go to Cheryl from New Jersey Sheryl you're here with Curtis in Rita\nBank yeah Cheryl what do you think okay for a while and I haven't heard anybody say\nWell we don't know if there than teeth I mean they've had some pretty crazy rhetoric but to go to that\nOur our ... you're right there are some that are going to get them because there's so much knowledge on TV that these kids watch wear rubber gloves ... day you don't have snow more you know there were also if you go ... or\n... or ... miles away\nBy the way

entirely bon it was into any number of terrorist groups you a declared war on America it wasn't even Hatfield or we painted on the professor from LSU\nAnd it wasn't about a half a dozen other people that we assume that might have been involved with it\nI think has remained unresolved yeah that's what I ... yeah sometimes you never know but I think and I think he brings up an excellent point though to Curtis that there is so much stuff on line on how to build a bomb had to do these things are way too much information where somebody like it could be anybody from ... to ... to a foreign entity\nOn us they're really not bombs they're really not bombs or let's go to a Tom was calling from ... welcome to Kurdish Embry to Tom tom\nHi are you do unless that I'm the bomb or I don't want to

interesting you don't count in the Democratic national circles now unless you have been the subject of a bomb scare showing it in one sense you're right Alex is probably the alec is probably going with my bottom scare\nI don't think anybody wants a bomb scare\nKidding no kidding oh look at Cuomo yesterday Andrew Cuomo ran down\nAt a press conference he said I got a package I got a package I was the first you get a package it turns out it was a thumb drive the Proud Boys what he had requested from a federal law enforcement agency I\nRarely defend Andrew Cuomo and you know that but in this

earlier\nUm somebody I Know it was an on air person at at Fox News was on a jury I think it was either a year and a half or two years it was a drug case and that person had to appear and Fox News\nHad to rearrange the schedule and do a whole bunch of things um because it was a high it was an important case but it was also a requirement they are by law they if they hurt you because you took time off for a jury duty they could actually get in big big trouble\nAlright Joe this Rouge of this CPA was to go to three shepherd doctor she was doctor shopping my back pay and my back then he got notes\nYou know immediately right away ah he was claiming that he just sitting there is going to cost me tremendous problems going to vote pain on my vertebrae my lumbar my\nBack Nick my head my mother was

for him okay I'm going to push back X amount of time and then he had the audacity the ... say oh no I Need more time than that to come up with these phony fake things I actually ... and I\nAgain I had been on a jury it was a short jury so I ... short trial so I'll give you that\nAnd it was a civil case but I learned a lot I'm Glad I did it and I think anybody who defies at this job\nThey're saying oh we gave them five ... five hundred dollar fine he's a CPA he should have given about five thousand dollar fine for delaying delaying and being disrespectful\nAnd not only that he said if I have to

Kurdish and really Cosby he uh WABC Jeff Hi Joe\nHi guys um yeah no I was just thinking that you know there's a lot of people out here they're living paycheck to paycheck ... work or you know our won a case might take a lot of people come up with ideas because they just can't afford it you know they're not being compensated anything by the courts\nTo show up and I understand that your civic duty but the reality is a lot of people struggle and if they're not getting paid you know for that day that there wasn't from work you know it can impact or watch a lot\nWell Joe two things first off I'm you do get paid so minimal I Can't remember what it is I think it's like Fifteen bucks or twenty bucks or whatever it is\nFor lunch yeah no I Know I Know oh actually I think they throw in lunch of I remember they threw in and we were there kind of late I think they threw in dinner to a couple of times but um but your employer here right if it's a small company or you're self employed that's different now that the companies are supposed to reimburse you\nLet's say the jury has come up with a decision on the civil or the criminal case and it's in the morning session they won't tell the judge until after lunch\nYeah 'cause you get a nice like salads are already right by the way I went to a nice Italian Restaurant I was that's how I kind of learn to some of the restaurant\nIf they tell the judge we reached a decision before lunch there won't be a free large\nYou know what's interesting Curtis and because I had been there and it's been fascinating for me to see what goes on in the jury room and I'm curious for any of the others who have actually been in the jury room as a as a journalist who's covered a lot of trials it was fascinating because they were ready to steam role this guy and\nI realize you know me I fight for what I Believe in and I fly for people I Believe in and for me when I saw what was happening in the jury room I realize why they picked me on the jury because you know they don't pick a journalist they picked me because they wanted somebody who would be able to look at both sides and be fair and that's what it was\nIn office down there and balanced when journalists were failing fair and balanced buddy yeah let's go to a buddy in New Jersey Welcome to Kurdish really Cosby he uh WABC buddy\nEd God has blessed memory whatever arrested everybody for like one joined I did get poppy Yankee Stadium worry about going to show when I Am I eligible for jury duty I still had a drug possession charge they don't want to know part of me and it was you know

through certain circumstances is Jeff and if it's a felony or whatever they you know the conviction as but there is sometimes they will once the city of somebody who they clashed them but\nIt's turned into an advantage for you Brian smoking alone get you a gym to jury duty even though smoking a joint would probably have nothing at all to do with the case you of being chose to was\n... it gets me out it's like the best thing that ever happened to\nI like to know if we have any color is what happened on\n... da ... up everyone's record for having smoked marijuana who got a ticket so then they can be on jury duty now we know willow run a but the point being here is you'd probably want to keep that summons violation on your record so that when you go to the ... you know the jury\nPool you
