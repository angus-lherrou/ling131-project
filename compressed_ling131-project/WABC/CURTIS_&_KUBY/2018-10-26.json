this arrest by the FBI of the suspect in the bombing packages\nAnd by the way critics to I'm just worried a few minutes ago too that there was another package potentially they say intercepted that was supposed to go to Kamala Harris who of course is a well known senator that we saw during all the cabinet hearings um and that was an root for her she's a California senator very well known and Democrat and although again another critic of the president\nIf you're somebody in the national Democratic Party and you have yet to receive the package you suddenly a Democrat or no consequence I mean uh you got to be a top shelf such a Democrat to get a package if you haven't gotten a package by now because obviously packages probably will not be senator he won't get out of the guys in

... it\nIt makes it you know I didn't think about it it makes a lot of sense I'm embarrassed to say that the state of the country but it does make sense\nAnd unless we don't know that yeah we just know that some guy's been busted and he has ties to our area to apparently\nWe don't have to know it just it just that option is\nYeah it is it is and by the way a number of people are saying that we don't know enough about this guy's politics yet or we don't know if he's just some a coup come on guys who just decided to do something for a lot of attention\nLet's go to Billy in New York a welcome to Kurdish and reading Cosby he uh WABC belly\nHi Rita curse you know the same way we have an open up your the epidemic in this country have something where he works at political epidemic people foaming at the mouse with politics on both sides left wing not Charles right wing not jobs you know that's the problem I mean it's too much politics in this country there's too much if the politics is your biggest concern I like to see more you\nWell and you know what the problem is also built it is so divided right now that people that somebody is going to the extent whether it's a a kooky guy or politically driven he's kooky regardless\nBut somebody decides are so disgusting I Can't think ... and all our time broadcasting Curtis where I mean there've been divided times but in politics this is unbelievable what where people don't talk to each other's\n... come out not to about ... years from the time he got elected I got it at age ... and often nothing like that it's just just for\nTwenty four hour news channels right there's ... billion is the only drug dealers they're trying to deal with right now isn't it better though believe that people flood to the polls and they vote because in

minute from the west wing it will go live to a Donald Trump when he does so well let's go back to the phones and its Joel is calling from New York Welcome to the Kurdish and where do you guys meet Joe Hi Joe\nYou're are great to talk with you hey I was thinking about this guy and it you know considered this he may be actually be a double fall flat kind of like a double agent and what he did with this he purposely misspelled her name\nYeah ... ... which is by the way he joined you know it's interesting I'm not I'm gonna let you go about it continue but well you bring up a great point because he lived apparently or word close to Debbie Wasserman Schultz of all people you would think he would be the one to spell it correctly you know\nAbsolutely so I mean consider that he did actually misspelled it on purpose\nAnd to kind of like put it out as I think especially when you consider this not really good time to do something like this for for the president because obviously this is like not good for the midterms and everything but he did it to make up suspicion so that looks like the Democrats actually put it out there by doing that sort of thing and using\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz sets the return of trucks and here's one thing I wanted to point out to be the title of his fellow should be like the Unabomber without the a\nUni bomber without the hey I'm going to see\nThe

I'm thinking even Puerto Rico and why why should I not be so fearful to invest money\nWell there are many concerns in these uncertain times China a currency what's going to happen with Greece and the life but that's not a reason to stick your head in the sand like an ostrich it's it was a reason to be proactive and not reactive because the person who plan is going to be better than the one who doesn't have a\nPoint securities offer through American portfolios financial services incorporated member ... ... s I PC advisory services offered to well quarterback American portfolio center will quarterback or unaffiliated entities investing main above the risk of lots of capital\nDiet dot com\nHas been ... has been affected um there were just saying that apparently there's nothing in the band of an explosive nature because that was the big concern actually busted him out of business and plantation Florida that I was saying because I think they were worried to go to the home that maybe there could have been a whole bunch of Bob potentially explosive devices that's dangerous\nBut apparently they've been monitoring him for a while too so we will find out what hopefully motivated him did he act alone\nI'm Still so many questions\nDo a lot of regional when they get a computer in their screen shape but whatever you as on the screen shave it tells his old story people where they screen sugar becomes like a badge of courage for whatever they identified with\nYet so we'll find out well listen if it's anything like the truck [laughter] just going to have some interesting\nSo long as she does have ideas out there who he is so much in the first that we're in disbelief that he can be a Trump supporter they thought oh maybe he was a double agent for the Democrats one eight hundred eight for re WABC there's one eight hundred eight for eight nine doo doo doo\nAnd in the meantime I'm of course all this stuff has become certainly a topic it was the topic in the debate yesterday that took place it's the first and so far it looks like only one that's going to happen between chele Farley Republican and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's for the New York Senate seat\nThe U. S. seat representing New York and of course Kirsten Gillibrand's longtime Democrat longtime friend of the Clintons although she said that Clinton should be removed or would have been removed dad all his sex you will a ticket dealers that happened now\nBut one of the big topics they talked about what security in light of all these packages around the country\nAnd they also talked about the issue of the caravan of immigration we talked a little bit uh with Bill O'Reilly at our pubs in politics about immigration and security and the need for that\nAnd certainly they talked about it during the debate and Charlie hey what do you think of this caravan that's headed to the border with thousands upon thousands inching its way to the u._s. should the\nPeople who are seeking asylum he allowed into the odds that\nIs a real problem but there are fourteen thousand people and people are calling a caravan I call it an invasion we can't allow open borders we don't know who's coming across our border they could be members of ISIS frankly they could be members of NF Thirteen we have to stop it but the real issue here if we got to get comprehensive immigration reform\nUm we got to stop the problem once and for all there was an offer on the table and senator Randall wouldn't vote for it that is a problem in Washington we actually need to create solutions rather than to keep battling over the issue is we need a comprehensive immigration reform plan and I will do it when I'm In DC\nAnd I thought that was a good answer Curtis I actually thought that was a great strong in front of\nA while she was saying that the Jill I'm Around yesterday for the debate there will be aired on Sunday\nOther troubled administration was hungry damaged plans on how to block that uh\nThat uh what could well be ten thousand strong a group of individuals bum rushing the border or manage General Mattis said the Pentagon said we're going to assign eight hundred personnel from the United States Army to that\nAnd Trump was figuring out ways of how to block them no matter what path eventually take up halfway ah into Mexico they decided to split up and go in different directions so that's first and foremost saw on the plate of the Trump Administration before was announced\nThat the cost is a Google among the in Florida who they believe is responsible for sending out those bomb packed\nBut it's interesting to see here the Republicans so I'm a strong about security ... and very kind of clear cut and the Democrats also knowing it's not like you've got a couple of hundred people coming toward the border you got a couple of thousand so they're sort of trying to finesse yeah we care about security but we also care about other than\nYou win win for the Republican ... Graham elections ... uh there are a lot of Democrats I've spoken to say oh hell no they can't bomb Russia border like that an open defiant she gonna come across by the thousands no no no no so they're actually supportive of the president on this and most Democrats have shut their mouths\nYeah they have let anything and unfortunately ... could not shot her mouth because during the debate you know it's like okay what's your applied what Farley just said especially in the climate with all these packages and all these security issues that we're dealing even domestically this is what job ran out of the day\nIt can be very clear I did not support open borders and neither Democrat but what we have in this country is an immigration crisis I you have\nPeople coming in this caravan to seek asylum in the country immigration has always been a strength for this country we our country founded by immigrants are diversity is I think that creates entrepreneurial is an innovation\nAnd so we need to fix our broken immigration system but separating children from their parents at the border is immoral that's what the president has done he demonized immigrants throughout this country which is wrong morally wrong so we need immigration system that actually work\nAnd that means making sure that you had an asylum process real immigration judges to process those claims not locking families up\nAnd for profit prison for just seeking asylum and our protection staff of the statue of liberty stands for that for this country has always said for\nBy the way that was called the pivot Curtis because the question was about to take care of\nA you know everyone acknowledges Democrat or Republican we lost a million residents in upstate New York from Albany to buffalo in the past eight years\nNow there's a lot of space so if the illegals don't make it through the border they got a long way from the border to follow shoulder and should be there at the border to take them to rush to the way to parts of central and western New York that are very kids it was just not seeing and I'm sure that it's better than having nobody there\nBy the way out the latest on most of that group and you're you know seven to ten thousand they are still five to six hundred miles south of Mexico City but what's interesting is one of the things I was I was hearing is that they're worried when it gets to a town called ...\nAnd then apparently on there they can get on a bus or a train pretty quickly to Tijuana but there's still a couple of hundred miles away but they are gathering the pictures are unbelievable I mean they're getting bigger and bigger and bigger and you can tell the Democrats\nIn right in the height of the midterms are going or we don't really want to talk about the caravan\nNo unless I'm One of our law enforcement agents shoot at one of those are folks who actually cross the border\nOther than that I think you're going to hear most Democrats tree or take the fifth on that one eight hundred eight for re WABC that's one eight hundred aid for a nine to two to let's go to the phones which Dave calling from Long Branch welcome to Kurdish that really caused via WABC Dave Dave\nAre how are you from a point I was very clear number one the ... are going to have gotten on the air or writing and congratulated everybody as far as they're a great job go far\nFrom the great anyhow number two what happens if the wrong person and it turns out that obviously or in your car has made a mistake okay\nIf they do they got hit by the way if they do they got a big lawsuit on their hands because that's happened before where they like finger somebody you know I\nDon't think cages Richard jewel the security officer out the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta and Olympic Park yeah it was like a young guy from uh he got blamed for the backpack that were bombs when it was actually that anti abortion a guy that mountain man\nYou're the guy who was living in the woods and they found out years later\nBut Richard jewel was vilified for so long and then eventually his revenge was as you pointed out he ended up showing everyone who painted on him and boy or I don't know what what is that it's just now but he cleaned up millions and millions\nAnd and ... absolutely because they they fingered him they pointed at him but look if you look at this day that they probably I mean I don't know but it looks like they had warrants out that there were following him surveilling him I you would think that they probably had the goods on them\nWear our hair your point again areas in the states involved or in the ... look foolish workers or to do because we have a president who obviously are perfect ... for him to start out right away within an hour that statement about you know what what's going on\nYeah but David David David ain't going way back then the day or two that\nI think actually it's a good thing because it gives comfort to the country that someone has been arrested a lot of people are panicking all over the country with these packages all over the place I actually don't\nGet the real net and presidents and they you know you have a day may have thought they were going to do\nWith the dog catcher in the neighborhood David also\nIt's a positive for the president if there's no job does turn out to be a Trump or\nThe president has seized the moment has given us the media meeting just basic details things that we I and read it all baby already been repeating over and over it's not like he introduced any new information oboe guarded the FBI or local law enforcement\nThey'll probably give us a lot more information when they have their own press conference that will carry and it's so ... already but I thought the president\nDid a good job I did too I I sold on the ground you heard cheering was not report you know they were on that will they rounded young African American supporters of Donald Trump who were there for a conference\nBut at first if you didn't see the optics you would assume oh my God the reporters are actually cheering the president's good news\nThat this violated has been well no no the ... I Would I Would\nI Would hope that any American would be happy that someone's behind bars I Want to go back to also Curtis the fact\nThat the president said them at first he kept trying to using I I just think that's odd language um because it makes me think maybe there is somebody else involved that they're looking for something I I look I Hope it the loan nut job and not a group of people are more than one person but let's find out\nHe's the only ones that I'm aware of where it's talk we talk and they all laughed for the little dogs who talks with the fake news while it's not like\nAs far apart the FBI today in responding\nSo way way way Chuck what's your point you got a lot of the drone aren't their\nPoint is that the stuff that's been created and the truth of the matter is that our president is not a good leader with respect to things that you got a lot of that he doesn't agree\nWell wait a minute Chuck can I ask you do you know I Love the ... do you think that it's fair for Cuomo there for ... for these people to come right out and say oh with the president who is basically a respond to let the job but guy with the history now that we know a bomb threat\nOr may I miss it as one don't put going on or off the ... you're on Colorado from years ago what regard to the growing up or ... of preschool with all those kids what the book will do in your way to go all the information that it kept on TV\nWell jak let me correct you on that emerged tall building in Oklahoma City which I think you're referring to taking out by Timothy McVeigh and his warped partner\nIt was Bill Clinton who blame talk radio for that blame specifically Rush Limbaugh\nBut said it was a tone of hate coming out of the radio he blamed talk radio we came to find out the Timothy McVeigh never listen to talk radio he didn't believe in having radio he didn't believe in having license plates that's how they eventually caught him you know to stop this ... widow license plates on it so\nBill Clinton was always looking to blame somebody\nYes both sides I mean that's the whole point it's it's really cook among gr crazy I mean really really let's go to Tommy from Manhattan real quick Tommy you're here with Curtis and ready to go ahead Tommy\nHi guys don't good what do you think ah here's what I think a John Brennan he made a statement wants\nA very recently he absolutely cruel Trump absolutely crew loaded with the Russians and they called them out onto what all the evidence why are you making that statement if you're withholding evidence comports with it\nSo what what's your point that there is some like deep stay tied to this or what your point\nDon't you know there were ... they got clap of or are they like the Congress\nRight by the time they ought to just make you some out saying that the suspected they've arrested a avid FBI Headquarters in Florida right now and questioning him is somehow tied into the deep state\nWell listen if I was writing a novel or you know\nHow much better when you do I'm surprised that interested in what am I don't\nKnow well he didn't need American Beauty though that imagine Tommy did you hear the van\nHad like a picture of the Trump pictures are by Hillary with us slash mark through it apparently\nLike a shrine to Trump and any enemies of Trump will vilified on this ah this band\nBut again CNN stinks but not using the word\nState you've got one of the country you've seen not jobs like this guy dress up the advantage of pickup trucks all kinds of pictures whether to the far left or the far right and you say ...\nAnd the guy with that now as we know with a bomb threat history apparently again as as I was saying they had the fingerprints Curtis in the database of this was clearly a screwball on their radar and driving around like a screwball to\n... to give you updates on who this guy is a ... originally from Sheepshead Bay I predict can use ... street right near the sewage bitch and it affected him and
