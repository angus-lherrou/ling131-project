road\nWhere was the oversight or the state which had had a series of a stretch limo accidents in the past potential particularly in twenty Fifteen and cut jobs\nOut in Long Island when those four young ladies were killed when the stretch limo made a U turn in the wrong location and they got smashed to smithereens I remember ... called the first was governor at the time\nSaid that he was going to create a task force to study the safety a stretch limos\nAnd that task force was never convened so you can blame Cuomo and you can blame the assembly because he had a series of uh laws\nOr would it be imposed on the stretch limo industry but guess what are the insurance lobbyists made sure that that was dead on arrival ... probably got wind diamond pocket line as speaker of the assembly\nSo if ... is blamed to way other than the owner the driver obviously\nYou have to say hey Cuomo where were you based on the fact that they were these accidents before and call hasty why did you bottle up the legislation in the state assembly simply because the industry the insurance industry put the arm on you\nAnd I want to hear from the limo drivers out there because what is really going on and how much are you bet it how much is this kind of happened because I bet you there are so many cases like this out there the numbers one eight hundred a for a nine to two to one eight hundred a parade nine to to to\nLet it go to Mike from ... who's here with Curtis and Cosby go ahead Mike\nBy Curtis how you doing\nGood where are you know I my heart breaks when you think about it's like these were people in their twenties and thirties they had their whole life ahead of them and there are so many irregularities so many probably criminal cases that are going to come out of this one\nYou know if it's a really awful story I mean it's just it's just really are breaking in and you have a whole family that's just gone now because of the uh the short cuts that one person decides to take with this company um you know I drive a school bus for a living as so we have um it in a very very very safety oriented I mean to\nYou know and I do tons and tons of trying to get that got to do something like Seventy hours of training or a life of the company you know have that me ... about all I see but that's not the case with limo driver to my understanding\nNo in fact I'm a the regulations are not at all specific\nAgain the state was supposed to impose these are special regulations because let's face it\nThe limo comes out of the assembly line and then it's altered that means it's lengthened its modified after it comes off the production line\nNobody checks the specifications bike it will be like the school bus do you drive of all of a sudden it was he long gated after it came off the assembly line well who checks the welding who checks the schottische who checks to see\nThat the actual uh on the carriage a is strong enough to be able to carry the load that obviously you want to carry more of a low when you stretch it out there and apparently there's no oversight whatsoever after that my\nYou know one of the things with one of the you know I don't know how safe they are they're all I Want to you know I think they're not as safe as plenty of other vehicles out there all the world\nBut I Know I'm you know I'm going to remember the story of my daughter is old enough to go into right now but what she is really have to think about if I Want to live off because the story\nI mean twenty people is is is a lot of people\n... Mike ... no ... no way no matter no airbags on the shy to stretch limo or there are no regulations require that only for the driver and passenger up front so if you're not facing up front which obviously in the back of a limo\nUh your parallel to one another you don't have to wear a safety belts ah doesn't have to be airbags who knows maybe had a those men required or they might have been less less that's involved in this action and\nBut the fact is all these suggestions were made after twenty Fifteen after ...\nAnd they got the governor did nothing the assembly did nothing show you know yesterday this ... at the annual ... Christopher Columbus day parade acting like yeah he's going to be the guardian of all the customers to stretch limo and eight ... back in twenty fifth day and you did Bob Gates you did nothing\nHow could this happen where continues in this way how many of you drivers out there now and we're not going to give out your name but you know that this happens all the time when things are just passed over where somebody's greasing somebody else because of the pressure or whatever it is you're continuing on the road\n... a curious they read this year you good show um I just want to say that people should be ... office said she got off the table always single faster and faster but there should be a tipping based on safety\nActually that's a good point you know because you're right a lot of people are like hey hurry up hurry up but you know what the drivers still needs to say I can't go faster it's not safe especially when you're in these\nBoat load limos that are like you know almost like like three city blocks you know\nIf I ask you ought to shape the latest that just didn't happen in New York City New York city drivers are pretty safe\nYou know why because you can't go that fast in New York City you're lucky if you're crawl in more than two inch of the New York so I Would\nSee a limo driver let's face it you're the painting a pretty damn good tip at the end of a drive because you have any deal with a lot of chaos yeah people are drinking interacting while they're acting\nCrazy who knows what they're like Lakers who knows what they're doing right there like party animals in fact that's what we'll be\nTalking about later on in a two o'clock hour how party shift change she ... overtime but a limo driver has a lot of their mind so here her nose I Hope I get that sweet tip at the end of the drive\nAnd all of a sudden whoever's in charge of the dry says hey you got to speed it up with twenty minutes late [noise] do you think at that point the drivers shaking safety or will follow the ... the bill\nHe thinking catching catching catching boy I can take my little honey out on the town\nLet's go to Bob is calling from Brooklyn welcome to Kurdish every ... uh WABC Bobby I got\nA guy called it a lot of time that people want to stretch limo\nYeah hopefully not by the way hopefully not the driver about\nThis in order to drive a salary old oh you're not fearful that

replicate what he had shed in front of the Senate or hearing\nCan you imagine he turned on the crowd and said I was a\nSong about Clinton's and others and all that okay so he said let bygones be bygones I'm going to be the best doggone United States Supreme Court judge I can be but the president certainly turned it into a campaign issue for the midterm elections and I said to myself why why it tell\nYou one you know show some dignity you are the president of the United states you are the leader of Democrats Republicans and independents\nOr it was a hard fought victory apparently there was no information about sexual assault sexual harassment that could be attributed to Kavanaugh you want oh do you know ... and try to unite the nation instead of turn it in to a campaign it was like he was campaigning there by\nBy a lot of people took issue when he said you were proven innocent a lot of people were like oh no capital guilty while I mean you even lower and I don't think that that's fair to cab\nI was one of the and these people Curtis saying okay we're going to try to meet you break but actually it's almost like Trump like you know I remember when we were down there for ... down there for Seventy seven WABC for an operation day and it was like the guy I hadn't even been sworn in yet and they're talking about impeaching I'm the same thing with Brett we have in the ...\nThey had enough time to find information it could have been offered by the opposition in terms of anything that could directly link a Brett Kavanaugh to sexual assault sexual harassment there wasn't\nSo that's it he's the United States Supreme court judge he will not be impeached learning to live on it or if you're upset turn out to the mid term elections either way both sides are upset so they think that you got to fuel it turned out\nBut I really felt the president in his opening remarks last night was really giving a campaign speech instead of a speech to try to bring everybody together about judge Kavanaugh who he described as being a great Jewish will be a great addition to the United States Supreme court and I think he should focus on that\nAnd that break capital as you were saying\nCurtis said during the process you know he said he's going to put everything behind them even cited the Bible he cited Matthew and some other things there's a little bit of cabin on\nThe Senate confirmation process was contentious an emotional that processes over my focus now is to be the best justice I can be a take this office with gratitude no bitterness on the Supreme Court I Will seek to be a force for stability in unity\nNeeded we needed to hear that we did we did and rather than I Hope that that's the case I just think there is such a bad blood between both sides I like when I saw all the justices their Curtis I thought that was a great example is the only one of them was are\nThey doing like campaign speech for the midterms and then I couldn't believe\nThat my sentiments in watching CBS last night to live a ceremony taking place in the White House was replicated by Hillary Rodham Clinton I Can't believe she said the same thing\nWhat was done last night in the White House with a political rally it further undermined the image and integrity of the court on and that\nTroubles me greatly it saddens me\nThat politics or was it fair game I wanted them all I don't really want to tell\nMyself in that one based on what the president said they have to agree I give a sums up the cabin or very healing speech and obviously as you said the other judges sitting there in their black regal robes very important that they show solidarity our number one eight hundred eight for re WABC so\nWas the president and write and making it a campaign speech for the midterms at the start of last night's ceremony\nAlways judge Kavanaugh more on in the spirit of what I felt was a necessary to try to bring both sides together\nAnd you can really be able to uh put everything aside after you know and listen he has maintained that he was falsely accused we haven't seen proof\nThat there was a sexual assault just the testimony from you know from Dr for but not corroborated could you really sort of set it aside after all of that and then you've got a major case that comes before you after you feel like you had been personally well aside\nThe other guy that was he said hey look my fault clerks historic\nAre all women this has never been done before and I was hearing that and also you know without mentioning Ginsberg didn't do a children my yard they do a cake and didn't do it no other justice or any Supreme\nCourt had four separate female\n... that was another good tie yup and I think he's got to be under such scrutiny like Clarence Thomas ... why\nDo you think you're right the little thing that he does they're going to be watching this right okay how's he voting on women's issues how's he doing this but the fact that the Democrats Curtis already are talking about impeaching the guy\nYeah they went about five oh thankfully not well then you have any heat on and not all\nThe Democrats below sea the Well Jerry Nadler a few others but they're gonna

to imagine\nThis is like a Super Bowl or because it really was the kind of attention that I received particularly when a\nFord and Kavanaugh spoke on the same day and it had that kind of attention all of America was watching yeah and in the super bowl a lot of time she had been bad calls bad blood ... and at the end don't you think it's appropriate that everybody shaky each other's hands well dawn okay we'll move on I think the president\nShould have addressed the nation and said well was was we're moving on we have a great justice that he believes in judge Kavanaugh and I think he will serve
