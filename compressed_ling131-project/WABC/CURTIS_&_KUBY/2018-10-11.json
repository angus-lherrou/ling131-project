water was eighty eight degrees and that if you're in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico was eighty eight as you get closer to land under the water was a you have to short nearly eighty eight eighty nine Ninety degree still very warm water even though it's October the water's still very warm there so\nThat hurricane is the worst one to hit land in a very long time uh you'd have to go back in Nineteen sixty nine to hurricane Camille which did the same thing by the way it started as the pressure coming northward over the warm waters slammed into the Mississippi\n[noise] uh and you're going to kill

they might be elevated to agree or two but you know hurricanes don't survive over water unless it's eighty two to eighty four degrees anyway and you know this is the the last place you know this time of year where you could still have that kind of warm water\nAnd that's what you all these things that you know they're born over water they have to they survive over water and wants to move inland they die off very quickly\nYou're the creative flooding rains first for him and flooding once once they come in but it has everything to do with the water there and this is\nYou know a little late in the season but you know the the water was right the high pressure was right steering currents were right and I will say this about Hurricane Center in Miami they did a fantastic job normally\nIf you're if the hurricane center forecast leave things in the track come within fifty miles that's considered excellent her consider this time got it somewhere between two and ten miles the exact landfall of the storm\nAnd not only that they get that right but that was in their fifty four hour forecast prior to landfall so that was fifty four hours ahead of time so they had the two and a half days out and they hit that within ten miles that's that's excellent forecasts\nYeah that is that and I chased a lot of storms bill in my day as a journalist to wherever you know you're literally like

to Norfolk an out the ... so you know this time tomorrow it's called you know it's out of out in the Atlanta now as we go in the seat again tonight you know we're on the edges of that the north the north west edge of the storm and we're going to get somewhere between one to two or three inches of rain we've already had a tree knocked down on a home\nOr in New Jersey you know a ground as weapons so so what rain we get now are just a little puff of wind cannot fix things over ... you know with the storm exiting are right around Norfolk, Virginia and how to get into the Atlantic we could get a round one to three inches of rain out of this and the farthest south you go in South east\nYou know central southern Jersey you know on down to DC do you think you'd get three to five inches of rain out of this and so could in the Philly area around three to five and as the storm goes away\nHey Bill Keller Charlotte Charlotte 'cause I'm going to ask\nYou for selfish reasons I used to work at W. B. T. V. in Charlotte oh\nWhat a great voice there they've\nHad about four or five inches of rain so far or the storm has not pulled away the western edge white over downtown\nCharlotte the the center of the storm so is this political way they've they've had some forty five fifty mile an hour wind gusts uh the the story is now thirty five miles south southeast of Charlotte and uh and moving out east northeastern at twenty three so it's it's getting out of their quick I Would think they you know they've had some power lines down trees down\nI'm doing nothing like you know and Mexico beach which if you see that video\nIt down a little like a a nuclear weapon what\nIt is amazing I was just looking at the pictures I mean that again is everybody just as a contact is near Panama beach but that was battered I mean that it's unbelievable those images bill\nWell the you know and this is the type of destruction that hurricane brings you know not only have they had hurricane force winds up it was just two miles underneath\nA category five subject you could call it a low end category five on the separatists to scale and this is the one instance where the staffer Simpson scale works it was designed for\nFlorida and and the Gulf you know it was not designed for storms like for you know in this storm is in no way like Lawrence is a bigger when storm the surge was seven to twelve feet were going to be finding out there's a little island\nA ride around Mexico beach in between there and Panama City called St George's island and nobody has any video from there yet and it's quite possible uh you know that there\nDo the the waves cutting in with the storm surge was somewhere between seven and fourteen feet and it's quite possible every home is wiped off that island it could it could be white clean nobody can get in there to find out yet they're trying to fly you know get some helicopters over that and and take a look at St George's island\nBut that that could be one of only two places at the United states where hurricane is totally wiped everything clear the beach and where would that one other place the Jamaica Bay in New York City\nThe Nineteen uh ten storm went right across Jamaica Bay and had an island called hog I used to have hogs on it it was owned by the Indians and then it had bath houses and the child is in the Nineteen ten hurricane in New York City wiped it out totally nothing left out and that's the only other instances\nWhere you live pointing out of that you said bad houses and beach houses and you forgot to mention the horror houses\nYou got a bill doesn't know about those kind of they were all on a hill they'll is a good boy\nSays where Mae West and many of her girls are entertained a lotta guys back then [noise]\nWell I Do that we're casinos and bad houses yeah you're really enriched my story\nWas but now let me get back to global warming and climate change because of the greenhouse gas emissions which continue everyday would belching more smoke into the air\nIt seems to be warming up the atmosphere at sea levels are rising and we're getting hit with a barrage of reports now from scientists meteorology as many of your your colleagues from all over the world are saying\nYou know we can really start seeing the dire ramifications of this ingests twelve years a dozen years\nNow I'm sure you've seen those reports bill Evans a UN agreement with your colleagues are you at odds with them\nWell I think it's you know the IPC the report came out to you know from the United nations and that sets that are within Twenty years or we would be a devastating now first of all I'm really upset about that because that's in Twenty years I'm supposed to have my boat paid off\nSo that is very important [laughter] with very would not be able to probably going to meet a boat at that point or Twenty years ago I ... I think\nYou do when you look at what they were using for their data a and you take the empirical data and then you take these models that they're looking at it and they're looking at what how high the oceans are going to be and what's going to be covered\nA I think it's a little much I think it's over the top and I ... and all that does is fuel that with with all the other you know politics that goes on with me I look at the war there every day and I I don't see that I mean I go back and you look at records you this is this work as a record setting hurricane\nOr for if you know for its amount of wind speed or to hit the United states but you know those kinds of records of going to be broken because we have ... all over the world typhoons psych loans and this is just a normal process of the planet\nBut I I'm you know I'm hoping to be around in Twenty years I don't think the plan is going to be covered with water and Twenty years\nI think you know some of those things that they suggested are good you know lower emissions things like that\nWell I don't know if we're all on the water make sure you save if you lived for ... on your good shift pill ad on our leaves are slowing down there and some I Do appreciate it as real Evans he's a weather guy also a channel seven eye\nWitness news ah and his description along with other colleagues was it was a tropical depression over the weekend out in the Gulf was barreling towards Florida and the next thing I heard it cites hurricane\nOne yeah you're not in no way that was like whoa hundred and\nFifty miles per hour and they're already suggestions\nThat the warming caused by all those greenhouse gas emissions has had an\nAnd a speaking of a Herman bell the cop killer who was released by almost parole board heat rewarded or the governor by actually casting an absentee ballot and his name on September twelfth a day before the actual primary\nAnd he is intent on voting in a general election we know he's not going to be voting for mark mile an hour because last night when I was in college town in Rockland County not far from ... where the branch robbery had taken place where the black Liberation Army and the weather underground had killed three\nThree a public safety uh guys two cops from that and you're wet and a a private security officer from the brink struck a those images still are burned into the minds of those in Rockland County and they cannot forgive a Andrew\nCuomo for pardoning not just Herman bell but twenty five thousand others all tied should criminals from pedophiles the sexual assault is to others who have been given the right\nNow that they're out and about to vote for Cuomo on November six\nEight is so unbelievable and needless to say mark mile an hour ago and so many others are seizing on this because as he should I mean to me it is so outrageous that this guy one of the first things he did was say okay I'm going to register to vote there was a lot of New Yorkers who don't think about voting ...\nWhen you have to understand with Cuomo's parole board and parole officer judge when they report to their parole officer\nThe parolees encourage I Know they cashed in absentee ballot in fact why not just fill it out while you're here to parole board\nBecause nobody knows where you're going to fill it out and check that says Cuomo right and then you mail it in and then you will have done you a civic duty and you will ... home all the second the sun a lot of your ... home all the first\nAnd mark muddled are always running up against him and by the way so you have a chance to meet mark ... who is indeed running against Cuomo and certainly taken a really strong stand against death which I applaud mark mile an hour for because I don't think somebody like Herman bell should be able\nTo vote on I Want to make sure we tell everybody go to W.
