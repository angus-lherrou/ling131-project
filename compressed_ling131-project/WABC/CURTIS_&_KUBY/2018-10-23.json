other measures but nobody on the board most of whom has been appointed by Andrew legalized ... home all the first we'll come right bill de Blasio the part time may have to do from park slope\nNone of the board members scratch their head and said you know maybe the reason that subway ridership continues to plummet is it the way we gauge whether someone is counted or not is based on the swipe of the metro card\nRight and you always contend that they they jump and they are there are jumping I Will also say Curtis as a woman\nI just feel like the subways have gotten so nasty and so to the point where a especially as a female on the subway that it just doesn't feel safe I mean I've been there so many times in broad daylight where I'd seen things that would make me blush or my mother blush I'm telling you\nThere is some dairy I feel like it's gotten dirty or I don't see cops around\nA and that concerns me as a woman and you just sort of see people like par for the course I'm like what do you see this guy over there I told you I saw a guy physically going to the bathroom a couple of months ago it was one of the most disgusting things and a lot of people on the subway didn't even seen the ... because there used to seeing it and that's a shame\nBut I got to tell you a reader or my senses are just as many people were riding the subway just remember we've had a surge of tourism they pay their fair or most of the people who come into the city to work nine to five job they pay their fair\nThere used to it that responsible people\nBut I detected in just observing a ... near the turnstile but it's not just important impoverished neighborhoods real crime infested neighborhoods that the jumping is taking place the fare evasion\nBut I've seen his vision millennials I've seen many business shoots I've seen women dressed to the nines because it's managed ... if you'd see others not paying their fair and you've been told that there'll be no prosecution there'll be no rash there'll be no some inches by the da's\nWell then you begin to realize why should I be a sucker why should I swipe my card and have to pay for a ride that others are not paying I can give you a a pretty good heads up and I'm sure some of our mission is out there may have had those same personal experiences\nIn jumping on across town bus in Manhattan or watching the bushes up in the Bronx you out in Brooklyn or even in a forensic Staten Island bus drivers will tell you time and time again\nMen women will get on a bus refused to pay will sit down orders from MTA headquarters all the bus driver is to just take the bus a basically park it to the side and two police arrive\nAnd the bus driver on understand it that's that's true but it's the constant ever going to come\nYeah they're not and they listen to contact their hands full the other thing too is also on the subway to credit because they'll go through you know that emergency exit door and you see people you know you see questionable looking characters doing it but you also see businessmen I mean the other day I talked to business guys somehow they ended up going through there it's like okay they see like you said it's sort of\nMimic behavior but what I'm Talking about is also on the subway themselves to because I'm running a business people reminiscent of suits ching people that are disgusting that it it is they turn out on the on the subway that the different T right\nBut my perception is just as many people are writing the buses and trains because they really don't have alternatives\nYeah that's true and we don't and and as New York it's busier and you got those bike lanes it takes forever to go somewhere and\nMore people are refusing to pay now remember the revenues of the MTA the buses in subways all tabulate it together how many people pay to ride a bus how many people pay to ride the subway today\nSo if we are fair of aging going up on the buses and I've seen that firsthand and fare evasion is going up in the subways we've seen that firsthand and\nWhy wouldn't it ta da ... we're not going to lock anybody up and the cops had basically given up on writing some inches you don't see them hiding in the short of a creatures of the subway system in plainclothes ready to grab those fair advantage and write him up a lock them up particularly if they have Pryor's\nBy the way you know ... more people to jump Kurds you know what they should have\nThey should have actually I'm sort of like the air marshals you know like like what you're talking about how\nSometimes you don't know who the air marshal is on the plane unless they're Liam Neeson drug then you know there there are so yeah you don't give it up and they could put somebody on the subways or on the buses to be kind of like look like they're just Joe blow passenger and then bus yeah that would put people I Know\nThey're not going to do it let's go to pat in Staten Island welcome to Kurdish and reading\nWell so we thought were the ... dogs a method which [noise]\nBut do you give the ear plugs into your most everybody else on the bus for the subway cars that allowed to Karim\nMike as you as you should uh like shake it off the electric shock you look at your phone is people will prone to do and you see\nWow it's locked up because I didn't pay my fair that's real you want to shut that's like the daily double\nIt just kind of message on your phone or is that it's\nGood that that badly hit him where it hurts because can you imagine especially millennials they're trying to jump the fair then they'll go they'll have a heart attack if they can't get into their phone but\nThis year like this is like a might the equivalent of if you park in the wrong spot sometimes they don't tell you a way they put the boom right you're right that I've had a vote that's not fun right so in this case they really it's like a technologically they're putting a boot on your cell phone\nBut you know it's funny you know it's like Curtis people can live without their cars sometimes can you imagine a millennial or a lot of people without their phone how they would not be able to breathe that couldn't function\nLet me tell you something I just like the idea that if you don't pay your fair you of age of fear it shocked I\nThink I think my idea about the phone is more debt and then you don't have to worry about a showman she don't have to worry about cops meeting quotas you don't have to worry about\nDa forced to prosecute dish as a possible climb you just let the natural ...\nSome people who are such mass she gets it reminds me of the interview we had yesterday with the dominate church in Studio\nYes that was interesting I learned a lot\nRight there are some people who are ...

wouldn't work for me to pick the crops sure they will languishing in the field because they won't pay\nYeah but that's essentially what what we all understand because they're paying such you know they're working long hours I used to work in Bakersfield, California always things you can agro community and you would see tons of legal reasons that doesn't take into across there that's what happened ... those are the people want to work in those conditions and what that salary\nSo you would think that it would be some kind of cement there in Washington and you can do that because all

I'm sure it'll change your\nThere there is a cap and there is a quota on a number of Asian students that they will el allowed to enter the freshman class each and every year now\nAsians is a broad term it incorporates mostly Chinese you know originally from the mainland or China or AK a formal short Taiwan\nOr it also involves others whether the Vietnamese Japan obedient tied Japanese but it also involves Southeast Asians so it could be people from Bangladesh Sri Lanka Asia or Pakistan, India where academically they're kicking everybody's\nButts right across the country and private schools are in public schools are in state universities and obviously in the elite colleges he Ivy League so this is part of what the demonstrators are are saying about this Asian cap\nAnd his Asian quota at Harvard that is considered a nation's leading universities\nHarvard systematically\nRaises the bar for Asian Americans in systematically lowers is for whites African Americans Hispanics real edge that Harvard has a quota the limits the number of the reasons\nThat isn't that interesting that whites for the first time a part of the parameter in which are the deck is stacked in our favor meaning whites ... blacks Hispanics\nAnd native Indians versus the growing number of Asians ... when the academically\nIsn't interesting Chris it really is it's like such an and what they're saying and it's interesting because you point out you hit on that it is hard for its own study that saying that like top athletes 'em like they say what what did you say ...\nLet me see Harvard not necessarily known as a place where top athletes go I'm\nTrying to get by by the way there's not that many Asian top athletes I mean you've got a couple in back you know that's about right\nBut I'm thinking John ... who had actually gone to the high school I went to Brooklyn prep played for the jets Brian Fitzpatrick who a quarterback\nIn other words they're not brainy axes where you're going to make your own hands full\nChristian Pico black use to kick field goals for the giants and I think uh his brother she if they play for the university but not\nReally a place where top flight athletes go\nExactly and that's what they're saying is that that there is this sort of ubiquitous care you know in addition to grade which you know obviously kids have to have decent grades to get into Harvard\n'em but they're also saying that there's this category sorter for courage for personal ratings and that would that subjectivity comes in where you could say this person you know what I'm saying extraordinary they did something need and they're saying it works against the Asians and ...\nThis is a Harvard student describing those personal traits and raiding set you just touched upon\nWhether or not he support affirmative action I think it's an important critical of high rating for however many not to be had inhabited it's going to need it again in ... in the Haitian American sounding maintenance for lower on personal ratings\nAll right so for the first time this is affecting whites are now why should join any coalition where blacks Hispanics in native Indians to say hey\nIf it's not a cat put our nations if you don't have a quota on Haitians it won't be any of us left in the student population at Harvard\nAnd other academic institutions of higher learning\nWe could apply that to our specialty schools in New York City where the battle continues about the the one test you take to get into a ... percent or Brooklyn tech or a Bronx high schooler science and that was I was just ... with the agency I ... I mean they're absolutely dominating in the percentage is\nRight and that's what's so interesting Curtis because as you see when they just look at it on reading scores as we had seen in so many of the schools here in New York City it is overwhelmingly Asians at that point when they've actually just looked at the numbers yes why because they had this great training\nAnd great you know process in the family where family you know if you're in an Asian family a lot of times they're like okay you're studying\nTwenty hours a day you're able to sleep three or four now\nNow that it's affecting the majority of our listeners kids and grandchildren cock his joy kids try white kids is it OK that schools put a cap and a quota or the surging academic excellence of Asians across\nThe nation one eight hundred eight for re WABC as one eight hundred aid for a nine to two to let's go to the first step in the ICU calling from uh Staten Island welcome to Kurdish outweigh the cons beyond WABC said nice deep\nYeah I'm an Asian students I'm currently enrolled Wagner College I applied for Harvard algae jak did\nOh why so now well let me ask you see do you think that maybe you didn't do well in your personal rating courage score\nRetire works the system works there's there's surfer action for gender and race so they actually help like the core of the mail for ... ... email through his you you better than male students and they have gender so basically like if they got what they refer of action in a\n... for some calls from California and Asians actually took over I mean\nYes the way it should be\nNow what high school did you go to Steve before you apply to Harvard and then eventually got accepted to Wagner College on the hill there in Staten Island\nUm I don't view of a high school 'cause uh for security reasons 'cause um but uh basically um I was ... it was in New York City\nOkay so there's no doubt in my mind you in one of these elite high schools in which you had to take that test to get into it and so\nNow all of a sudden Asians are just breaking the all time records in terms of the numbers are who are qualifying for the schools uh they want to make it so that there are are there as a percentage of whites blacks and Hispanics and you don't think that's fair\nYou know I think a ... search for the best can students available and pick the best students into the student body and wherever a guess except for except for the new diversity maybe should have the academic excellence yeah\nAnd I just have everybody from China come over and take over our schools and what will have like to present a local students why\nYou could have favor us citizens and legal residents over Chinese citizen\nForeign students but overall a tone down for fear for Asians Simon fear for white students either because white students basically uh\nUh being from times are kept the second white students Texas suing a public ... public college because she says she was wasn't accepted 'cause 'cause minorities were taking or a place\nWell she is what I Want you to do as you go to class every day wagging the college I Want you to go in there or whoever you're a student a counselor or faculty person is and let them know that the most famous graduate evident graduate from Wagner College you know who that\nIs in other then Steve who will be maybe the most famous after that all the most\nFamous uh let me re established as most infamous crafts\nWe're going to have you learned burger with like a one time\nConsuming area of enjoyable as formal king Cuomo the second the sun about her you'll find troubling cold can call the first who is now looking at six years of federal time for stealing\nMoney Steve as part of the Steve don't take that route doesn't have a judge the have make it a good point I don't recall going all of white college in Staten Island we ... we make sure we encourage Steve not today\nFor cocoa one eight hundred eight for a WABC let's go to Jeff was calling from New York Welcome to Kurdish really Kashmir Jeff Hi Jeff\nHi how are you all are just calling because I find the uh the percentages\nOf my son goes to school up at Cambridge just go to Harvard University and I spent quite a lot of time up there and I also do a lot of work around the university\nAnd you would think walking each campus just that that you used to have a universities are almost appears to be two thirds Asian\nOh yeah oh yeah but Asians on the campus\nSo how do how do we change it Jeff what do you do to change that I\nKnow it's not I'm not talking about I've just I've just come at the fact that there's a that these studies are coming out that there's there's such a low population the Asians go into these university I just ... visually it looks like it's it's dominated by Asian\nWell they're not seen a silly thing now what they're saying is that in Harvard\nThere is this kind of quota system behind the scenes like you know like you could you know it's like what are you going for a job interview they're saying that I you know I'm Jen do that it's not based on the numbers it's subjective and they're getting kicked out when it comes to like personal criteria that there may be\nMaking up for ... and I agree with you when you go there there's a lot but they're saying if you looked just at the numbers it'd be a hundred percent most\nI guess I look to me the quotas than well more a filter or I go up there and I walk around the campus it started with I mean it's startling to me who are walking around Harvard and seeing how many of the universe\nBut Jeff this is how they are eliminating some Asians from getting on campus like Steve who was sent to Wagner instead of Harvard which are putting on my way of saying that Asians on these quote personality or measurements\nAre less light or don't have as much courage off kindness now come on you know the edge bogus Jeff yup yup that's\nThat right would take that hit it right now ahead you know that point yet but he took such a good hit\nThat's right he did so much better than the rest of the way we really don't get out on him or dodge wall\nIsn't that wasn't the guy who was

rooting for kids to have to read it wasn't remembers heavy called facts wasn't any one of the greatest pitchers of all time you know I Know you're going to say when you look on your cell a Dodgers\nCan you think of like Asian now football players who is not that many but let me tell you I Will say though that in Larry defense Curtis I Do think diversity is a good thing and I think I Do think that we should do something to get those folks better academically 'cause I think we can learn but I Do think they're a well rounded you're wandering ...\nJoined the military right I mean there are other places that are very diverse\nBut yeah I don't think you want a you know well\nBut what is very diverse is what we're going to discuss up next it doesn't matter whether you're Asian Judy
