bad I'm raising that crowd\nAnd it's a big it almost looks like a small city courtesy and I think of it why now\nWhy this caravan now certainly doesn't help the Democrats because it puts immigration up as the main issue right before the midterm elections which is a grand slam for Trump and the Republicans she's trying to get elected or reelected if they can focus on immigration\nEspecially when you look at the people who are just steaming north seeming to or not uh not obey any of the laws of the countries have just left Honduras they bump rush through the border Guatemala bum rushed to the border into Mexico now they're just gaining steam\nLet's see I think the Democrats I agree with you that I don't think it helped the Democrats but I think the Democrats some of them do think it helps them because it's like these people that are being you know only help\nCome anyway if ah by the time they reach the border wherever they end up whether it's the California border the Arizona border the New Mexico border the Texas border will have to see what you find a route to take\nIf the president would do a Bebe Netanyahu audit idea forces to do when the ... Palestinians broke through the fence ... gossip from Israel and you had the Israeli defense forces or shoot his first shooting a rubber bullets and then shooting real bowl\nYeah who's going to say they open fire\nWould've ... what'd you actually support the president look they could end up being a before long a hundred thousand and it becomes sort of like the thing to do join this march or particularly if there's food and water along the way what do you got to lose joined among near the border\nBut if they actually would have ... a rush to the fence and you could there are areas where the fence is not that are not that strong it's very simple it's very easy to get through\nAnd by the way those areas where there's basically no than current event I mean you and I both spent time down there to order where there's these huge holes I mean it's like there's there's basically just get on a boat and get a chance to get across the river UN's\n... at the present and have as an option using a bb did to stop the Palestinians from bum rushing from Gaza into Israel a few weeks ago\nLet's go to Rob first up in a cue from west Chester welcome to Kurdish and really Kashmir WABC Bobby\n... and I think\nShe later on that pizza guy right and look what happened so now enough is enough is enough for well to me I can we stop 'em right there so showed him if they come across shots right yeah you get shot well\nThen the Democratic whoever field yeah I'm going to say I think I like a robot bodies is not what the president wants right\nNow not heard about what the president wants to pay taxes I don't want those problems in this country\nOkay well you know that would warm the hearts of below sea and Schumer if in fact a military because the president said he would send not National Guard but the actual military United States military\nAnd it looks like a threat when you see this huge group I don't advocate killing them at the border but when you look one of the things that's really interesting criticize a number of people have pointed out that it is mostly men that there's not as many women and children and if that's the case it also makes it very suspicious is it really families pleading as they are claiming\nLet's go to Johnny in Brooklyn welcome to Kurdish and ready to Cosby uh WABC Johnny\nHey guys how you doing good where do you think Johnny\nFirst of all that to guide our way to set up a guy you know they got the river walk by for grants to grant\nThat stuck her dad's Curtis thinks that was laced with drama Johnny I\nThink it was a total at ten pies about a hundred dollar bill they're famous for their ten dollar prize but you're right why would they have so many you have so many great pizza parlors right in proximity of the fourth of Fort Hamilton army base\nMan very weak I now I mean come on and all they were set up a threat to bought a RINO as I can I buy now not electric cotton and they don't get this ... what are you doing out well\nAnd you can ... I think he's done I think you get an how right away\nBut remember if you have so many people rushing the border in different places you have the military in some places\nYou have an immigration a offices in some places you abnormal on law enforcement from those towns in some places all it takes is one mistake let's say one law enforcement or army personnel member fires the shot and it hit somebody\nAnd then they go down either they're seriously injured or they died that's all you need it's an international incident\nAnd then they riot too I mean you it it does is it really wasn't the one\nYou saw it and the guys who remember how they were rioting and it was setting up fires and then they were trying to storm the gate enroll through but remember\nRecently there was also that care of them were they were getting over the wall remember for a while like we saw those images there was nothing like the size of this though and that's why those pictures were very difficult than and you're right if something happens and I just this is a tough situation\nLet's go to Eddie and New Jersey welcome to Kurdish ...\nCourage we made a man who tried to pick the crowd you're going to do it\nNow me\nAnd my son that's for sure when you if\nYou know you could record Kurdish they are all because I Do I\nI Do have some illegal aliens in the guardian angels especially out and rent when it's a central islip battling image Thirteen who used to be a much Thirteen guys before we converted up so yeah yeah you know whoever gets thrown will convert them\nYeah you got seven thousand workers right there [laughter] what\nWhat reality is that's why they come across in these ah groups of like twenty five thirty fifty with the coyotes so they will not as easily be detected as if they come across with ten dollars\nRight right but there are hoping power in numbers and what the world is watching right now I'm you know Trump has talked about cutting off aid to these countries that have allowed them through you know the countries like Honduras Guatemala what is he going to do more to Mexico um I mean it's it's it is a mess\nAnd they're getting closer and closer to look at what the map now you're traveling all you know\nI'm telling you in this case I wouldn't 'cause I trust neither party they will use whatever means to see the vote and keep power or get power I wouldn't doubt that there are some sympathetic Republicans along the way who are making sure that these marches laws have plenty of food and water\nAlong the way to make sure they get to the border\nYeah you why you think that that see I think getting there but if things get ugly right at the border than it does not help the robot\nWas actually right but the point is is to think of it you you move a hundred people would cost money even in a third world country you move seven thousand probably ten maybe more by the time they get midway through Mexico\nYou know what there was that there was a helicopter that the George Soros dropping crates\nFood now several projects it will be nefarious because this definitely help strengthen the Republicans in the reelection battle in the mid term such good Antonio in the state of Texas Welcome to Kurdish that really caused me Antonio Hi Antonio\nWell I Would agree with that under one condition sure that you let them come through and you assembled a mall onto a freight praying and send them right back to the country fly them right back or even better\nThe best answer of oil would be to fly them over to Iraq go bomb it stayed in Hawaii a them let them dispensed the at the state and you know why\nI say I say I called bomber would love to take the man yeah well I have a feeling Hawaiian\nMight object yeah I think they ... mom is almost never and how how by any longer\nYou ... yeah he's watching Donald Trump from a few a few blocks away Adams Morgan right it is right then I got a friend who lives right across the street is keeping an eye on them\nBut anyway up next oh boy if all of a sudden you'll live your love life in the booth dwell a shorter hit ... and you still want to keep that relationship going you don't want to go in different directions you think there's still a spark available\nThere were a different ... trained it can be introduced to you both as a guy or gal that could inspire you to enjoy one another's comfort in the ...

folks dot com\nWell first there will be a a league of women voters debates are held\nIn in upstate New York with with all the candidates although the governor has and the Greek you that I've ever get to pay I I think the media you know I I get a lot of credit to the New York post and to others across the state your ran editorials and made it perfectly clear that it's not acceptable you\nKnow forty nine other states have one or one debate between the incumbent governor of their challenger\nA and and so I just think that the pressure of that sort of a you know public embarrassment acknowledging that the governor was either afraid or too arrogant debate um was was the reason that ultimately motivated to to do it I mean I I'm you know we'll see we'll see what happens but I I think that's what that's what drove this home\nAnd you know I'm ... and our our listeners obviously are very intent and following the case so closely tell everybody I Know it's being recorded tomorrow earlier and then it airs tomorrow night tell tell everybody where they can listen to it and and watch it\nSo I Will um I think it all air live on CBS Radio I've got to be it can be recorded on CBS Radio and an arid at\nSeven pm on boats CBS Radio on CBS TV and they've offered it up for their affiliates air as well so she'll recording it tomorrow at one thirty PM or it will be aired on CBS Radio and CBS TV at seven pm one hour or the governor I uh with uh Marcia Kramer and\nUh and and a red rich land right I get it right thank you and yet when I heard all about a moderating or a conversation about that important that she's facing New Yorkers which by the way causes me a little bit of problem tonight and I I you know this and I really feel up front I have to apologize to you\nOr you know the governor didn't give us much leeway on schedule or day or time so we're taking what we can get for New Yorkers but that means that I Need to a need to be a are getting ready to see things so I'm I've been a few a few ...\nYet and by the way we are sad about that because our big pubs in politics tonight we're going to have you is one of our featured gas but I Am happy again mark for New Yorkers as you say or that you're spending the time and that you're going to be with this big debate because he absolutely should debate you\nAnd understandably so that you're preparing for it but I Know we will definitely miss you tonight we have of course we got Bill O'Reilly and we got the medal of honor recipients and we have chele Farley who has you know was running for Senate um but we will definitely miss the mark\nWhile you've got a great line up and I and I I Believe me when I tell you I'd rather be with all of us a than\nA crowd by the way we are we are you ... you know you're gonna miss Curtis and I are a lot of fun you know you think we're during the day were fun at night\nWell I Will say this Kurdish has been to a few my town hall meetings and boy uh is is he a lot of fun to be around\nNow mark in the only debate at a Governor Cuomo submitted to end his primary against ... and it was what cash across the state but I got to be honest with you and all the places that I've\nBeen as chairman of the state reform party and that's obviously a line you're running on so I'm encouraging everybody hey you can vote for mark a Republican conservatives they don't need as much as we need you to vote for mark mowing\nOne of the reform party line but out in Nassau self snake Westchester orange Dutch is Rocklin and up in your area a while to mid Hudson people were really disappointed did they never once addressed an issue that was important to anybody other\nThan people in the five boroughs or will you make sure that these upstate and mid state to issues are dressed\nYes yes we are we are one state and the governor needs to speak for all of us in my my job as a candidate is to is to fight for every New Yorker and his governor to serve every new New Yorker\nI listen to the uh the the the the song that you played on on the lead into my getting on the on the air of course that was the theme song to the to the show underdog\n[laughter] right\nAnd and and underdogs underdogs need somebody to speak up and talk to them so my my role as speak on behalf of the underdogs across New York state ... what did they corrupted government the too often ignored their their issues\nSo what's your strategy without giving too much away mark ... an hour you prepare for this big debate tomorrow against Governor Cuomo your strategy because here's a guy who was a you know season politician been in office twice go in for a third term\nUm that was sort of that the way to kind of get under his skin or get a different answer then sort of the usual can't answer that we often hear in press conferences from him\nWell is it his answers or his answers I I'm gonna try witty and charming let's see if that works but um\nIt works with us [laughter] I ... in all seriousness\nI think we I think we lost smartly losing you'll get each interesting because upstate and the most\nRecent poll the Quinnipiac college will mark ... out in the suburbs outside of the five boroughs you slightly behind him\nBut he gets clobbered in the city uh on that note a candidate for governor mark mile an hour on the Republican against Germany and remember the most important the reform party line is joining us back\nMark ... this is a powerful for him to people living in the five boroughs also who in this recent poll Josh have you ... you know it's Seventy seven Thirteen whereas within the rest of the state you're doing well you just slightly behind in the suburbs and you're beating Cuomo upstate\nWhat can you say to residents in the five boroughs\nTo convince them that it's time to ask Cuomo because they seem to be in the bag for him\nWhile I listen I truly care about the issues that that New Yorkers face a if you're if you're concerned about the transit system crumbling apart because as governor doesn't want to take response where I Do and I'll\nI'll system will do this together\nAfter those families living in subsidized housing will lead paint and tainted water I get it I I grew up on food stamps I Know the challenge at and I know how government I can often ignore their needs I Want to help fix those problems I I Want to make New York city more affordable and more accessible\nTo the people who live here and that's that's my commitment and by the way it's it's my commitment to govern without ideology this isn't about party politics or partisanship it's about solving problems for ordinary people in my commitment is to do that\nYou know it's interesting mark mile an hour of that in many of the things and obviously it's a very it's a strategy by Cuomo he essentially says oh I'm debating Trump piece kind of trying to paint you with the Trump brush but the irony is you didn't vote for Trump\nI didn't but I listen to the end of the day we have a federal government and I need the federal government that focuses attention on on helping New York investing and infrastructure and services is governor wants to make it any the enemy of everyone uh you know it's it's him versus everyone else\nMy ... my job or if if given the honor of being governor is to get people working for New York people working in New York so that's that's that's the job I understand why he wants to talk about Washington and the president or it's the distract us from paying attention to the fact that he's led the most corrupt state government in America\nBut that said uh at the end of the day of my job is to light a fire in New Yorkers and and have them understand that we can do better than we are today if only we work harder together to accomplish real real solutions to problems we face\nNow mark ... campaign out there for you on the reform party line and become our neighbors revved up right but I always run into people who will acknowledge that Cuomo has been a crook surrounded by crooks and we are now in the most corrupt state in America I never get arguments from that on that but people will say to me\nWhat makes you think mile an hour all Republicans are any different aren't Dale cooks don't they all have the beacon the ... member they'll say to me\nLooking at scale ocean Republican and he went to jail looking Collins you just got indicted in Erie County luggage December we met up and run chess or how do you count All right dad when people have become so jaded so skeptical that they just think everyone in politics is corrupt\nWell first year\nEvery side has given them reason to believe that and and here's the deal right if if if I win and I believe I Will\nI Will have an opportunity to get this right if people need to understand that this corruption this corruption is stealing from taxpayers it's defrauding and sheeting taxpayers in my job\nI if given the honor of being governor will be to bring it to an end I'm not going Albany and make friends we're going we're going to go to Albany to make a real difference which means endemic corruption and pay to play a and the hand out to ... to the private interests\nAnd and demand devote on term limits will do all these things because I Believe that is the most important thing in the most important problem that needs to be solved\nNow if Republicans
