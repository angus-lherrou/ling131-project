if you're sweating or going in the water you have to reapply right after and applying sun block the key to this is applying it thirty minutes before you go into the sun so we're really how how often you replant thirty\nMinutes that's like was hired him as yeah you have to just a fulltime job [laughter] you know so I don't have a little bit but people don't realize they have to put the ... before

PHD a biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function and sell you the performance in the body he says after that that is simply\nSip heard at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated\nRecovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science and sports and exercise found that those who took\nFour milligrams adopted that than daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output\nThan those who did not take it so they fight fat learn\nMe remember that after that and it's one of the few\nThat fireball antioxidants that can actually neutralize three radicals even at the site of the mitochondrial membrane if like sailor body

this comes from after that the research published in the international journal sports nutrition November two thousand and alive and this was another study done with cyclists they took for granted\n... than than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists improved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race\nI mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like

show\nOh it's great to be here with you today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover it today packed today we're talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now pat a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea teen it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as\nWe get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nAn amazing story can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nA short pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single cylinder body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain\nStrength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're\nWorking out at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed\nHere's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had ... stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles now the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nIt goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pops up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger\nYou get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it lipic athletes have been using Korea teen for years to enhance his strength and performance tell me more\nWell this Korea Team is the premier\nSports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you used it body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThey came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes\nTo enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever a strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger and stay stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan style diet this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nHigh so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus or like you and me pat in fact let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals when I\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men study done it several American universities or group of men get this pet age\nThe nine Seventy two hey you know we know that's not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team they put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that\nIt shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat\nThey could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that they could generate more power on a stationery bike pack this happened in one week when I think about that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAlright but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well will it actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies gets stronger to\nArabs or ... let's go straight to another study loved the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older women published in the European Journal of applied physiology\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called every strong and it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\n'cause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here creating supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular strength power and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly\nThey go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly could potentially delay atrophy of muscle\nAnd unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right yeah\nYou're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us you would think this sounds too good to be true but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ever strong formula today plus the bonus bottle of ... energy melts\nJust by calling us at one eight hundred by eight zero eleven Seventy five you just pay for shipping that's one eight hundred five eight zero eleven Seventy five will give that number out again later on the show but first Dr Lehman now listeners can only get ... on this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right\nOh absolutely I Know it combines the Korea teen with vitamin D the coffee berry fruit ... be more on and for those who don't know talked about how these works so well together there's a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure cruelty and that's a purist\nFind as pre teen from Europe if you brought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D and it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not going to spend that today that with purity products and your name going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today it for\nYour job is to be one of the first thousand cause\nAnd take it seriously this the flies out the door and the big radio stations be one of the first thousand calls you could you'd be twelve and ... and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you\nKnow we want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it\nTry it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take and it gives people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottle today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these are days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing has become very big these days so if you're doing something like that to a jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDump it right into your juice dumping pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powdered they tested golfers and she already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFor teen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my face right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers call this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula\nThe product we are talking about right now the average strong power so double blind placebo controlled studies thirty golfers took the ever strong powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our original powder for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further ... not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster they\nGet older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job or you can read five hundred dollars on a driver up five yards right this is a sport team\nYards had people shouldn't just how how about this or your about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive than is more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board but again\nThese golfers one month on this ever strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine ... you get your bottle of every strong you don't tell your buddies take it for a month and you go out and you're banging the both fourteen yards past them they don't know what hit him\nWow I Would just got a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nYou know what pat my one concern with this show is that literally it sounds too good to be true right like when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up not possible right you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen\nI almost couldn't believe it I said to myself\nIf it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's just phenomenal and it's as simple as this you're going to get on the restaurants\nYou're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror and see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies

discussed that we are to the fruit XP remember that joined health\nWe'd have the coffee Barry extract that nominal at the opposite of their more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful

cameras that we had the everywhere in New York and it all and not only New York all these different locations\nSee with think mhm\nWell look the way that this was done it was done in a way that uh you couldn't easily track someone they put some thought into this um apparently they put thought into it and the way they constructed the actual devices themselves very simple they\nPut thought into the way that they delivered the packages so that it was done through the mail and if you don't have a you know you'd think that that would be one place where you could look at CCTV and I'm sure that investigators are doing that but\nWhen you don't have a suspect and you're looking at a very busy post office or you know or or a drop somewhere it's possible that uh you know that person could go undetected a there was a lot of thought put into this and and obviously when you take a look at the wide scope of people that have been involved um it's complicated\nVery complicated I'm Talking to Robert string who is one of the leading experts on terrorism security\nAnd investigative matters so people like the Clintons an Obama obviously have someone who goes through what is sent to them but\nNot everyone know much in that show how did they find it I mean suppose they had opened and it's only suspicious when you think there's something inside\nRight well remember our two former presidents household or the Clintons because of a President Bill Clinton\nAnd uh the Obamas obviously because of President Obama um have full Secret Service protection um and that goes for a lifetime they get that for ... yes I'm the others that we've talked about um don't have that type of a\nSecurity but they do have some security I mean even George Soros has uh some uh security built in around his state's in his homes and apartments and\nUh you know various uh he's got an enterprise enough itself separate from his business and it's well protected or most people with that kind of financial means a need to have some security set up\nUm but you know and when you look at congressional or former vice president of him looking at every one that's been involved in this has some type of security one way or the other um they're not at home opening their own male\nRight which which is certainly a release on the other hand when you send something to a major TV station you know in the building that has so many other resources in businesses that's pretty scary\nYeah it's very scary and you know as you look into it you know in law enforcement is doing this now\nYou know was it was it sent to scare the whole building was sent to send a message to CNN\nUm why these individuals' up and down the east coast for the most part um these are all questions that I'll have to be part of the equation so you're looking at you know where these were all sent you're looking at um what type of\nA bomb the says which was not sophisticated\nOr but nonetheless um something that could hurt or killed people um you you have to then you'll look forensic Lee at that in terms of how it was made and you look for DNA and fingerprints and all the normal things at one does\nAnd then you'll look at the intelligence of it all you know what this is the secret service have on file in these locations who could be a suspect in a case like this I mean it's interesting we have a few active cases in our office based here in New York\nWhere we work very closely with the secret service on people who have threatened our clients you know well known wealthy people um and the secret service does have a database full of information with people who have threatened the president people who have written kind of crazy letters that aren't stable there's a lot of believe it or not\nShown there are a lot of people out there that um they don't actually say I'm going to kill you but they are crazy and they're on stable and their continuously writing letters they're making phone calls they're doing things that are very annoying and ... and and frightening to the target but they're not enough to\nPut the personal way it's not enough to say you've threatened me and we're gonna wash and we'll know\nWe're going to lock you up so unfortunately people of wealth and people who have a you know high profiles and opinions um are sometimes a\nTargeted by unstable individuals across our country and in some cases around the world\nChoose interesting you know my generation grew up with mastering the art of French cooking yeah it was everyone shower president you know you lose you know and I loved it but they were complicated they're still complicated\nIf they if they hadn't said come on now she no no no right and I love ... that is a street food dish but when you're getting follows the flavor out of every ingredient that you're using\nShow you always told me this this passion started fairly early\nWell at that my earliest kitchen experience was burning down my parents' kitchen name which was the hand you so that was the it well it was the end you till I got married I got married when he was Nineteen years old\nStill married to the same manner um he never gonna leave with your food [laughter] Michael hold on how come\nBecause I'm like I wanted to learn how to cook\nAs soon as we got married I wanted to be able to have people come to visit and eat at our home that was I I just I had this mission of people being around the table and it's nothing has changed I cooked\nWell I could because I had to feed us but I also cook because I wanted to share food with Pete right and that you are right to it started early and it's never changed\nAnd then what was when you think about it because you know when I was growing up there if you're a kid came home and said I Want to be\nA chef you would think all the lower the flag is bad today zillions of kids they used to want to be in the movies now they want to run restaurant or a girl\nBoy have things changed yeah it's very glamorous to be in food now hard though people don't realize is so hard but when I got my first job in a restaurant kitchen I got my first jobs and then I got fired a month later but never mind smaller and I\nYeah well I kind of didn't learn\nUm I didn't learn because I still do the same thing I ... I got fired for I changed the recipe\nAnd it was probably a lot better I don't know if it was better but it was him with customers were expecting\nUm but when I got my job my parents were so disappointed I didn't graduate school and they were they thought I was going to become dumped Rory any state had this baking cookies in a basement kitchen and know it it it really wasn't glamorous for a long time\n[noise] [noise] well this new votes which is book number lucky Thirteen Baker says and it's good every day during the way I cook and well ... you know it's\nBeen so cold I couldn't believe it wholly October but you can go home and make turkey meatballs horrid shower oh I\nLove the soups and the stress a piece of the child or what loving a recipe is when you can play around with that so I make the recipe I share it with you and you can add what you love to it you can make a little change 'cause your family like something a little more\nAnd I have a child or a recipe it's called chowder always um the and it's I give you a variation for every season\nAnd you can make more variations if you'd like but ... this is a big moment for child her\nIt is and then since right and the turkey meatballs survey was so tempting well you can go home they make it ... it's easy it's turkey meatballs which are so great in the soup but would also be you know good in a\n... yeah I Love them was anything at all if you will as a sandwich or amount can take on the flavor of the broth and everything was ...\nExactly so they're flavored with there's plenty of ginger and lemon and all those bright flavors in it and then a very simple bras and some rice noodles delicious ...\nAnd one thing of outdoor his new book everything is very friendly like I turned to her hangar skirts day that can often be it's reasonable to buy but it can be tough but not this which is ...\nThat's the secret to getting right tenderness out of that cut yeah\nAnd for a very simple dish and yet so tasty\nLooking well and so we come back to this idea of adding something surprising in a into a dish that you really bring up the flavors and so the ... for this has a little little curry paste in it which was like\nWatch on the supermarket shelf so um I don't know if you notice Joan but I'm ... more now in Connecticut than in New York and I'm ... parish 'em and Paris until your heart my heart is in past\nUm but what's interesting is I think that this book is um more reflection of my living in nowhere Connecticut because I've been shopping in the supermarket not and cute little parish ... stories\nAnd so I'm said tie curry paste comes from the supermarket shelves this so I saw sitting next part of the marinate [noise]\nUm [noise] it's really I'm finding all kinds of ... in Florida it's in the ordinary supermarket that I can use to make flavors bigger and bolder and unforgettable\nYeah and it's really important or you know I decided that if this cold keeps up [noise] cold weather I Would make\nIs still with all ordinarily I Would not choose to mix due in October ... not a gang of October but we're almost do ready for your beef embarrassed to oh I Love ...\nI Love that still manage easy so\nIt gets its flavor it has this interesting combination of a flavor so it has beer [noise] but it also has a little bit of brown sugar and vinegar and mustard invasion as an ingredient yes\nYes and so it's nice Jews heart is Belgian\nBut ... ... ... if he feels very to me it feels very American and that the way that it's slowly cooked these flavors to have this little bit of thinking and onions and mustard and it seems silly sweetness and a little spice she is so good\nI miss another beef stew wrestling too which is a little spicy but not really enough to make use them I Can't eat\nThat I'm ... I'm I Need this through you're thinking of has a title reel to reel um but I think describes it subtly spicy softly hot so lately sweet needs to do and I made it the other night we were eight for dinner\nAnd I had two people there's just a little spice and they said just what you said it's like a sheep but not ... it\nDoesn't say do I need water I'm burning know what you need is red line which you know it's so funny [laughter] my husband's mother was a dreadful cook\nBut she did make one thing's stuffed cabbage so last week I said I'm going to make stuffed cabbage with apples and ... and ... and onions and tomatoes and I won't use beef because I didn't have it in the house I had to ground turkey\nBut you know I'm looking at your fabulous recipe mine melted in other words when it looked gorgeous but their meat was sort of like it came to the cabbage I don't know if I cooked into law school\nI Wonder if that was was the quality of you know the the that turkey has to be a friend a different texture and or for ground sausage and the way the way it except moisture V. cars and yet you want the inside of those cabbage rolls ... yeah\nYeah I had such a good dish really ...\nWell I Love it my mother in law made it my mother probably was good at such as your mother and now you're a mother in law not good [laughter] I'm putting my mother-in-law need stuffed cabbage and she always put a little catch up in it and\nAs I Do to be for just the same reason it's got sweetness you got a ... it works I Know a little\nBrown sugar in it and we tried that was all that other generations recipes on the other hand story can have your ... spaghetti\nWith their hair coming to walnut chicken yeah when I was interested in because as much as the ... I find them a little foreign you know every fight is\nThe senior and still added both from folks and an wrong not to just kind of change if the texture and keep the interest\nAnd you make chocolate pudding delicious and dark chocolate footing no cozy shack from the market for dory\nNo no no no no homemade and really you know it's easy to make I grew up on ... mix on mighty fire chocolate putting she's actually\nMaybe takes five minutes longer to make them mighty fine\nAnd he's so good because you get ...
