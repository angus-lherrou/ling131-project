minutes ah last night and then half and the bad governor Murphy surfaced from going out there and trying to get that crook Bobby Menendez reelected again ... who can who will be in Studio with us at two thirty today the Republican candidate\nBut he finally weight in Amish after he showed up a bit\nThere's no excuse for that so I I don't have a specific a forensic answer to that question in terms of exactly what happened but the notion of getting people if there is a problem getting them off the damn trains or into a safer place to place we're moving looks safe the uh is is a is a is a huge objective of arson\nKnowing mumbling and by the way he was being honest he doesn't know what's going on because he never writes New Jersey transit he never ...\nWhen you hear it you sit there and and just as bumbling there was no sense of self assurance there's no sense that he has any solution and remember when he campaigned he said I'm going to fix the system here we are it's I think it's one of its worse than I had ever seen and no solution and that's ... that's the leader of the pack give me a break\nA show was blaming though the form a Chris Christie shamu\nWho was a write off the Jersey shore and that sort of floating\nIn home Dale a red bank long brand\nWhich is the home of a assistant program director Matt job when last we had them in Studio he was a resident and that's where our expert right there on the run 'em let's just say diarrhea [laughter] why runners marathoners and others ended up having diarrhea and start taking poops\nAll over your lawn and all over your personal space\nAnd now he's going to find out that was going to tell us why New Jersey transit his poop and on us that uh it seems that these problems\nAre all involving bridges that are over a hundred years that you must take whether it's Amtrak a New Jersey transit to get to ... and you should have described as\nWell so these are problems that have been going on for at least a decade I've been working here for ten years and I've been dealing with the same delays for ten years just to get here just to get the lousy pen stage and\nIt's always a problem not not everyday but two days a week three days a week ... morning commute afternoon commute you always have some issue with one of these two bridges always impacting Northeast Corridor and north Jersey coastline\nNow when I see the bridges are what they call the swing bridges you on the show up and down bridges because all of a sudden they'll go up because there's some kind of water traffic going underneath\nI never see any substantial water traffic in Hackensack equivalent of narrative ... it's not like the streets or the Verizon or you know where you're going into the kill them caught on and on your ... tankers and cargo containers shipped why the hell do these bridges even have to rotate or move\nYet so yesterday I think that what they post was a marine traffic\nAnd that they know they said in the morning they ... traffic and then they open the bridge and then they said for that you know cause you open it for a big you know a big bowl whatever it is right and then they said they couldn't close it after a marine trafficking\nWill be sludge barges right you know simple sludge bar Jews they would figure you could re route ... lodge or if it's an oil barge or some other barge why you risk getting this broken down bridge ... what are you\nThinking right and it was going to opening and apparently it was hours earlier and they couldn't figure out how to close it bad I mean that's unbelievable right\nYeah and then again I guess at four o'clock they just deem did was stuck in there and that was a head of Newark between two copies of Newark was stuck and that just ruined everything because now you got your afternoon rush all these extra trench trying to run\nAnd that's why if you saw the images of Newark Penn Station it was bad downstairs here but Newark was even worse because that's up to ... it

the earth shining by the way there's an emerging Turks that are also doing the same thing\nBut the ones you can go at because he is at war right now with red China\nIs his birth tourism business five hundred companies in red China alone will coach pregnant women how to Deceive Us immigration authorities now this costs you a lot of corn I don't know where these read Chinese get the money and most have secondary income the cost of the trip\nWill cost you twenty to eighty thousand dollars and that includes medical expenses and\nSo they they they school you're going to America on a tourist visa that's why you're going they teach you how to hide your pregnancy with all kinds of tricks\nAnd they say when you stop by immigration do not say you're seeking medical services five hundred companies that are in business in China to do this they fly right near the JFK and they'll immediately in rural or yellow cab their way up to Jamaica hospital\nDeclare that they've broken some water they have to have a a operation they may be ... a few days the baby is delivered then taken to a safe house in forging AKA flushing everybody knows about it\nAnd then for ten days they sit there while the papers are process for the child but you see they don't stay in America they go back to China and this is all a hedge on the bed that eventually led China implodes and then they've got a one way ticket back to America\nRight just sick kid is an American citizen and they get another son\nAnd they get all the benefits to criticize I mean that's the thing and and by the way there are some companies I was reading about one of the companies it's not just a few days there are some that actually bring you in like a month or two or three so you don't look that pregnant when all you know it's ... it's like an orchestrated but it's interesting\nHow it's become big business and to your point Curtis it doesn't need to just be on it's not just the books are coming across the border it is places like China and other\nThings you see if the president would appoint out that the birth tourism nobody's gonna get upset right nobody gets up yet\nHe needs to make a distinction of these quote

work in the backs of kitchens a major restaurant\nYeah these are clear or do you write clearly orchestrate but what he didn't do it to your point he did not separate it you're right he just said okay you know what this but\nThere are people that agree with him and by the way there are also people that also feel that what he is doing is possible in the constitution their constitutional

means when he's talking about the\nOnly coming a DJ I'm tired of hearing people telling me what the president and means he didn't say it used to have many opportunities focus all they match you know or the\nEarly ... he did say anchor babies what I Do think he should never you never mind birth tourism Emma trying hotel what are the shows at all over the place he actually did but what he should do by the way he\nLied and said yeah but you're right Curtis she didn't London ... any should\nHe should die of rare you can't judge penalize the poor if you want the Americans to coalesce behind you look at these rich red China yeah on a dolphin dollars the pervert our system and\nCurtis he would be smart I think to do that first and then but but I agree with you that I actually think and I don't always agree with you but I Do think on this one\nThat he should actually do at first because you're right who is going to be against that that is such a blatant abuse of our system and it also

also re commit ourselves to each other\nFlights queens food you out of the stadiums and as you are [noise]\nScared [laughter] and what they're doing it for anyway [noise]\n\nSwear on your mother is still [noise]\n[noise] you're gonna do what do you use your judging\nBy the way that was one of the greatest movies ever I thought Jack Nicholson in that film and I'm a huge Jack Nicholson ... that was an amazing film the irony of it all is that he was playing double agent\nRight but he was a shaded ... and Jack Nicholson court that part of them and here's Jack Nicholson again playing Whitey Bolger the departed of\nShock through an FBI informants\nAre you kidding me [noise]\nTalk [laughter] do they know why am\nI gave up ready ready [noise] wasn't going down anyway ... knows enough\nAbout it you know not knowing the interesting thing here is is number two guy was Steven the rifle man from me\nNumber two guy he was like a what family the robot was to John Gotti senior but you know it's so funny I think Whitey he was such a figure barely anybody ever talked about is right in guy oh no no no no no he was information and in fact he had a girl friend Stephen the rifle man plumbing\nAnd he had told the girl friend yeah we're working with the FBI we're informing show he alleged Whitey Bolger no\nBold joke goes ballistic these shows I don't care if you're married to a I don't care if she's your mother your grandmother I don't care if she's the blood should merge and we got a kill her he word would ever get out we would be dead because people have ... which is why you got killed in prison as you as transfer the west Virginia\nApparently a cabal a mobsters didn't like Whitey Bolger because he wasn't cooperate or and killed him beat him to death but here it is\nHere Steven the rifleman ... girlfriend there in his house and then all of a sudden Whitey Bolger comes in and strangle her with his bare hands right in front of ... and the rifle man for me and saying you see is what we gotta do to eliminate anybody who can harm us\nAnd even the rifleman plenty who testified against him and he ... testified against John Gotti seniors shed\nI didn't do nothing he was the boss uh forget my girlfriend uh I was more a embed with Whitey Bolger they do is with my girlfriend which Naser characters\nOperated isn't that amazing Curtis to that that ... that was the mind set by the way federal prosecutors ultimately indicted Bolger for nine ... murders isn't that amazing Nineteen murders and people said that was just the tip of the iceberg\nOh but the interesting thing here is because of all a lot of our listeners they don't trust the FBI forever busting Italians in this case rubber busting Irish were of a bust\nIn his llamas because they think they are corrupted they think they're inefficient and they figure they stack the deck this was a clear case in which the FBI was corrupted because FBI agent John Connelly was in contact for Whitey Bolger\nIn front of me and so he would warn them when they were rage he would tell them when they're with people trying to put a hit on them from other gangs they would get them before they could be killed and everyone always wonder how\nThe hell was Whitey Bolger and his cool in the winter hill gang able to avoid getting arrested getting busted are getting executed by other gangs I was because it John Connelly who's now during forty years for helping the ... the ... as a warrant trouble\nAnd even ... who was the U.S attorney\nIn Boston in the eighties has been implicated and that's what surface than his investigation of Trump in the Russian connection\nHas been implicated in basically turning a blind eye to how the FBI dealt with the winter hill gang especially Whitey Bolger and especially the his right hand guy she was a rifleman plenty the other interesting thing that goes beyond anything that John Gotti senior was involved with is that\nWhitey Bulger's brother is the second most powerful political figure in all of Massachusetts yeah let me the Kennedy yes\nThat's what I was about to say here's his brother who is like the good guys supposedly um and then you've got Whitey Bolger was like two different brothers you could not have two more different\nBrother here he was he was president of the Massachusetts Senate for Eighteen years unprecedented he had all control in the capital in Boston\nRight there near the comment then he became the president of University of Massachusetts very procedures everyone kick kissed a William Bulger's talk is the brother of Whitey Bolger\nAnd then he was dragged in front of a congressional hearing in two thousand and three just like you're showing the godfather when Michael was dragged in front of the ... committee and basically takes the fifth one in this case Congress is asking him\nWhere is your brother public enemy number one Whitey Bolger\nHe took to fast he got dismissed as president of the University of Massachusetts he says I'm not telling you and my brother is I'm not telling you if I had any conversations with them while he's on the run I'm\nNot ... my brother out\nYeah that was I remember that was so powerful and now speaking of rotting Curtis\nThe new news obviously in the last twenty four hours a big headlines or coming that\nA Tuesday Morning um boy you Bolger maintain demise by a guy who doesn't like rats um this is a guy who's known for you know taken out other mobsters his name is Freddie give us some people call them pretty boy looks like a like a male model of you almost like of this guy very handsome guy\nAnd here he is this guy was involved in other heads with the mob he ended up being in this prison where Whitey isn't how transferred to and he and some other inmates are suddenly badly beat now in eighty nine year old wheelchair bound Bolger who gets transferred there are almost immediately homeless upon arrival\nAnd one of them actually had a padlock wrapped in a sock\nAnd Bolger was found unresponsive and the cell just after a day\nOr do you ask where were the correctional officers way with the Scrooge obviously they turned a blind eye to this too but Whitey Bolger is dead he's gone straight to hell without it as best as showed\nBut he was as infamous in organized crime circles\nAs John Gotti senior was here in charge of the game be no crime family our number one eight hundred aid for a WABC at one eight hundred eight for eight nine to two to let's go to Neal wants to weigh in on the deaths of Whitey Bolger murdered in a federal locked up in West Virginia that he adjustment giants but to yesterday\nA welcome to WABC Neal Hi Neal\nHow are you doing I think a little cameras locked down for the whole summer ended with a lot of murders or net beside the\nOh yeah there there's by the way there's been a history of murders in there because there's a lot of that um raise their\nPenitentiaries all the other countries they lock 'em down you know one of the ... or whatever killing ... now but uh he's almost Gregory Scott running up number Gregory ...\nOh my God I'm not I absolutely do I have an ...\nYear he was also the type that was a informing the FBI at over ... and also the yard and form your own or the FBI ... cells\nThey wouldn't form scar or it was just like the one when I'm guarded what was the name of the end of the ... the same thing in one of his uh when he was that the empty seats ended a boom he had this guy was a ... you know what all the time when he was ... and then he was transferred to an entry he was that on the on the yard and then they got there\nYep NPR but those carpet didn't meet a you know at the same reaction like on the street and you know couldn't just saying I remember communicating with scarp of years ago that that that's a fascinating case and that was right here in our\nArrows empty the still have blood on his hands on while I was reading a clean you up [laughter] speaking of blood a scarf or had age at age ... adding to the FBI right\nThe FBI assisted him and whacking out all of the mobsters who sit in his way\nAnd everybody always wonder I was ... head of the curve everybody wanted to kill scarf or\nWhatever something I mean do to overcome that older locker ... ah the FBI the FBI was\nProtecting their inform adjusts like John\nConnelly was in ... in protecting his informal up in Boston and some say the lower was us attorney in Boston in the eighties knew what turned a blind eye to it\nAnd how ironic that are here it is an informant because this guy has a particularly hateful view of informants because it informs somebody read it on him he doesn't like rats and so now he is apparently the celebrity at the prison for taking out a Whitey\nBolger down meantime our own Bernard ... hurricane a lot of Irish myth out there sitting shiver\nThat's what I was sitting there going to happen I\nMean how did these Irish Bernie is Ira's\nShow well that it should and remembered against shitty him to be the equal of what John Gotti senior was to some Italian so what what is sad I mean\nHere's this guy a you know ... years yeah the ... the legend a folklore as well but when he was found he was eighty one years old he was hanging out in Santa Monica almost in plain sight under a false name though and areas you know what a pathetic and to put right like horrible\nHow question for you to start fascination with evil\nWhat do you mean by I think people are I think it's such a psychological and don't you I mean if people are fascinated how could someone be this a horrible this uh evil this brutal\nWhen you hear that this guy was he liked to have people suffer and and women children I mean there was nothing off the table for this guy Bali\nThey only thing I think is it [noise]\nYes late sadly remember they have their supporters uh and they won't you know you got a new gym uh Ben Affleck I don't know what we had known for his alcohol problems by Matt Damon\nThey were at the trial in Boston on a regular basis virtually kissing up to Whitey bulging out some said they wanted to plays\nPart that's what I was about to lay over to do and yet they said they were fascinated because they got to know the hard but they\nGo up with the law just like our own ...\nRegime in every way because I was curious to see what can he looked like too like when when that famous scene that you were just talking about when he was busted in Santa Monica I think there was this fascination of what does this guy looked like now you know a bit on the run for ...\nAlteration he looked like Whitey Bolger and yet he
