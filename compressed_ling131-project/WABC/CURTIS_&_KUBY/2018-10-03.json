Years old he molested\nUp but he ... he said he put it in context of how some people cross the line and he and he said it wasn't like a sexual assault by what are you calling us it's touching somebody it wasn't like throwing somebody on the bed and Pentagon\nHands you ever said will go in for that unwanted touching you can go to jail for that\nUm I think is like Ninety percent of the men might be in trouble if that's the case\nLet's go to Bob rose calling a welcome to Kurdish and really Cosby he uh WABC Bob\nHi no one cares about Trump's taxes and regarding Cory Booker I'm shocked at it with a girl and not a guy\nWho by a bar where do you think of the keys Keith Ellison it is shocking to me in particular and that can come on you know\nThe why are they not raising holy hat and talking about a debate Barbara a double standard yes yes of course\nNow let me ask you a question barber no big deal about the taxes if he and his father if he and his father didn't pay four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in\nTaxes that yeah yeah so that sort of like\nIs this well first off this is sort of like when Leona Helmsley who used to be partners with Trump when they own the Empire State building together with our ... only middle people pay taxes right Barbara it shouldn't matter for the one percent in the rich\nGet anyway our idea\nShe now now people they vilify her because she didn't pay his taxes\nWell she had that little dog to remember the show was he may go in with our limits remember [laughter] and I'm happy about that I thought the dog was cute\nLet's go to John who's calling from North Bergen welcome to Kurdish and read the ... uh WABC Johnny, Johnny\nThere are two times ... mystery ship in talking to people so it's kind of marker\nCrime right away John that crowd like the the crowd was clapping big time\nYeah I don't have an issue with her and her you know trying to describe the perfect thing Scott loves the church and and help deal with the ... or anything or whatever primary part or he just while\nI don't know John John from a strategic point of view it did deflect the story because the number one story was him mocking forward on the stage in Mississippi and then not him and his father with their tax dodging which they made four hundred and Thirteen million dollars\nOr the Democrats would get through it once this or a church or why they should\nRemember every day every day every day is your new soap opera new novella new episode and his strategy was to break out of that mold where he was very very presidential you said hey you know\nA convincing testimony and if Kavanaugh has lied he has to go that was nice imbalance represent it was all Americans you know all of a sudden last night he was so partisan\nBut you know like Curtis that the tone even on Capitol Hill has been a lot more unleashing so I don't think it was a distraction it was if you take it home with the I think it was him\nSaying that it is time that the voters coming close that so far there hasn't been any core operation how do we know what I'm just saying what's been reporting are well he clearly I'm sure probably does now as Jumo lower members on Capitol Hill away\nSo he wouldn't know what the FBI has discovered\nKurdish been so many look within an hour I saw I mean you're pretending there's no limit on the CIA\nThe FBI is going to bring its conclusions to the White House first on friday they will disseminated to the Senate members away by the way\nIt may be coming sooner than friday there is even worse than it might have been coming the next twenty four hours or why do they have interviewed Ford die in ... I agree they should look\nGood and by the way this is all being done because you have to convince flake\nCollins and Murkowski well let me play even think it's nice you think last night's performance on that stage in Mississippi did a lot to move flake whistle blowing snow oil like had to say about his ah improv ditching and dismissing Ford last night in Mississippi\nTo discuss something [noise] just sensitive or credit for the rally to\nDrive just ride I Wish you have to\nKind of appalling well and I think I think that was damaging I don't think he should have done it the other thing even and play 'cause obviously a key one because he's one of the three or four that we have to keep an eye on and that clearly everybody seeing which way does he boat which way they're going to go\nThe other thing too you heard from Lindsey Graham and that is someone who was his biggest advocate my goodness that was a guy that all the headlines in that testimony hearing that we heard very much where he was going after\nYou know supporting cabinet daytime\nHe when he when he was concerned about a Trump as well you haven't mentioned\nOne Republican woman one Republican woman\nWho has come to the defense of cabin or the way Trump now is or Lindsey Graham is\nWhat no Lindsey Graham is actually Lindsey Graham also did not like the president kind of doing them off I understand but so you have to know that I I think it is I think he's got I think he should have just stayed away from it I stayed away from it but I think it's just everything is about\nTrump so if he can distract bad news about himself and entertain that crowd and he knows that's going to get the headlines by ditching and dismissing Ford who he said was a credible witness just forty eight hours before it's all about Trump it's not about the country of what's best for the Republicans it's always been about Trump\nI think he knows that he has been seeing the report as we all have that there are holes and he can't help themselves but to bring that out\nIn the ... when she gave them oh no I don't think I think he waited a little bit of time it was so compelling you still\nDon't really believe that that helped convince the wavering Republicans yesterday his performance on the stage\nYeah I don't think it's helpful but I don't think it was a big distraction game as you're saying\nLet's go to Johnny in Brooklyn welcome to Kurdish and ready to Kashmir WABC Johnny [noise]\nI don't I don't have the courage to tell you that I I'm Sorry what is the question because I started falling apart and they need to beat up on what\nOh that's interesting because it's got any data that's a story they took many months to prepare that's not something you could whip up all night when you look at all the documentation that they had to\nStart with whipped up yesterday and I am a mini Mart\nWell I'll tell you how things go on the news business people hear rumors ... like the New York or does or the post us for the wall Street Journal or other publications\nAnd they'll steal the story and run the story in advance of your story even though you may have the full data they were on a limited edition story to beat you to the point ... times while you\nYou lock her up absolutely so let's find out why what\nWe want because some have shed the FBI has finishes report as of today\nWell I don't get that I agree with you there are so many chemicals here and the fact that they haven't spoken afford even though they say they can rely on her testimony they're trying to get also her therapy notes remember which is when she spoke at their therapist about a Curtis\nBut despite that I agree with you you got it look she ... she didn't have to buy a long time answered a lot of questions but I'm sure that there are other question she did not answer and I do wish the FBI would\nTall next president warns all mothers out there lock up your sons because they're an endangered species but then said women oh they're doing okay I just ...\nThrough a number of reports of sexual assault all of them involve young men assaulting women\nI mean it happens the other way too but I mean I ...

years old\nOh he's not going to use the age to welcome or come first one what is the way it doesn't matter I don't care I don't care how old you are you spend the rest of your life after but I've seen\nThis one used when it comes to animal cruelty and that is he comes from a third world country Albania eighty percent of the population is Muslim about twenty ... and they have third world wage their their views towards animals are not like they are in the United states\nLike my friend who you are you're saying that he's going to say and how ... what the cost of Mr kicking throw dogs out of

as usual really good on you and then the Kurds I Love all the stuff you guys are doing it for these animals um anyway I really I'm not sure exactly the like the center they should get but I really do think that some kind of system or\nPeople that you kind of sadism to animals really should be put on some kind of list I wouldn't be surprised that this guy has done other similar things to people he has control over in his life in the past when it gets really frustrated\nWhen I'm are actually you know what it and I'm thinking of courtesy you think of like Jeffrey Dahmer and all these crazy horrible like serial killers ally with here that they were with animals doing something terrible you\nBring up such a common sense point but there is no animal abuser registry in New York that's one of the campaign platform said my wife man she's running for state attorney general on the reform party\nAnd there should be that's a great night yeah that there is and yes there is\nNo because again elected officials although mark many of them have dogs have cats and not abusive towards animals they've never prioritize animal rights animal protection like my wife and she says no that's my primary concern\nAway highly ... Nancy is doing that Curtis because quite frankly and you and I have covered so many of these cases where there's always usually and so I\nI Would think like the real extreme cases of serial killers and others they always do something whether it's a dog or a cat you always hear about these crazy things that were in their use ... kids experimenting it's a warning sign\nSo I got a call early this morning from a fairly flipper Joe Vitale our producer for ... for her and she said hey can you have Nancy come in tomorrow because she also got to preserve in court yeah shitty human ... with the ... the guardian angels we'd like to interview or at seven forty tomorrow\nI said can I come into affiliated for that you know we're not interested in you\nKnow it well then she liked flipper more now she's got high standards that we don't want you to them all flipper very large me slippers even smarter than I thought oh let's\nGo to ... to ... in Brooklyn welcome to shout here uh WABC sell sell\nSuckers curse you know was going to be that he's insane and Saturday he lost his mind Seventy seven he's an old man you know taking medication that's going to be there for like\nA terrible pathetic don't you think ... absolutely correct\nBut you know that's going to be to play\nI Know we gotta you gotta throw the book at people like this and set an example cell you can add some guy to oh I'm too old or or it's my culture or whatever it is give me a break\nWell you know the defense attorneys gonna be grabbing anything\nYou can do yeah he should be grabbing the truck and he should be thrown out of your truck just like the dog was\nA please go to the Kurdish and Cosby Facebook page and you can read all the details say in what was involved in catching or at least forcing this guy to turn himself into the police let's go to Mitchell India part welcome to Kurdish and read it costs me ...

know I mean you can throw him in jail for life like as if it were human victim you're going to get some blowback from what\nI tell you I tell you what we'll do Michel will keep you in the loop because a lot of times these cases fall through the ... yeah that's all I Know the Nancy and those that were pursuing this Beagle beat or will be in court and monitoring it\nAnd we'll let you know how it
