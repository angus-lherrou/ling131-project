I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza there a trial I've worked with scientists in Europe and also in California and she'll lay on south\nAfrica all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientists than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit and was there a troll from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human different spiritual why did you want it combined three there's always a method to your your madness\nIf I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other works better you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all in\nSeparate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and\nWell that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what you've seen recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal\nAnd it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti opposite activity in whole blood get assigned to recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume that don't actually\nWind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which are protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body\nFrom premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in the right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are\nThe right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue the thigh bone\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to fire on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nAll right let's switch gears and talk about this for human which is number two on Ulysses by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula\nWill be offering free bought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human which is spelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know was one of the most powerful super feeds on the planet\nIt can positively influence our D. N. A. maintain joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible\nHeadlines on human and tell us why you use this and we talked about this off here a few minutes ago this patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of Kirk human with seven times greater absorption\nOkay well first of all I think while people might not know the term curriculum and they may well note ... group which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of it\nFive thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying tumor wreck and its derivative ... since the Nineteen seventies and I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied as there's\nA couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined tell so if people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that\nThree of the biggest superstar protective health and Hansing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply\nSaying that you can get in a capsule and a good liquid soft gelatin capsule what you'd otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine and are now in this new green T. C. R. formula purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to you I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brand new\nWell I especially like the liver protective heart protective\nAnd joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact\nBlood studies show that newborn babies contain two hundred industrial pollutants in their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning\nSuper healthy very strong liver we might not think about our livers that much but we need that and we know that Kirk human protects deliver it detoxify deliver it keeps a strong\nFrom a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint we have in numerous ... studies showing overall improvement in joined health and relief\nAnd stable inflammatory activity better joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk him and\nI like the brain protective studies as well you know I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind and Kirk human delivers all this so I regarded as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware path that most people are not going to eat enough rock tumor recruit\nTo get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated Kirk human extract\nI don't want to remind people did in ... now to get started with the free bottle green T. C. R. purity products this is their unique green tea formula secret human and the spiritual ... today just before Ninety five for shipping coal now are breeders are standing by one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero\nFive again one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five year old right next to this you know Christian I don't want to get to technical here but these ... oxygen green tea or classified as wholly females\nAnd there really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists but didn't use green T. C. R. formula there's more tempted green tea ... human the spiritual we talked about\nClass grape seed extract pine bark bio ... vitamin C. you talk to me about this is ray of really super anti accidents poli funerals for the for me\n[noise] well yeah I won't say that we kind of went over killed but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here\nGrape seed extract and pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds\nThat not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue\nIn the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for extra boost in antioxidant activity but also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the curriculum and then there was there a troll the bio flab annoyed and hence\nThe overall activity of vitamin C.\nAnd vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen if we put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C. we\nRealized that we would have an utterly superior formula and just to reiterate pat I Want people to experience dynamic health I Want people to feel great this formula the green tea CPR will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nNot Christian I Love this green T. C. R. combination four million remember to see our stands for human inner spiritual loved that was his complimentary bottle today our listeners to get started for free that's great value what would people expect to pay if they bought all these symptoms used or\nWell I think if they bought high quality products that contain these ingredients they'd be into it for about Seventy five bucks or so possibly even eighty\nSo they wind up spending appreciably more than they're going to spend on the green tea see our formula and they still wouldn't get the grape seed extract they still wouldn't get the pine bark extract the bio lab and always or the vitamin C.\nAnd Chris what kind of results people expect to see what can they expect to see a once they start taking this morning\nI think that people will feel greater joint mobility and comfort\nI think they'll feel more energy\nBecause these ingredients also help to stabilize and maintain natural healthy blood sugar control I think they'll have more sustained energy throughout the day and I would just suspect that people will have an experience of greater vitality when you detoxify the body\nWhen you have a more highly functional immune

these women none of their allegations nobody else made these kinds of accusations that those six FBI background investigations are apparently irrelevant we need to know just in time for the mid term elections\nHappened to you know what happened what have you ... grade right you've been working steadily for the last couple of years happily yes yeah that's nice\nYeah and then a good friend of mine Jim Heineman we met during Mary Poppins and rising ten for this play [noise] and uh we've been talking about it and developing it for years and then he took a leap of faith on me and said well would you like to direct\nYou mean you didn't say to him you know I'd really like to direct\nI didn't really I mean I've had opinions or the Koran and my career that I shared with directors and I've worked with some amazing directors and learned a lot [noise] but um it was really he and Tom ... um were acting in the play in basically Tom's living room trying to stage it\nAnd they asked me just to take a look at what they've done because these two actors play about twenty different characters so I was trying to get them transforming in a way that's clear and uh to make the story makes sense and so we just started in that way and her her ...\nAnd did it feel good right from the beginning\nIt did I mean it's daunting it's a lot of responsibility and a lot more emailing than I expected [noise] um but ah I just uh it's about having an opinion about what makes sense um what might make things clearer what my main thing was true or or funnier and uh they've put their trust in Maine which is wonderful\nRight and as an actor who's done so much funny stuff and farce and everything else you really have a better insight take it's I think\nBecause you and I was going to and from all around it is true\nOne of the greatest challenges and it's it's a fun challenge is I'm giving actors guiding actors towards funnier choice without giving them a line of reading and I'll be fair I'll be honest I have given a couple of line readings but as an actor I like Atlanta reading actually gets right to the point sometimes uh-huh\nAnd so let's take our audience back I'm Talking to a Christian boroughs who's not only a wonderful actor and has worked constantly in the last couple of years but he's got a new show where he's the director popcorn falls\nRight into Davenport theater on west forty fifth street so all this\nBegan way back when [laughter] and what happened if you knew\nWhen I was born in a very early age yeah injured Pennsylvania and then somewhere around my formative years of fourteen Fifteen I knew\nYou and not just going from party the party like other fourteen year old ...\n... no I actually didn't have a sip of alcohol until college\nMy father said to me freshman year and he said if you can look me in the eye and told me that you've never had a drink or smoke a cigarette on your graduation they'll give you a thousand dollar if you're kidding which in Nineteen Ninety One all my money\nAnd I ... I was just never tempted even with your friends and yeah I I hung out with a very a sweet funny group riding home and they were much more focused that's right I'm making up for lost years now of course\nOkay it worth you know I remember I'm finding my grandfather's scotch\nOh we're going there okay yes I Do on big and it tasted so mean to me like Madison mean you know I was so thrilled all my girlfriends were asked to look when I found\nAnd we all took a little shy and we were like ... and it was so I you know I thought it was going to be something fabulous yeah flick ambrosia exactly happy to see is a rather liberal I\nWill tell me you developed a taste for it now otherwise I'll be heartbroken\nScratch as much as like a direct connection yeah fewer a pretty good but not not a big deal give me a better cooking and I'll take a cookie\nAnd I understand so that's no water and that cup\nNow that's a little to get us through them and or an editor knew a little like so you were focused early on and your father was dangling a thousand dollars at the end of the polling you sell when you went off to school was it to be an actor or to you\nKnow it was I went to Carnegie Mellon which is a ... and so it was four\nYears of rolling around on the floor and black clothing and not a lot of history classes um [noise]\nYeah but I mercifully I had very um my parents were highly intelligent and growing up I had enough of an education in the house and a great high school at once I got to college it was all acting all the time a little bit of dancing a little bit of thing\nBut you know that that she can go to Carnegie Mellon there a couple of schools that provide this yes that are good so then you came to New York\nI did I moved here straight out of school in Nineteen Ninety five and knew anyone or I came with a Merce if we had a nice group from college and we were our support system and then you just slowly start working what happened to my first job was as a an elephant may see Santa land which is like acting exactly but not quite [noise]\nAnd then uh yeah I slowly started touring and you know pay my dues in Europe and around sets your car and here I go to the car and I did\nSo when you look back on all these shows what was the one that had the most impact on your life when you said it's okay I can breath\n[noise] it was really ... it was a learning from those incredible people like my muscles his view has a working on stage with David Hyde pierce and sell them firing and Hank\nIs area I was a master class and um they trusted me with five beautiful little nuggets of rules and um it was the first time that I felt like I was coming into my own\nAnd then it just kept on going to Cincinnati it kept on going so and now that you not only have one ... directorial debut is about to happen ... here now you're going to have to write all your own material\nI dabble in writing I just use big words and someone else stressed out together you know\nThat say well let's give the audience a little peek at what popcorn falls is all about\nGreat it is a two hander meaning to actors play different roles and it is very funny but the thing that I have been working with Jim Heineman the play right over the years\nIt's been aiming towards is it's not a farce it's not crazy comedy I Want it to be very much grounded and earnestness and sweetness and the story is actually\nVery moving and it's about a small town called popcorn falls\nWhich is like a lot of American towns as a having a hard time and so I don't really swallowed up by a larger town and the only way for them to see themselves as for the mayor and the executive custodian of the town hall to wrangle that dozens of popcorn falls to put on a play and hilarity ensues\nSounds good to me when I first heard about it I thought it's got to be a farce you know two actors twenty roles door shutting but still it takes a lot of delicacy to breach that line it does we\nLeave us that we sell us early on a physical vocabulary that made it very clear when one person was becoming another character and each character has its own kind of signature posture\nOr um gesture and I'm the first ten Fifteen minutes you're teaching the audience what this is going to look like and the fantastic alchemy that's happened I had a friend come last weekend who's not big theater goer ... he was astonished that they just became the evil\nAnd this is my favorite character as a character named Becky who was a bartender that just came back into town after being away and having a child\nPlayed by Tom ... and all he does is tucked his hair behind his ear to become Becky\nAnd she has the sweetest soul and you forget that you're watching Tom ... who is dressed as a custodian right without named type but says Joe\nAnd there you are with that key with your hair behind money that's really beautiful but that's the gift of really being able to interact and your actor hearing you\nYeah it's nice to\nSell the work is when you direct as opposed to act is it the same work the same pressure like I always wondered when you have so many lines how how you deal with that at all\nWith the slow it's fascinating watching actors work brilliant actors because [noise] they're very focused at that's very myopic work their focus on their own task and I've never felt more patient throughout a process of watching them go through\nThe ... the process of\nNot knowing it we have a new actor Jim Heineman had been playing Mr trundle for years and now I wanted him to step back and be the play right on the side of the table so we hired Adam Heller who's a fantastic actor an old friend of mine and watching Adam learned to play and all of its intricacies over the course of three weeks you know he didn't know it at first and he was struggling\nAnd watching him work I never felt more calm that we would get there because you knew and we in time and we still have time we open in a week\nYeah like they do well or we can be a long time in the world a theater when you think back by Carnegie Mellon and your group and your network would you tell kids who wanna\nThat they need to go to places like Carnegie Mellon or Yale School of drama Juilliard does that an actor make I think it is tablet shes\nA vocabulary for learning when you get out into the real world and as I think one of the greatest pitfalls that we're living in right now is that everybody wants to\nBe an instant star of over there I don't want it I found they don't want it to or you've got to pay your\nDues you have to be disciplined and those schools really do teach you how to come here and not be fully formed actors I was Twenty one when I got here what did I Know\nAh John is all I Do is watch TV and read and it's sports news politics whether you're talking about Brett Kavanaugh Donald Trump\nThe New York giants or the Yankees not take it on the red Sox in the playoffs I Know about all of it so it's not hard for me I've done this my whole life I started my career in sports so for me this is actually fun\nBut how did you get started in the sports was this year was a kid obsessed with that says\nMy dad was my coach writing own play I played football baseball and basketball huh so I was a skinny Jewish asthmatic I wait and my mother would yell at my dad taught me why do you how he's going to get killed out there was a skinny as kid on the field I have my inhaler in between ... you can make it up but\nI was good I was a good ballplayer and my dad was a terrific coach and we got very close so I played for him and then we go to events together Shea Stadium for games so\nI'm very close with my dad to this day and a lot of our bonding growing up\nWas for us right it's true my kid\nYou know my husband was like you love smarts played basketball did all this stuff [noise]\nMy kids were not into sports either as my son and not at all yeah so the biggest proudest moment in my husband's life was we had a farm in Vermont\nAnd the kid we ... we in a baseball game what do you do in Vermont you shop for antiques and you're playing faithful cows and ski so they can't\nHe had a glove his father gave him his cherished club\nAnd the kids or ball coming towards him ... terrified that he was going to be hit he put his hand with the gloves in the air he caught it he caught them oh my God this is day all of his father never ... ... not that long ... as a wonderful story when Sean caught the ball totally by accident\nIs grace you know and and and the same thing with me I've got one son right and you know he'll be ten in November Gabriel that I Love 'em to death and one of my wife was pregnant with the first time she's like you can have a little boy and like I don't want a boy\nI was working in sports

the giants he can tell you poor thing is is on the next doesn't watch sports not very good at sports he likes to read he likes to play Fortnite and I as a dad could not be happier\nWhich is great you 'cause you're taking the heat all these kids especially New York kids have too much anxiety too much heat on these records whether it's sports whether it's academics and they can't be kids so you are doing a great\nIdea thank you does your daughter place for now and then she doesn't it ahead and you know we grow up they grow up I should say in Boca Raton yeah 'cause it's perfect for ... and she was still is a tremendous tennis player\nHave actually used to train with a guy named Rick may see he's got one of the biggest autonomy says a lot of very famous yeah he trained Jones six number one players in the world including the Williams sisters Maria Cheryl pa Andy Roddick you think your daughter has it\nShe did and you know it's funny you say that she was becoming that good right and then we moved from Boca Raton Florida to New York city to get it\nForget it he actually tennis but it's not as well we don't go to John McEnroe is placed on windows it was a very close with potshots rather she didn't like it I mean the truth is or she moved to New York and she decided hosts sport\nWas going to go from tennis you what are you with us it's a brand new sport it's called Starbucks was she sits around was on a gland New York all my gun and she's not catching trying you know I spent two hundred thousand dollars on tennis and she's sitting in a coffee shop for now she's going back to\n...

started together ... years ago and I'm Still here\nThere was the year that Donald was running against Hillary was telling me for political talk he voted for Donald I voted for Hillary we fought every single day it was wonderful a then now we tend to agree because even though I voted for Hillary I'm an adult\nI'm going to do them on a child and I can admit some sort of good job don't like when he talks should have told the other day about this young lady but I worry about the economy great but I says gun I worry about the GDP great so\nRegardless we've come to notice at the station that too much political talk is no good\nFor his weight turned off its too nasty I Know every big stationed joined across the country these are statistical Fox not my opinion that was doing a lot of Trump told the last year the numbers of plummeted\nAnd I said this before my station even told me this I said let's do more sports let's do more entertainment let's bring Jonah and talk about the Tony Award\nYeah let's talk about things that we really can laugh how fun right change get our heads out of the jurors\nRight so and sue Roosevelt goes a Sunday Morning sport show which already has proven statistically enrolling you on that people want it already tell everyone what time of year on I'm On eight to ten and a half the time perfect time um that me move that may move but for now it's eight to ten am\nAnd I'm like you said it's every single sport oh we get the some of your morning there was one of the great interviews and ... and you know off on your like the show\nNow I you know working

Nick players Rangel players in New York the liberty the female role here they're all here so uh it's a fun exciting place to do it we want to move away from all parties and conservative even though you're not thank God I don't want to\nDo we want to have a good time we have a good ties and match what radio was all about I Want to hear opinions but I Am so sick of screaming yeah I did go let it go I'd rather know where to eat the best pizza where some juicy gossip about a\nBase Paul ... and that's what Bernie and I have done and again it's worse than in numbers we can prove it to you much of it should go into some of the old time listeners\nWho want us to go back to talking about every little political thing going on today but we can prove to you numbers in revenue that is not what people want like we talk about what I Wonder is about twice you'd get pizza\nI use Syria I'm asking you well besides phony going in Brooklyn that's the best you know what you should really go to Brooklyn from Oregon\nAnd have and when pizza's good and if you're ever on the stand of Long Island [noise] go to Sam ... it's been around forever\nAnd they have paper thin individual pies like nine bucks for you can sell with six slices but little you know into the life is so good do you love pizza love\nPizza eat it at least three times a week it's actually good for you before I work out with weights and

really scary [laughter] like she was just take care of I died of us\nBut I Will ... will tell you one way up there on I got your opinion on this going to the drone Hamburg where could I get in the city not Brooklyn in the city where can I get the best corn beef sandwich on other counties\nIs close to me the vast corn beef sandwich is cats is I don't care where you go catches delicatessen and I go there\nAnd it's funny because that used to be Jewish have and yes now it's you'll hear Spanish or more than your hair\nChinese everything else but you stand at the counter and the counter man ham slices and feeds you while you wait for your order I saw in ... and this is supermarket chain called Martin Williams\nIt's all over the city in Manhattan yeah in Manhattan I'm Wondering I was ... okay and\nThey have a huge takeout bar you know and they have hand caught thick corn ... little potatoes cabbage not the kind of corn beef sandwich we're talking about that's catches rights and that's good\nBut pastrami clean on Lexington Avenue is already good is very very good I like it not catch says is the best and the second avenue deli Hawaii as a secondary and this is a question why is it on
