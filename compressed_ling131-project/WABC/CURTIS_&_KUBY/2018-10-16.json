TV networks E. R. T.\nV. and by the way he was on Fox all the time I mean I first got to know who he was because I Would see 'em all the time on red on you know the late night show there um with Greg ... he was sort of a picture on that show many many weeks and\nI never sort of saw this extreme always obviously very conservative they they know what I didn't see that hard hard core\nYeah these boys have been saying we want to beat the crap out of anti ... wherever they are let's take you to the streets ... dust each\nOther up they moved to battle\nBut this is what their leader now you can identify a leader with problems you cannot identify a leader with active for that is one of the problems so naturally the Proud Boys is getting the bulk of the attention now\nWe got here through the card up there and comfortable revolution\nTrying to construct television document where were you great to be free from guaranteed and keep government\nCountry founded by a triborough race as a country bell got an idea if you're in your work\nGovernment says because of the\nBut it's also a conservative value the founding\nRepublican after all they were\nWell by the way he wasn't like that on Fox where he was he was a lot more time\nYou could have fooled me that the founding fathers were Republican\nThey had differences of opinion amongst one another we're like you're going to anti crowd boy you know all stuck ... well that's fun Proud Boys just such a look at the video\nThat's the point here beating each other and ... and I'm curious for listeners who do you blame and this may lie because it like you said it almost looks like a U.S the fight Curtis\nEverybody has a right to free speech and has a right to free speech I remember leaving high school I went to believe it or not an energy calm French in Hunter College in the cafeteria\nWorkers go for my first question the why shouldn't higher than I Am as if you're at ... how could you have a conference because the consequences organize it goes against your great writers were shot and they looked at me like a you know I was the anti Christ with six six six on my part but likely or\nAnd I and I am sure so we clearly have these two groups that are battling away but why the metropolitan Republican club would give an invitation to a guy who was the leader of the Proud Boys and encourages them to do battle in the streets were that there was a\n... a beyond anything I could understand you just look at his social networking but he they're not alone which into our own ... pretty pretty intelligent young guy look how he's been bamboozled by McGinnis and the Proud Boys spent\nFour yeah making it to the leader of the Proud Boys now again the media have labeled the crowd was white nationalist broke their members of the Proud Boys who are white nationalist yeah and it's not a white nationalist and they'll gather in Yemen is not a white nationalist so now\nMembers of the group a white nationalist but not having the leader\nAnd that's where maybe the confusion was because maybe the metropolitan club invited gathering and his group and knowing who he was re does he was at Fox\nI Want I Want you to say no but I Want you listen to ... to ... he is in his comment listened to what he said again\n... the leader of the problem now again media have labeled the Proud Boys white nationalist broke their members of the Proud Boys who are white nationalist Yemen is not a white nationalist and again in Yemen is not a white nationalist that's I think that\nI'm the leader of the guardian angels and you could shake Curtis is just not racist\nAnd and also going to fix the roof metropolitan Republican collateral damage was you know watch out watch the swimming and oh yeah I I don't think they should not have to pay come on\nWhat Jack said they would be hosting McGinnis there with the Proud Boys and then claimed they didn't know what he was a book well\nThen you were saying that you think that Ben Shapiro new I don't think ... ... ... the only guy you know street I think Ben knew who didn't know that he ... everybody that's our way\nEvery day but when we social networking water bed Shapiro let's go to Joe a welcome to Kurdish and read a Kashmir WABC Joe\nHey Curtis area so I'm going to take a little bit of a different stance on that and again I Would never sign up for either organization but I'll say that okay I watch this from afar\nI like what the Proud Boys do it and let me tell you why okay add the fuck\nHave been cowards this whole time covering their faith they can't fight no good on not go for anything courteous and then all of a sudden they'll have a tendency to poke the bear the Proud Boys and you know what the Proud Boys get throw some hair\nAnd quite frankly I think they're getting their come up and acting like complete a market these past three or four\nWork but if you will in your mind Joe what you don't want to like be pushing both sides lust for battle Rachel\nEnlisted yeah and that's what they read I understand why you would say that\nBecause you know I 'cause I think we're getting into extremely dangerous territory when I see the rhetoric in this country and then I see these two sides very desperate side going to battle it scares me as an American and that's where I'm coming from a child\nBut I have to tell you the Trita I had to tell you that antifa has run all over the city for\nA long time and great roads and I'm not saying what the Proud Boys are doing it right I don't support them at all\nI Love ... well yeah that's where Democrats need to have\nSome ... says we talked about on the show and say we do not support these activities so it's like they're afraid to speak out against them I mean you got these guys literally they were down there were right walking right by our building right here saying ... da da da da da da ... we hate all that and then they hide behind their little math\nYou know shame on them and shame on the Democrats are not\nGoing to get out of Iowa hero bench bill goes home again it's the Proud Boys she's not a white\nNationalist but he has white nationalist into group well how do you have white nationalists in the group you can tell them we don't want\nYou in the group well I'll tell you I didn't know who the Proud Boys where did you know I didn't know where they were OK I'm happy to say I didn't know they had their happy bad and it was badly I knew in ...\nThat's why say bring them up to the same marriage parts job lodge but these white boys from the suburbs beat each other's brain job and then let the brothers have whoever's
