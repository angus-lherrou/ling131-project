are staying quiet\nAnd waiting to see what happens with this caravan but it's a whole moron for Donald Trump and trying to bring in battle congressional districts or Senate this year but\nThat's why he's trying to hit it and you're right he's going over the top and hitting it but he's trying to highlight the fact that when you see a group of so many men that are coming over Curtis I mean you wonder are there I I Do you can't believe that they're all leaving because they're being politically persecuted leaving their wife and kids behind in most cases it I'm just saying\nThey are the president talks about legal immigration and he's right people have queued up they have jumped through the hoops save a they bite at the time but they're not going to get hired to go pick crops in the field shit I'm going to be hired to prepare your meals in the kitchens of restaurants you know I'm going to be cleaning the plates awful bussing tables\nAre those are the illegals do are rarely do they hire legals who have just arrived and into the country because they obviously want more pay more benefits and you're going to give the illegals\nSo the reality is our business is promote illegal aliens coming across the border they need more workers that's how they get in here and that ...\nThat everybody in that care of them is a is a good person totally saying you know ... and so I think that his point even though it goes way too far he's trying to highlight that point and how dangerous but this is what it was\nAnd it always does he already has a home run he wants the grand slam against greedy and now says I'd like to know if anybody out there\nActually tell me that there are members of ISIS al ... the highly bon ... somehow infiltrated themselves into this a long line this caravan now there's a second Kara fan that is following behind about a thousand\nOr let's say by the time they eventually reached the border it could be twenty dollars and fifty thousand and they could be multiple caravans\nIt really I mean that's enough of an issue right there I think most Americans would say yeah I think the president and his shop to care of and I don't expect him to let them into the country and for them to take advantage of the situation because they coming across in large\nNumbers one eight hundred eight for re WABC as one eight hundred aid for re nine to two two\nAnd I will say it is an ominous sign Curtis when you see this huge imagery of all of them coming towards the border and it and it's a little different than the guys issue because that's a smaller area this is a big area our border and it's not just you know there's a lot of space so many many miles in our border it's a very difficult\n... it's and it's not clear checkpoint like it as you know it's a larger area five are but then again for Israel in such a small condensed\nArea we got to see exactly the different techniques that you can use against the group or an a large group ditch attempting to violate\nWell they just took a dangerous when you know they just they were both viruses right\nNow they they first started with water cannon and they did the pepper spray that didn't deter it a then all of a sudden the next thing was rubber\nBullets and then live ammunition so do we want to get to that point one eight hundred eight for re WABC let's go if we can to George you call calling from New Jersey Welcome to Kurdish and really caused me here WABC George Hi George\nHey guys how are you\nWere good what do you think do you think that there could be some battle and brazen that care of them\nWell first I'm I'm a legal immigrant from Lebanon ah I happen to be a Christian\nYour legal legal or illegal legal okay I\nReally I came here legally as a student I got my degree I got sponsor H. one I Want ten years to\nBecome illegal citizen and I am a friend that that people can just crossed the line and say hello we're we're not fitted number two it is very hospitable and it's probably likely that there are some bad people are from the astronaut because\nIt is in their high ... encourage and the Koran to\nRent in until you can over power and that come out actually in black and white\nI assume it's in the car on a show you're you're ... you're stating it's in the Koran that people should blend in in this case into this caravan to try to sneak in when it can sneak in so many other ways George it's not hard to sneak into our country\nWhere it's a lot easier to can wander ten fifty thousand people and\nNo no there'd be honest with you George the way most people sneak in is they get a visa\nAs a tourist or a student or a special worker and then they just don't go back that's how most of the illegal aliens e yeah unlike yourself who followed the\nProcedures you did due diligence she took you ten years you're now in American\nBut you know these people would not be coming across the border if there was no work for them here somebody is telling them they got jobs waiting for them and the restaurants in the fields don't you think\nI understand I'm a business owner and I and I believe me I I this is a real problem but that doesn't mean you can rule out the possibility of having ...\nAnd by the way George I'm sure they find that when you have that many thousands of people there probably are some bad characters and again if you look at it it's a lot of men if things are so bad why are you leaving your your honey and your kids behind I mean I think there's there definitely will be some carrots aren't we got that amounts for\nWork because you know what happens they have relatives here like they send the money back not too much that holding the money and let's see if the kitchen workers or their field workers or they've injured workers they say hey we got ten jobs she if you guys can make it in the next month to charge let's go to Charles in Westchester welcome to Kurdish and\nReally Cosby had WABC Charlie Charles\nYes hello thank you for taking my call yeah go ahead Charles\nI'd been a firefighter for twenty eight years in my town and while you're worried about terrorists the real problem is just the illegal aliens\nThey drive cars without licenses getting at the car accidents are going number for educations every day when I'm working God's telling me you know no no license no insurance fires one of the jobs firefighters I work with was killed by an illegal alien setting a fire\nLet alone now they're also overloading house in very dangerous conditions 'cause living in exile rose like single um occupancy if\nYou know over ... you're you're absolutely right but then again who are the landlords they permit that those are not illegal aliens social\nThose are regular Americans who sub divide their houses illegally and they get wealthy on the backs of illegals who live in a little closet illegally you know it's just like the employers and when ... illegal aliens oil Americans who pick them up for daily but if we didn't do that they wouldn't come jobs they wouldn't come I agree\nBy the way we you know I'm On my own lawn I've been on my own lawn and we were able to go to restaurants long before you know they overloaded the restaurant business by the wife\nRight well they're overloading a lot of businesses because they're doing the work that a lot of Americans don't but also they are also stepping up to the plate and taking jobs that are that\nNow with the minimum wage in New York state is going to be Fifteen dollars soon you don't think there was some owners out they said bring on illegal\nOh yeah well and it happens all the time they're definitely guilty on Republicans and Democrats both alike on that\nLet's go to Norman calling from Orange County welcome to Kurdish and really Cosby here WABC enormous nine or\n... higher guys are great\nThank you referred\nEarlier today that they are according to our paying like a ... ... a day on the southern border\nOh yeah they do by the way or thousand a year yes the by the way that isn't it's not uncommon for them to come through there there that often happens we just don't know what they let them know Don I don't I\nI no no no no I made sure I mean are you are so many middle middle Easterners or terrorists know\nOK so Chinese come across that shame border every day also that are brought over by coyotes Hispanic\n... na na na da da da da da da\nDa da da and to make it go city on an international flight right\nYou you work your way to the border you ready to cross the border you think you do that on your own or you hire a coyote who knows the route that can get you to a safe house and then you can get on a bus or a general need to go directly to what are\nYour ... how are you going you're you know you're like recorded away their\nTrust me then not coup in on their own across the border they have professionals who take them across the border will charge him a pretty penny had told them a lot around\nIt and the immigration court if I start drilling and married her ...\nKnow we have ... you know you should be doing now is putting it out there and shaming does because it is\nLike I'm going to study shaming\nAnd don't make it a large signing these companies\nThat are doing is he's capable and then maybe we can get one hundred percent correct they can hear you coming here will work out and these were George Starbucks or is not making that argument a hundred and fifty dollars cash you buried up plus ... and\nSome of the same people calling us decrying it uh getting an air station wagon chip pickup truck generous you reach

with that yeah you know\nIt's got to become a big issue because we can talk about it but unless employers who are doing the right thing sort of stand up and create whether it's public shaming or whether it's a law like you're talking about well you got to get the bud out there happening\n'cause these employees know to write a check political contributions to Republicans and Democrats and

Tacoma so that\nThey'll say Jackie remember Pataki also Curtis was is also very close to ... so he's\nTrying to say oh you got this guy bought by behind you you got also Trump being sort of you\nKnow the line up with a rural board now we know some still hold over his trumpet tacky some may be from a super shocks man stretcher and his prostitutes maybe\nYou know prostitutes play a role in the ...\nOh maybe a Governor Paterson appointed wanted to wear those\nBasic almost been there and now for a total of almost eight years two terms looking for a third he acts the bulk of the individuals who have been appointed to the parole board or you know there's ...\nAnd ... you know funny Curtis is that he tries to pretend like he had nothing to do there is a bet\nThey're independent and you're going after it was an interesting come back because he knew that he would getting hammered on this because it's so ridiculous that he has given this conditional and leave you know the voting rights he you know after they've been released that he's given Herman bell he's given pedophiles he had to like ... he knew what was coming\nThere was an interesting turn on his part he actually has asked why did you give them the right why even give somebody like Herman bell which you and I talked about on the show when so many of our listeners why would you ever give someone who was a cop killer first of all see the light of day is one\nAnd then give him the right to vote and he tried to like evoke sympathy in this whole like let's rehabilitate\nAnd this is that moment pointed these are people who are on parole\nWho have served their time they've been released we're now trying to reintegrate them into ... society and we spend a lot of money trying to reintegrate people into society so they don't commit another crime and there's not more risk that it was\nIt was a he's looking after his own he as eight or of his ... areas including children Cocco who will eventually get out of prison for being a a found guilty of corruption or for Andrew Cuomo in his administration so he wants to make sure that is very dear friends\nAre able to vote when they get out there he's got eight votes for all got eight votes there [laughter] anyway numbers what eight hundred eight for re WABC that's one eight hundred aid for a nine to\nTwo to let's go to a Django is calling from New York a welcome to Kurdish and Rita tells me hit WABC jacket hijacker Hi\nGood what did you think of the debate who who did you think one\nWell like like I said I'm Glad that nothing but I didn't like that they're talking about the path like um who ran for violence from bats propriety outlet for\nUm keep each other rather than talking about the future and what they plan for the future\nNow that's a great point as it got so nasty you almost barely heard about policies or you could tell there's such bad blood between these guys but but did you think anybody made a dead like do you think anybody out there\nThe independent voters who you know I think there are people who are entrenched on both sides do you think it's weighed anybody either way Django\nI think we lost Jagger yeah boy let's go to Larry lay the luge you have this ... she was on for like ten minutes you lost your dropped a like a she was a bad habit\nCome on let's go to Larry on that one Larry what do you think who do you think on that one\nAbout why what was the question who think won the debate last night with ...\nOh okay I didn't listen to the debate I just started exercising but um I based\nOn that excerpt that I heard I Want to disagree with you I think that more narrative score the knockout punch\nI think on that when he did well but I think some other areas I just think Cuomo was so overbearing and I could also turn off voters but but he needed because of the poll difference if you look at the numbers right now he's far behind Cuomo in the polls so when you got that when you in that position you got to do a knockout\nWell I think that when he um when he's at the core of all you got to know you had to know about the corruption of the people that were prosecuted in your administrator clothing Cuomo could ... say say back I think was did you vote for Trump he resorted to identity politics\nWhich is not an issue up the lower ... either side of the issue of the debate we voted\nNo but you see the moderators did not control that secondly\nEven though he hates the Blasio he followed his successful pattern of getting reelected mayor in New York because he didn't talk about issues he talked about oh Molly attack is a Republican candidate you're a mini Trump you know use the same strategy lacked\nDistract Trump has nothing to do with this election neither does Morocco bomb on Hillary Rodham Clinton it's who's going to be governor who's going to take care of the mess right now with so many agencies and as ah the woman before us mention what is your vision for the future and quite frankly\nThat either ran out of time for that or they just want to dispose even talking about that the moderate and she didn't even bring them back to that\nWell and the one thing they should have done to Curtis you know I think about even ... you know we had the debate here um with Donovan and Graham not too long ago and there were times where both of them you know your typical you know you're in the heat of it all you're trying to spin\nAnd that's what Cuomo did dairy I thought affected Lee actually last night because I actually think mowing are\nHas a lot of goods on 'em and he got the job or Coco you got that part and and yet Cuomo was able to kind of spin it end deflect and that is where I remember to think should happen moment or should have said wait you didn't answer my question or the moderator should have said you didn't have a moderate\nHis language that in the direction of coal mine were knows why should they were just so appreciative that he chose Yemen remember it wasn't like a joint choice it was Cuomo said All right\nAll right I'm tired of being called the chicken will have the one debate one debate over maybe we'll have a twenty four\nHours because remember he was supposed to be with us that are pubs in Portland\nAnd just slightly shows the venue against Cynthia Nixon and just like he chose the circumstances they were grateful that he was providing them as the forum for the debate so they went easy on him\nBut that's where mullah neuro had and I do believe he look I thought he did a decent job but I think he had to say that you didn't have you know you turn it and say answered the\nQuestion will if you're a model in our most people don't even know you in the state especially in the city where you're falling so far behind you're on a stage you're now in an equivalent position is the governor who's well known none of the other third party candidates ... he'll have they're going to last through government at Torrey elections on the insistence of Cuomo\nUh you got that opportunity at parity and now at least people know who use what he stands for and now it's a race to the finish\nWell and listen this is a lifetime between now and election day November sex and no question a lot can change but he's got to pray for a knockout punch in the next one to change the dynamic\nBeing on a guaranteed ... and our is right right not\nParticipate in the league of women voters who are having a forum for all the candidates including the third party candidates ... said he'll be there will be upstate but you know ... be a no show let's go to ray in New Jersey Welcome to Kurdish and ready because we uh WABC ray Hi Ray\nHi how're you doing [noise] uh I Would like to know and I've been wondering about this for quite a long time what is the difference between college you're caught and killing a taxi driver they make a big deal about the cop being killed but nothing about a taxi driver bus driver or your mother\nYou know what that's a great point because I agree if somebody kills somebody's life and it's intentional they should not see the light of day I I I feel really strongly about that and you're right I but I Do think when it's a cop\nWho has a gun and and if you hear what they did I mean these guys were targeting cop so we're supposed to be keeping us safe\nI Do think there should be special circumstances but I think sometimes are way too easy on anybody who killed anybody\nTo understand each case they should be judged separately and distinctly way and the the most infamous cases Herman bell who along with his partner in the black Liberation Army set a trap for the cop\nHey how's it going good how\nAre you doing now you do and what do you think\nOK a two very short points um [noise] um it was\nIt was someone called our global uh those these criminals surround themselves were especially the guy that got convicted or six or eight months ago that refer to the ... the city I mean look at this guy he's a good father\nAnd ah they call them a call the second Barbara anywhere at one of the ones that's doing\nWell somebody planes ... that he is not the governor of New York city that there is no such office that he's the governor of New York state the whole kittens Boadle\nOh yeah I mean he doesn't usually one that's the problem it is an act that way if you look in the most recent polls mark mile an hour winds up state\nOr he slightly behind in the suburbs in places like nationalist sub ... orange Dutch is Rocklin but he gets clobbered in New York City by about Seventy seven it's Thirteen\nYou know it's amazing though in the debate last night the only really up to the question was and again as one thing he represents the whole state was what do you think of the Buffalo Bills I mean that was based on what are the only you know basically say question really also discuss\nThe taxes and obviously the lack of jobs and the flight\nYou don't let it went well until it was still you know miniscule the effort it was so New York central New York city central ...\nToo and the moderators control that but remember ladies and gentlemen as we now race to November sheds a you've got to vote for mark mile an hour you got to get this guy out of office itch term limits chele Farley brought it up the other night on the pubs in politics on the stage he said\nThat's why I liked the reform party I'm On the line because you promote term limits if there were term limits\nA coma would not have been on the stage for that debate last night it would have been two terms ... think of it for all of you hate the Blasio at least we know we can't run again he can't bribe his weight with third term like Bloomberg did but up next let's get our news headlines update\nDiet\nThe categories and mostly cloudy on robbed Austin with the
