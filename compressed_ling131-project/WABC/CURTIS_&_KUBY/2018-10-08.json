those people should be prosecuted\n... to ... or you know for for his daughter and his wife the private people and they're going to suffer for the for the rest of the life they should get some relief from people paying your right he's a public person but not his daughters and their female to his wife\n... well the thing is the one how do you prove it because at this point you could make the are I mean I think the sweat nickname was such an outlandish allegation but you could make the case that it just wasn't proven that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong you get the different than from a legal perspective there's a big difference\nOkay well let me just say what I heard the attorney\nIs specialize in civil litigation talking about it okay for example okay NBC by north vetting and making sure that it is a very merit to it ... of march so liable okay this is just one of them working\nAlone they indicated they had no substantiated evidence they're totally in the clear itching news outlets dishes what news out which do you can start suing the\nNews now and people you know like because you don't like the information and certainly the wife and the daughters have been harmed by this\nBut nobody ever mention him personally none of the three women ever suggested the admissions Kavanaugh had done anything yet but it was collusion right you're right it's specifically aimed at having all it is up to have\nAn audition them for defamation reliable and I'm telling you he will not want to go through a any kind of deposition process because that goes on for hours sometimes days\nBut there should be grilling of the ... right now to say okay listen you said you had the good you had sweat neck your broader forward you put her before NBC what else do you have to corroborate you know because\nI Do think think about the turmoil that this country is and again this is a big if we don't know but if and indeed there is a big if it turns out that there was some huge orcas ...\nAnd this big effort to go after somebody and I'm all for it somebody you know somebody was maligned or somebody actually was raped or something like that but he should be heard and I think for something happened to her and we don't know what it really kind of having her it\nDidn't matter whether or not he said according to the president because when he mounted that stage in Mississippi he tipped the balance in Kavanaugh's favor\nWell there are a lot of things happening that word correct they weren't true and there were a lot of things that were left unsaid and I thought I had it even the playing field because it was very unfair to\nJudge now I can you know very nicely if they justice tavern or right right it was a very unfair situation do I even the playing field at once they did that started the sail through it was very very unfairly\nOh my lord now you had an impact I think he will we not because the votes that were in question were posed to the way he dealt with the issue\nYeah I think I think it was dangerous but I think he also his base loved it you could see out a way to cheer up his\nBase is not the the majority of Americans it was the independence it was the free agents who hadn't made up their mind if anything I think that created\nMore of a problem for Kavanaugh up until then the president was handling things well he was\nSaying yeah I by the way I agree he would have stayed sort of ... and left it to the Capitol Hill and I I don't credible but I Will say his base loved it and some people it was what capital it was clearly not just him but it was\nTruly in love with it already in favor of cabinet you didn't change anybody even fat is based wanted to hear him I enjoy it but he lived he didn't change the flow for cabinet if he had kept ashamed temp a temperature in terms of his statements balance\nKavanaugh's nomination would have gotten through anyway anything he he gave college\nMurkowski mansion and others paused for concern because\nOf how over the top you was in Mississippi one eight hundred aid for a WABC let's go to mark who's calling from queens welcome to Kurdish and ready to Kashmir WABC mark\nHi Mark how are you were good what do you think mark\nYou know what I'm thinking is there has to be some specific limitation of when these women can come forward I mean don't you\nThink it's a suspicious that all of a sudden these guys whether it's proper cabin aren't they become elevated at this data that because the political all of a sudden welcome ladies\nThat mark I think you're right there are people who capitalize on that and like you know whether attention seekers but\nI Will also say that there are people who say well I didn't like what happened to me Thirty years ago and now my gosh I don't want this person on the Supreme Court I mean I'm not I there are people who legitimately feel like when somebody comes to a really high office\nThat they should speak out and and don't you think there are cases those are legitimate ones to\nAgree and I might legitimizing God Forbid a model legitimize the all these\nActs it's disgusting cannot treat women this way you cannot treat human beings is way that is true love to either be a regular a formal investigation let there be a trial but to put him up\nThere and to embarrass him like that in front of other people with the amount of giants a percentage that it might not true\nWell that's the thing I think if you go for a word you're right ... you gotta have some backup I think if you're going to go forward especially after all this time in public stakes I'm surprised that we didn't hear more back up again you know they they couldn't prove it and that's why I call others want to remain in limbo\nBecause clearly the FBI had their orders of who do investigate who to speak to who to get to a cue in age from\nAnd it was surprising credit that they didn't talk to for it and they didn't talk to a couple of others in this case I think they should have it in\nSo he might now and listen I'm not convinced when I I thought Dr Ford in particular because she's the one who of course testified I thought she was very compelling I mean I was moved when I saw it I was very emotional as I Know a lot of my like female friends especially were\nAnd so on and then something happened to her I'm not convinced so that she proved with Kavanaugh\nBut I'm convinced that something happened to her don't what are you and I\nThink I think she said one hundred percent but it was Kavanaugh right\nShe did but she couldn't prove it though and that's the problem I think you know if you make an accusation against someone who's running for a Supreme Court [noise] um I mean while they wait ... if it's true I Wish she could have been able to do\nWith the way you handle that is you know full throttle investigation you find out in fact did she ever tell anybody else that she wasn't quite sure which Kevin\nWell and that is that what the last caller was saying is that Kaiser apparently\nShe said I'm not sure that there's a report that maybe I'm not sure of was it was you know ... don't you think it is why you do a full blown investigation but I Hope it doesn't sway people Curtis from coming forward I Hope it doesn't persuade other women coming forward and that would be sad if that's the case I think it\nDefinitely will deter women from coming forward but\nEach case ... Mian independently from previous cases meantime up next is the case of the Brooklyn College professor\nWho are saying to the many demonstrators who won and Shaq men and then you can't do anything to me because I'm ...

the ... the researchers and they went in thinking that maybe they would be equally then or that alcohol might even have a more profound effect on teens and they're talking specifically about the young mind and they said\nThat they were stunned defined that marijuana\nAffected for key areas in particular and they said all four of these are cognitive these are sort of thinking abilities and they said that marijuana had a much greater effect again on the teens and young adults is is different than older people these are young\nHe's a younger folks either teenagers in terms of problem solving long term memory short term memory and also the ability to stop habitual behavior to change your behavior\nAnd they said those are soda for key ones that especially short term and some long term effects marijuana was worse than alcohol on the young brain and I think that's a that's a staggering\nIs the problem with this study the study could not tire alcohol to negative effect now come on\nRight it's kind of I kind of tape ... right all the young we're doing both so much so it's kind of a little hard to figure out an we've got to\nGo back to a cabin or years as a teenager that we all went through we certainly know whether it's personal or through your friends and\nIt shows Kavanaugh has a good memory he never blacked out remember he said he never blackout so and he only had beer that under that reinforces this current under\nThe heavy influence of alcohol you would find it difficult to solve problems she would find it difficult to have long a long term short term memory\nYou find it easy to go to the bathroom you probably need like a lot of fear\nI think that's where the study fails now should this be further explored a short about legalization of the recreational use of marijuana yes but the problem is when you talk about teenagers it won't be legal for them\nWell that's the thing it's important to make the distinction but I think also there are a lot of teens\nAnd and lesson in high school I remember seeing marijuana everywhere it's accessible it's easy to get to and I do think when it says the younger mind the effect\nAnd what scared me the most I think scares people the most I think it should\nWhen you look at this is it said there's issues with the long term that also associated with substance abuse they didn't see it with alcohol but they said that there was one in terms of how how could you not changing our actions to me that goal I mean I think both of them obviously they are on an island for young and\nWhy is uh just because you are discussing the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana you have to apply the same standards alcohol is legal for miners to use\nAnd their booze and left and right and they're smoking marijuana left and

and in college that they looked like waste away now you know so\nI read it always starts with no discipline\nYeah and and I think it's important I Do think there are people now who use it for medical reasons or even even CEOs\nWho do a little bit pop pop pop off I you know I'm not a fan of that but I understand why they do the other day it was just one other thing\nThat there'll be ... to talk about that is that a cancer potential\nAll right well the cancer potentially canceling days around ... what's\nThat got cancer but then she comes from the use of alcohol\nCigarettes to cigarette to inhale it wasn't like around\nWhat I'm really a winning ... percent understood because\nOf the fact that the you know just like with cigarettes marijuana it diminishes lung capacity and nobody says

you do have now you don't legalize it in order to be able to get the revenue is fending for things that we needed desperately for the government doesn't have the resourceful\nWell I'll tell you a little slower Curtis ... well it started back to the cigarette the\nRight thing to come back and one of his country or should be banned because eventually all those people that uh smoking tobacco cigarettes pipes or whatever right they've actually go on Medicaid and Medicare right and it's costing the\nDave how do you ban the sale a tobacco you create a black market and they would be

of\nSaying it could you give me a favor in mind the luge could you find out if either Jamieson of Budweiser we're responsible for the public\nHas nothing to yeah I mean it and sort of outrageous but I'm not surprised that the brain is affected by marijuana I mean again I go back I think of a couple of people there was one guy who was told and I I'm surprised that you could even wake up in the

Kashmir\nHey Mike guy I worked in a while and offer the same rate for that disagree with Curtis agree or read a little but hey I Love\nMike Mike I knew you were the guy for me\nI'm just saying let's bring Curtis something a little airline here when you are saying that the legalizing marijuana for the miners that back to the fact that teenager that they're not legalizing defend them anyway caused by the fake whether or not it's legalized for the minor\nBeing brought in a society we know how much you hear from mine did it get it and going to take the bus wise than it is and it's an effect a coke and if we legalize marijuana that's going to put it in the hands of the mind or whether or not it can actually go in and buy it\nBut you know Mike I I must tell you that there are some states that already have the recreational use of marijuana will have to see what the outcome of two or four or five years of usage\nBut I Will tell you now a lot of young people use marijuana and specifically because there is a taboo it is illegal it is the Pandora's box\nAnd a lot but I don't really going to use that I think I agree with with my that they're still going to use that Curtis and it's going to be even more than I Do when you\nAnd memorize five or ten songs in a week for gigs on on on on up to a private parties and uh as long as you don't abuse it I don't see eye if my instead of having a cocktail when I come home and and go to bed at night I take a couple of ...\nNow ... you started at what age and how much did you do\nIf there are about Thirteen well\nOf course in the late sixties and seventies used it a lot more now it's like one or two heads that night when I get home from work whatever instead of having a martini that's what I have in the evening and relax
