the government is guaranteeing that when he by fixed annuity a fixed ensure\nIs guaranteeing that based upon their claims bang ability no there could be fees are can be surrender charges all those potentially negative things but there is a contractual guarantee in the world the Venus there is no contractual guarantee\nSo you know if your money goes down and said well you know we try their best

I. N. are a\nBroker check and make sure you're working with an advisor who doesn't have a poor track record in terms of you know having problems with the SEC\nYeah that's a great point because now it's very transparent you can see especially if you're in the interview mode with financial advisors that is a good idea to see like do they have some sort of spot on their record for things they've done in the past and that's something you really want to know before you engage with especially with a new advisor especially within about it's like a steak dinner\nEntertained all the great things are going to do well you definitely go past that superficial reality and see what their track record actually is now more than ever it's accessible\nThey like anybody get out of a thing on the record ride but we transferred into ... the other day who's advisor had sixteen actionable complaints\nWhere with the majority of them they had to settle with the investor and pay out of pocket fines or you know just getting bad advice or inappropriate advice so it's a good place to start is to look and make sure that your current advisor or someone you're considering as a clean track record\nLaying here he's saying here Bob is just because someone is charming doesn't mean they give good financial advice now you are charming and good financial advice such I Would call that the best of all worlds\nThat I don't have any problems with my record on broker check so that's even better side you know ride the best ... scammer has the best personality right the biggest cheats in our business or the people who are smiling as they're sticking it life in your back\nYeah exactly I better do some more homework another thing that we hear often I think this is actually a very big red flag is the market crashed and I lost a ton of money in my portfolio\nYou know that's usually a sign your advisor has not been managing the risk correctly and sadly the only time you really know is when the market goes down on my protected or not so I think that's when you really gotta make sure that someone's actually addressing risking your portfolio pop\nA right that's what it's all about it's about a process you need to have an advisor who's checking\nOn you on your process on your portfolio and make sure that you're not taking more risk than you signed up for their rights you had a portfolio just back in twenty fourteen that was forty percent in the stock market and sixty percent and bonds and you didn't rebalance or do anything that should be done\nOn an annual basis what do you think your asset allocation would be right now\nI mean right now you probably have way too much money in stocks and the problem is when the market finally does go down at some point like it did last week well you're gonna feel the pain no pun intended\nYeah it was good wake up call for you know because you would have ten percent more in stocks than you signed up for and that's what happens when I look back at all the crashes that have occurred my career you know you look at investors who got hurt the most for people who just allow their asset allocation of drip and allow their portfolio become overweight it in the winner's right the stocks that were overvalued\nAnd they didn't realize was overvalued until they had that disaster state income in the mail you need someone who puts your interests first you know what that's called ...\nIt's called being a fiduciary Bob you got it you need a fiduciary stockbrokers annuity salesman you know avoid him like a plague\nAnd if you're thinking to yourself right now I Need a real financial plan not just an investment plan than accomplices my goals and it's updated on a regular basis here's your shot if that second opinion if you have over two hundred thousand dollar save for retirement if you're one of the next ten callers\nBob and I will run for your complimentary our total financial master plan you will do that with no obligation or cos it's a full holistic review that addresses every thing you simply just bring those statements in\nPrint them off the computer put them in a folder we're going to build you your own personalized portal so we get a bird's eye view of your finances and we can look at all those critical components we're going to look at things like diversification\nWhat underlying risks you have in your portfolio in the markets sold off last week did you feel it at a greater level then you should we're going to show you were those pitfalls are and how to protect yourself or bullet proof your portfolio we're going to look at fees there's a lot of hidden fees and portfolios and shocking\nBob and I are going to break down all those hidden mutual fund cost insurance annuity cost brokers product costs show you how to reduce costs on your portfolio and we're going to look at income income is so critical in retirement we're going to show you how to fill in that income gap with a very real\nIt's time for financial\nOf the week this is what Bob and I scour the daily financial news and caught the biggest offenders of offering obscene for fame financial guidance to help you protect yourself\nFrom making any ill advised financial decisions so Bob what did you find out there this week and the hard world of financial propaganda\nYou know what I found the financial truth and if you order truth in titled nobody knows nothing about proper English or not but what it talked about is that market forecasters are often wrong but they're never in jail\nAnd if there's absolutely no financial wizard there's no talking head out there who's on national television you know promoting their forecast she's not really promoting a newsletter or book so it really doesn't matter you know what their experience has been the future and the ability to predict the future\nIs impossible and I think that should be obvious to everybody\nBut there was a doctor ... walk that back in Nineteen eighty five interviewed two hundred and eighty experts to find out\nYou know their confidence that they're sort of to to their predictions and on average raw you know what they found out they didn't do much better than random guessing and the other thing they found out about experts is the right and to make very extreme for cash does that surprise you\nI mean you just have to turn on the TV every day [laughter] and yeah I think it's one extreme forecast after another right if you like the financial media specifically loves to propagate fear which we always say gets in the way I have a really good investment strategy and that's why sometimes it's just more beneficial to turn it off\nWhile you know Robert talking about experts wouldn't you say Warren Buffett's group\nI mean I Would say he was probably the guru of gurus given his phenomenal track record in the second wealthiest American Me third now\nWell you know what he says he says he has a process in place that guards against magical thinking\n[laughter] I was like that which is processed against magical thinking that's a great term\nYeah because he says no one can predict the direction of the markets on a daily basis so he's not predicting what he's doing is he's making investment that's on the future\nYeah and that's what we forget right it is a long term game and well kind of playing into that Bob I found an article that says the big turn for the markets which came out this past week and this newsletter writer claims that he warned about the glaring bearish divergent stairs in the stock market for the past several months\nAnd especially for the last part of September and this looks so similar to other important tops is what his comments were you know claiming that he knew this market was going to correct\nOver the last two weeks and he's been warning us for a long time but you know I think one thing we always forget Bob is let's say this market going down about let's say five percent that's pretty normal an average year the market does correct five percent on average three times a year\nSo someone who goes out every year predicts there's going to be a five or ten percent correction and do they actually of gifted insight or are they just looking at history\nI suspect they're just looking at history so and then I think we've got to remember and remind ourselves when the markets to get more of our tile\nAnd things don't look right is this is a very normal type of market you know it's normal for markets to sell off and not just go straight out you know markets aren't linear and I think it's good to remind ourselves that as these headlines come out week after week\nWell what I loved about my article rise at this guy I spoke the truth you know no one has to get an insight nobody can predict what's unpredictable no one can do it's unknowable\nAnd the only thing you really have the fears recession of course if you subscribe to his newsletter he has a very reliable recession forecasting services available for nominal see he's ties can't help themselves\nSacco is always a catcher\nYou know get my crystal ball for you know it just kind of price on a monthly basis\nBut I think it's important though I think last week is a great reminder when the markets to sell off that you need to have the right allocation Bob you need to make sure that your portfolio is structured correctly and we see this all the time now\nWhen you bring your statements and we're finding that a lot of times you get one or two problems and maybe you're taking way too much risk you've got way too much money in the market specifically us stocks growth stocks\nWhich I've seen the biggest sell off in the last week because it's become a crowd of trade or on the flip side even sitting with way too much cash\nAnd you're trying to figure out when to actually deploy that cash and you really go look at these pulled back in the market is really a nice place to start to add or allocate money is in your portfolio\nYeah I mean if you have a discipline strategy you look at these dips in the market his opportunity that yes you know from the market God's to give you an opportunity to buy low I mean we all know that you buy low and sell high but it's so hard to do it in the face of corrections if you're listening to these markets rivers in other words\nYou need to invest on purpose you know for the purpose of achieving your financial goals not to satisfy you know some short term horizon which some you know market grew route going to try and tell you is going to happen\nYeah exactly right so I think it's really important especially now that you're managing a risk\nAnd if you're sitting on cash the other thing is there's been a lot of talk about interest rates low interest rates have actually gone up so it is acting attractive time if you're looking to get some income for your portfolio there's a lot of ways now to generate income with safety you know tax free bonds we talked about earlier in the show right now\nYou know the ... and those that come up significantly so if you're in a high tax bracket right now there's a lot of ways to deploy or cash\nIn a conservative way and they become way more attractive than they'd been for quite a few years\nYou know Ryan are combined sixty years the only hedge\nAgainst market risk of market volatility that I've ever found his own high quality bonds that has a fixed interest rate and a fixed maturity date in other words you know exactly how much you're going to get paid and you know exactly when they got to get your money back you know we've been talking\nWeek after week about the risk of these bonds on they don't give me any downside protection only a fixed couponing to fix maturity date on your bond portfolio take a look at what you have now make sure your hedging your portfolio properly 'cause that's the only true heads there is in the financial markets\nYeah and if you're singing yourself right now I Need to get a game plan in place you know I've got way too much money at risk of got way too much money in cash I Need to know what to do it that here's your shot to get that game plan if you were in the next ten calls you have over two hundred thousand

[laughter] and they definitely for their age and you know kind of where they're at in life we you know we're kind of shocked at how much they hadn't inequities which we see all the time you know how much they have in the S. and P. or you know in individual stocks you know in their sixties getting ready to potentially fully retire\nThis was kind of shocking though I had given\nCredit so they knew they were taking too much for it yeah right they have all their money and growth stocks which has done phenomenally well but as we know at some point the party stops and a portfolio like there is you're getting close to retirement starts to go down rapidly they're going to be in big trouble if they were at least cognizant of the fact right if they're taking way too much worse\nWhich I appreciate it like hey we know or take any kind of risk just let us know like give us the number is basically you know give us a whole picture so yeah they neither taking to address but I think when they finally saw it on paper it was like well I yeah definitely you know a shock to them 'cause they're in their sixties in their Ninety three percent inequities\nYeah and that's what I Love about just that three sixty Porto would put together for them because you know that's where you really can see how ... and then we're able to say hey guess what and here like two thousand and eight this portfolio would have been down like over fifty percent and who wants to see the net worth if you've got two million dollars go to a million dollars\nYou know at any given year that's a buzz kill yeah you know times two or three I don't know it's terrible\nI mean if you want to lose like five hundred million dollars I could do something with\nThat generally do much better time movie [laughter] and yeah the ... I gotta move soon I could use that money it's like if you're just counting on losing that\nMuch in the year like yeah I Can't get over\nYeah it's I mean that's a huge thing and not only that but there and all these tech stocks to that just got hit really hard from this recent pull back and if you are now pulling from your portfolio and you have these individual tech stocks like your Netflix or Google you know all those things that you can get hit pretty hard in in a downturn like we just saw last week\nYeah we call it the overcrowded trade and that's when we met them before last week\nSo now we're gonna talk to them after last week about the first thing we said was what you've got to reduce this risk and I mean last week his case in point Ryan seen tech stocks because they've gone up so much typical in the market goes down they go down and much more it's the same kind of magnitude on both sides\nYeah and you know they have no protection in there so they have no bonds they've no certainty they have no income that's going to be you know there for sure right and that's why we want to build in some bonds and some protection there and we see those downturns say you're not hit with a million dollar downturn God Forbid\nYeah yeah it just doesn't make sense for that close to retirement I mean you have to start thinking okay you know two thousand eight was ten years ago you were ten years younger you are ten years further away from being in retirement now you might be at the end of your career you might be in retirement now you've got to change the game\nYeah and even like a two thousand right we saw the tech bubble burst like right there I mean it's just it's\nReally up to remember Gen hanging around [laughter] I figured\nYou might laugh because she ate that right yeah and in that and then along with just planning right so let's say they're retiring now\nYou know there's all these science as we can do between now and tell Seventy and a half or you have to take out your choir distributions and they're in mostly retirement accounts so they have\nYou know Seventy five years now where we can plow these distributions out and see if they can was ten years ago they been much better shape planting wise but now we can do at least five seven years and all the income tax planning 'cause that's important\nYeah like we sat down and money saved in taxes is just as ...\nI mean money you can make invested in much ... Seventy and a half your deferred your retirement accounts or we caught picking tax time bomb you're forced to take money out of your irate neck and bump up your tax bracket\nSo there's a lot of great planning to do before that to really believe you know that tax burden later and a lot of ways you can do a tax rate which is I mean who doesn't like tax return I Do write\nI really do [laughter] I Know you do [laughter] I Know it's hard [laughter]\nIt's crazy to even just down you know decreasing the rest of their still going to have over fifty thousand in just extra income coming in from up more secure diversified more conservative but so growing portable yeah\nYeah and that's kind of a magic formula if I use that word is like okay you have the opportunity\nFor growth in your portfolio but let's create reliable stream of income that you know you have coming in every single year because there's no way every year you know which way the market's going to go and that's a terrible way to plan your retirement around hoping the market's going to go up you know hope is not a strategy here\nIt's really not [laughter]\n... gel in this case I mean if you're thinking yourself right now I Need a review like if I have to know the risk of my portfolio I Need to convert my portfolio to make it retirement ready it was still a couple of black swept if you give us a call right now you have over two hundred thousand dollar saved for retirement myself Bob\nGen financial angel will run for your total financial master plan will do that with no obligation or call it the full holistic review where we analyzed the whole picture just bringing her statements print them off the computer put them in a folder\nWe're going to go through all that for you we're going to build you your own personal lives financial portal where we can review everything at a bird's eye view we're going to get all those critical components\nWe're going to look at diversification what hidden risks do you have in your portfolio did you get hurt last week when the market went down or you protect you were going to show you had a bullet proof your portfolio\nWe're going to look at income income is so critical in retirement you need a reliable stream of income were able to increase the income on this portfolio by fifty grand a year\nHow can we show you how to optimize or increase the income on your portfolio and we're going to look at the there's a lot of hidden costs I Know it's shocking and investment portfolios were going to show you all those getting costs are on those new it is mutual funds brokerage products show you how to reduce costs on your portfolio there weren't a title together\nInto one total financial master plan\nUtilizing strategy now we've worked on for over forty years\nTake your family from point a to point B the least amount of risk in the highest odds of success\nSo all you have to do is text or call us at ... for four seven five to six six nine to that number again it's a four four seven five to stick stick nine to give it a few slots left to give it to copy it wants to take a look at your portfolio\nEight four four seven five to six six nine to\nWell Gen ... though he was a pleasure having Janine Jonah showed it is they'll button you just don't do ... and I you know I I still think about our co hosting at one episode and hopefully the dirt down yeah they are bringing a little sarcasm to the family will sarcasm a little more color [laughter] you can't you know I Know\nI Do do it well thanks for being on the show another great show this weekend and it's always the Bush [noise]\nInformation provided on today's show is provided for information purposes only and does not constitute investment tax or legal advice information has been obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable but their accuracy and complete this cannot be guaranteed always consult with an investment legal or tax professional before taking any action\n\nWhen she came and she was complaining about the sleeping issues which a lot of times the different factors that come in but a lot of toxicity that's what this really is is a full detoxification program\nA and detoxify deliver and getting rid of a fat and the body stores toxins in fact so getting rid of that stuff\nIs going to make you sleep better and give you more energy and people are hydrated better and you know listen if you're getting some weight off the midsection there you're diaphragm can finally move up and down to where it's supposed to your lungs can expand properly and you're probably going to sleep better so\nThat is awesome thirty six and forty nothing to sneeze at their [noise] um you know the ... the sleep will tell you one by ... funny email on the way in today I ... I just need to say because I don't know what this means but she says Leslie says it ... it was one part per hour by responded to her and says what she's talking about but basically the email said\nLast eight pounds in seven days fungus going away\nYou know ... well ... you know a lot of people um you know develop\nSome sort of fungus and you know on their feet and are on their hands depending on you know what their body starting to\nKind of produce you know right 'cause it's all about the toxins like you said and I think that once you start that he'd have detoxification profit that you really don't know how your body's going to react you don't know what's going to come out\nAnd we have seen so many times when somebody starts city death if Haitians a product that we have seen people you know even break out sometimes or um you know the toxins are coming out of clay you know it's great if we forget the skin is our largest Oregon so in order to detoxify the skin has to start to you\nKnow get rid of some of those toxins that we had burrowing inside for snow you know a number of years at this point probably ... so I like I said I totally have you beat on these numbers I'm ... I'm ... so it's our competition competition so anyway so I have generally down fifty nine pounds day thirty four stop\nFifty nine pounds day thirty four I he is on track to be actually the highest weight loss in forty days what officers to go to wherever the human very Jersey and you know exactly who he is because he came in last week he had a white shirt on and black pants\nTall guy really big guy or like you know tall like he he looks like he you know could play for the NFL basically almost\nA ... yeah he is on track we even had this conversation can be one of the biggest numbers and forty days except for I Believe that he is going to extend to fix the because he feels unbelievable they need\nTo win it to track him at forty and then the winds up at sixty he thought what did you say Fifteen\nNinety nine and thirty four days I mean he's almost two pounds a day but um you know made yeah I've got another one I've got crank who is at exactly two pounds per day um and he's now at day I Believe twenty six so he's also kind of\nIt's a tracking a my friend Jim over here for a New Jersey yeah both of them are Jersey last week yeah this was last week said this is brand new no you know I'm\nYou know it was only ... I was only New Jersey won ... that's probably one of those running around the other officers you know it's ... you know what's great about what I Would like to know I Would like to have these I Would like to\nHave the before and after a while you're going to be on our website definitely once they're finished I mean\nWe like to you know we like to posted pictures of people being done you know several months out because the whole point really able to keep the weight off so um and I feel that um our DNA report you know I was just looking over I'm One of the patient's DNA reports um a couple of minutes ago right before we went on air and it's really amazing all this information that's in here\nUm you know we're talking about diet recommendations we're talking about\nEating behaviors which hiking about food reactions um we're also talking about nutrition and what works for you and what doesn't work for you such things that you know um do you have a genetic risk for decreased vitamin the do you have a genetic risk for\nA decreased vitamin a and you know and during the training what kind of exercise should you be doing\nSo and so you're not spinning your wheels that it should be doing more aerobics or less of this and more that this was going to give you that information to load later way to\nYou know also talks about um how exercise actually how your blood pressure for example response to exercise how your cholesterol response to exercise some prom loss of body fat how does your body respond to exercise you know not everybody who's going to go run\nThree to four miles every other day is going to lose weight for the same way as somebody who for example will do high intensity interval training you know and wait on you know everybody's a body reacts differently and\nI you don't necessarily need to be spending two to three hours in the gym you actually probably don't ever need to spend that long in the gym\nSo this is really what the DNA tests is all about because it really gives you a road map on what you should be doing once you're through with the program I'm so valuable so cool does not change right it does not change do you have a number and you have forever so none of the changes that is so much information it's almost\nA you know ... enough to keep you busy for a couple of weeks just stop trying to understand exactly how the information I'm really apply you and your body right exactly ...\nIt's really it's really amazing and and uh you know that that gives the tools you know that's a personal I should ... one of the parts of the personalization that we do the supplements are also personalized each individual based on\nA hair saliva a DNA testing blood work assessment buyer energetic scans that we use\nA two to personalize the supplements for the weight loss component and then after a weight loss component also\nAnd so that's why we're able to get these types of numbers where people are losing you know twenty to fifty pounds and only forty days and more of that and sixty days and that's without shops and without hormones and without surgery and they're not hungry or their bodies burning your their own toxic fought for fuel and so\nThe numbers are to let me give you the number so you can call in and and take the first steps to to changing what's going on with the right now is one in five five five and Jay diet\nWon eight five five five six five three for three a uh that's scheduled call up schedule or a or go over in our office to the program at no charge now\nThe easiest way I think there are now when you're calling please remember the people on the phones are just there to make the appointment and they don't know\nHow to program works in the ... to the program they don't know your specific need for whatever for the program their\nOwn leaders gradually appointments so to make the point with them\nOr just keep that in mind and then we'll answer everything when you come in you can skip that whole process and just go to and Jay diet dot com and only twenty seven dollars right now is the radio is they're normally it's Ninety nine dollars\nBut only twenty seven dollars you'd come into the office or have an appointment with us do a consultation or we're going to explain everything to you\nHow the process works how we're going to personalize everything we do a body composition of assessment or we're going to take a look at things like if it's real fat rating or if you've got high visceral fat that could be actually slowing down your metabolism and making you not be able to lose weight that fat makes you more insulin resistance er and balance which affects\nHow your body brings sugars into yourselves for energy and if that's not happening properly then it's going to turn into fat and stored and why is it so it's so dangerous is because that fat it's stored than on the liver on the pancreas on the other organs and so that's why obesity in itself is basically a self perpetuating\nA type of disease really uh so we're going to take a look at the visceral fat rating would take a look at your metabolic age so yeah you're forty years old but if you're a metabolic ages eighty based on the factors that come up on that body composition analysis you're going to have a hard time losing weight\nYou know so if your body is is functioning not functioning the right way than we need to we need to change it around to get a goal in the right way so we use all these tools very personalized\nSupplements based on a pair of saliva ... blood work assessment if you have it using the DNA going forward and that's going to help you not only lose the weight but also keep it off going forward as well and and maintain health\nAnd really you know after the program is complete so many different tools that we give you ten different ways to eat that day to drop the weight back down the DNA tested and continue to document of hair saliva than you'd assessment of\nBlood work to to try to keep you as functional functionally a optimally optimally functioning as as possible or and so\nLike I said the whole thing is personalized from start to finish and that's why it works so well that's why it works better than you know pretty much anything I've ever seen and it's really you know that's that's the whole key to it so that's ... died dot com and like I said it's only twenty seven dollars on line you come in to set up an apartment in New Jersey New York\nI'm very Manhattan right queen's Brooklyn Long Island uh and now in Westchester\nSo we've got you covered in the area just have to take the first step in and sort of get a dog now you want to give me your biggest sixty day people or you want me to give you my ... I went for the last time you know I I\nReally didn't focus on the six today people I had too many people in the forty days that I thought were really\nTalking about somebody on the forty days and then I'll go back and talked about how\nTo do and what I find really I'm cool is when um we have some of the um older people coming in because\nI'm I find that at you know\nMore often than not have done so many different um diets and have been yo yo dieting for probably better half of their life\nAnd um we had um\nLaura who came in sixty nine years old and she lost twenty three pounds and forty days which is a tremendous number four sixty nine year old woman gray um and she really did not need to lose more\nUm [noise] she you know almost had her goal she wanted to lose twenty five pounds but you know we always our goals are always a little slightly higher than actually where we need to me you're\nUh a woman that was a little older and\nI wanted to talk to you about Paula who came in ... to lady talked about six to nine years of Paul at Seventy five years old last so she came in on her first day\nShe came in with a three inch file\nOf programs that she's done over the last thirty forty years it didn't work\nThree inch file so I looked at it I thought it was a boardwalk and I'm like I said oh my God 'cause people come in but blood work and and different health exams in this like that\nSo I saw it in my eyes ... out of my head because I was like oh my God I'm gonna have to run for office but it turns out she puts it on the table and she was a referral from somebody who's done really well in the program and she said this is everything that I've done in the last twenty five to forty years Thirty years or whatever it was\nIt was a three inch filed everything she did she was none of these things have worked\nI'm only here because my friend did this and said that it works otherwise I wouldn't have been here\nSo I looked at it I go look and let me tell you I said you know let rather than be going through everything that you've done in the past what ... what are exploiting the program to wire explain the personalization using hair saliva buyer energetic scams a blood work assessment a DNA assessment for going and so forth\nAnd let me explain it to you and then afterwards you told me but I mean you've done it or anything like this so we we can afford a few things so I go through it sure looks I mean I go there anything like that absolutely not I've never heard of any sort of ... let's move forward\nSo low and behold you know we did the different scans that we do we did the book the functional or assessment of the blood work\nWe take a look at it would give her some fireworks support with diversity adrenal support twenty eight pounds forty days of the great that's really great ... I you know I said she's going to ... I said what are you do what you came in fire which came in last week shows or what do you do with the French fries for the shredded all of\nYeah like I mean I think it's also you know I think we tend to carry a ton of baggage with us we we really tend to go back I think people in general tend to they want to be positive but they tend to be on the negative side especially when they tried so many things and things don't work\nUm you know I think that that's really generally where we're at and I think a lot of people are telling people to throw up their old coal I Do I I I think that is a really powerful a powerful tool once you're done um you know losing weight I think you really need to get rid of the past I mean\nA fraud all your clothes when I did I and I gave them all the way I don't have one single thing from before um when I was um\nYou know you'll get a years ago she probably do it but at what point out the officers have houses you get rid of all\nI actually well because I started to try on my clothes probably about halfway through the program so halfway through the program was about twenty pounds down and I realize had I kept going to the forty hours a day which I did I Would be way down so I actually started to give them away\nUh throughout the program and of course you know once you start to empty out your closet you have to fill it with something and so that really is a very very important part of the forty days out of your time for I think so I may still having a good time you know I think I think it's\nReally really important for the mental health to get rid of what the old to get rid of what no longer effect on you know although we just taped um our first TV commercial which was so exciting and um you know we asked a couple of our patients actually participate in it and screw thankfully they did keep at least\nOne piece of clothing that they used to have\nThat on the fat tense or um you know in the case of our patients Diana she kept like some of her dresses from before she look I'm rate ready to come a little after she had a whole transformation as she was um you know so\nShe uh they were able to bring in their stuff and really it was really fun shooting the commercial because you know these weren't models these weren't ... so it was really exciting because we had to do like a bunch of takes because when you put someone who's not an actor in front of a camera\nYou know no matter how good their story as they start to go up above above but you know so but you know I've super proud to you know they they did really great it was really inspiring to listen to them we did some uh you know uh um\nSome aback stories almost because actually the gentleman that was doing and producing the commercial he didn't know or patients so he actually asked them to tell 'em him their stories and it was really fun and cool to sit on the sidelines and watch\nAnd you know seeing these patients who were patience of hours you know I mean Diana or what you know lost all her wait a couple of years ago the other two gentlemen that were in the commercial was over a year ago also\nAnd um to listen to their stories and really what led them to our office for me was very interesting because one of the gentleman I actually didn't even know because he was going to one of our remote locations are not New Jersey and so I never met him before and what an interesting story he's\nActually happened to be a semi professional ballroom\nDancer raw on and I said that now that he's retired uh you know he told his wife he wanted to take it back up because he feels so good well he lost close to a hundred\nI think a hundred and ten or something like that pounds um and he's like I you know there's all these things now that I remember I used to do and now I Want to go back and do them again because I have all the time on my hands I'm so these are you know these are really it was really an inspiring day it was really a great day but\nGoing back to actually I thought of I'm a female patient who just finished up she did um I don't know you might know this um eat her name is eat us I'm not sure if she did\nSixty days or she did a two rounds of forty days um I I think she was at the sixty day mark and um she's down over fifty pounds but she is on our website are harder to foreign actors on our website they are so I'm\nJust almost a ... it's a it's like a great ... percent over fifty pounds you know one of my kids I think wait fifty six now so it's really a these types of numbers are really staggering but what's really amazing for me is the fact\nUm you know you're losing fat and losing fat is the only thing that works long term I'm you know a lot of these other things out there you\nKnow everybody's like well the first week or two you lose all water anyway well that's not true no I\nAnd it's not healthy um and losing water is not going to give you any sort of long term and\nYou know a weight loss retention if you will um you have to lose the fat you have to hydrate the only way that you lose the fat is through the label some bags the only way that that happens is when they fill up with water and they burst\nThat is the only way you lose fat I mean I don't really care what anybody else to saying out there but that is the only way that that fat goes down that is also by the way the only way that you will see herself shrinking and your clothes getting better\nYeah everybody loves the clothes getting\nBurned all it's the best part of the whole thing I mean I Know I ... I didn't\nGet a chance to keep saying I keep I keep forgetting you're talking about the six day people hold on there and get back to when you're talking about it so we did the men first that would do the sixty\nDays or the female Laurie ah thirty eight pounds and sixty days\nPretty good run a big number thirty eight pounds in six today it's almost forty pounds for a woman that's absolutely tremendous talk about a different person that's that's great what's her what's her dressage is forty ...\nSo I for me um I did thirty I might I'm five eight so I'm I'm taller side if you look at you know uh most women I I'm five eight I lost thirty seven pounds I went from\nA twelve to ... starts off and that's like we're talking like the design or like the Italian designers the load the ones that basically make everything to sizes down\nRight away like a normal size twelve\nIs not what they call in our life has twelve does you know everybody outside of the United states for some reason seems to be sooner than we are in this country there's a lot of reasons there is a lot of reasons to that but it's very frustrating writing and then you have to talk about so that this is you know to go from a twelve to a sex um it is um\nIs a life changing event to me and you all of a sudden shop at a different store yeah you know because unfortunately most stores um don't carry the higher sizes so you you you ... you actually are moving from one to shout very into another shopping experience\nYeah absolutely so you have thirty eight so she did the thirty eight pounds a Steve is in sixty days Steve worked out it down fifty eight pounds in six years I didn't have you'd\nFrom that guy was whether you're thirty four thirty nine and thirty four to nine and they're there and that but [laughter] amazing I mean you know we typically see twenty five\nPeople were six twenty five to thirty five and forty days for women we typically see a thirty five to forty five plus for men and only forty days or so these numbers are ... are fantastic they're tremendous such great both of them uh you know we are off of their blood pressure medicine as a surprise you lose you lose forty pounds and sixty pounds respectively\nFemale in the mail you were going to be off your blood pressure Mets I mean that's not there's no there's no doubt about that are now uh so if you've got a five pound or ten pounds or fifty pounds or a hundred pounds or we can help you\nUh we we uh we typically see twenty five to fifty and only forty days\nAnd that's where that shots hormone surgery there's no hunger there's no pre packaged foods are monitored every step of the way you're coming into the office you're not doing this on your own you actually get a either the ... one of the doctors in mind one of the other doctors or one of our certified health and wellness coach is you get their information as well so we're always there to help you\nAre and so you can come into the office\nIn order to do that one of the offices in New York area and you can call\nOne eight five five five and a J diet a one eight five five five six five three for three eight and so what that does is get you a free go over in one of our locations of the program or we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nI Do everything on line so and Jay diet dot com only twenty seven dollars right now as a radio listener normally Ninety nine dollars for right now twenty seven dollars is a radio listener\nAnd that'll get you an appointment with us\nWith one of one of the doctors and one of a certified health and wellness coaches will go over everything with you do the body composition analysis I Will do all those different things and and take a look at\nA visceral fat rating water levels muscle ... levels fat levels metabolic age scenarios are also will look at the obviously your weight and and body fat percentage and all those types of things so\nYou know real visceral fat so important to look at\nIf that visceral fat as high then that could be a reason not only why you have some of the health issues that you're having 'cause that's linked to the diabetes heart disease cancer all those things that were nobody wants to even think about but also it's slowed down your metabolism because it makes your insulin more disrupted which ... which affects\nHow your body is able to uh metabolize sugar and it's those sugars aren't burn for energy your body is no other choice but to turn it into fat and store it\nSo we have to take a look at that as well so all these different things that we're looking at to personalize the situation for every single person and and and and get them the results that do you need you want\nI almost forgot like what time of year it was now it it really almost um you know past me that\nUm you know if you get started now you're you're gonna be all set for the holidays sell their you know this is one of the um is one of our busiest times of the year for for many different reasons you know people start to layer their clothes and then they realize they have to go on vacation you know your winter break and they either have to put on a bathing suit or they have to put on a ski outfit\nAnd you know here's the deal you get benefits in both sides right you put on a bathing suit you're the new you you put on a ... year then you you too because we knew yes why you have a lot more energy going down the slopes you feel a lot better you're breathing better and\nYou know if you start now where we we do we have forty days before the holidays we have ... we we've got forty days before the holidays you know you haven't seen some of your families you know this is a funny time of year for us because what starts to happen as you know we've got this huge influx of patience right before the holidays and then right after\nThe holidays what we have happening is all of their relatives and all of their friends that saw them during the holidays just how I tell my cousin my aunt my uncle or whatever they lost all this weight so now I'm here so it's a very interesting dynamic of what happens in the next couple of months with our practices that um\nYou see some of the you know if you will the guinea pigs come in and his whole family follows along\nAnd you know we actually had um a very interesting at thing we had a patient come in and he and and doing his second round the first time around I think he lost um thirty five pounds I think he wanted to lose another Fifteen or twenty so he's only doing a shorter period he's not doing a full forty days\nBut he said to us he said does anybody ever complain to guys that it hurts to sick when you lose all that weight\nAnd so I thought it was kind of funny in law flood pronounces ... yeah yeah\nWell that's the thing where you don't even think about that right when you're sitting you're sitting on you know quite a bit of Palestine and adding and whatever it is the Adams says official muscle there he said I didn't realize that he's like my heart so like I understand what he's like\nI said to him I was I guess as they get up and get more active than you know\nI'm you know this is actually somebody who doesn't fit a lot he's it extremely active human being but I guess he started realizing he doesn't have as much padding over there anymore\nBut that'll do it right oh he's like down almost sixty pounds and the total not sixty he's a little bit over fifty pounds but you know and the total of his weight loss he now started to feel well he should have been feeling like four years right here in his heart\nAnd well yeah I mean ... is the muscles are all very sad but I just thought it was such a funny thing to say like this is kind of what's interesting right when you're talking to all of our patients some of the things that are no there's less padding on the ah less patting ... exactly exactly\nAnd you know you see a lot of what's also I'm kind of an interesting dynamic as someone who is very sad and who does work out on a regular basis and come to us to lose that whatever twenty or thirty pounds and they need to lose\nAnd what's interesting is that you start to see their a muscle mass and you actually physically see their arms surely see that definition laying there under fat\nRight ah because we have so many of those patients that do work out on a regular basis we've actually had such a huge number of personal trainers that come in to do our program right because just like\nA you know a regular person unfortunately they come to the point where they don't understand why they're putting on weight and so once we get them into fat burning it's quite amazing because then they really start to look shredded I mean you see all that muscle and all that work that they've done over the years it's still there doesn't go anywhere\nGray and the results what's great about this is the results are so fast like I mean\nPeople don't believe you know you're you're losing twenty five to fifty pounds and forty days that's what we typically see with men and women so the results are tremendous you\nGuys are coming in women within the first week people come in they go how fast am I going to see results are in the ... I said by the first time you are and we have people come in within like around ten days after they start to program by your tend to visit women are down anywhere from eight to twelve pounds met her down anywhere from ten to Fifteen pounds\nAnd when I say that to them they could look at me so I was absolutely that's what we see here that's absolute we see and when people are coming in\nThey're losing fat they're not losing the water the water is improving because of the personalization of supplements the water levels are actually increasing in the body\nAnd it's not only a matter of getting people to drink more water because a lot of times we have two people have people lower their water consumption because they're drinking so much but their minerals or out of balance of their body isn't absorbing it properly which ones are slowing down the metabolism\nAnd so we we we have them kind of keep it around a star number depending on where where they are and that's individualized also but that's what the thing so like Tom comes in this uh sixty five year old guy he comes in this week\nFifteen pounds he's down in in twelve days right it's great so he he came in you know we did the ... we did the uh ... the ... the ... what the ...\nGet a tax thing we did the blood work assessment he needed is a long standing skin issues and marine alluded to that you were talking about that earlier about you know who the skin detoxify and that's where largest Oregon I'm absolutely lady got liver support\nThat's one of the main supplements he had it's usually a liver toxicity when it comes out on the skin like that and so you you know skins improving already\nThis is to less than two weeks in\nFrom severe skin issues for a long period of time to the charity improving now ah and he's down to Fifteen pounds and twelve days I mean it's it's a tremendous tremendous number and we're not talking about a twenty five year old guy here it's sixty five year old guy\nAnd so this is these are the these are the types of things that we really see a show one five five five and Jay diet is the number is the number to call here uh and so you know you're going to come in where do the body composition analysis or we've got you covered all over the tri state area a couple of locations in New Jersey\nOr New York city queens Brooklyn Long Island\nAnd now opening in West Chester as well or if you call one in five five five hundred guy that's where I go over in the office a of the program and at no charge right so you can do that at twenty five five five six five thirty four thirty eight\nI and we're gonna explain to you without shops hormones surgery know hunger how you're going to lose weight\nFat how are you going to lose it where you want to lose it because that's why people Stuart in different areas of because the body's protecting those areas because they're different hormonal imbalances how the program is going to balance your your your hormones\nA detox or find themselves the Oregon the tissues almost everybody in the first week I said the same thing I have more energy I'm sleeping better I have more energy I'm sleeping better [noise] uh [noise] and so\nThat's where we're going to expect for you to twenty five to thirty five pounds for women is what we typically see in forty days thirty five to forty five plus pounds\nFor men is what we typically see in forty days and so you can either do the phone call you can also the best way in my opinion is you go on line you go to and Jay diet dot com or and normally it's Ninety nine dollars for the first visit\nA as a radio listener only twenty seven dollars gets you an appointment to the office where you're going to come in and we're going to take a look at it not just your way we'll explain the program to you and the personalization of it\nBut we'll also take a look at a body count will do a body composition analysis with you\nWhere we're going to take a look at your weight your body fat percentage or your body water level you're visceral fat rating so important to take a look at metabolic age so if your metabolic rate if you're burning let's say if you're a guy burning Eighteen hundred calories a day\nBut your body's functioning like you're taking in three thousand calories a day you are not going to be able to lose weight you're gonna oh twelve hundred calories at the end of the day so like I said very important\nAnd Jay Z I sat com only twenty seven dollars right now is the radio is you can call one eight five five five and Jay die at one eighty five five five six five three for three H ... n J died dot com have a phenomenal day everybody take care had a great afternoon [noise]\n\nListening to the new law system [noise]\n\nThey're also helpful against Marcia but the strongest one in general for bringing immune system back really seems to be by fetal bacterium any malice subspecies like this so I made sure the strange were included in the end by ...\nAnd there's quite a few studies at this point when you take these several probe addict strains that within two\nTo three weeks your immune system is humming as far as its ability to be lethal against flu viruses\nThat works better\nThere's the cells that control the immune system like anti buddies\nAnd T cells and natural killer cells\nDo much better when you're on these particular strains of probiotics that's really important for older people\nThe lion's share of people who die from the flow yes some of them are young some of them are toddlers but the lion's share of people over the age of sixty\nBecause the immune system becomes less competent with age especially if you have a severe disease like severe high blood pressure or diabetes diabetes destroyed your immune system\nWhere you were treated for cancer with chemotherapy with the traditional chemotherapy like packed with tax and stuff like that um\nThe ... bring back the immune system so the antibodies that recognize the flu viruses the various flu viruses are in better shape to kill the flu\nAnd a T cells to control the immune system that start the ability of the immune system to really fight a flu infection or pneumonia or any of those nasty bacteria and viruses that are out there in the winter they're better and they're also better at shutting off the immune system once the infection has done\nYou want your immune system really active when you're sick she don't get an infection in your heart or in your brain or in your lungs\nBut once the infection has gone you want your immune system to shut off again to go back to its normal state where it's more observant than active it's the T cells that dude AT T cells like gamma delta T cells empty helper cells\nAnd uh the probiotics training system okay there's an infection get active kill the infection so it doesn't go into the brain or heart valves or something and now the infection has gone time to shut off because you don't want the immune system attacking your own bodies tissues you want to just attacking the virus or bacteria\nPlus the natural killer cells are more active natural killer cells are the first line of defense against the cancer so there's always cancer cells you only need one cancer cell destructive cancer process\nBut if your natural killer cells are functioning they will locate that cancer cell and kill it before and has time to start to cancer process there's always a maverick cancer cell every day in your body but the natural killer cells when they're working take it out\nSo to ... again and again and again I have been shown to help the antibodies work better there were also called immuno glider wing antibodies against the flu and cold so if you're getting a flu shot you really should be on a probe addict to help work better um to help\n'em the T cells ... the immune system's ability kick started in high gear to kill the infection and then shut down doubt activity FDR infections gone 'cause once again you don't want your immune system over active after an infection that would be called inflammation\nAnd also your natural killer cells but also the cells that duty actual killing the neutrophils\nThe neutrophils such as uh\nI'm not ... as\nThey are much better equipped to kill\nShe didn't section a parasite a worm or viruses bacteria much better equipped what they found in a host of studies I'm not even going to read the studies to you but I have them\nAnd if you need so many studies just emailed me and say hey send me some of those studies on the probiotic what the immune system I'll be happy to do that Jay Hickey at invite health dot com that's my email address Jay Hickey I'd invite health dot com\nAnd uh\nThey've shown that when you give a baby a probiotic one it's less likely to have a food allergy and to the immune system and the digestive tract develop better\nAnd they showed that little little kids toddlers two three four five six year olds\nHave fewer colds and fewer outbreaks of the flow and if they do get sick the infection never gets out of control it's a much milder infection and it shorter duration in general they recover faster and the amount of symptoms\nI'll tell you some when you have a little kid and they get the flu it's really scary\nAnd they've shown that college students when you give them probiotics\nThey have fewer sick days you're paying all that money\nFor your kid to attend that pricey college you might as well make sure that they can attend class and get their work done\nAnd if you give him a probiotic not only just your digestion better and they're less likely to get directions stomach cramps from all that stuff they're eating and drinking plus still lack of sleep that compounds that but um they're less likely to get the flu or cold\nSo that quarter of a million dollars you're paying for them to go to Temple University or Rutgers University or poverty yell\nIs better spent\nThey've shown even medical school students who are we going to take their national tests to see if they could get a license ... when you give them a probiotic and they're less likely to get a cold or flu infection\nI mean I've been there I was going for my finals in my third year pharmacy school which are killer killers they want you to flunk out a pharmacy school and the and the third year they really do they want to read aloud
