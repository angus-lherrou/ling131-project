called flavor flavor\nComes from ... state to probably southwest bounce new sunflower crunch Brad ... fire season starts taking my call us pouring sampling make it what you want\nAnd here's where it gets dangerous I said this yesterday\nPeople who are immediately jumping to Trump's rhetoric caused this or the media's rhetoric cause that those people are undermining the first amendment because the first amendment basic guarantee is that if I Am not inciting violence in my incitement to violence\nI mean saying go bomb someone than I Am not responsible for your violent actions you know was responsible for the violent actions here\nThe guy who put together bombs and mailed them to people that the guy responsible not President Trump not CNN that any of these folks\nJustice Bernie Sanders was not responsible for Bernie Sanders supporter going and attempting to shoot up a rational baseball game and justice Brock Obama was not responsible\nFor eight apparent fan of rock Obama trying to shoot up police officers in Dallas President Trump is not responsible for the immediate response was and I don't have to wait for the outcome to know that you know why because the sort of rhetoric that President Trump is\nHeaded has used as much as I dislike it as much as I've written on this program for years he has never once said go mail bombs to my political opponents and shouting lock her up is not the same thing as saying mail her a bomb it may in fact\nLead people to condemn each other at higher rate we talked about that yesterday but it is not in fact inciting violence the center for incitement to violence is for nearly Hi Andrew American law\nAs well it should be a President Trump reacted to all of this yesterday and his first statement was we all have to unify you know you're trying times but we all have to understand that violence is not appropriate\nAnd I just wanted to use it in these times we have to unify we have to come together and showed one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nOkay well that seems about the right answer\nDoesn't it that's the right answer and what he really should add at the end of that is listen I use charge Frederick my opponents used tried Frederick maybe we all should take a step back and tell them that down but\nThe reality is that nobody not me not my political opponents nobody has actually incentive by this kind of violence in the United states nobody in the United states in fighting this kind of violence in mainstream political rhetoric which is true okay to actually wants to the mainstream violence being pushed by political\nAgitator all you have to do is look at actual government in Iran where they literally chant death to America and call for violence against Jews all you have to do\nIs look at governments around the world repressive governments around the world to make clear they weren't violence done to their political opponents even President Trump's worst statements where he's making jokes about ... what you're talking about last week body Fleming report there was an actual difference it turns out between body slamming\nMore and bombing someone now if somebody went out and punch reporter and said I did it because President Trump was making this sort of remark about raging forte make light of that I Would say okay there's at least some connection there but I'm not going to say that there's a connection between people sending mail bombs\nAnd Maxine Waters and the president of the United states saying that Maxine Waters is a very low IQ individual we see that kind of stuff about each other all the time in a free country maybe it's not the best thing to say but that doesn't mean it's an incitement to violence is kind of stuff has to stop it really does but the media are not stopping it and President Trump fires back in just a second\nThe media obviously are not lowering the temperature it's amazing to watch members of the media claim\nThat violent rhetoric began with President Trump or overheated rhetoric not violent rhetoric overheated rhetoric began with President Trump if it weren't for Trump we wouldn't have anything like this really racing racing was sent to Senator Susan Collins two weeks ago a year and a half ago a Bernie Sanders supporter shot\nOr tempted if you're thirty six congresspeople and nearly killed the house\nMajority what Donald Trump junior is white was sent an actual toxic substance she had to go to the hospital for like two and a half months ago no this is not all Trump no it didn't start with ... this has been true in the United states for a very long time\nPeople use charged political rhetoric that does not mean violence is okay but violence has been commonplace in political circles for literally decades in the Nineteen sixties and seventies bombings were actually quite routine in the United states they're not routine thank God now we have an eye out for them as well we should let you pretend that ... the world began spinning with President Trump is just absurd\nEspecially considering some of the rhetoric that has used on a fairly frequent basis\nBy folks on the left about President Trump himself so for example today in the New York times or yesterday in the New York times there's an actual\nPiece in the New York times it's a fiction piece to spy novelist imagine Trump's next chapter and then the New York times if it's a new book review section and here's what they say they take\nOur focus here as a book reviews on books and stories but also on how the books being written and red reflect the world outside a book and one of the biggest stories out there of course the motor investigation and the relationship between Trump and who it's hard not to speculate about what might happen next that and we thought\nWho better than some of today's most talented spy and crime novel is one of these not unless the person ... isn't the pages of the New York Times Book review that quote the Russian landed in Dallas after forty eight hours traveling of necessity came from Moscow by a circuitous routes a long way with very specific task there'd be no return flight\nAnd the airport bars the TVs were tuned to different news channels but the story was the same first the president's campaign manager then his lawyer Republican congressman former aide\nFamily members those weren't indicted were subpoena house arrest had become fashionable and then it goes on and on about how this guy was basically shadowing the president of the United states and here's where where is always sharp gets to the key\nWhen it was time he went downstairs took his place in the lobby before the entourage appear the hotel staff have been lined up to see their boss the president go buy\nA few of them apart it most did not the president didn't seem to notice he waved and has a ... fashion the secret service agents clustered around him assured him toward the armored limo idling outside of the curb the Russian waited until they were a few steps half before you drew the gun decided on the center of the president's back and squeeze the trigger the macaroni missed fired\nThe secret service agents at the president shoulder heard the question into a crowd\nYou registered the scene instantly drawings or weapon with razor edge reflexes the Russian tasted failure he closed his eyes and waited to pay the costs of did not come he opened his eyes the secret service agents stood before him presenting his walk but first\nHear the agents had politely use mine and this was printed in New York Times the same day that the media decided that President Trump was the one who was pursuing violent rhetoric and was the only one person who violent rhetoric so I'll take a step back here everyone is overheated it needs to stop\nA few things can be throat once one wait for all the evidence to don't blame non violent but overheated rhetoric for violence and three if you want to take the temperature down you have to obey wanting to if you want to take the temperature down wait for evidence and don't blame people for violent act by third parties unless they are actively telling the third parties to commit the violence there\nWhat about our country that we're all going to need to do and that means don't come to confirmation bias as\nSoon as humanly possible okay let me get through the media is a response to all of this which is just agree just then President Trump's response to the media but first let's talk about your underwear guy's\nFall is here as you switch out your wardrobe don't watch your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade to reach soccer drawers with only fall colors in print from Tommy John Tommy John it's just fantastic underwear so that my kids took it out of my drawer and started wearing it around this morning I Am not kidding five pairs of them one over the other\nThat's a good time John you my kids love it Tommy John infected over every little detail on that using proprietary fabrics and perform like nothing\nYou've ever worn before as a result Tommy John men's and women's underwear sworn to know what you're guaranteed would've been helpful of high school comfortable staple waistband and a range of fabric that are luxurious we saw\nOther like moisture ... reasonable designed to move with you not against you know a bunch of you know riding a Tommy John his so confident in their underwear that if you don't love your first pair nickel refund their best burial everywhere or it's free guaranteed so you've got nothing to lose\nAnd this includes their women's underwear to now fully back in a hurry to Tommy John dot com now and he's probably been for twenty percent off your first order that's ... percent off only at Tommy John dot com again Tommy John dot com you ... for twenty percent off\nThe media have decided that President Trump is ... which was predictable Paul Waldman in the Washington Post actually just blames the presidents of the United states straight out he says allow me to suggest that blame\nIs too narrow way to make sense of a series of attempted bombing to end up precisely the people from another Republican spend a huge amount of time ... we don't have to look for clues about whether the person responsible either ...\nOr what their party registration is we don't have to assign directly and beyond a reasonable doubt well we can say that given what Trump has Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's wonder it took this long so in other words you don't need to wait for evidence right this is a guy who's overtly making the case in one of the nation from your newspapers\nYou don't need to wait for evidence if you wait for evidence then you're doing something wrong and said I'm going to jump to the conclusion I Want to jump do which is that President Trump is responsible for all of this year's a woman that does not trust the Trump advocates violence against his political opponents do he does is it everything about his rhetoric pushes his supporters in that direction\nEven if the overwhelming majority will never quite get to the point where they'll actually commit this kind of act of terrorism and well there are those of us on the right who felt that President Obama birds pretty easily on promoting violence sometimes when he talked about\nWhat the police were when he talked about how the police were overtly and systemically racist when he said that sort of stuff we felt like okay well you know is that an indication that maybe violence is okay there are folks in New York who felt that way people on the NYPD who felt that way that so much for the one bill de Blasio\nAfter ripping the police for months actually went to a policeman funeral was shot that members of the NYPD turned their back\nOn him and they did the bar for evidence is extraordinarily hire you ought to blame somebody for violence incitement you actually have\nTo have evidence but the left doesn't care about evidence they're not interested in evidence coming up CNN's Jeff Zucker doing a lot of journalists being himself\nHere's decided President Trump is directly responsible for all the terrible things happening in the country shot of shock CNN doesn't like president from this is wildly intellectually and morally Seinfeld went wife Ventura\nIt seems like a lot of political prophecy on both sides when the real world should be I'm not fighting violence and not responsible for violence will talk about it and then here\n[noise]\n\n\n\nDo degrees and sunny on robbed us of what the stories you'll be talking about on Seventy seven WABC NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill says while

CNN\nMaking the case that the president of the United states is responsible for this spate of male bombing attack again without any evidence they have no idea who this person is or why they're doing it but what do you need evidence for when you hate the president though\nWhen when they suggest that President from not like in his political opposition is to blame for somebody sending bombs to members of the political opposition all I have to say is you're trying to outlaw politics in the end what you're trying to outlaw get political opposition\nWhen I spoke at Berkeley\nThere are people outside chanting speech is violence that's basically the chance that's happening in CNN her headquarters here\nBut it's completely hypocritical by the way also because what the ... and what the folks at CNN really mean\nIs it speech is only violence is coming from the right person examples ... represented from President Trump is blaming members of the media and he's being mean\nAny being cruel that's at night he's letting numbers in the media or really the victims and all of that well let's be real they're the victims of the bomber but they're not necessarily the victims of President Trump the media can stand on their own two feet and they're fully capable of fighting back against the president and they have been for the last three years here is Don Lemon thing President Trump blame the victim\nNever I don't blame a victim tonight for him to sit there\nAnd blame us we're the victims here and only us it's disgusting\nAnd just you know what were the victims here were the victims are again CNN were victims\nBut not a president from not when it comes to that OK President Trump was saying that the overheated rhetoric on part of the media are confirming a bad environment the United states and the response of the folks in the media is let's overheat the rhetoric even more\nAnd I'm Sorry but this is this is over done okay ... ... ... ... hugging each other outside of CNN you know in the middle of a segment ... and doing this\nTake the gruesome facts the opportunity to be better I Love your brother good where we feel very must be careful\nYou know all all the folks who are or acting as though there is some sort of existential threats in the media in the United states I'm Sorry no I'm Sorry no there isn't okay this is a bad incident there is no question it's a bad incident the reason I have a little bit of lack of sympathy for that we we almost died here routine\nIs because the thing was stopped in the mail room with no detonator on and apparently my Jewish high school used to be evacuated three times a year for bomb threats minimum three times a year and you know what it wasn't people hugging and kissing outside because\nThere are crazy people out there there are crazy people out there but the way the ...\nAnd that it's not crazy people it's perfectly sane people are being directed by the president of the United states attack them they're an institution under assault by the president said was calling for violence on behalf of his of his political friends no no and you don't get to do this I'm Sorry Don and does not get to do this routine when the media are the victims at the same time\nThat he is out there claiming that antibodies wonderful this is just a couple of months ago is just a couple of months ago John Lennon claiming that he put an actual violent terrible than the United states is totally fine\n'em knowing condones violence but there were different reasons for antifa enforced\nThe last few years uh to either one racist ... the other groups fighting racist fashion\nOr they're not that bad I mean they're just fighting racist fascists antifa it's it's just again everyone is garbage okay the memorial is a new show everyone is garbage\nAnd couldn't couldn't mat GRE or they say I'm a evidence yeah but the money some of the show run and you're getting as they get rather Raul ... and I just talk about whatever funds in my brain lame at me coughing coughing credit I say OK by then I come in with that at a garbage can do I think our government should do because as you go\nTo say there is no connection between what Trump is about Hillary Clinton Rocco bomber Eric Holder John Brennan and soon and and the\nThinking of the person who sent those pipe bombs is foolhardy how do you will know that you don't know that he doesn't know that because he doesn't know things everybody assumes the worst on behalf\nOf everybody else and instead of saying there's a difference between he'd political rhetoric and violent political rhetoric we just jump in with both feet but Democrats are even worse than the media on this because the Democrats are absolutely hypocritical and absurd so Nancy Pelosi and Chuck
