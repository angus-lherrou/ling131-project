citizens and now their kids are entitled to all the benefits that American citizenship converse\nSo President Trump suggested today that he could change all of this by executive order here's what he said he said it was always told me they needed a constitutional amendment gets wet you know and and then he said it definitely can do it with an act of Congress and now they're saying I can do it\nWith just an executive order where the country and the Web Web person comes in and has a baby and the baby's essentially a citizen of the United states without the benefit it's ridiculous ridiculous and it has to and\nSo there are a couple of contention that he makes you can send your number one birthright citizenship is bad policy\nI tend to agree with him\nI think the birthright citizenship\nIs bad policy if you've just coming across the border and having a baby in the United states\nThat does not mean that you have come in for a legal immigration system and your children are going to be much more impacted obviously by their parents\nAnd they were going to be impacted simply by force and didn't of living in the United states oh if you're interested\nIn a country that assimilate people to American values you need people immigrating illegally and then having babies here legally now listen legal residents of the United states different story because legal residents very often are preparing to become immigrants to the United states on my inlaws for example were legal residents to the United states\nMy wife came here as a child she came here back and forth until she was well they came here permanently when she was well she's not become an American citizen in the United states until actually after we were married and not because we're married but because her her time waiting ...\nThat was basically a when she was Twenty one twenty two years old she got her American citizenship because you had to wait ten years in order to get American citizenship but her younger brother was born in the United states and he was an American citizen as you should have been his parents were legal residents of the United states\nThe fourteenth amendment essentially guarantees that if you are legal residents in the United states or a citizen of the United states\nYour children are American citizens which again makes it there but if that because if you want to make sure that kids are ensconced in the American way of life I Want to make sure that their parents are loyal to the United states government and are loyal to the American constitution\nThe same is not true for the children that need legal immigrant if you just come across the border have a baby never go through the legal process we didn't want you reading there there's no evidence that we want you maybe we do on you know there's no evidence of that than suggesting that this inherently is is a good idea is is kind of hard to President Trump says\nThat we're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby and the baby's a citizen of the United states that's not true there are thirty countries across the world that have birthright citizenship most of those happened to me in central and South America\nCuba Haiti these these are places with birthright citizenship is not wrong however that in the developed world we are almost unique and I say almost I mean the only other country that has anything remotely like he birthright citizenship category\nIs Canada Canada has sort of birthright citizenship category as well no country in Europe does so for all the talking about Europe being open and welcoming to immigrants the United states is birthright citizenship policy\nIs significantly more open and the European policy and you're using a lot of folks in the media doesn't know anything about constitutional law opine on these issues\nSuggested the fourteenth amendment dictate the children of illegal immigrants are by necessity under the constitution citizens of the United states that is not clear nor is it correct I think under the text of the fourteenth amendment to the fourteenth amendment says it all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and if the state will end of the state we're in they reside that key phrases subjected to the jurisdiction there up again I'll read it again all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and if the state where and there was like why is that is necessary\nAnd you're just reading that why do you need the phrase subject the jurisdiction there out why not just all persons born or naturalized in the United states are citizens of the United states obviously the phrase comes to add something\nWhat does the phrase compact what does the phrase subject to the jurisdiction their outcomes at\nWell the people who framed this amendment knew what it came to add it was to prevent a situation where a foreign diplomats comes to the United states ambassador from France comes to the United states in his wife has a baby and now the baby is an American citizen not only that it was meant to prevent citizenship for Native American tribes because we were trying to ensure that Native American\nBabies born to Native American tribes not automatically American citizens because that would be taking sovereignty from the Native American tribes\nAnd same thing was true of soldiers who are fighting from abroad in the United states let's say there was a mercenary force that came to the United states who brought along their wives they're fighting the United states government\nTheir ... their wives had babies in the United states it was meant to exclude that why because they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states government meaning that if you worst subject to the jurisdiction of another government you are not subject to the jurisdiction of the American\nGovernment Shapiro of the K to Institute points out again the phrases originally written to exclude the children of Native American tribes from American citizenship\nAs well as the children are foreign diplomats and soldiers from abroad fighting an American led the amendment itself the fourteenth amendment specifically designed to reverse read Scott there's an awful evil Supreme Court case in which they ate and escaped slaves in Dred Scott\nSued for his American citizenship he said I'm an American citizen I was born in the United states I was ... I I get my masters I'm\nNow in the north and now I'm ... I'm not going to return to slavery\nAnd the average my rights to return slavery in Dred Scott the Supreme Court in evil fashion found constitution of the United states not apply to black people born in the United states because they were not covered by the constitution the fourteenth amendment was designed to reverse that and say that if you're a freed slave or a black person born in the United states\nAnd you are a citizen of the United states senator Jacob ... Republican in Michigan explained the purpose of the subject to the jurisdiction thereof provision back when it was written you said this will not of course include persons born in the United states for foreigners aliens who belongs to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states\nBut will include every other class of persons it settles a great question of citizenship and the moves all doubt as to what persons\nAre or are not citizens of the United states on just a second we'll get to the Supreme Court just ... which kind of money is the issue more than the amendment actually does from the very outset but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like you said why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nHe'll sleep has built to sweep quit it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sweet preference as to the perfect mattress whether aside bleep or a hot sleeper when you're like a pleasure from but he looks there's no more guessing and no more confusion just go to Hugh asleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes because they will match you told mattress that will give you the best leap of your life for couples\nHeels can even split the mattress down the middle providing individual support needs and your preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty gets tried out for a hundred nights risk free right now is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress or\nAfter a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he like sleep dot com slash Shapiro again he was ... dot com slash Shapiro\nMy wife and I love our he looked sleep mattress we took that question the mattress arrive in the Malian wrapped it in a way to right in front of us we touched on bed right we're good to go we've been moved to a more expensive ... out of the room because he looks legions that much better we got my sister one for her wedding\nHe looks like dot com slash appearing at a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or again that he likes leak dot com slash Shapiro use that clash of Europe and the special deal okay so the Supreme Court has weighed in on birthright citizenship kind of but not really\nWhat I mean but it's there's a line of cases with regard to citizenship that don't actually clarify the issue with regard to children of illegal immigrants\nSo here's a line of cases in Eighteen eighty four there was a Supreme Court case ... versus Watkins ever in which the Supreme Court ruled that a Native American born under the jurisdiction are they Native American tribes and not unilaterally making self a citizen of the United states so what happened is there was a baby was born to Native American family under Native American tribal sovereignty\nHe said listen I don't want to be subject Native American tribal sovereignty and I was born in the United states I mean the United states citizen and the court said no\nYou don't get to make yourself in the United states citizen just because you were born in the United states if your parents were subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign body namely Native American tribes there seems to cut against birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants\nIllegal immigrants are intact citizens of another country and they're subject to the jurisdiction of those other countries how do we know that's because under the Vienna conventions\nIf an illegal immigrant in the United states from Mexico say commits a crime we have an obligation under the convention to let him know about his constantly right we have to let him know that he can go to his local conflict and at the consulate will provide him services this was a duplicate it in a case ... called ... versus ... went all way to record\nIn which this dive murdered someone on American soil read or write someone the rate at may have been raped and murdered in any case he\nWas not in form of his right to consular access and this was considered a violation of his right because he was illegal immigrants\nIn the United states so this seems very much in line with that right this Eighteen eighty four cases has just 'cause you're born in the United states if you are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign power you are not United States citizen in eighty Ninety eight there was another case and this is the one that proponents of birthright citizenship like just like\nThe Supreme Court ruled that ... was a child born in the United states to illegal residents Chinese immigrant couple was included in birthright citizenship\nAgain that was a legal resident that's more like the case of my parents in law and my and my brother in law and he was born in the United states legal resident Paris and therefore he's an American citizen fine this was not due to get the question we legal immigrant children was not adjudicated all the way until Nineteen eighty two coming up we're going to discuss\nThe Supreme Court case that really speaks\nTo whether the children of illegal immigrants are American citizens and as always Supreme Court\nDominated by power has been for decades to fight in

particular synagogue Oregon after this particular group except that he was very angry at the Hebrew immigrant aid society which is a group that welcomes refugees into the United states\nAnd so if President Trump were using such inflammatory rhetoric than this ... wouldn't have been targeted\nThis raises a couple of questions one whether in fact his rhetoric whether inflammatory rhetoric is connected with ... and number two whether it's accurate so as far as the accuracy\nShop Smith was on Fox News last night saying there is no invasion he's getting all sorts of plaudits republic on the left are saying that there was ... sort of railing against the language being used with regard to the migrant heroin\nTomorrow is one week before the midterm election which is what all of this was about there is no invasion no one's coming to get you there is nothing at all to worry about\nAnd now the question is whether people really believe that when Trump says there's an invasion taking place whether he means that in sort of generalized fashion meaning that way to be legal immigrants are coming across the border thousands at a time and it just is having an impact on our culture it's had an impact on our economic and having an impact on our labor force\nOr whether they actually believe the most inflammatory version of this which is that they're legitimately people are coming into destroy the United states with Ellen ... but I don't I'm not fond of this sort of rhetoric you know the sort of scare tactics\nThat people are bringing in criminality and disease like we actually have to look at the statistics and see whether that is true or not\nWith that said with that said I Am deeply worried that people are connecting rhetoric violence in a way that actually ... censorship\nSo the ... let's let's be Frank about the connection between rhetoric and violence it is true that speech is related to action it is you listen to my show presumably if you agree with me on now more likely to get involved in politics in a way that I Would agree with that is why do the show every day I'm trying to get people to think in a different way or the Gemini issues a little bit differently\nAnd that's normal that's the way politics work we do it every day with our children we would every day with our friends or co workers and their spouses\nSpeech is related to action would that set the attempt by folks on the left to connect every action\nOf speech with violence and the jets at speeches connected with violence is a way of shutting down speech of course more nasty rhetoric is more likely to create more nasty action that is a question really of us being circumspect but I I really don't think that that's\nWhat we ought to be debating in in the how we speak question first of all I Will note that the less auto refusal with knowledge that the lessons and been in any way responsible anyway responsible for the heightening of rhetoric over the past ten years\nIs that irresponsible that you're not as well not only is irresponsible as polarizing and it actually leads to radicalization\nRadical rhetoric leads radicalization you know what else leads to radicalization being called a radical by the other side uh unjustifiably that also leach radicalization all you got right now is everybody pointing fingers at everybody else\nNobody looking at themselves and say OK what can I Do to change the tenor and climate of the political debate\nAnd with the west has been doing with regard to Trump's talk on caravans and migrants has been saying all Trump is causing violence I don't actually think that the biggest problem with what President Trump is doing and and the same thing is drawing the line when Bernie Sanders has millions will die because of Republican health care I don't think that the big problem with that\nIs that somebody is going to go and shoot up a congressional baseball game I don't know Bernie Sanders responsible for that I think the problem with the these sort of radical polarized rhetoric that kind of inflamed rhetoric the problem with that sort of thing\nIs that when something terrible does happen when somebody does something that is truly evil and somebody goes in shoots up a synagogue for example instead of us unifying and saying all of that is bad\nWe are now more likely to see the other side as responsible break crime that we all agree is evil\nThe social fabric relies on looking at each other as though we are friends not enemies but if our politics is all about how we are enemies and when something bad happens to be first reaction is to blame it on your enemy and when that happens in social fabric actually the case that the biggest problem the teacher\nYou know when Kass on his team he writes a piece for Bloomberg today and what you said that Trump's hateful speech raises the risk of violence it the the one sided focused on President Trump's speech as opposed to the left speech",
