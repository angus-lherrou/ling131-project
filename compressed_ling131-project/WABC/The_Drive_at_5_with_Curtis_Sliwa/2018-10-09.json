had your windows in ten years really gonna blown it in five years we're going to blow on it three years we're going to blow well now the new report they should be the headline today it's not that like the new report basically to get sort of the opposite that it does in chapter two of of this new report\nNikki quote as well there is high agreement across various lines of evidence that's in the report that the remaining carbon budget or one point five degrees Celsius or two degrees Celsius would be larger than the ... time of the hour by the by the elastic study they did that was that you know at least once he Thirteen twenty working what that means no\nNon science be is that it turns out that our carbon emissions have been lower than they thought they were when they\nFirst made their estimate which means that the climate is warming it slightly lower rate than they thought it would be at this point so the estimated date for hitting one point five degrees Celsius of of global warming is actually it's been pushed out further now they were saying that we're going to hit that in three four years\nNow they're saying we're going to hit that in ten years they keep pushing that down the line\nThe reason that this creates some skepticism among folks is not because people don't necessarily believe in climate change at all as the climate is changing it does raise questions as to the sensitivity of the climate to human produced carbon emissions Cuban produce greenhouse gases\nSkepticism I think is warranted with regard to some of the more outrageous claims that are being made by un members and radical leftists who do indeed many of them have an alternative agenda and not just saying they have an alternative gender they're basically saying so there's going to Eric ... who is a meteorologist and a visiting scholar at\nUm at us and I owe it I'm not sure whether the University of Minnesota I suppose I and he he actually calls\nFor an end to capitalism in order to fight climate change\nNow there are a lot of folks on the right who have been suggesting for a long time that was actually the agenda here that all of the worry the extremely worried about climate change was really designed\nTo hamper America's economy in the world and the evidence for this was actually presence right there was evidence that for example the Paris accords which were demands on the United states that we were supposed to radically shift how we did business while other countries made empty promises about how they did business in China suggested for example that they were committed\nTo reducing greenhouse gases after peaking in twenty thirty well American studies already showed that China was planning on speaking it's greenhouse gases in twenty thirty they promise to do something they're already going to do India promised that they were going to gradually lower greenhouse gas emissions at some\nPoint in the future that promise didn't mean anything there's a lot of folks\nIn the United states were saying well why are we committed ourselves to attempt in targets when the world's greatest emitters and polluters are not actually time themselves to anything\nOf substance here no air cold house he says that if you're wondering what you can do about climate change the world's top scientists just gave rigorous backing to systemically dismantled capitalism as a key requirements maintaining civilization\nIn a habitable planet I mean if you're looking for something to do with the idea is that we have to get rid of capitalism completely wears you getting this from in the report well there's a section in chapter\nFour of the un report that says increasing evidence suggests that climate sensitive realignment of savings and expenditure toward low emission climate resilience infrastructure and services requires an evolution of global international financial system\nEstimate suggests that in addition to climate friendly allocation of public investments that'd be like building levees and ensuring that there's infrastructure a potential re direction of\nFive to ten percent of annual capital revenues is necessary so basically the entire profit margin should be redirected as the un suggests that it should be read directed now there there are several problems with this report the first problem is the way that it's actually reported by mainstream media so the way the New York times\nReports that the landmark report from the un scientific panel on climate change painting a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought except that's not really true not much change between the twenty Thirteen report and this particular part they are five and this report not much changed at all\nIn fact the only thing that really changed that they said that their forecast for June has actually been pushed out a few more years\nBut the way the New York times covered this or that everyone is going to die\nAt one point five degrees Celsius change by twenty forty as opposed to two degrees Celsius changed by twenty forty\nThe report issued on Monday by the answer governmental panel on climate change says that a world where it describes the world the worsening food shortages and wildfires amassed die off of coral reefs as soon as twenty forty a period well within the lifetime of much of a global population\nWhen the New York times says that what they want you to picture the day after tomorrow that movie with Dennis Quaid where suddenly giants nominee just washers through New York city and set the whole place under ice for a thousand years\nAnd global warming is responsible for the rising sea levels and everyone dies and catastrophic it's deep impact\nExcept the climate the problem is that that's not really true all this climate change is going to happen over the course of the next century human beings are pretty good and adaptable when it comes to adapting overtime to threat to the present themselves overtime climate has been changing\nAcross the world for the last century and a half those into Eighteen eighty in Seventy\nAnd human beings have been migrating and moving and developing new technologies to deal with all that and the same will hold true in the future as well now to talk a little bit more about the un report in just a second but first let's talk about your

you report\nAnd they this is just a climate analytics a nonprofit organization they're a left leaning one you're not aware of this just a few years ago it's quite a shock and quite concerning so this is the first report commissioned by world leaders under the Paris Agreement which again is that two thousand Fifteen pack that people supposedly sign but really made no real commitment to keep\nAnd Trump said this is a waste of time and pulled us out of it to the authors filed found that of greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate the atmosphere will warm up as much as you point seven degrees Fahrenheit one point five degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels by twenty forty\nInundating coastlines and intensifying droughts\nAnd poverty there are significant problems I should mention in climate change modeling none of the models have been put forth so far actually reflect the level of climate change has been occurring virtually all of them over shoot the mark and that's because climate is actually very difficult\nTo predict are a lot of factors that are involved in climate now how much of climate change is caused by human activity certainly some the PC she says eighty percent folks like Roy Spencer who I'm sure you've heard on the other talk right if it were my Rush Limbaugh Roy Spencer\nHe says that he thinks about fifty percent but certainly our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions leads to climate change the question is really not whether that's happening it's what extent\nAnd also what the economic damage is from such climate change what the human damages from such climate change so than New York times\nIs playing this up as much as humanly possible avoiding the most serious damage as requires transforming the world economy in just a few years said the authors who has to make that the damage would come at a cost to fifty four trillion dollars while they conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid to point seven degrees of warming\nThey concluded maybe politically unlikely for example the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions perhaps as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton by Twenty one hundred would be required that takes forty dollar per gallon tax on carbon has what you're talking about every time you go to the ... and you buy ten gallons of gas\nIt turns out that there are arguments actually under cut some of the arguments being made by the same folks who are promoting them and promoting it that easy to report now there's
