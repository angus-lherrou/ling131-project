{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "The harsh an unfair treatment a judge that have now is having an incredible impact on voters that people get far better than the politicians most importantly this great law like cannot be ruined and Maine and despicable Democrat and totally uncorroborated allegations\nA hundred percent right on this even ... even ... expressing gratitude that Trump is president today which is an amazing thing right Brett evens it out of anti Trump\nAnd his possible debate he is a true never Trump Republican and he came out in the New York times today and said I Am very very pleased that Donald Trump is president and standing by Brett Kavanaugh\nNow there are a lot of folks on the left and don't seem to understand why folks on the radar so passionate about this issue the original passionate about this issue is because it looks like due process and presumption of innocence have been talk completely are now the second\nI'm gonna get to the counter argument being made by some folks I think in good faith folks like him Harris on his podcast\nI'm friendly with them and we've been having a little bit of a text back and forth about that\nAnd I don't I'm not really any secrets he's got all this stuff publicly ought to talk about that and just a second but the way that Republicans are viewing this way conservatives are viewing this way independents are viewing this is\nA man was accused after thirty six years of allegedly sexually assaulting a girl back when he was Seventeen years old there is no corroborating evidence and Democrats wants to run him out of his life over and then the media have decided to latch onto every single woman they possibly can\nIn order to prevent cabin up from joining the court that's what this looks like anyone I think of objective by I don't even think it's conservative anyone of justify the process sucks now there are two separate questions and this is where I think it's worthwhile discussing\nThe most intellectually honest version of the left the state they're two separate questions does the process and does Brett Kavanaugh deserve to be on the court now these two issues are not completely separate the process\nAnd it stuck edge or one of the reasons why Brett Kavanaugh got himself into a little bit of trouble with regards his testimony them to talk about the trouble he got himself into with regard was testimony just a second\nBut the ... the process is what most people are concerned with at this point because it feels like whatever complaints are being made about Brett Kavanaugh sexually fruit of the boys in history when you accuse the guy a gang rape and you start going through his your book\nAnd then your final case against him as he filmed about stuff in his high school yearbook\nAnd that's why he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court that feels like root of the poisonous tree in the worst possible way and in a second I'm gonna discuss that case also it feels like the media are out to get have not because they are Ronan Farrow has done some really good work on the beach and stuff like some some really excellent work\nOn me to stop and he completely has undermined his own credibility with regard to Brett Kavanaugh so you recall that a week ago the New Yorker piece by Jane Mayer who is not a good reporter and Ronan Farrow who is a good reporter\nThey put out a piece suggesting that a woman and Deborah Ramirez when she was at Yale was in a broken wrap party and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd his pants and exposed himself to her and that was the accusation it was at a party she apparently considered it for six days because she wasn't sure that you remember that correctly or that it was cabinet and then she came forward and told the story there were no corroborating witnesses well last night the New Yorker sides in order to undermine the credibility of the FBI investigation\nThey are going to come forward with new witnesses to Deborah ... statements well that'd be kind of a bombshell wouldn't it except that not actually\nWhat the report said on Wednesday evening New Yorker runs this investigative piece from Meyer and Ronan Farrow the peace claimed that the FBI investigation into sexual assault claims against Kavanaugh was insufficient what made the investigation insufficient well here's what they said they said quote frustrated potential witnesses\nWho have been unable to speak with the FBI agents conducting the investigation into sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had been resorting to sending statements unsolicited the bureau and dissenters in hopes that there would be seen before the inquiry concluded\nThe FBI investigation is justice Feinstein said insufficient because there are a bunch of witnesses who have not been interrogated by the FBI\nAnd they'd been desperately reaching up the FBI trying to tell their vital story what are they are vital story well the key vital story comes from a new kind of apple headed that hold according to the New Yorker was a sweet make a Brett Kavanaugh's at the time of the alleged incidents in previously spoken to the New Yorker about Ramirez and condition of anonymity\nBut he said that he is now willing to be identified because he believed the FBI ... thoroughly investigated allegations apple\nWith Jane pacing Nichols professor of reformation history at Princeton Theological Seminary\nAnd the first heard about the alleged incident involving cabinet and Ramirez\nEither the night of the card or a day or two later\nApple said he was one hundred percent certain that he was told the Kavanaugh was the male student exposed himself Ramirez well okay that's pretty damn except frighten me here's a guy who's saying that he heard\nAbout cabinet exposing himself at this party so why is and you have to I talking to him literally the FBI investigation is a ruse clearly it hasn't been done most thoroughly enough and all the rest of it well there's only one problem buried a few paragraphs down there in the story\nIs a little spoiler that completely undermines the New Yorker story I Will explain\nThat were you in just one second but first let's talk about your comfort down below alright you close your eyes imagine yourself in the locker room back in high school were in your current underwear I Know it's just a nightmare in every respect why would you want to be back in high school why would you want to be in the locker room and why would you want to be wearing those ugly ugly underwear\nIf the answer is you wouldn't well then maybe you should try Tommy John the revolutionary clothing brand is redefining comfort\nFor men and women Tommy John obsessing over every little detail in pitch by using fabrics to perform like nothing you've ever worn before Tommy John men's and women's underwear they supported ... guarantee\nComfortable staple way fans of ranger fabric that are luxurious lease off better like moisture watching reasonable designed to move with you not against you Tommy John it's so confident in their underwear if you don't love your first time you get a full refund with their best Perry will ever where or it's free guarantee\nAnd that includes their life changing women's underwear which is now fully\nBack and got so go check out Tommy John's right now is political Shapiro at Tommy John dot com right now say ... percent on your first or as political Shapiro for twenty percent off and Tommy John dot com again Tommy John dot com bust on where you can buy plus they have their best Perry you'll ever where or free guarantee there's no risk involved\nTommy John dot com you that political Shapiro for twenty percent off\nSo how did the New Yorker undermine that okay so they say here's a witness a witness who says he heard about Brett Kavanaugh exposing himself to a girl I Gail now getting to the different allegation than the you tried to sexually assault somebody this is a bad drunken brat antics that is gross but it's not quite the same thing as\nPressing yourself on a girl and putting your hand over her mouth where there are gradations of evil this one is a little bit lower than the other one but there is a big problem with a New Yorker story okay the New Yorker story says this is actually what it said in the story quote apple said that he initially asked remain anonymous because we hope to make contact first with a classmate who the best of his recollection\nTold them about the party and it was an eye witness and the incident he said he had not been able to get any response from that person just by multiple attempts to do so the New Yorker reached the classmates but he said\nHe had no memory of the incident\nSo in other words here's what the New Yorkers are boring 'cause they're big bombshell this guy heard secondhand\nAbout a party which cabinet exposed himself without permission to grow and this guy said I'm not coming forward and so I talked to the guy told me the story the New Yorker actually identified that got which supposedly witnessed the event and they want and they talk to them\nAnd that guy that I don't remember anything about that wouldn't that actually be the end of the story like in a normal journalistic can wind up in the end of story if I if I spoke to somebody and they said I heard a rumor from ...\nThat this happened and he was an eyewitness and then I when I spoke to the eye witness and the I wouldn't have said no no no remember anything about that that would be the end of the story the New Yorker ran with it anyway because this is the length which journalists we'll go to sink Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nAnd then that report and the New Yorker and gets even worse\nThe New Yorker wrote that some of Kavanaugh's classmate said he was a bully in high school who laughed at other kids is a quote New Yorker story in his statement\nWhich is attorney there's another witness in his statement which is attorney also sent several members of the Senate Judiciary committee on Tuesday you describe cabinet as part of a quick of high school athletes most of whom are on the football team\nWho routinely picked on less physically fit or popular students he said he never witnessed have not physically attacking other students but he recalled in doing nothing to stop the physical and verbal abuse and said he said cabinet stood by and laugh at the victim so what he was a jerk and high school was part of the popular kids quick\nIt's coming from a guy who was deeply unpopular high school that I have no sympathy for guys who were boys in high school or who stood by what bullying occurred in high school I have no sympathy for that 'cause I was a brutal victim of bullying when I was in high school\nBut being a victim of bowling does not mean that I think that anyone who was bullied in high school also rape checks but that's the implication from New York is er and you wonder why the right is reacting with outrage to all of us that's why the right is reacting outrage coming up Dr Christine\nBlasey Ford's attorneys response to the FBI investigation suffice it to say they are unhappy but the reason they are unhappy is quite stupid ... y that reason it's so stupid and we'll take a look at other attempts by Democrat to knock down Kavanaugh's nomination very last minute

I was in college and make sure who did it Oh yes a hundred percent\nAnd then she just goes on and on about what exactly happened here and it's pretty terrible I don't know what the inclusion supposed to make because Christine I Know the truth as you do this logic is just as applicable to crystal ... who do come across rape accuser whose line or on the talk with\nThe Columbia University random user was lying if the standard if something bad happened to me so you're telling the truth we have no system up your process presumption of innocence and go and it's just an insane Glenn\nOther insane Clinton Seventeen hundred watt professors have signed that letter that they sent to the New York times and then sent on to the United States Senate on October for and they talk about judicial temperament so case number ... so there are several cases now being brought against Kavanaugh\nBased not on the original allegations of based on ancillary allegations that pays number one is something that happened to me so I Believe for their okay illogical neck nothing tastes number two Brett Kavanaugh got mad he got angry you accused him of raping people and then he got angry and that means that he's not fit for the court\nAnd you use partisanship in order to destroy this man why\nAnd then you're mad and call that you're partisanship that he's a part of it they shouldn't sit on the court you know the reason no one cares about the law professors thing because everyone knows the professors a Democrat I went to Harvard law school you know how many Republicans were on staff at Harvard law school as far as I Know one\nThe number of of actual Republican or conservative in the halls of law school academia are Neal debate with a bunch of partisan Democrats signing letters\nSaying they don't like Brett Kavanaugh because he got mad one letter as we are professors who teach research and write about the judicial institutions of the country\nThe question that issue it's painful for anyone but judge Kavanaugh dip it in a given and they lack of commitment to judicial inquiry\nUh-huh so when it tore us RPG Ruth Bader Ginsburg ripped on Trump and says you shouldn't be president that's not partisanship he deserves to sit on the court when judge Kavanaugh gets angry that people are calling the gang rape is an open television\nThen that's obviously a reason that you shouldn't be on the court that tape number two is that Brett Kavanaugh dot net\nOh no he got mad and that means that he shouldn't be on the court that means the Democrats have fallen back on their mind okay he's their fight okay one that they are they're finally falling back on\nAt the latest is that judge Kavanaugh committed perjury there it's interesting that in his testimony judge Kavanaugh committed a bunch of ... he led a bunch of time so\nFirst of all let us to find what perjury is in the ...\nSome of the law is a false statement that his material to the proceedings that at the definition of perjury okay this is the the United States department of Justice Department of justice standard for perjury section Seventeen forty eight elements of perjury\nMateriality the false statement must be material to the proceeding a false statement as material if it has a natural tendency to influence or capable of influencing the decision of the decision making body to which it was addressed testimony not had to actually influence misled or impeded\nThe proceedings so if you lie to impede a grand juries line of inquiry\nThen that would be a violation of perjury charges if you're President Clinton and you suggest you did not in fact have sex with that woman that is legitimate perjury but that is not the same thing as you know you asked a question about whether it snowed on a particular day you know it's not easy it rained and it has no actual material impact\nOn the course of the investigation that's perjury okay that's not how it works so what are the whys of Brett Kavanaugh supposedly told first of all it is important to note that all of his testimony was given it in the context of him being accused of a gang rape by a bunch of Democrats", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Drive at 5 with Curtis Sliwa", "city": "New York", "day": "04"}
