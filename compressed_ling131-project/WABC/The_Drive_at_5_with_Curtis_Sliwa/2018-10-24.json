what you're saying but where where do you think what do you think that this is going to motivate people to do not take it seriously as they say the Democrats are going to play this ... this is reckless\nOr you are you telling me that they don't play dirty already I felt like I guess you would you I guess you were you out of the country when they try to destroy cabinet with allies\nAre

I get financing please insects take into my ... point sampling making what you want\nScience fiction author Arthur C clocks at any sufficiently\nSo with that said obviously this is really really bad stuff\nAnd it goes to the question of motive because what we're seeing now why is this breaking out so much why are we seeing rights and sent to Susan Collins innate why are we seeing rock the moon's a thrown through windows and having the copies offices in California why are we seeing\nBombs put in George Soros his mailbox it's because they're a group of people who have been fully convinced that the other side and I just mean the other side ideas I mean people who are on the other side are actively members of evil\nThey're hilarious figures and that sort of rhetoric\nIs is responsible for heating up\nThe temperature it's not responsible for individual acts of violence\nBut it is responsible for an increase in the temperature\nAnd the more you increase the temperature the more you can expect that they are going to be people who are going to go to the ultimate extreme of attempting to engage in violence you seen it on the left some on the right and it's really ugly no matter how\nYou slice it seems to me that a lot of this is springing from a basic failure of values\nAnd the basic failure values is something that we call in Hebrew there's a there's a Hebrew commandment that you're supposed to consider everybody in their best possible way that they keep a price for it has done the cost of ... which literally means that you're supposed to\nThink of everybody's marriage we don't do that anymore we tend to and said think of everybody's ... we tend to think of the worst form of everybody's arguments we tend to think the worst motives\nOn the part of people with whom we disagree we see someone say something in the first thing we think is not okay what's reasonable explanation for what they're saying or what maybe were they thinking instead we immediately jumped to this person is the worst person in the world\nAnd the rhetoric is obviously intended for ... for the worst possible that now I Can't say I have an innocent and that's because I don't think anybody in politics is innocent and but I Do think that we're going to have to start trying to attribute to people perhaps a less uh less vicious motive and we have been attributing to them so far because people hate each other not because of what they do but because of what they think\nThey are and they think the other person is thinking that's where we are in American society is one thing to hate another person because of something that they do but I think they somebody murders your father you're allowed to hate them but what we have come to in society is actions that can be interpreted in a couple of ways\nAnd we have decided to interpret them in the least flattering most nasty way about somebody else to take an example there's a religious Baker and Colorado He says listen I don't want to bake a cake for ... impact sweating because I Believe that homosexuality is simple we immediately attribute that to malice\nWe immediately attribute that to that because the Baker is a mean man who have gay people never mind the makers in serving gay couples for years and has a tablet and he's just saying I don't want the ropes or hamstrung into violating my own religious precepts\nNo we have to attribute him hatred we have to attribute team viciousness and we see that on the other side as well and there are folks on the left will say things like well I won't nationalized healthcare and instead of us saying on the right\nWell maybe they won't nationalized healthcare because they don't understand the issue or because they misunderstand how nationalized healthcare works or because they have a good faith argument about how we should redistribute resources\nInstead we go to is because they won't control is because they won't control once you start explaining people's motives without reference to the actual behavior you're going to get yourself into hot water politically entered into divide the country on a more significant and we'll laughing level\nAnd yet this is also here's the problem this is awesome stuff that window elections the stuff that wins elections in today's society is castigate in your opponent as morally somehow deficient thing that your opponent is not just wrong the evil they'll Ronald Reagan was famous for saying\nThat it isn't that Democrats are are just there are evil it's that they know so much that isn't so in other words he attributed to ignorance\nWhat he could not attribute to mail it and it's it's a it's a rule that I've had on the program primary attributes of stupidity what you can some tributes malice but when it comes to political fight the easiest thing to do is a tribute malice to the other side and you say was none of us in a couple of different ways let's say for example the way that the left\nHas decided to read President Trump's comments about nationalism for the president of the United states gives a speech a couple of days ago\nIn which he was talking about illegal immigration and President Trump is no stranger to character attacks or uses them on a fairly frequent basis against is lyrical opponents whether they're former opponents like Ted Cruz\nOr whether they are opponents in the Democratic party\nWhy because the fact that it's a lot more effective to attack somebody character and then to attack their ideas because we tend to vote based on whether we think somebody is a good person or not\nNot based on whether we believe their ideas are good see evaluating ideas takes time and effort evaluating ideas requires you to actually sit there and determine whether you think that the evidence is there to support particular idea but evaluating human being you can do like that\nAnd science tends to show that that's exactly how we deal with other human beings in our daily life in politics more broadly when you meet somebody you tend to make a judgment about that person within the first five seconds of meeting them whether you think this is a good person or a bad person a nice person or a mean person a person who you think is going to benefit your wife or a person who's going to be a detriment to your life to make that decision and second\nThere's a lot easier and a lot more instinctive human brain is built for that rather than thinking through okay what are the policies at this politician it's just that we as a society need to start thinking about the policy is a lot more and stop attributing motives so much but again it is easier and more ... lucrative to suggest evil motive\nOn the part of people that you face down character attacks are deeply effective I wrote an entire book about this and two thousand Thirteen called bullies and the entire premise of book that basically lessened decided to leave idea arguments outside the realm of the norm\nAnd instead have decided to attack on a character basis everybody on the right to ... example here's President Trump a couple of days ago saying that he's a national is not a global now even implicit in this comment by President Trump is a character attack on what the character attack on the left as the people in the United states who disagree with him about immigration\nActually don't care about the United states but that's sort of implicit in what President Trump is saying but the real point that he's making is that his priorities are the protection of the American people above all else\nAnd other priorities such as for example kindness or human rights those take second priority protection of the nation's borders maybe for human rights reasons maybe for charitable reasons but that's the way he thinks that things were going to see in a second what President Trump that\nBut first let's talk about your underwear dudes ball is here and as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect her

disclosure I'm president Megan Kelly I think the Megan Kelly is a really nice lady uh I I was I used to be a regular guest on her Fox News show and she was on Fox News\nAnd I wish her nothing about about Megan got herself into hot water because she was on yesterday an NBC News and they were doing saw and what was the soft up they were doing it was it was the NBC morning show while the stuff that they were doing\nWas they were talking about Halloween costumes well there's always gets into dicey areas because as soon as you start talking about limits on Halloween costumes and what should be allowed and what shouldn't be allowed people get very easily offended by Halloween costumes\nTo the point where people on the left have been suggesting in recent years a white girl shouldn't be able to dress up as Milan up for Halloween and talked about last Halloween is just idiocy it's just the idiocy\nMy daughter is going to dress up as any Disney Princess you chosen by making stuff in some pretty broad territory here because\nShe's talking about the use of a dressing up as black folks for Halloween and whether you can put on black makeup dress up as a black person for Halloween 'cause we're making has to say and this goes to the central contention and making today which is that people are jumping\nThe worst possible conclusion about people's motives without actually analyzing what the motives are so here's making talking about Halloween costumes involving putting on black makeup or darkening your skin for a costume and the blowback was just enormous\n[laughter] it's really you do get in trouble if you are a white person what's on the way or a black person it puts on white we like that that was a kid that was okay as long as you were dressing up as like a character\nOkay so if you've gotten all sorts of problems because then when I was a kid was okay to dress up as Diana Ross has been Diana Ross than in my neighborhood if somebody darken skins what what Diana Ross because if you just put on a bright with a you know ... to look like the Enron people still ... dark and your skin or whatever so\nPeople like nuts over that this is Megan Kelly being ignorance and bigoted and races and so making Kelly actually had to issue an apology here's what you said your friends and he made one of the wonderful things about my job\nIs that I get the chance to express and hear a lot of opinion\nToday is one of those days were listening carefully to other points of view including from friends and colleagues wading me to rethink my own view is\nWhen we had the roundtable discussion earlier today about the controversy of making her face looks like a different race a part of a Halloween costume I suggested that this seemed okay if done as part of this holiday or people have the chance to make themselves look like others the iconic Diana Ross came up as an example me I thought why would it be controversial for someone dressing up is Diana Ross\nMakers of looked like this amazing woman as a way of honoring and respecting her I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong and I'm Sorry the history of blackface in our culture that ... the wounds duty I've never been a PC kind of person but I understand that we do need to be more sensitive in this day and age particularly on race and ethnicity issues which far from being he'll have been exacerbated in our politics over the past year\nIs it time for more understanding love sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that I look forward to continuing that discussion I'm honored to work with all of you every day making so I think that her apologies perfectly appropriate\nBut the outsized reactions were original comment is pretty astonishing so here was Kirsten Powers which supposedly is in favor of people saying what they want freedom of speech here's what she tweeted you're white people who are upset that you can dress up as another race or culture for Halloween\nYour feelings don't matter the only feelings that matter are those who feel disrespected or mocked by you appropriating their culture for entertainment show some common decency\nSo basically the feelings of people who are non white matter more than that people are the feelings of people who are white now I think that there is some actual nuance to this issue here isn't he wants to this issue\nBlackface has a long terrible history in the United states had\nPeople actually wrapping up as black folks in order to mock them with something that happened on a frequent basis all the way up till the Nineteen fifties Nineteen sixties in the United states and you can go back and you can watch old videos on YouTube of people dressing up at ... doing ... putting making their faces black and giving themselves big lip in really really racist fashion\nAnd then singing Miami songs in order to mock wacko and it's very much the same thing as in anti Semitic cultures for centuries where people would put on a hook nosed and they and they put on a fake belly and currently sidewalks and then they would suggest that they were Jewish right I mean it it's the same sort of thing\nLike dressing up their culture to mock that culture is discussing unacceptable actually racist now is that will make until it was interesting this is what we're getting to the issue of assuming people's motives", "show_name": "The Drive at 5 with
