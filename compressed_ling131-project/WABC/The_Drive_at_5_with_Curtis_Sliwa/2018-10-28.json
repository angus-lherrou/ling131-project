in the polo pony logo never wore Ralph even though I mired the product from afar\nHowever for the last three years among the radio and for the first time in my life I'm a free agent and I could wear

those names are promise\nWhat is fashioned if not a promise well the word of a brand or design a promise of comfort you will look good in our product you should trust us in our quality that we promise you every brand is giving you that word\nWe give you our word this raw Florida saying Ralph Lauren makes me feel good about myself now this can be said in any industry but as a reminder I'm Talking tonight about the idea for Tonight Show where it came from your word\nAnd how you own your words I Know where Ralph Lauren and I wear their dress shirts swim fit I'm swim collars graded has a perfect shape for today perfect\nAnd I tell you I walked in the store while back and I bought five white shirts because I Love the collar and I wanted to wear a rough and that is the beginning of my story\nThe other night I went out and they're put on my favorite navy blue suit white French cost Ralph Lauren dress shirt DKNY navy Todd Black ... choosing belt I rented a house jumped in my car and headed to the city\nI got to the restaurant and remembered when I sat down\nThat my Ralph Lauren dress shirts have a problem I completely forgot about it you see the sleeves a tool even though I

thinking about\nThe promise of this brand was holed up for a minute\nI went back to the store while back and I bought the next five shirts and when I spoke to the guy on the floor I told them the

pretty clever how you got there I like this subject how do you talk about the cops I bought a polo shirt too long waits up almost up to my knuckles there's a trick though for all of our listeners and I figured this out actually Jared taught me this you flip back the cough and then ... and you can have a ... a ... pretty well\nYeah except you're looking at the inside the raw side of the shirt rather than the proper side of the shirt and if you look closely at the button it's in the wrong position and its politics\nBut now that you mentioned that but the point is you shouldn't have to do that when I put\nA shirt on it looked like you know a little kid that where's the father's shirt draws you log but the folding back works just not great you're right you're right well I happen to

out there have given a word who lives out\nThere have meat agreements verbal agreements with people in life and business\nHis support for you I'm Wondering if I get somewhat of oral agreement and business is it valid and to my friend and son might attorney is an oral contract ...\nIt can be it can be and it can be enforceable but it really depends upon what type of agreement\nI every state has a rule that certain contracts you have to have in writing no matter what having said that there are other kinds of contracts or all contracts they can be binding you need mutual consent and understanding both parties need to understand what they're agreeing to\nTheir needs to be an offer and acceptance of that offer mutual consideration which means both parties are exchanging something of value\nAnd performance both party have to do something if you have all those things even though it's not a writing you have an all contract\nAll right so let me um you sound like a lawyer I I I Would hope so [laughter] okay let me ask you very simple question I don't play wonder I've just play when John okay I'm going to ask you a question\nUm you come to my house right and I need the snow

snow do I owe him the money yeah why\nIt's an all contract think about it that's enforceable oh I Would think so yes it's performance of services\nI doesn't really fall into any of the court categories that would need to be in writing in New York as far as I Know and basically you had an agreement you made an offer for him to shovel the snow for a certain amount of money he accepted a there was performance on both sides payment and to shovel the snow belt understood what was happening\nAnd the fact that he did it and you're not paying that's not good\nAll right with that as a

that complicates the world who to tell you a couple of quick stories I like store you like by stories just you know\n[laughter] I don't know how does your reaction to while you're on the road my ... now I get my word your stories are entertaining I promise yes\nOf course I have a great story about a money there is a business out there it's called licensing I've mentioned it before but for those who you\nWhat does licensing great brands rent their names to people for profit categories that they do not have an expertise saw\nSo for instance if I was a great brands like um let me pick one Tommy Hilfiger\nI have a fragrance I don't know anything really about the fragrance business I don't know how to manufacture I don't know that you know\nPurchased the designed the bottles\nI don't know how this gets done I don't know how to distribute it but I Believe Tommy Hilfiger\nShould have a fragrance and I find a world class partner will close partner who knows the fragrance business I rent Tim my name they pay me a fee for it and I oversee everything they're doing those surprises I Know who they're silly too I Know what the price is going to be\nI Know what the package is going to look like it's going to look like my brand and it's going to add value to the overall vision of the Tommy Hilfiger bread but I Need a partner in which to do it\nAnd that's called licensing it's in effect renting your name and I would pretty much tell you every designer sunglasses company that you see out there is under licensed to someone else\nWhy am I tell you the story be good at it has to do with your word\nOr is this a contract is not a menu when you sign a contract with someone you can't pick the parts that you want to observe a need to you too and then forget about all the other things\nWell if there's ever been a problem in this whole subject of licensing renting your brand for category that you don't have the expertise in to a professional who could extend the value of your brand to do with the contracts when I was at Venus and\nIt's a little story we license to brand the veins use of brand to a partner in Canada I'll never forget the guy his name was ...\nI as much as I could really like maybe even love certainly respected individual that wasn't part of my family or my company for that matter I felt all of those emotions towards this fellow us go risky\nHis father step was one of the largest if not the largest shirt company in Canada they manufactured there they imported from around the world big company in Canada and be licensed the van user name and their trademark and they went out started marketing the Venus and bread for shirts dress shirts\nThey use the package they used our styling they used everything and of course we signed a contract with\nThis ... by the way it was a cool guy one of the coolest guys when I met him in his sixties and he had just refurbished\n... five James Bond car Goldfinger that's awesome he actually had just had it read delivered from the u._k.\nI was in in Canada visiting him and I was floating around and James Bond car ... seats and all they didn't do the inject to see if he did he was doing it without telling me 'cause you can throw me out of bin Laden but I just said so back to him we were in his offices and he sits down he says I have a problem\nYou know I signed a contract with you and I'm I agreed to pay you all we're picking number I agreed to pay you two hundred thousand dollars a year and based on the size of my business\nI can only afford to pay you a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nAnd I looked at him and said boo hoo while you telling me this what do I care what you could afford you signed a contract\nSaid Marcus were partners we respect each other I'm telling you I'm doing everything you know I'm doing everything I can to build the brand and I'm just falling short of the volume I Need to do to pay you the two hundred thousand I really would like you to consider\nGoing to a hundred and fifty thousand in the spirit of the relationship so I said to him you know look a screw too complicated because you know how much I admire you\nAnd I do believe you're doing everything to make Venus and successful here and I do appreciate everything you've done so far you were in the best stores\nOr we could always do more business but let me go home and I'll think about I went home and I completely forgot about it on purpose you know why would I give him any relief you know it said it's like renting your brand any of you out there live in an apartment you know what\nPlace you wind up going to the landlord and so you don't want to pay your rent increase in the landlord and asking for a decrease in your head when he's through laughing and throws you out of the office you can get a discount and you know\nThe answer is no limos they'll give money back so why should I have a policy when it comes to all these deals I have thousands of these deal no relief\nSo I went back as I said I'm In the United states ignoring him and sure enough I get a call from my head of licensing the pros of licensing as to come in and see me side comes and sits down and said look I just got off the phone with us courage ski\nHe's really pressing for this relief I really believe that uh he makes a compelling case he's a great partner used on everything you want him to do he's launched us in Canada we have a straw ordinary business in Canada with a number two shirt company in Canada we never were able to Canada successfully least up until that time I think we should give them the relief\nI said you know it's my policy not to give relief I don't believe in it\nI don't believe in it is but mark and he's calling on the friendship used on everything you blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I should let me think about it so now I'm stalling my president of\nA couple of days goes by and the head of sales for using candidate calls my licensing a guy and she happens to be the niece of Oscar race\nAnd she comes to see him personally you know you got to help us Kansas fifty thousand dollars is now principal second a make or break the company just doesn't feel right we shouldn't have to do this amongst two partners\nSo my head of license he comes in with her with me they make this compelling case and against my better judgment I gave her the relief of the fifty thousand dollars now why am I tell you the story this has to be a twenty year old story\nBecause they never forgot it because this is about giving your word and they gave their word to pay us let's fast forward about two weeks later goes by and I asked my head of licensing did you speak to the nice again and what did ... say about the fifty thousand dollars relief\nAnd he said he started to live and he said you're not going to like it but she was willing to share with me exactly what he said\n[laughter] you know what he said when you say so they're so stupid we should've asked them for a hundred thousand\nAnd you gotta\nGive your word and you got to stick to it I never forgot that story and shut your mouth [laughter] or you want to talk about word in business I got another one for you that was a good story right now I tell him don't ever give relief remember that\nSo this story dates back to NPD H purchase Calvin Klein Calvin Klein\nHad three extraordinary businesses they still do have three extraordinary business you know what they are just\nLike to take a guess I Would say the first one\nHas to be intimate like underwear yes Mark Wahlberg come on now yeah well that's and the Kurdish forgot about that and I'm In a separate rocky I met nearly cooler I a huge successful business that number one Kevin Kline genes", "show_name":
