and there's Christian Joel ran your real feminists standing up there with Amy Schumer as a woman who talked about the great paid maternity leave in Saudi Arabia entered [laughter]\nThe good stuff there from the Democratic party President Trump is correct that the Democrats have indeed turned into an angry mob and you can see how much in every mountain they've turned into when we get to what policies they are proposing because it's pretty astonishing\nBy here's President Trump hitting the nail on the head as I've said before the president has a hammer sometimes you hit the nail sometimes you get the baby well yesterday in and out and it was satisfied because he said what is correct year the the only thing Democrats had to do honestly when Trump was elected all Democrats had to do was not be crazy that's all they had to do they have\nFailed dramatically in that task of not being crazy and said they've decided to go full blown crazy here is President Trump pointing that out\nIn their quest for power the\nDemocrats have turned to an angry mob you saw that today were screaming and shouting not from the two hundred people more or less\nThat weren't you know what those people they could fit in the front row before we ever\nGet Trump is exactly right about all this now\nWhat is left ... about this well they want to do two things one they want to come up with systemic ways to change the system and do they want to try it out a war on women narrative the war and all of a narrative is there a great hope that they can start a war of the sexes they tried this and twenty sixteen they said that there was a war on women and Hillary Clinton was representative of women in this fight\nThey're hoping that because President Trump is alienating too a lot of particularly suburban women\nThat they can go on to that and then they can combine that with enthusiasm for the me too movement and use that to a club Republicans into submission on a political level will get to the one woman narrative and a second but first what they want to do is they want you radically change the system of American government they're full blown members of the medium talking about Washington Post reporters today\nOr shocked shocked to discover that the Senate of the United states is not represented by population they're shocked to discover that in fact each state has two senators and then they realized that weight\nMontana has fewer people in the New York which means the Senate isn't representative oh my God they're they're literally realize when it's like right now is it [laughter]\nI don't know what were they been for the past three hundred years in this country\nBut yeah I mean this is actually a case that they are making right now we'll get to all of that in just one second but first I'd like to take a moment to remind you there's a whole other world to this radio show a daily wire dot com never miss an opportunity to listen to the venture bureau show up

com okay so the media have discovered a few things that they are upset about do after twenty sixteen they discovered they didn't like the electoral college very much because\nHillary lost and now they've discovered that there is such a thing called the United States Senate and that the United States Senate believe it or not actually represented different population than the house of representatives now originally the constitution said that the Senate was not even to be selected by popular vote within\nThe states originally the state legislature selected their own senators which was the correct movie that's the way it should have worked because that meant\nThat there was another layer between the population and the Senate founders were actually quite worried about mob rule there are quite worried about the idea of democracy because they figured\nThat demagoguery could win over broad swaths of the population and that would enable all sorts of bad things to happen\nTo minorities inside the United states is what they're worried about and so they set up a system of checks and balances\nTo provide for the rights of states while ensuring that if there was overwhelming support for a measure that all of that would be able to happen anyway but Aaron Blake over at the Washington Post in shocking news breaking news you the senior political reporter at the Washington Post this is breaking news guys\nHot off the wires quote people are suddenly deciding that population disparities render the Senate undemocratic upon ratification Virginia has twelve times many people as Delaware disparities are bigger now but they very much exist in our founders decided on the system\nTo air and Blake is a ... and Blake is is obviously you know actually saying the truth here\nBut there are a bunch of people in the media who have been suddenly calling on folks to get rid of this and I'm not kidding there's I'm looking for all this week right now but basically they're making the case that the Senate needs to go away or alternatively\nThere making the case instead that the that the Supreme\nCourt ought to be packed so my favorite is Democrats suggesting that Republicans on democratically got Brett Kavanaugh through the Senate when Republicans had the votes in the Senate somehow undemocratic and now they're saying they're solutions to the ... democratic nature of the movement of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme\nCourt requires them to add more justices to the Supreme Court in violation of the constitution is\nFrom New York Times today the bitter partisan theory that engulfed justice Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation\nWas the fiercest battle of the political war over the judiciary has been steadily intensifying since the Senate rejected judge Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven but an even greater conflagration maybe coming this confirmation but well not necessarily be the last word on Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so this is this is what Democrats are hoping and they're hoping in most while possible light coming up a lot of folks in the media tweeting about how the United States Senate is bad they just discovered checks and balances after a couple of hundred years what will they discovered that the United states\nIs actually on a continent called North America I don't know I mean there there's so many things for them to discover we'll talk about this newfound discovery in a second this adventure\nDiet\nThese are the breeze and cloudy on robbed us of the stories you'll be talking about I'm Seventy seven WABC the NTSB a New York city police are

saying the undemocratic nature of representation in the Senate is unlikely to be remedied anytime\nSoon the job everybody okay so back to this war on women narrative that that do left his trotting out this is best exemplified by women into Alexis Grinnell she's written on gender in politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets that she was a professional useless person\nAnd she writes a piece today that is titled white women come and get your people they will defend their privilege to that so but I like about that is that now the left is not just attacking\nMen now such as the war between women and men now it's a war between intersection analogy groups\nSo it's black women versus white women and Hispanics verses women versus white when because it turns out white women largely sided with Brett Kavanaugh white women vote Republican more often because it turns out a lot of women actually think individually women don't always think like the left wants them to\nSay which is fine and good I thought the whole point of feminism as you get what you want to think\nBut not according to the feminine care is this insane to I mean this is fully crazy this is like get the butterfly net and straight jacket stuff\nHere's what here's what Alexis agree now right now in keeping with the the moderate tone of the Democrats lately after a confirmation process where women all but what their risk letting their store sexual from a rotten like rivers abroad\nThrough the capital the Senate still voted to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court with the exception of Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska all the women in the Republican conference caved including Senator Susan Collins of Maine who held out until the bitter end\nAll but what they are is letting their stories of sexual trauma run like ... ... through the capital I wasn't aware that screaming at people was\nA necessity hating factor in them agreeing with you and if you screaming people about your experiences that have nothing to do with Brad cabinet Brett Kavanaugh's guilty\nBut life is going to drop the hammer these women are gender freighters to borrow a turtle from the dystopian TV series The Handmaid's tale first of all I think we ought to have a new role and there's a rule on the Internet or and or about using Hitler and prime member of the the rule about using Hitler on the Internet or what what's it called\nUm there there's an actual name for it that the guy wins a lot so it's called God when while they're basically the longer and Internet argument goes on the more likely somebody is going to drop Hitler in the middle of the argument well the same thing now holds true for The Handmaid's tale\nCollege Shapiro's law longer any argument goes on with the last the the more of an opportunity left is going to have to drop a reference to Handmaid's Tale you most overrated\nThe last half century and a series that has become popular largely because the media have decided that it is deeply important for women to believe that they are on the verge of being sexually enslaved by men in a society where fewer women than ever in American history are getting married in which women are waiting longer to get married having fewer children\nAnd having a job and having more and more income from jobs and then any time in American history but women are disclosed\nTheir disclosed and Mike Pence has his way we're going to stick those women in those red brick ... and we're going to just going to send and we're going to force them to reproduce with us that's what we're going to do it if Mike Pence has his way that evil evil Mike Pence\nSo here's what elections when I read these women are gender turns to borrow a term from the still getting TV series The Handmaid's tale they've made standing by the patriarchy a fulltime job the women who support them show up at the Capitol where women for cabinet T shirt but also probably tell their daughters to put on less revealing clothes when they go out\nWho they tell their daughter is not to address all\nSkimpy ooh\nThat means that they're bad mom the best moms to their daughters to go out in the streets naked\nThat's the best moms do I love at first of all I just have to stop right there\nThis notion that if you tell your daughter not to dress simply because you should respect herself more than that at this makes you a bad parents or restrictive parents is utterly insane it's utterly insane\nOnly somebody who has never really raise children in any serious capacity could thinks this or maybe if you think there's a ... like maybe a different strategy may may I don't know about elections could also change maybe she has maybe she has get maybe maybe", "show_name": "The Drive at 5
