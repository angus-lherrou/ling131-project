I'm a wet out in public and made excuses for rioting in Ferguson and Baltimore to I'm not sure what Hillary Clinton is talking about when she says the Europe's ability is over\nBut here's Hillary Clinton saying we don't need to be civil anymore because we disagree with Republicans and why would you be civil with people with whom you disagree\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nCertain victories the ability to civility can start again when we dominate you and put our boot on your throat that's when civility makes a comeback that was funny about that is that her premise that you can't be civil to a party that wants to destroy all the things that you stand\nFor that's the premise of party politics in the United states there's not a lot you can find a democratic and Republican parties right now they both\nWant to destroy what the other party stands for that is not remove the requirement to be civil now I think Republicans understand this much better than Democrats do or at least did until twenty sixteen ... the great untold story of less twenty five years\nIs that Democrats categorized every Republican as evil and nasty and bigoted and homophobic and racist and all of these terrible things and\nFinally Republicans responded and twenty sixteen by saying you know what screw you two were done and I have a chart to prove it so here's a chart from Jonathan heights new book about polarization in American politics and here's what it shows it's partisan\nHatred for the other party and you'll see you later line if you're watching us into the lighter line shows that you like to folks who hate the Democratic Party Republicans have hate the Democratic party\nAnd the darker wine shows Democrats you hate the Republican Party what you will see\nIs that until twenty sixteen democratic hate for\nThe Republican Party was higher or equal to hate from Republicans for Democrats every year since Nineteen eighty like that's the actual trend line here what you see in the trend line is it since Nineteen eighty when Ronald Reagan won election democratic hatred for the Republican Party skyrocketed and was significantly\nHigher than Republican hatred for the Democrats all the way up until Nineteen Ninety five or so then they sort of drew even and they basically are right on top of each other and then after George W. Bush was elected than democratic hatred for the Republican Party sky rocketed again\nAnd remain higher this is the practice making it remain higher\nThan hatred for the Democratic party by Republicans all the way until twenty sixteen which means even after ... rock Obama was elected Democrats still hated Republicans more than Republicans hated Democrats which shows you that Republicans in the end really believe I think they they believe and heavily this for decades\nThat Democrats are wrong but not evil and Democrats believe the Republicans are both wrong and evil\nAnd in twenty sixteen Republicans finally said listen you guys think that we're evil well that makes you evil we're done with it or you're going to say that you hate us just for partisan reasons well we hate you write that you can go shove it you're not interested in playing this game with you anymore that's\nWhat's happened so the media only noticed is around twenty sixteen because the media are partisan Democrats the folks in the media only noticed that Republican\nHatred for Democrats have skyrocketed in twenty sixteen because for the first time it was evident that that was the case because until then democratic hatred for Republicans always had exceeded Republican hatred for Democrats and the media were part of that problem the media we're\nForwarding that hatred the media were cheering it on\nThe media declaring the George W. Bush was a war criminal was the media declaring that the Tea Party were a bunch of terrorists was the media declaring that the that the Tea Party where a bunch of mobs Doug awkward seat bands like this was this was their claim and then in twenty sixteen Republicans won partially by saying okay fine you activate\nThe hatred with it right the fall for the emperor's ... in in return to the dry without the heat\n... through us and you can make a powerful and to a certain extent it did Democrats thinking that they are going to somehow wind by escalating hatred in their hearts again is a
