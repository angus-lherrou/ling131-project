everyone works together your world gets better [noise] Hackensack Meridian how\nGoing to present I witnessed interviews with inanimate objects\nAnd this is willing to call and live on the the never return lightning storm here to describe the events teeny tray\nI was watching football and holding a plate of meat loaf went up bam a bolt of lightning slams into the apartment blowing out this evening is around anything you could have done to help ma'am I'm a full table not an electrician\nYour TV tree can help you in a lightning storm but the guy go insurance agency can help you get covered for personal property damage go to guy go dot com to see how affordable renters insurance can be\nDoes not fair that price the same thing is true in your business as well but these basic misunderstandings about the free market lean to the idea that the free market is somehow oligarchy when in reality the free market most democratic system of property ownership ever divide by humankind that you are the owner of your own labor and your own time\nAnd says you are the owner of the product of their own hands but according to Kevin Kelly at teen vogue are great economic clear thinking source she says the capitalism played the heavy focus on private property economic growth freedom of choice and limited government intervention all of a stroke\nGenerally these tend to be for the right of the political spectrum and then she says how capitalism impact people well it depends on whether you're a worker or a bar if you're on a company or employer the workers capitalism may make sense but if you are not and it's bad for you\nThat's a bunch of nonsense that capitalism again has raised the globe from abject poverty it's the reason why you have cool stuff today so why do people opposed capital as well as I capitalist capitalism and inhuman anti democratic unsustainable ...\nAnd they must meet dismantle they see it as an ... democracy because how capitalist bosses hold power over workers in the workplace and the fact that the more capital what a crude more power they have\nAgain on through richer people do not have more power over other individual human beings and poor people do because they can't compel you to do anything\nUntil the regulatory capture takes place that they have more power power is not just how it is not just being ... how are you pointing a gun at somebody power does issue from the the muzzle all the time it does not issued simply by their by basis\nHow many times has has a rich person asked you to do something just in your life and he said no probably fairly often I'm not even talking about things that are offering to hire you to do if they if they offered to pay something\nThat is not power that is I'm offering you a consensual exchange and you're saying yeah in any case the the enthusiasm for capitalism is falling away because everybody gets to be the product of a capitalist system we all get to live extraordinarily wealthy long healthy wise because of capitalism\nThat gives us the ability of crap all over at the same way that spoiled brats\nYell at their parents will spoil them we are yelling at free markets that have spoiled us too when it's evidence of this is also Pope Francis talking with Michael Moore during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square at the Vatican the current pope is not a friend's capitalism he's a liberation theology as he believes that\nThat progressive economic ought to be wedded to the gospels and therefore he is constantly talked about the shortcomings of free markets\nAs though the alternative government control distribution of resources is going to be superior even though it has not been\nAnd even the social supposedly socialist countries that folks on the left like to talk about the Nordic countries Norway and Denmark and in all the Scandinavian countries Sweden those are all capitalist countries with socialist redistribution systems piled on top of them\nThe question for those countries it how long you can keep piling elephants on top of stills and hope that the sills continue to support that weight the filter capitalism the elephants are socialism is not that the entire system is socialism but the pope meeting with Michael Moore is pretty indicative of where we are\nAnd then we have a much valley who'd proposal from Kamala Harris the senator from California who was just awful I Know she's my senator she is she is proposing a what they call a Trump size tax plan of her own the Atlantic doing humans work to try and suggest that a tax plan is basically just redistribution of resources\nHere's the Atlantic reporting on Kamala Harris his new tax\nPlan and this is the way Democrats are going to run here the way that Democrats are going to run is\nIn a way that that undercuts capitalism and this is an example of it there's her proposal according to the Atlantic\nHarris is offering that kind of fun house mirror and version of the sweeping Republican tax initiative one that would\nInstead of flashing rates on high income households and corporations push huge credit out to middle income in poor families the lift the middle class act would provide monthly cash payments of up to five hundred dollars to lower income families on top of the tax credits in public benefits they already received last year Congress gave a trillion dollars in tax\nBreaks to corporations Harris told me that money should have gone to American taxpayers when ... we need it instead of handing it over to corporations\nAnd the top one percent now the fact is that the people at the bottom of the spectrum the people at the bottom of the spectrum are not actually paying any taxes right now they're receiving net tax benefits okay the people who are paying all of the taxes and I mean literally all of the taxes in the United states all the net taxes in the United states are the wealthy\nIn the United states and the wealthy in the United states are paying far more than their fair share\nIt is just a why the people at the bottom of the economic spectrum are paying the tax burden in the United states we have the most progressive tax system on planet earth and yet that includes the Scandinavian countries\nThe light at the Scandinavian countries is that they are progressive in their tax structure there or not they heavily tax people at the bottom of the lower end of the economic spectrum as well because you have to pay for ...\nThe Democrats don't want to pay for stuff\nAnd as we'll see as being down and Kamala Harris as opposed to tax plan she's not talking about paying for stuff instead what she's talking about is essentially\nForcing Republicans do raise taxes on the wealthy or forcing us to take out inordinate amount of debt that will never happen to be paid for either through inflation or through higher taxes not just on people who are rich but on everyone on everyone as well and we'll talk about all of that in just one second but first

the government makes it seem as though the government it had to get the money the government has\nNo money of its own the government is taking from me and giving to you or taking from you and giving to me or take them from the future and giving a talk now the government is not a repository of magical money trade there is no money for us but the government present you with the idea that there is so when the government send you a check you don't have\nTo feel guilty about anything it's just receiving free money after all however when it comes to charity and there are folks in my community by Jewish community who received charity they feel terrible about it you can see that you can see they feel terrible about it and I think that's a good thing\nI think it's a good thing I think you should feel bad about taking charity as long as you because that that's what's going to encourage you to not stay on the door it's going to encourage you to get out there and more it's going to encourage you to make a move toward prosperity can pay all those people back if you see the money that you are receiving\nAs a as a step toward getting your feet under you once again and he can pay people back it's a much better way of viewing money and money is growing for free\nAnd you can just take it no matter at anytime\nAnyplace it suggests a lack of entrepreneurial spirit\nAnd and unfortunately I think that that's the way that that we're going in the United states that example number one example number two there's a lot of talk these days when for and by the way that the things is as well in places like Norway so Norway which is which is prized love by folks on the American left\nAnd they ignore the fact that Norway actually has become a place where the work ethic and starting to collapse\nThe economist wrote in two thousand to the Norwegians have ... to ... minutes to get money from any of the state's benefit agency and you see the ... you actually see this happening where people believe they're entitled to think that the very fact that we call the benefits entitlement as opposed to benefit to get them at the ...\nThat's point number one point number two ... of picking up and moving\nWe are the most mobile ... society in the history of mankind and easier to get from one place to another on planet earth faster than any time a history of humankind\nWhen we talk about our ancestors in the United states were thing that people and covered wagon taking six months to cross the country you can do it in six hours now on a plane and for significantly less cost and yet we are now less mobile\nRight ... fewer Americans are actually leaving their home town\nI mean which is which is not a good thing\nWe actually want people to go out there and think adventure right now Americans are are moving less often\nThan they were right there's an article from the New York times the typical adult was Eighteen miles from his or her mother according to an upshot analysis of data from a comprehensive survey of older Americans over the last few decades Americans have become less mobile most adults do not venture far from their home town well part of that is because the family I live very close to my parents\nBut if I were to move my parents would probably follow may not the other way around if it if I Want to live close to my family you know you have\nTo follow prosperity you have to follow adventure you have to follow the call you have to move but Americans don't feel that way anymore Americans feel like they're entitled to a job in their hometown where they grow up at the factory where their parents were that is not the way the human beings have\nWorked for literally all of human ... for literally all human history and yet now we believe that in order to facilitate people being able to stay where they were originally base we have to shift the way that the free market works\nWell that's not that's not correct and again this is not coming out of the places of lack is where I sympathize with people's plight and the question is what can you do to make your life better Democrats\nBooks on the left they want to talk about what can we do to make your life better and the answer is very little the real question is what can you do to make your life better\nBecause every successful ... person on planet earth is the person who at some point said to themselves what can I Do to help myself America is a country of people saying to themselves what can I Do to help my lot in life what can I Do to be more ambitious what can I Do to stretch my wings
