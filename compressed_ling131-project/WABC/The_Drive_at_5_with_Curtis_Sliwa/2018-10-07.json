I probably should have done something different in college but then here's the other side of it every one of my experiences even in college with that major in law school especially practicing in the law\nLed me to the person I Am today so it's hard to say I should go back and do something different because I don't know if I Would have done that in the beginning\nWhether I Would have had the same path so it's hard to say\nWell listen you have a multitude\nOf experiences along the way and how you got here by the way from let me ask you something else so with all these different directions how did you end up focused on a a lower income and dating and that being you're calling on TV [noise] well I was doing\nDifferent spots on television like being a legal analyst on Fox CNN CBS\nBut at the same point I wanted to be a host and I remember we had a ... a meeting we met Tamms inside out fishing she is an anchor on picks eleven the nightly news you and I had a breakfast meeting with her and said hey listen I Want to be like Ryan ... crashed I Want to do hosting I Want to host this have interest in this\nAnd she said whoa wait a second your specialty is law that is what you're on T. V. doing right now\nThat's what you should specialize and just keep focusing on that legal background keep focusing on doing a legal analysts on TV and you're going to get a hook and the more you appear on their people are gonna want to have you host certain programs they're legal oriented\nFunny enough that's exactly what happened I started appearing on lawyers which was a legal program they asked me to be the host of it so she was a hundred percent right focusing on what you're really your strength as what you know and the rest is going to lead and\nIt's very interesting so in the case of would have should have could have you wouldn't have done it differently probably not probably not\nWill now we're on reflecting this week and always in fashion I'm thinking about life and careers Jesse story is a clear one\nFigure out what you want to do and get focused\nI'm thinking under the heading of should I Would I have I could I have done things differently another way\nI think it's an unusual approach to get yourself settled and figure out where you are I think it's a fascinating exercise I think when we're done with the show you sit down and start to ask yourself you're going to find some interesting answers to the questions that you ask\nBut I Want to start with a would have and it could have this work for you just\nI think so I don't want to look back and say we should have we could have or we would have done something different [laughter] [laughter]\nYou know I mentioned in the opening China I'm I'm In ...\nI Can't believe what's going on with China it's annoying to hell outta me so I Want to talk about the business of trade with China the trade war that I touched on a moment ago last summer I was on CNBC business I was interviewed they called me in and asked me to be a commentator and they wanted to talk about the trade war with China\nI told them President Trump is negotiating it makes no sense in having a trade war there will not be a trade war forget it will not happen yet at the uh [noise]\nI'm Still personally not convinced we're at war with China over trade we're negotiating but where are we and what are we\nSay what are we doing now that's something to think about would have could have and should do this is what I Would have done or more importantly with the prison and should still do so would have could have tonight and hopefully this is what should be done\nI should point out that I walked the great wall of China before I was Thirty years old just yeah I was on the wall of China before you were born that's pretty impressive if you think about it and that everyone can say that yeah I'll tell you what most of the pundits walking around and talking about this of never even been to China I was there when they were developing\nI learned first hand that the Chinese as a people value the long history and are proud of accomplishments\nBrought to their world in the east and influence the west these are proud people that work hard hard working industrialists that accomplished which they set out to do\nAnd quickly there is no fooling around China they make up their mind to do something they get it done that's the people we're dealing with it would be an interesting exercise I Want to build two identical buildings right next to each other twins like the twin tower\nOn one side of want to take a Chinese team from mainland China and tell them to put up the building just get it done and the other side I Want to put to us I guarantee you\nThe Chinese will get that building built amazingly quicker than the Americans the Chinese would get it built faster and less expensive faster it's their work ethic\nCheaper because their labor rates are different the Chinese system and the Chinese standard of living that just less than the United states I'm not endorsing that it's just the way it is but I don't want to go there we are capitalists we're entitled to make money it has its advantages but the trade in balance is very simple\nThe Chinese and their vast labor supply of over one billion people work to produce and produce they do\nKnow people are going to remember we taught them after their industrial revolution would they closed China in Nineteen forty nine and didn't open it up to the west until Nineteen Seventy two they were back would so the west came in and taught them we taught them how to produce\nAnd they learned and they threw their billion people at it and they became very very efficient\nThey learned they grew they produced in the u._s._a. and the American people love their products so much so we buy five hundred billion that's a half a trillion dollars more of this stuff than they buy from us they're not doing anything wrong we are rewarding them for the industry is efforts that they put forth\nHowever trumps the wrong it should be balanced so on a night where I'm Talking what would I Do what should I Do what I could do let me make it simple I'm going to tell you what we should do\nTo like in this yeah does it go you're paying attention\nChina right [laughter] you're funny Jesse I'm going to ask you questions later I didn't think this will be homework what should we do and when we're talking about would have could of should have I'm going to keep it very simple\nPresident Trump make a phone call to the president of China toe president Xi\nThat you're going to be sending him a piece of paper of later today have Larry Kudlow the economic advisor I don't know it was titled has the industrial through Larry Kudlow to give you a list of the products they believe China should be more of\nWhat could put it on a piece of paper cars planes trucks buses carpet steel windmills what ever I don't care now of course\nPut on the list the number five hundred billion dollars\nThen\nSimply has the Chinese government\nWhich products they want to buy half a trillion dollars worth of products from and go out and buy the case close no more trade war no more duty them or anything how can they refuse\nWhere the largest trading and most important trading part of the Chinese are indefensible position by from us eliminate the trade imbalance buying less from those other less important trading partners\nThat's what you should do that's what I Would do that's what you could do on always in fashion I Would have could have and should have be back in the mid\nComplicating things my counterparts ... multiple languages frankly and with the ease its their culture Europeans are expected to be multilingual when you think about Europe it was too small each individual country for ...\nIn ... to grow they need you go outside the borders and because of that they learn to speak the language is the countries surrounding them\nSo they all speak multiple languages\nIn the United states we're spoiled American businessmen and women to spoil\nThis is such a huge market that if you never stepped out of the United states there's more than enough money to be made by a company and hence we got comfortable speaking just one language English at the same time we're lucky because the world's languages English and therefore we could be lazy and get it done\nAs time went on Americans realize they had to be global brands that just local brands in the United states and we went and ventured outside the United states and most brands are everywhere if the good branch\nBut we don't speak more than one language and our European counterparts are taught from birth they must speak English to the native French Italian Russian so there will multilingual unlike U.S born here in America now would say recent immigrants coming to this population in America more bilingual\nBut I had a choice I was spoiled and perhaps may be arrogant swatch Buckley American with my smile on my face and maybe just not\nSophisticated enough to understand how important it would be to learn French when I travel to Paris which was frequently as expected for my benefit they all spoke English but I couldn't help but notice in every meeting in multiple situations they would lapse into French for ease and help them move things will\nIt wasn't just respectfully I learned a long time ago that when people speak foreign languages in your in their country it's often done to be a fishing and needs to be done so they can move through\nAnd although I felt like a hot shot American what can I tell you I feel good about who I was and I feel good about our country I excluded from their ... I was in part of this special club I couldn't speak their language and do I was always treated as a trusted in respected member of the group\nThe language and the language barrier kept me at a distance across an ocean in but not and so again let's go back here I Am at this charity event and the doctor asked do you speak French\nI thought of tonight's theme I would've I could have and I should have back in a moment\nWays in fashion [laughter] [noise]\n\nI'm very interested in France\nThey Italy that's where they tell you it comes from an awkward\nThere would approve this is a collection of men's and women's shoes that are not only contemporary style brilliantly but they're also waterproof\nSo you guys and gals you don't have to change your shoes and in climate weather and I should tell you how comfortable they are not only fashioned style right but the comfortably where the where if you go\nI could tell you the science of contemporary it is a classic fuel to them they're easy to wear their elegant yet that for every day high quality and low maintenance the true foundation of timeless wardrobe something you could wear every day and not worry about it\nI could tell you is foot where that is made for discerning men and women who make bold moves and want to look their best without sacrificing fashion or comfort\nYou should explore the latest collection of ... dot com\nI could tell you is amazing styles beautiful fabrics beautiful silhouettes\nYou should really look for them you can find an explorer I could tell his latest collection that I could tell you the dot com or visit the flagship store at Nineteen sixty five Madison Avenue in Manhattan awkward tell you a Q. U. A. T. A. L. I. A. where ever the weather goes they will take you\nMade in Italy and waterproof the best combination\nWelcome back and say here's your house mark whoever [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd I should have done a lot of things [noise]\nInteresting topic tonight I Would have could have\nI should have tried not to beat myself up too much because in the end I like who I Am but all of us how there are always confronted with I could have I Would have I should have\nOnly problem is that the past and we talk in the future I don't want to continue now\nOne of the things I've often thought about\nIs listening yeah\nIf I was a better listener I might have done things differently I might have been to be perfectly honest I might have missed opportunities I might have just gotten a little further a little faster Jesse I Want to start or am I good listening a serious\nQuestion what are you really asking me that question what okay you're very funny\nBut I I Can't I I don't I Can't believe you're actually asking me if you're a good less there\nBecause when you chew it out\nAnd you do this a lot you go into your little ... world you forget it you are the worst list [laughter] in the entire world you do now to listen to anything and the worst part about it is half the time you're doing it on purpose so of cash ...\nBut equally as true is when you look at me and my eyes were walking or driving around you're focused exactly what I'm trying to talk about you drill down you asked me the right question so you're an amazing listener\nI Would say eighty percent of the time and you really are but that twenty percent as I was really an I\nWill thank you for that and while we're talking about would have could have been should have I guess I should have listened more to you Jesse but\nThe purpose of the show we used to teach right now and I believe that being a good listener is one of the top ten skills anyone else there needs to be successful\nBut before I go there that they have to tell you when to listening school I didn't even know there was such a thing as listening school\nYeah you know if you're in New York every so often maybe every day you get these pamphlets offering services like coming to learn how to put a title on your roof for anything what are you looking at the bulletin boards at Starbucks like lots of our lives and give them all the time and work and get these things\nI get one that says learn to be a better listener\nI said to myself\nGee whiz I Know I'm not a good listener why not go why not go\nSo I had a young lady I work with the company name was I mean who's a worst listeners than I could ever be she was one of those people while you're talking to she's talking back not listening to your question and giving you an answer she was the worst said to my secretary at the time of the ministry of assistant\nJudy give me a spot at that and get one frightening it's we go to the thing we sit in the back of the class already making a mistake teacher gets up\nAnd start to talk about listening and it was so sophomore okay for those of you out there that means so elementary for those of you out there don't get that means so easy I started to lose interest and started talking I started talking to be a good listener you have to pay attention to be good listening you can't those blah blah blah\nUm talk in a way I was out of the class within thirty minutes I didn't learn anything so if I'm not a good listener that's partially why just you know I have a question just\nFor people that do struggle listening and when you do have to listen to things what's the trick to listening to stuff that you might think is really really boring really I mean people face this all the time in class at work what is the track\nWell first of all now you're taking me in a different direction but it's a fair question you know we all have obligations to be interesting you know think of it that way if you take the time\nTo tell the story or talk to people you have an obligation you you want to talk then you have to know how to present yourself and we've talked about that a million times on this show learning how to present when you telling his story it needs a beginning a middle and an ended it has to get the quickly I think most\nOf us aren't funny we don't belong in late night TV just to get the jokes try and be interesting okay that's your responsibility and the conversation\nAs the listener you have to drill and you see those movies um was a movie with Kevin Costner where he played the baseball pitcher ah the love of the game of the game and love the game you play the great big ... baseball pitcher and he was extraordinary in it but when he went to pitch\nYou had a saying in his mind he said clear the mechanism\nAnd what that did was all the noise or the crowds everything dissipated and all he saw was the catcher who's throwing the ball to end the batter everything else was wiped away", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Drive
