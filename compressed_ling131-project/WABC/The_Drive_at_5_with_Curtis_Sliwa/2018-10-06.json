{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "But I Want you to talk a little bit about the uh the integrity of the process because ah there have been opportunities where people have come to you or\nMaybe they were trying to pull a short cut on you and they've they've tried to take shortcuts with your process and it's actually sometimes costs you a little time energy and money but you've been ... oh a a passionate about making sure that the process stays pure the product stays pure and that it does what you said an invasion from the beginning talk about\nThat and and when I started talking to them and invite likes to come on the microphone leisure because there's some experiences that I Want him to to share with us on this\nInteresting as you can imagine through the years we've had company up on company come in and talk with us and I had a dear friend actually come with his dad early on and they saw the the possibilities here and\nAnd they came in and they they wanted to invest in to us and so then I sat down and they said so what's your exit strategy how we going to make money on this and I said\nMy exit strategy is is the epitaph on my on my tombstone is has made a difference in this world and changed lives and quality that literally that it was my answer to this or we just couldn't ever get it together and there's and Lex got the experience of seeing many times for example I'm just going to put it out there but the\nPeople wanted us to go a multi level time after time in companies that wanted us to and then we would sit down because yeah I mean we needed to make money and we need to be running through the bad times\nI mean what is this as a business you started this as a way to help your patients so that is on the side of it was something you had to get a learning curve on and grow and kind of shepherd from day one this is not something I never thought I'd be doing right I Love\nPractice I Love people and so so as we started doing this do people started you know coming out of the woodwork and it's interesting that people then we would say no there's some there's a ... a major\nThere's a major health food chain that wanted to do something was but when they\nThey wanted us to change it everyone every single time they want us to change it\nEvery single time they wanted us to to cheapen it because it had to be cheaper anyway there was this one multi level that they were doing something and then in some third world countries and helping people and they said you know if they get to these it's better than having to to capsules that as it was better than nothing and they started to convince me to some things like that and so\nWe started talking with them came down to the line\nWhen they were they had already a multi level business they were doing they just wanted to replace it with a plug in play yeah and so we found out they were paying how much how much like was it that they were paying per bottle for those vitamins a dime\nA dime and they were selling them for sixty dollars ... and and and so when\nThat was from the manufacture of other manufacturing without making money too that's right that was their prize they weren't even making themselves and they were\nThen they they just had a good story they were telling these people that they would become into financially independent and blah blah blah when it came down to it they found out that over half of our costs are actually in the broader [laughter] they were like whoa whoa whoa we can't do that where you got to do this or that and that's when they came you know how about two and a captain\n... obviously we could never make it work one of these guys that that was doing this once he just wanted to make something work\nAnd we even fluid flown out with our attorney because we thought something was going to work with this and everything and and and it just and then it got down okay so how are we going to make it cheaper and I was like I won't change the product I won't change what we do we won't do that these are the studies I have this is why it works is how it works I won't change it we're about changing lives\nAnd if if you could sit in fact I invite you haven't come and sit in on one of our our staff meetings and just to hear it on the phone is one thing but you should come and sit and see the tears that are shared by some of our our help coaches when they tell the stories of who they help to this week\nThat is what our staff meetings are about ... they talked about their successes\nAnd we share them and we and\nThat's what we are and so any ways that we actually produce our own product we've tried we have tried to to get it out because we we thought it'd be easier working with government entities and things that that it would be easier to do that way\nTheir quality could not pass our standard right we wouldn't send it out we literally would not send it out I said you know give me those bottles I'll take them home and eat 'em but I'm not going to send those out to people\nThe the fact that there's such a high standard in the a product that's in your capsule and the\nContent of what's in every bottle or is really unparalleled and so it's one of those things friends where when you get in and Dr Howard says this and the commercials on a regular basis\nBut when you when you when you pop open the plastic lit up the bottle and then you pull the the sealed foil seal off [noise] if you don't get a whiff\nWhen you open the fruits of very strong fruit and it just it just walked right up to your nose and the same with the with the veggies or if you don't ... then you're not you're not taking balance of nature\nIf you don't get that smell if you don't think that there you can take one of the capsules

fruits and vegetables\nThe combination of this all base going back to our previous discussion on the chemistry of what those specific fruits and vegetables mind\nYou take the three and three and they work in combination and how they work in combination and you take those three and three every day you're going to be taking the equivalent of ten servings of a salad made of those thirty one fruits and vegetables\nNow I don't know how much salad you're currently are ingesting but if you're not eating ten plate fools of it\nWith these thirty one specific fruits and vegetables in it you're gonna miss the nutrition that isn't the compact form of these caps with nothing but whole food\nAnd when you say whole food it's skin it's it's see it's it's all the stuff that that it's in that food when feasible yet writer example is the whole up all the whole pineapple now we take the skin off of some things right now that's not necessarily the edible\nPortion right [noise] but yeah every edible part is there and it's very important and we're the only ones who do that we have to have that made special for\nA while you have to do it under your control because again if you try to outsource that

is a huge part of the American real estate sneak\nAnd we're going to start with foreign buyers who purchased real estate right here in the usa\nYou might be surprised to learn that last year foreign buyers purchase more than one hundred twenty billion dollars worth of real estate in the United states but the shortage of homes for sale and rising prices are having an impact because the amount of foreign investment is dropping\nLet's talk about that now with George or to director of housing and commercial research at the national association of real tours George welcome to real estate today\nThat gives them and it's a good to be here chatting with you\nWe are so glad you're here so George let's start with why so many foreign investors put their money in American real estate why is that\nExcellent question Steven and to put that in perspective the United states is known worldwide number one obviously is the largest economy but to as an economy in a country which has a very strong private property rights\nAnd when you combine the two so strong property rights with a growing economy which also means a growing real estate environment you have a very appealing proposition for a lot of foreign buyers are looking for stability number one for their capital and to any return a bonus on top of that\nInteresting so George who are these foreign buyers and what countries do they come from a\nBuyers come in a sense from pretty much all over the world obviously we have a few particular countries which lead that list\nAnd here I think of China I think of Canada Mexico India and a few countries in Europe like kingdom being at the top of that list\nI see and are these people looking for vacation homes or do the foreign buyers tend to rent out these houses and generate income\nSo it's a combination of things so we have a detail when whenever I Would try to get this information we we're on a survey of our members on we've tried to detail how many of these are\nFolks looking for a vacation investment or how many of them may be for example temporary residents like diplomats\nForeign students and so on and it turns out that basically we're or a little bit split between so looking at twenty Eighteen\nThose who are non residents so that didn't have a ... than status at that and he soared purchase about fifty a three billion dollars worth of real estate and resident types purchased close to sixty eight\nBillion dollar so the resident maybe edging but just a little bit to the non resident\nYou know George I was so interested in one specific part of your new report on the international real estate and that is that the most transactions by foreign buyers happened in five states can you tell us about that\nThey absolutely tend to be what I Would call ... shine they traditionally so Florida tops that list as a major destination followed by not surprisingly California\nTexas Arizona and New York as sort of the top five and then ... the rounding up but you know that some of the other states are Georgia New Jersey Ohio Virginia\nAnd North Carolina so you can tell that a lot of coastal areas where foreign buyers tend to buy they also tend to be a vacation destination not surprisingly Florida for example California Arizona\nWould markets like Los Angeles San Francisco Miami obviously being at the top of the list\nInteresting but George as we saw in the latest report the shortage of homes for sale and home values which are not joining up has caused a rather significant drop in foreign investment in American real estate\nYou're absolutely right in fact with prices you know looking over the last five years or prices in the U.S\nHave gone up over forty percent now when you couple that with with the exchange rate for various countries that basically has made a lot of us are real estate relatively speaking a lot more expensive during this period\nWhich not surprisingly has put the brakes on some of the activity during this last year from now when we surveyed our members\nIn addition to you have an economic as well as regulatory issues for example European economy has rebounded\nSince the the concern of twenty sixteen in addition Asian economies have gained strength still for a lot of foreign buyers there are a lot more attractive destinations for second homes around the world so some of that is also contributing to the declining sales\nA it's very interesting George now if I Am an American homeowner and I'm putting my house on the market\nSelling it to a foreign buyers can be a very attractive proposition because they generally pay all cash and many of them aren't really that worried about the purchase price\nYou're absolutely right in fact the one of the things that stood out in the survey was that for a lot of foreign buyers\nEven when the strong price appreciation of last year's us home prices remain a relatively affordable for many of them compared to their own countries prices so what we see is when they come here they tend to buy also more expensive homes so for example on average\nForeign buyers paid about four hundred and fifty four thousand dollars per that typical home when you consider that the average price of all the existing homes sold in that state and you know twenty Eighteen was two hundred and Ninety One thousand dollars\nIt tells you that you're willing to pay a premium they tend to do obviously buying more expensive locales but they also tend to by larger home so to your question obviously if you are a seller and buyer can certainly be a very attractive proposition wonderful well\nGeorge I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about international real estate with us thank you\nYou're very welcome Stephen always a pleasure talking with you\nYou to
