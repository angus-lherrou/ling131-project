the founder and formulate or of balance\nThe nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard Dr Howard is a medical doctor ... doctor researcher and specialist in spite of nutrients Dr Howard\nWhat is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of this perpetual scientists don't what'd you are learning it even more and more as the results come into the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nYou know what is beautiful the balance of nature is it's not new it is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and it's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving a how and why does it work but the beauty of it is\nWe don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make it special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth ditch one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing added and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce it took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with\nWith the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know due to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond was immune studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out where it needed\nAnd I'll do even studies about the viscous it'd be the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood how flows through the beans you can get to the smallest possible vessels\nAll of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different vegetables that made the greatest impact on those things in in the DNA for example how could protected\nThe most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature when I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable the beautiful benefits at the fruits and veggies and the ... the whole health system\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today thank you it's great to be here thank you\nReally sponsored by balance of nature views

you have the wrong number actually no I'm not familiar with the credit ferry and I know all the fairies were tight knit bunch\nWhy don't you tell me more about what the credit for it does maybe the ring a bell the credit very magically raises your credit score so you'll be more likely to receive better interest rates [noise]\nI'm pretty sure there's not a critic theory but I Do know you can

Leadership Conference on civil rights education funding the ad council\nUnfortunately the vast majority of people have no flood insurance we have a population here of more than ten and a half million people\nAre less than one hundred and thirty five thousand people have flood insurance\nAcross North and South Carolina CNBC reports that a total of just three hundred and thirty five thousand homeowners have flood insurance\nComing up and a half an hour it's air BNB versus Washington DC there's even back to you thanks bill [noise]\nAs you know the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates this year\nThree times so far\nAnd it's possible they may raise rates once again this coming December now when the fed raises interest rates they're not raising mortgage interest rates but their actions do have a long term effect on the rates you pay on a new home oh\nLet's talk with an expert now about how that works and what to expect down the road joining us this useless injure the award winning business analyst for CBS News the host of the national radio show Jim on money and also the podcast better off with Jill slush singer Jill welcome to real estate today\nThey can be with you so Joe as you know the fed has already raised interest rates three times in two thousand Eighteen and they might do it again in December so why are they raising interest rates\nOn the economy is growing at a pretty good credit by most estimates for all of twenty Eighteen or have the data three percent GDP gross domestic product and that's a good sized kick up\nFrom what we've seen over the last say post recession years are over the last five years now the real balancing act at the Federal Reserve has is that when the economy starts to pick up\nSo to do prices and so with all this talk about it's really great to have a growing economy we know that part of that will be that we'll get to ... a little inflation is fine\nThe Federal Reserve really wants there to be some price pressures that that's actually good for the economy no inflation is bad\nBut they don't want inflation to get ahead of us and so raising interest rates is one of the tools that they have\nTo make sure that the economy doesn't get too hot create chew much inflation\nAnd really cause problems for consumers because obviously if\nOur wages are rising three percent but inflation's running at four percent we are losing money every year so the feds have got to really walk this very fine line they want to make sure that interest rates are high enough so that we stave off inflation\nBut not too high to actually choke economic growth so you could see it's a tough decision but we'll probably get another one in December and then next year we might get another two or three rate hikes depending on the pace of economic growth\nOkay Joe but many people believe that if the fed raises rates by say a quarter point and then later another quarter point that mortgage interest rates will automatically go up by the same amount but that's not the case correct\nRight because the interest rate that the Federal Reserve controls is a short term interest rates so\nThat is a rate that for all intents and purposes is not\nDirectly linked to the mortgage market where it's a longer term luck\nIt is linked to say a car loan or um when the fed raises rates which you might see is a business line of credit could rise and cost you could see credit card rates go up those short term rates are linked to Federal Reserve decisions\nNow mortgage rates are usually linked to the ten year treasury and that is not did not move in lockstep with the short term rates that the Federal Reserve does control I Would say that direction only it usually does\nBut not the exact same rate so if you see that hey the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by a total of let's say one percent for all of\nTwenty Eighteen it may not be that thirty your mortgage rates went up by one percent they probably went up by some fraction of that maybe half a percent\nThe other thing that's really\nImportant is one mortgage rates go up it of course does change what a buyer can't afford but I Would be very careful that buyers don't go nuts about this because you may find\nThat the court or or the half a point interest rate increase that you know maybe you have to pay since the last time he went and looked for a house maybe a year ago\nIt may add let's say fifty dollars a month to your mortgage payment may be less than that and of course the larger the mortgage the more it would add but it may not make a difference in your ability to afford the house\nThat is great perspective Jill so finally you've always been one to make sure people don't flip out when they hear news like this so if I'm looking to either buy a home or refinance my home and I read in the newspaper the fed is raising interest rates no need to panic\nThere beyond don't need to panic the opposite of panic you should be rooting for this because this is raising interest rates because the economy is\nFarming so maybe you could have gotten a cheaper mortgage rate forty years ago\nBut maybe you didn't have as high paying a job or maybe you don't have as much confidence that the economy will continue to grow or maybe when you think about refinancing you say oh this stinks\nI could have refinance and gotten three and three quarters percent and now it's four and a half except that now you have way more equity in your home or except now you are fixing a variable rate mortgage which will go up and will cost you more and you're putting it into a fixed rate note\nThat makes more sense for you and your family so again\nLike the stock market the headline can seem scarier than the actual impact on you and it's not to say that rising interest rates don't hurt people who own money if course they do\nBut you are buying a home you're making a thirty year purchase and you are making sure that you can afford it based on your circumstances today and maybe you can better afford the mortgage at four and a half percent because you've got a more secure job or a better job or a better paying job today then you had five years ago\nSo in that case you're very happy to pay a higher rate\n... I really appreciate it when you talk us through these somewhat scary scenarios and reassurance to the sky in fact is not falling\nI promise you it's not falling today\n[laughter] Jill again thanks for

economic issues for Christian welcome to realistic today\nThank you so much for having an honor to be here\nWe are so glad you're here so Christian Percival how's business\nIs a good I Know the markets kinda you know just shifting an evening out everywhere but business is good and you know banks are still selling people are still buying\nExcellent so Christian you set out to invest in real estate at a really early age how old were you when you first bought an investment property\nI bought my first and best their property at twenty four years old and I've tried my best to buy it at that their property every year that that I Am thirty one years old and just bought\nMy night so I Know what I had a schedule I started the purchaser but I did sell one so I guess I'm On track\nWell you know a lot of people who invest in real estate in some of them do invested a younger age but I'm fascinated by your slogan and your plan twenty five forty what inspired that\nI Am inspired by that because my grandparents were both realtors as well as both my parents and every day they wake up and and why they have a sale they have no job\nWe our job I Swear I wake up as a self employed person at at the important that we set up for our retirement because we're preaching that good word short Hi it so we might as well talk the talk and walk the walk\nAnd I asked you before about this whole plan and you've said it is a plan you don't just wing it you really planned this out so now you're nine properties what's next\nWell I think that always depends on the market I like I had mentioned just now that I have stalled on my property it's often I added across because one or if that's the reason for that is I think that they've reached their max potential for profit and so I Want to ask somebody to profit on there that they take that\nOn truck ... tested at real estate at a lower price point to allow for the fame appreciation that I was able to get this project\nThat is such a great plan so you're selling some properties and when you do you can put the entire profit into the next place thanks to the ten thirty one like kind of exchange can you explain that to our listeners\nAbsolutely and I would highly recommend putting your property that church at thirty one exchange it's a great way to defer taxes it will end up paying the taxes at the end but it's a great way to test for them in the meantime continue to purchase a properties\nOr caused them at a church temporary well actually I think I purchased your new property and a ten thirty one exchange you need to identify your property and a quicker manner but it does allow you to deferred taxes which is a great way to build your while to get to that next level especially at a younger age\nAnd the big question Chris than you would know the answer to this better than anybody if you want to start investing in real estate a lot of people think oh well that's way beyond me you've got to have really deep pockets to do that true or false\nI Would say falls at first there's a lot of information at your fingertips on go on I'm not saying that everything is real but what I Would say is don't be afraid to roll their slaves and get dirty yourself that's what I did I went in and get all to get it on myself and\nThe reason for doing what that was because I wanted to do what was the height of all I wanted to do\nA do wires that how they just don't work and do waiters that go into the ... backer and the title of the shower and why it needs to be hardy back over sheet rock because it's waterproof and just learning all these things at the end of valuable when it comes to represent buyers and\nSellers though is able to take all of that knowledge apply it to being a practicing realtor
