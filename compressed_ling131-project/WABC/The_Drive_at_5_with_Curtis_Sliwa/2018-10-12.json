shows up at the White House here he is in the oval office wearing his nag hat and the press or just eating this stuff up the press a very serious problem will say no we must treat president\nWith the president in the oval office all sorts of ... that they're they're eating is they love it they couldn't love anything more than ... yesterday saying that Trump did not expect the crazy mobile like cognac\nFair enough serious\nProblems on your own journey right now and he might have expected to have a crazy mother but my kind of was one of the support\nFor better believe we are going to make America great\nAgain so that the press went nuts over this particular comment for a couple of reasons one thing that comes on the hero's journey which is pretty Joseph Campbell and second him dropping ... on on TV in the oval office oh Jim Acosta tweeted this out Jim Acosta weeded out\nTania just said mother effort in the oval office per White House pool and people like and he'll cage him in the

that disgrace the oval office like cigars have had human bodily fluids on them that didn't come from the oral cavity\nIn the oval office like they had the steam clean all the carpet after Bill Clinton left ... and ... there's there's a book fully describing round Emanuel dropping the M. F. bombed repeatedly in the oval office so\nNo general cause I Love to have a cost and getting all hot and bothered about all the clutching his pearls it's just it's amazing it's just amazing so Jim Acosta anyway to Kenya says all of that and then kind of goes on\nAnd he says you know what I Love my bag a hat and now we know he lost his ... because he said this before he was not enough and now\nAnd he said my ... it's just the best thing ever which I got to admit it's pretty fantastic the honey where's ... it is because just the the juxtaposition of cognac who is I have been told by the you know one of the cooler people in America\nWhere in the ... and lets me straight about ... just as a general rule just aesthetically there's something that my family war at like the Shapiro family picnics in Nineteen Ninety six you got from like the mass production store that had like you remember they had like little woven band that goes just above the ...\nThe brim of the cap so Tanya wearing that as sort of a an ironic feel it's just spectacular so here's county talking about why magazines are awesome and you got to appreciate it then you just ... you can do one or two things you need a cried the tragedy that this is what our national politics become or you can laugh at the fact\nThat Donald Trump is now swiveling every pop culture mean the what ever created back on them and slapping them in the basement which is just hilarious\nIt was something about our previous hat off and make you feel like Superman\nThat was the favorite superhero in your mid\nFor me also as a guy that looks are you referring to ride around most of American industry guy nonpolitical no we're going to be fought it however you want to do as far as the way I just go to Tom\nYes he is the first of all going to a couple of things that cliff once Superman the funniest favorite superhero which is good I mean that's a good pick I looked at me and myself but can you guys don't take Smith\nAnd then we also learned that the ... is like a Superman came which is just like to echo he could see the media members in the room collapsing in on themselves like dying stars it's just great and then tiny aid 'cause the worst thing in the world\nGets up and he says about President Trump I Love this guy that was hilarious without this is that until Donald Trump ran for president this was the view of Hollywood Donald Trump was very popular with all of these people in the media is very popular who's very popular in Hollywood\nLike he'd go round and how people would back slapping him giving him a hug she was doing cameos on every show so it's it's kinda funny now that oh my God can you give them a hug everybody loved Donald Trump until I ran for president in twenty sixteen at which point everybody hated Donald Trump like here was cognac breaking the ultimate capital and making physical contact\nIn the flesh with Donald J Trump\nI Love this guy or your let me [laughter]\nI Love to do I write is\nThere is there's a Carl Weathers Arnold Schwarzenegger hand grip\nJust amazing stuff and then kind of actually had some\nPretty good political comments it will be the good and then we'll get to you know the we're so he is he actually good political comments about racism\nWhat he said is basically you can't use racism as an excuse for failing in America anymore instead maybe we ought to think about how we actually better the country seems pretty fair to me and this is coming from a guy who as I understand that grow up with a single mom in impoverished area and then made himself a billionaire\nSo even though I don't like rap and I'm not a fan of Conyers' music\nHistories pretty American story it's pretty amazing American story there's plenty of talking about racism\nA lot of times it's just an overall lack of reparations that we see any given point we say\nThis is this is ready for this was this was literally will try to control a black person to the concept of racism because we know that we're very proud emotional people do and I feel like try to like someone is liberal they'll say\nOh these races fusing races visible\nWhoa yes yep [noise]\nBlow Clapper county and this is the point the point that he's actually making here\nDoes not require you to be all that learned in politics and when he says that racism is very often used by political actors in order to achieve a particular result in order to manipulate people that is certainly true that is certainly true so well done county there and then ... made everyone had explode when he defended the second amendment which is just that ask here's county doing that\nThe ... the second amendment going on for problem is the legal ... illegal because of the problem not not not legal goes we have the right to bear arms\nOh no all of their heads just exploded Kanye eight actually saying the truth tells you to actually about the second amendment now listen as I said before any time you get in bed with celebrity you should expect that somebody's gonna get screwed and the fact is that\nSomething could happen with Kanye as a personality that could be damaging to the point that he's making here but take it and they sell it for what it is today you saying some things that need to be said and when you hear an argument you really instead of first considering the source may first of all to consider the validity of the argument the argument that Conyers making their\nIs exactly right now as I say live by the county die by the ... when the second how the die by the ... half of this war\nAnd then we'll get to the media coverage was ... which is a real story the media coverage of this meeting is a much bigger story than ... actually visiting the White House you've been to the White House before I Believe I mean he he was there when Obama was president naturally so\nIt's not a giant truck but we'll talk in a second about the media coverage but first let's talk about your bathroom habits how are you getting ready to
