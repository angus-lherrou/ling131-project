through the looking glass are we in the middle of ... that your aspirin middle of any of the I mean my goodness\nI think it's a good stable every morning and they always say\nHorse face and told from Mario ... an American romance that's where we are\nAll good stop the other narrative of the day is that Elizabeth Warren as Tom ... is not actually Native American so she claimed that she was Native American and many many many many many on she claimed that she was Native American in legal journals she claimed that she was Native American and the war in that you want from University of Pennsylvania last fall\nShe claimed that she was Native American in a story that you told over and over and over a romantic story Romeo and Juliet story about her mother a Native American proud Native American woman wandering the plane who met her father and her father brought her home\nAt the inlaws were racist or is it and said you can't bring home that Native American woman you can't bring home that\nThat Indian get out of here and then apparently her parents Hilo and they had a a beautiful romance from there on it well it turns out that Elizabeth Warren is not in fact Native American but it was funny to watch the narrative turned yesterday so yesterday Elizabeth\nAnd started this whole thing off by releasing a video of her and her family members talking to her Native American she was and here is what the video sounded like\nThis isn't just about casual racism war who needed communities have faced discrimination neglected in violence for generations interim can say whatever he wants to know mocking Native Americans or any group you were to try to get nice [noise]\nUm some people question my heritage and my family history maybe they do it to insulting\nMaybe they do it's just strange time to dream to some finding the time to change\nMaybe because they think politics was [noise] my parents were real people\nLump issues struggles seem to have the money they\nReally will always be at you know [noise] even printed [noise] because we were using edge on hard\nEdged on her heart and then she goes to all her family members were talking about their Native American heritage and\nThen she released as they study and the study shows that you want maybe maybe not totally maybe one one thousand working for native I'm sure it one one thousand twenty fourth Native American which is just awesome it's just awesome in every way\nSo surely does that and watch us our tweet evolved over the course of the day so she starts off by saying this by the way a real Donald Trump remember saying on seven five to like if you give a million dollars to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry I remember and here's the verdict\nPlease send the check the national indigenous women's resource center in number one that's how he said what he said it if you prove your Native American and then I'll give you a million bucks in brochures Native Americans you prove the Jews whiter\nThan any person decided mark and mark and then she continued tweeting but watch out who developed and I W are seen as nonprofit working to protect native women from violence\nMore than half ball native women have experienced sexual violence\nAnd majority of violent crimes against Native Americans are perpetrated by non natives send them you're one million dollar check Donald Trump and then she continues along these lines I took the test and released the results for anyone who cares to see because I've got nothing to hide\nWhat are you hiding Donald Trump release her tax returns or the Democratic led house will do it for you soon enough tick tock Mr President though there's one most annoying things on Twitter these days and the tick tock reveal Baltic talk more ticking down to something that\nAura turns down we're ticking down to you completely collapsing in on yourself like a dying star\nShe continues and she says having some memory don't problems Donald Trump should we call for a doctor here some people forget Mr President you're the least popular president in modern history in your allies will go down hard in mid term elections twenty two days tick tock\nTick tock\nOkay and then she could but then she concludes I won't sit quietly for Donald Trump racism so I took a test\nBut but DNA and family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship which is determined to only only by tribal nations I respected ascension and don't let myself his native Minnesota ... what happened like that I mean that was a sudden western\nIs like when Michael Scott was driving on the road and the UPS holding drive into the lake that's basically how that we read what he's just he's talking she's talking about yeah a Native American and Native

could have changed Elizabeth Warren's mind what could have changed her mind she was saying very confidently that she was Native American which was an American and then all of a sudden well it turns out that tried to get to decide who's Native American why\nWhy because the Cherokee Nation came out and said a you're not Native American and share that now it's supposed to be clear about this the Cherokee Nation does not come out and make political statements very often\nBut they found out there secretary of state truck hawking to issue a statement he said quote\nA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA test you're not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous north or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and well DNA tests can be used to the terminal lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliations and then they continue\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nations even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nAnd makes a mockery out of DNA tests and legitimate uses well also just honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and his heritage is proven Senator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continue claims of private heritage\nOut out\nThat she just got land to buy the Cherokee Nation which she claims ancestral membership yeah that went poorly furloughs with war which is why she shipped and said I'm not claiming that I'm a Native American anymore but I kind of Native Americans\nWill give me a million dollars again I call on the Trump Administration I call in President Trump's personally signed a nine hundred dollar check\nTo Elizabeth Warren's charity of choice because she was one one thousand four people were Native American maybe you should pay one one one thousand twenty fourth of a million dollars that is the amount to which she ended up to President Trump was asked about this yesterday and he basically just missed all of it\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're better read it again [noise] I Hope\nFor security very easy I always said he is running I Do not\nFeel destroy the drug for your dreams are Venezuela was that big I don't want to think\nMe a love for us it was ever\nOK so President Trump he he's eager to go after Elizabeth lord again I still think we need the image of him with a publishers clearinghouse size check handing it just to to Elizabeth Warren in order to basically have that image linked with Elizabeth Warren forever unfortunately it seems like he's level\nComing up the second reason there was a bit for health and the fact that needs to continue cleaning Native American
