beauty of it is\nWe don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make it special in New because the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth ditch one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing added and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy at different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA of the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most\nYou remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond does immune studies\nThose DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell good received the nutrition and receive oxygen so give out where it needed and also even studies about the discuss it either blood or in other words\nThe thickness of the blood how it flows through the beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels all of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different

thanks for having me on the show\nWe're so glad you're here so Lawrence of late summer early autumn decline in existing home sales what's happening here\nThe mortgage rate here in ... he was in trouble that some people are getting squeezed out because of the higher rate\nNow some of the buyers will just greet set their mind set you may be lowered the price point at which they will enter the market but the initial phase of rising rate so is that some people are just getting squeezed out and contract calling themselves\nAt five point one five million unit\nThe latest mark will be the lowest in nearly three years\nAnd was it also a year over year declined Lawrence year over year declined uh and the lights and got me started small incremental\nIncreases but as an Victorian crazy is providing some hope\nFor buyers iced out an hour it would be more choice there's two parts of the answer to market in the upcoming nuts but the rest are stuck in your mind that in September there were some shows down in the house the origin of because of the hurricane or not\nAnd we will have to wait to see how that gets resolved because generally speaking a natural disaster that is a negative ads up this week I was down to recover race based people began to buy homes wants to stay alive\nInteresting when Lawrence yes it is a tough market for buyers out there but prices are up four point two percent year over year that's great for homeowners and home sellers\nHigh in terms of net worth for the country a combination of the stock market I Know the stock market as little wobbly at times but one compares to one year ago it is higher compared to two or three years ago substantially higher\nSo and then you combine that with the middle class well which is tied to housing so ... who says why isn't\nA great benefit for middle class homeowners\nBut we need to a shirt that homeownership rate not remained just press levels but with infants who are beginning to show up all price growth going ... percent range rather than in the upper stick with their jets against you provide an opportunity for people to enter the market\nAnd the economy is creating jobs and we generally foreign debt as the economy it creates jobs even adult cells may decline initially because of the interest rate increases the buyers will resume\nThe market with greater tore choices\nMore as you mentioned that the hurricanes down south effected home sales but every part of the country was down except the Midwest and they were flat so it was a very tough month\nThe ... was the most affordable region of the country held steady wild west ridge him based on a political conditions prices have gone up too high too fast and the west regime can tell it's a struggle in terms of buying activity\nOr not the sole modest decline but the Midwest showing civilization is implying that us unless those jobs and affordable conditions the buyers are willing to make the major purchase for home\nI see well Lawrence let me ask you this does it seem to you then with all the challenging headwinds at the buyers are facing in today's market some of them might just be waiting for the spring market of two thousand Nineteen\nNow some may be waiting for mortgage rate to retreat back down\nThat would be a false hope in my opinion because mortgage rate is clearly on a wide path\nProbably this time next year maybe five and a half percent mortgage rate average from current or point eight percent and when I look at the past historical homeless and cycles\nWhen there was a job creation and mortgage rate increase partly due to job creation or the economy improving with a mortgage rate increase because of job creation there were a few months where he sells declined\nBut that virus coming back so it remains to be sure whether it's springtime the buyers will resume as the economy without a doubt is and I took shape strong job creation wages now picking up the number of people filing for on the truck at historic lows so economic data is\nVery positive limits are sure that translates into increase how is ...\nInteresting when Lawrence says you and I have talked throughout the year it seems that it's just been kind of either flat or down for much of two thousand Eighteen so by the time we hit the end of the year what do you think are down here\nThe cells or the down about three percent of the prices up four to five percent so one can call it you know is it a down here are set up your\nJust wholesale prices continue to increase\nSomehow the housing market swung from great\nRecession ten years ago\nThat I quite strong recovery the recent past years before being more neutral or not strong look moving up or down the highway in twenty eight chain and twenty loud chain attempt to conflict and forced the\nJob creation as positive for housing are rising rates are not\nAnd those two factors may castle each other out so that home so they're not really changed that much but for the buyers will mean more inventory choices\nAnd I want to point out something you just said which is just so true whether the year ends up up or down depends on the kind of real estate you're doing\nSo and so I

management the issues that come with tenants leaving collecting rents repairs cetera sometimes so by investing\nIn a real estate investment trust and faith rate you are investing in real estate that you're actually just buying stock in that role I say\nIt allows you to diversify your portfolio by location I property type by larger portfolio our property that you wouldn't normally be able to go by yourself I'm a very similar to owning your own a piece of real estate without all the headache sometimes\nYou don't have to find tenants and chase down the rent checks it's just like investing in stock that is awesome if I'm interested in investing in a repeat\nWhat I Do it through a stockbroker or if I just say having account where they trading company can do it that way or should I consult a financial planner and work with them\nMy personal opinion is you need a financial plan our first and I share that you can do it any way you just mentioned it's taken but\nYour financial planner could give you ideas of why don't you invest in this stock over here here's some others over here maybe\nYou need cash liquid not just in stock with the ups and downs of the market so I think you do need a financial planner but you can go buy it straight out if the on line and buy it from a trade or anywhere else\nIt's your decision whatever you wish to do that's interesting and so there you are now you have a ... and you start getting the evidence Cindy I imagine that taxable income\nOh yes you pay them on your end depending on where your tax structure shock\nYou know the one little bit of that I Would also tell you as I have reached in my Ira my investment for long term for when I didn't retire even further and the different and staying there I'm not taxed on that\nI'm not taxing I take it out and that interesting\nThat's so interesting if I Am an older Americans say you know fifty sixty Seventy and I want to invest in real estate to make my retirement more comfortable how would you compare investing in reads as opposed to buying a brick and mortar property with a ten\nLet's say you could go out and buy a property and he happened to have five hundred thousand dollars you could invest\nIf you could go buy a piece of steak and get a six and a half to seven percent return on that property\nYou could net somewhere around thirty to thirty five thousand a year on that five hundred thousand if you pay all cash ... if you take that same five hundred and let's say you invested the even in the ... on that are blacks counts\nBeck says there ... that you would end up buying somewhere around ... Thirteen pounds and share okay they're currently paying six point six percent he'd get thirty three thousand class and the other hand\nI see so Cynthia that's pretty comparable investing in a region or a brick and mortar property except the brick and mortar property would be more work\nThe ups and downs every parish collecting at France and I love for real estate that's what I hear that out for what investing in our own state tax cut that does the same thing and at the end I come close to getting the same meal\nYou know that is so good to know that your bottom line could be very similar but we're the ... you can be out playing tennis can be out golfing it'd be on the couch with your feet up\nAnd the one lasting outlet over ... you have to be in it for the long haul whether you're owning or else you're on the shots 'cause the ups and downs of our market", "show_name": "The Drive at 5 with Curtis Sliwa", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "20"}
