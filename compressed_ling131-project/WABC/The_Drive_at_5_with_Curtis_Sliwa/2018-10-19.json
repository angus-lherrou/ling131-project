radical feminists are trying to push women off that scale right now\nThere's a philosophy that I've talked about a lot on the show on the west that says that we can prioritize people's viewpoints based on their genetics based on their ancestry based on their ethnicity based on their class is so basically here's how this hierarchy goes of abuse that we should respect it goes it goes like this oh you mean the person\nBlack person Hispanic person woman\nAsian person Jewish person white person that's how it goes that's the hierarchy and women are somewhere in the middle as I mentioned right there ... kinda behind Hispanic but I had a major and then that's where women are so what radical feminist are trying to do is elevate women in the hierarchy of victimhood higher up the ladder\nAnd that way folks like Hillary Clinton and have a better shot at being elected by clinic victim but this is why it because women are tighten up on me as her sexuality scale he's always with war and trying to claim Native American ancestry\nBecause you're saying it's not enough for me to be a woman and Democratic primary I also have to claim membership in a historically victimized group I'm also a Native American that of course all apart for\nWhat so if you can't if you can't beat the intersection now of course he joined the intersection now like horse\nRadical feminists are trying to elevate women as victims in American society and so this this woman it's late as crazy as she sounds just tore through strike who says that she wants to be a ... that you basically wants to be part of the she woman Dan Harris club like within the reverse of the of the gang from alfalfa\nYou know she when she says this this is not actually that far out of the realm of the mainstream in certain democratic

daughters and I started getting together and local playground and at that time each week recently among them away brought her son to the playground at the same time we were there\nI asked her nightly I thought if you would mind leading because we'd wanted it to be a girls only time\nShe refused and seemed angry at me if she comes back is there a better way I can approach to approach her this has been such a sweet time for moms and daughters and having a boy there is naturally going to change things we live in a world where boys get everything in girls are left with problems and I would think this mom would realize that but she seems to think our son is entitled to crashes girls only time\nI don't can't legally keep her from a public park or can I appealed to her better nature\nAnd then the response was showing off the mom and her boy was terrible but I have to admit that I actually have a little bit of sympathy for the ... not in the sense that you should drop the boys but boys do change the dynamic when girls are playing\nI based on I have a daughter and I play very very differently when boys go to a girls only go to the changes that I doubt it boys are different than girls radical feminist want to have it both ways boys and girls are exactly the same but girls are different from boys and therefore should be separated often boys when they want to be separated from what\nI think that we should recognize him for his boys and girls are different also we live in a free country\nAnd because we live in a free country people should be able to rise and fall on their own merit without claiming victimization at the hands of the free society in world history okay so it's Hillary Clinton gonna run again I\nHighly doubt it I don't think she's going to but maybe she
