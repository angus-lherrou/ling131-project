like that from these from these guys from the village in New York\nWho are playing in this club that that I was visiting and they were talking about uh their friend that sent some black ... to them

know it's and it's not it's still here I mean I I smoke grass I you know Willie smokes grass is a ... you know a lot of musicians grasp because frankly when you're finished playing you made a record or you've done something you know you want to listen to it\nGrass really opens it up it just like you or you can get totally into it you don't need to be high to hear it but if you are it kinda takes everything else away and you go right into it now you know there are others at home kids that\nWere going to say do you worry about the kids who want to be the next meal yum may take that and say well I better get into marijuana\nYou know I think everybody has to make their own choices and I'd say this to those kids\nJust like everybody else ... you gotta you gotta make your own way and you got to realize that what someone else says\nEven though if you admired them may not be good for you and it may maybe who knows\nI Know a lot of musicians who've been around for many many many years who get high one way or another just to relax and listen to the music they're not it's not damaging drugs the damaging drugs you can see because people die\nQuestion which you approach to thinking about that everybody has to think about it sooner or later ... was later\nYeah well you know um\nIt's a part of life and I love living\nSo I'm I'm sure that when death comes that uh you know in some way I Will appreciate it you know I I think there's something that must happen with that\nAnd ah you know I'm not anxious to find out what it is but when it happens I Hope that I'm there I Hope I can see it happening I Hope I can feel it\nAnd it may be you know fast it maybe slow whatever it is I just wanted to be a um real what it is not something hopefully that I did myself where I made a mistake I'm and I'm certainly not something where I ended up hurting anybody else\nYou know having said that what do you want people remember much we were holding a memorial service for his remembered new you've heard so many great songs with a group like one\nAnd so what are we going to play\nWell you know I Can't say excuse that's what other people are for I\nOnly create the songs I don't I don't have the future of the songs in mind\nI don't have that if I did I Would miss so many songs\nWhere I was so busy taking care of the ones that I made that I missed three new ones that came in I was busy I couldn't do it I I heard it but I didn't pay attention that's not happening with me if I hear I pay attention I'll take care of it until it's gone until I get it out there and\nThen I feel like I've done it and uh and if I think there's something more I can do like in the case in the months on Thirty years on earth I'll do it\nAnd I'll I'll I'll I'll Try to do it and then I'll let it go now I feel better about that song because of the way I did it and uh but it's gone now it's gone\nIt's great but we're going to argue with me for a shovel okay and answer the question you wouldn't pick a song with about ... heart of gold and we're going to be just pointed\nNo it was a real saw any song do you know there are all all that they all do that you know there's other ones\nIs there a particular story behind harvest moon\nThat's the that's the one of my uh favorite songs because it's a a real song about\nReal feelings um\nThey kind of remember when I first started writing the melody and and everything I was on my boat in the Caribbean and I started writing this malady and it started coming to me and then finally the whole thing came and then I had the words and\nAnd uh it was a ... vote what really touched me about that song even more than singing the song and even though it was fun to do it and make the record in ... came in and put these beautiful vocals on and it blew my mind how how well it all turned out but\nThe thing was that people come up to me now\nAnd they say we played that at our wedding you know we played that when we first met that song was playing things like that for a romantic ah atmosphere of the song there's a uh something about it that that brings that out and people so it's it's interesting it's nice to see it's like if you're a farmer and you're out there and\nYou're throwing these scenes out and everything and then you reach in the southern Baghdad throw up the seeds and suddenly there's like eight or ten cows right there just to just all checking out those seats\nNow what's the difference between that one in the other ones I don't know but there are they are they're all beautiful blue eyed big eyelashes cows with that you you know it's all good it's perfect there there are so happy to have the food I mean what happened\n[noise] I\nRead something called more on it you feel court battle you should use to be approaching good enough to be worthy of your family's love puzzles that level\nI think it's I think I'm doing well I really am I I feel very good in the family is a is big it's a big family it's not just blood it's it's a big family so I got my sister up in Canada and um my son and\nMy brother and my ... my older son and my daughter great artist and Virginia and ... you know I have a you know I've been very fortunate to have these these people around and that and you know so I I'm trying to do everything I can\nAlways speaking of family you have a discussion then yeah it was on\nA great kid he's great he's in his thirties now quadriplegic cerebral palsy wheelchair soul life it's like having a or a spiritual guide with you\nWhen he goes on the road with me is just a feeling he's just there he loves to be there he loves to sit in the bus field the motion of the bus he's sitting in the cherries going back and forth we take for granted\nYou know if you can't move\nAnd ... you're in something like this you feel good that's a good feeling it's free you're getting moved by the world if you're in a body that doesn't move and you're moving\nFantastic so he loves that he's a great spirit and uh and and I love them dearly and all my kids I Love dearly but Venice special everybody realizes these special\nYou know we've been ... something along the lines of recording drew blush to to\nHave been only have ... definitely we are I mean Peggy and I both feel the same way about that and it was a blessing because we learned so much about life when I see someone struggling to do something\nAnd getting mad and giving up I think a ban for those people in\nThat situation and see what they would do what do you mean you're trying to do something that somebody is trying to walk\nTrying to move their hands slowly over to put her on a button to blow the horn on an electric train it takes a lot of work to move your head if nothing works this is big stuff\nAnd and you get it done and then there's a little smile and its life that's what it is so ... you know he's taught me a lot I I Will never give up on things because of him\nWhat was going to ask you do have any missions for families who may have children working through adversity if not like been some kind of the Bush well\nYou know you just have to believe in yourself that you could that you can help and then you can do what it is that needs to be done and not take it personally and certainly don't blame yourself\nI don't blame yourself everybody has their own road oh everybody has their own thing to do I see people blaming themselves for things that happened to other people\nAs well he's just sage advice for seven year old don't blame yourself when something goes wrong with somebody you love\nYou listen to something you did but there was a powerful mostly because you've lived you invented the human family been yeah we've been through and your support for the school yeah the bridge to tell me about that\nWell you know that we're coming up on the thirtieth concert this year and it's a it's a pleasure we've got a\nYou know we raised a lot of money and we still don't have enough money to get the uh for what we need for the dominant of the school you know what is the school it's the British school the school for a\nChildren with severe a handicaps or stop them from communicating and in a way that people can understand\nThat sometimes of severe physical limitations and all kinds of things and and it's a school for augmented of communication\nWhere you know we teach kids how to use switches computers with buttons choices different ways to communicate all kinds of little devices that have been developed for somebody you can talk and can hardly move their hands but they can move their head\nThey can move a light around this on their forehead and point out little things to say words by pointing at them\nAnd they can put sentences together and then go over and say it\nSo this is the kinds of words the scooters and has been doing for him and the years\nThirty years so it was my wife Peggy he's idea she said to me one day she said why don't you get Bruce Springsteen coming player a show you know and we'll have a big show and\nAnd ah and you know get enough money together started school because we've been trying to take bend the school and and he never did uh we could never find a school or they just kinda like put them there and babysat him\nYou know he wasn't really doing anything and I can sense there's you know there's someone home we don't want to just have to have him sitting there what do you get springs seem to come and play you know he did come and then you know I said let's make it a coup stick those put everybody on an even playing field\nSomething they're not used to doing put them all there and let them do that\n\n\nWhat do you tell me about yourself\nThat nobody knows going something I don't know and maybe nobody also worked for so\nI'm fairly shy in and secure in intimate situation\nOkay but I managed to be my way through it and let go\nThat's something or Goldman bananas river men as you waited [laughter] thank you so much thank you for [noise]\nAnd that's it for this position of the bigger the reviews were always eager to hear what you have to say look we follow him on Facebook and Twitter war syndrome comments to viewer at access dot ...\nThe morning and sit on the morning show up on the job would be I'd be ... from Breitbart News alum bakari on Google MSNBC Chris Matthews fan the lovely we'd have Cosby once or just the Gulf and all the basement of a great weekend Bernie it's in the morning show see him on the morning\nWe didn't hire you and lick you to be reelected we elected you to do the job that you have a right now the job you're supposed to do what's with this party line\nYou're allowed a point of view it's called free will\nBut apparently not anymore in politics this is terrible I must admit I must admit when I hear them speak law these senators brilliant\nI don't agree probably with anything that comes out of senator Schumer's mouth and don't like ... ... per se for his policies but when he spoke the other day on the situation with Kevin ... I was in or he was brilliant he was articulate he made his case\nAnd if nothing else the Republicans deserved and should have listened to what he had to say I don't believe they did I have a great sounds I don't want to play for you it's mind ...\nYou know the sun is just a you know goes in one ear out the other yeah I didn't introduce just the high everybody for that yeah that's the sound they make when someone says something me I don't want to hear in one ear went out\nThe next ... senators the Republican senators didn't listen to Schumer and then senator Collins started off very slow but our ... built a history of Kavanaugh's decisions\nAnd how they affected the world and in great detail articulated in laid out a scope of events\nEvidence or the lack there of all why she made the decision to vote for cabinet forget either one of their decision she was brilliant she was my idol that day I couldn't believe how smart I was getting how much I learned about civics in the government by just listening to her\nBut the Democrats didn't even listen ...\nIt's like whatever she said it doesn't matter because it didn't go along with the party line\nNow why am I talking politics on the show I'm not this is all business this is a business show not a political show ...\nMaybe I did just a few little commentary but in reality I just wanted to explain to you one influenced me to come up with tonight's concept for our show which is the party line\nGot me thinking the party line in business in life business life it might be the company line\nBut I Will use my free will\nTonight to create a fun thoughtful show that will call the party line\nNo speaking of free will and a great thinker my son co host at attorney Jesse Weber Jesse all week long you're on the lure of crime show you've been on TV a bunch of times and you've been talking about cabinet or and everything else that's going on what do you have to say you hear about this\nParty line nonsense well first of all and I'm Glad that you said I have free will and it's not just the puppet for whatever you say fair you have to say this ...\nUm is that the way we do that it's not the way we do things if anything we discovered in the last way before you go there I'm just using that on next week it's because he didn't toe the party line than I ever got very well thank you for that [noise]\nIf anything the past month has told us it's how important the law is to be impartial and I want to just talk about this for a second so\nEverybody has an opinion on Kavanaugh one way or another but the thing is every single person that talked about it no one has any idea what happened thirty six years ago nobody knows nobody\nNow this is an unfortunately the two of them only the two of them so not New England at all honestly I law inside the two of them that's a smart observation beside of the two of them no one knows and the problem is we may never know\nWhat actually happened after watching them both they both work stream Lee compelling extremely emotional and heartfelt I find it difficult to see\nHow Dr Ford without brood her life create such hardship herself just to come on in front of the entire world and lie under oath I don't see that at the same time\nI find it difficult to see a sitting judge also going on the stand and basically committing perjury I don't see that either one of them lying\nSo the thing is is this is really not about protecting men are protecting sexual assault\nBecause if something came out to support her allegations he would be gone he would be not only his nomination withdrawn he could face criminal charges not kidding you he would have been got an ... even heard President Trump at the very beginning of the before the FBI investigation said\nWe'll see what comes out which means he was suggesting if something came out he would have thrown him out so everybody was waiting to see this\nBut we have a system here where if you are innocent until proven guilty if you don't like it that's then you move to another country that's the due process system that is what is the foundation of our legal system and we see this constantly I'm Talking the worst of the worst\nWere put on trial you have to say even though you know a hundred percent they did it\nWell they allegedly did this now there are questions about that FBI investigation that I even have\nWhy certain people were not interviewed but you know what I see a lot of trials where there's been questions about an investigation and maybe people are unhappy with the N verdict\nBut you have to respect the system\nAnd what the system said was he was still innocent and he was not proven guilty and so because of that the situation there was really no grounds to withdraw his nomination and what's ironic about the whole thing is that despite if you're a democratic or Republican the law is impartial bowl law stayed the same\nAnd you're hoping that when he goes to the Supreme Court I Believe you started this past week that he's going to look at the law and have that be impartial whenever you handle\nThat he does is so the take away on America is thank God for our legal system because the treats everyone fairly or it's supposed to exactly great now how do we turn this into a conversation\nAbout our show because we're all ... business [noise] well I had a question for you as you were talking about it does the party line apply to companies\nThat is a great question Jesse to the company line because the concept is similar there are definitely Jesse party lines in companies but with a vast difference ... the number one difference\nI think I Would think that companies are not democracies boom you\nKnow these are not democracy juror autocratic someone at the top makes a decision and that's the way it is people don't get to vote and companies they don't get to set the direction they get to listen and toe the party line and be part of a company and it's lined\nThe route of and that issue please\nTry to understand tactics\n... and I got me from at Cornell and actually [noise]\nPlease\n\nWhat is it is [noise] the only thing I Want you to ... at the flea let's say\nAbsolutely all our ships must feel in the same direction established companies have a point of view\nInterview often sit by the c._e._o. CEO operates within the confines of brand lines it's the strategy and positioning CEO sits the direction establishes the policy brings in his executives for their input\nThey office suggestions some I'm sure he or she will take\nAnd cast aside any ideas that don't support the strategy he or she is the C. E. O. they make the final decision period there is no voting there's no real calling there's no persuading convincing controlling or threatening\nThe C. E. O. is the boss and once the company line is just a Bush and said\nYou're expected to walk that line no wavering and not only be conversant stole all the virtues of the company like this is not a democracy this is capitalism at its best\nI like that what do you do if you don't agree with the direction\nJust a great question 'cause not everybody's going to agree yeah and I like it well you have two choices first let me play something for you I'm telling you straight [noise] my way or the highway\nExactly you can leave a trail prerogative you don't like what's going on leave business is not a democracy it's also not a prison you can walk\nHowever just see the proper course of action is to accept the choices and strategy laid out and do everything you can to try and make it work and convince everyone there reports to you what do you report to that you believe in the strategy you think the strategy is brilliant and now let's go out and make sure we win and make it work\nBut I've heard a lot of people in my experience they bad mouth the company constantly or their boss so what do you do about that\nAnd it taught a very important lesson not to him 'cause he was African guy I'm sure\nBut certainly when did you talk about the company line in the party line Jesse asked me a question is it different companies and the answer yes it is it's not like government we don't vote it's not a democracy you don't get to complain\nYou get paid to do a job in one of those jobs you do is the company like you have a responsibility to make sure everyone around you feels hope and feels that this is a great future in the company you don't like it leave which you don't do as bad mouth the company that's not the company line that's not the party line will take a break we'll be back in the\nFall away [laughter] [noise]\n\nI'm sure that's for sure they'd in\nItaly that's where they tell you it comes from an awkward there would approve this is a collection of men's and women's issues that are in a contemporary style brilliantly but they're also waterproof so you guys and gals\nYou don't have to change your shoes and in climate weather and I should tell you how comfortable they are not only fashioned style right but the comfortably where the where if you go\nI could tell you the science of contemporary yet there's a classic feel to them they're easy to wear their elegant yet that for every day high quality and low maintenance the true foundation of timeless wardrobe something you could wear every day and not worry about it\nI could tell you is foot where that is made for discerning men and women who make bold moves and want to look their best without sacrificing fashion or comfort\nYou should explore the latest collection is awkward Talia dot com\nI could tell you has amazing styles beautiful fabrics beautiful silhouettes\nYou should really look for them you can find an explorer I could tell his latest collection adequate tell you a dot com\nOr visit the flagship store at Nineteen sixty five Madison Avenue in Manhattan aqua tell you a Q. U. A. T. A. L. I. S. where ever the weather goes they will take you made in Italy and waterproof the best combination\nWelcome back only [laughter] here's your house marked whatever [noise]\n\nUm [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know this is mark wherever I was thinking about a lot tonight that has to do with the party in the company line what do you say we think about [noise] I'll tell you what I've been\nThinking about I wanted to talk about the company line for brands\nAnd that I Would talk to you about tonight thought about Calvin Klein great advertising right now great product thought about leaving tone my former home thought about the or because they have a lot going on I even thought about Nike\nBut I'm going to surprise you\nI Want to talk about Dunkin' Donuts because they were in the news this week Dunkin' Donuts is changing their name hey let's hear Dunkin' Donuts commercials\nTo make them that income donuts are only fresh [noise] may make them at least twice a day to make the [noise] it's like a supermarket [noise] tied to make it down [noise]\nSoda doughnuts and doughnuts [noise] think about how important donut started Dunkin' Donuts so important that Dunkin' Donuts just change their name to Dunkin\nCrazy right I think that is the worst decision I've ever heard let's talk about it caught my attention I thought it was worthy of talking about it considering we talked about brands Duncan\nI don't drink coffee in fact\nHe is an interesting thing that most people will never be able to say I never even tasted\nCoffee but I'm told that Dunkin' Donuts has great coffee and therefore\nThe name Duncan I suppose Dunkin' Donuts stock is performing very well that particularly strong in the restaurant sector compared to all the competitors now why\nThey streamline their product offerings stores easy and and again the gate and walk through in the environment in and out quickly lots of advertising value pricing it always works giving the consumer\nLower prices and they have great tasting doughnuts and great coffee however thinking the company line you know donuts don't ever forget the company\nIs all in its name and then name over the door now is no longer going to be Dunkin' Donuts it don't get to\nEmphasize the coffee and downplay who they are\nThere a new company line in that store Duncan\nNow let's not talk Duncan any more about the fried dough round things we make infused with sugar so fattening you can pay some right on your hips your thighs or you know what\nLet's forget we're helping America become obese where Duncan now the new company line I think it may work\nPS did anybody even notice that nobody's talking about Christie cream anymore mean crispy cream\nOh yeah that's very cool crispy cream is the one that Governor Chris Christie graded is that true now but that's the funny thing I made a well\nApparently donuts do work anymore and for good reason but I was fascinated by the fact that Duncan changed their name and ... subject of company lied or the party line nothing angers me more than the company line when it's a load of bologna the spin\nSpin when it comes to the companies and talk about JC penny\nJC penny is in trouble one of the world's largest greatest long standing retailers may not make it\nTheir value is down by Ninety five percent I Want to tell you about JC penny because they know a lot about it I'll never forget I was a young man being told them going into my first JC penny meeting in New York mark this is a very very important to count to us we do a hundred million dollars with them\nWow that's a lot of business yeah they're unimportant again\nSo when it's in a meeting I Will never forget the guy's heading up the meeting wanted to make a point and he said hello guys I wanted to start with a story about JC penny that's actually John Cash penny\nThe founder of the company and it turned out to be a remarkable story\nAnd he said as folklore with a habit\nWhen John Cash penny interviewed someone for an important job and his company it took them to lunch\nWhile you might ask during lunch she would observe them and when they ordered the food and the food came to the table he watched\nAnd if someone would sold their food\nBefore they tasted it he wouldn't hire them\nBecause he felt they prejudged the food and he didn't want executives pre judging the decisions that needed to be made he wanted thoughtful well thought out people\nThat's the way the meeting began and then of course he said that's the way we want to be with you we want to make sure that you understand the kind of company we are\nJC penny in the early days was one of the first direct to consumer retailers they were on the Internet before there was an intimate it was called a catalog\nBefore rented it catalogs with the way more people marketed directly to consumers\nYou would send a book out with pictures in items to their home\nDetermine what if anything they want it to purchase make a phone call to the company tell them what they wanted to buy give them the credit card and the merchandise we'd be shipped to the home it wasn't the Internet but they were there one of the first catalog sushi penny business was a billion dollars\nJC penny was a remarkable retailer we did business with everyone", "show_name": "The Drive at 5 with Curtis Sliwa", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "14"}
