here's the problem and this is really a problem with with President Obama is going to see that\nRepeated throughout his speech that he gave yesterday in Nevada everything he accuses the right of doing he actually did well he was in office so this is just nonsense and when the president says that you're not supposed to activate executive agencies to target political opponents that's exactly what his eye arrested his iris targeted conservative Bible one see three pro Israel five on the three's\nThe evidence was extraordinarily salad in that case that the OJ didn't do a serious investigation or did they prosecute anybody when the president says that President Trump is doing all the stuff and Obama says that Trump is doing all that stuff\nJust remember President Trump is a reaction to President Obama and the more you look at American history and history in general what you really do see\nIs that the the the\nOf the human being is to swing from side to side that we react to things that happened in our life and we usually overreact to things that happened in our life so we'll react to President Bush by putting in presidents Obama and react to President Obama by putting and President Trump that depend on in order for it to to start swinging less wildly it takes a force of collective\nWill it takes all of us saying to each other we're not going to allow\nThis pendulum swing quite as wildly as it has been in the past\nIf you were the ... between the president sees right now I Would say that if you look back\nIn the Nineteen sixties like the difference between say LBJ and Richard Nixon on policy\nWhile you were looking at was that was a ... that was semi major but not in orbit or the the the the swing of the pendulum was not quite as far as the same thing is true with Eisenhower JFK this one of the pendulum was not quite that far if you look at how far the pendulum is swinging now it's almost a hundred and eighty degrees and the pendulum is swinging wildly side to side\nAnd that's dangerous for the country because eventually the pendulum is going to swing over the bar and things are going to get really insane\nPresident Obama did not help that did this this revisionist history where President Obama was a great piece Springer\nThis this this religion is history where President Obama did not create conflict inside the United states where he was a unifying figure as opposed to a polarizing figure that is just a why when he was elected maybe he was a unifying figure for five minutes and then he proceeded to govern as an extraordinarily far left die\nAnd then he also proceeded to polarized the country along ethnic racial and sexual on\nIt's a real ... it's just it's obvious that he's doing he trusts\nRight into in jeopardy and now President Trump is trolling the left into insanity this is all reactionary so there's presidents I buy my again he's such a for all your subject for when people accused President Trump for being it for all I'd like to remind folks the first presidential parole with Rocco bottom here's President Obama throwing people in Nevada yesterday saying that\nHe was very committed to the truth is president of the United states\nHere you're just one simple thing this is I say this is Matt I'm just\nOn a large sum actually trying to say that [noise]\n\nI Believe in a ...\nOkay that is just a why he did not believe in a fact based reality a fact that all that is just not true and he says and he didn't lie he didn't like to them like some people\nReally how about if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor how about if the president is the president doesn't have authority to breath executive amnesty how 'bout those men died in ... because of a Youtube video how\nAbout the Iran deal is being pursued because we knew moderate policy\nPush by the New Iranian moderate administration\nThe president wide every five seconds Brock Obama was congenital wire while he was in office when he was replaced by a guy who doesn't have tremendous regard for the truth either get reaction in American politics\nIs is almost completely proportionate\nRocco bottle was very far left and Donald Trump is his ... house mirror image and when ... says things like he tries to say backing Donald Trump just those out there ... all the time it's just not true I like when he says that he's based on that he's based and back then the president of the United states who took title nine\nOf the civil rights act which said you're not allowed to discriminate against women\nAnd tried to apply that to men who believe they are women saying that this was somehow back base ... almost nothing the rock Obama did was that\nBased almost nothing and it was ... and this is why so many people reacted to drop a bomb and they said listen if that's still mattered less well maybe they don't ... either all the matter is now is victory because that was the mentality of less mentality of left with a slender and George W. Bush is a war criminal was fully justified\nIn order to get the rock Obama elected Leonard and John McCain as George W. Bush part three was totally fine as long as it got rock Obama elected\nIt's winter and Mitt Romney as a dog killing evil genius who gave women cancer specifically so that he could fire their husbands or that and\nThat was totally fine so long as you want that Harry Reid was fine and saying that Mitt Romney didn't pay his taxes because after all they want\nThat stuff does not spring from nowhere in American politics evil in American politics the nastiness of American politics did not bring out of the ground full blown out of his head that's not the way this works rock Obama was the progenitor of Donald Trump rock Obama was the was the predictable forbearers Donald Trump in retrospect\nIf I can only give you some more of a rock Obama's propaganda but first let's talk about your impending death or life insurance is pretty important but one third of people don't have it that's because it's hard to buy in because people don't like to think about the fact that one day they're going to plot but you do need to get ready for that eventuality just in case\nHealthy genius and do this for you they compare quotes from the top life insurance companies and they find the best policy for you it takes just two minutes to get a quote if you don't have the first thing about insurance they've got all the tools to get your speed learned the difference between term and whole life insurance calculate how much coverage you need to be sure you're making the right decision in fact\nOver four million people have used policy genius to shop for insurance policy genius doesn't just make life insurance easy they also put their disability insurance and home insurance and auto insurance if you care about it they can cover it so what do you know a lot about life insurance or nothing at all start you're searching policy genius dot com and just to mention compare those costs\nAnd make an informed decision for you and your loved ones again there is no reason they should leave your loved ones wrapped if God Forbid something should happen to you and life insurance is one of those things that you can buy and then forget about until God Forbid you actually need it go check it out right now policy genius dot com policy junior the easy way to compare and by life insurance so\nRock Obama is a great reminder is why Donald Trump is president\nAnd then he tried to take credit in Nevada last night for the way the economy is growing now let's be clear the stock market did climate or Brock Obama because it felt to all time lows under Rocco but I'm also or you'll recall that the economy collapsed in late two thousand eight right before the election that wasn't on Obama and then it continued to collapse until early two thousand nine\nAnd then it started to recover and then we had the slowest peacetime recovery in American history\nI'm old enough to remember when folks were saying things like\nA four percent GDP Growth rate is no longer possible for the United states and now we have had that for a couple of hours in a row and I'm old enough to remember when people said the manufacturing sector in the United states was doomed to failure\nThat obviously is not true when folks were saying that the stock market was going to talk about where Obama left it that obviously was not for the job creation was going to talk about that obviously was not true there's no question the economy is growing faster under Donald Trump and it was under ... dominated super heated\nUnder Donald Trump in a way that it was not under ... get very very slow recovery under Obama and whatever recovery\nIs due to Obama you really can only attribute for the first couple of years because after that it was the Republicans dining every budget that Obama tried to propose a volunteer for one budget in eight years Republicans rejected every budget proposal Brock Obama ever made and yet here's rock Obama\nSaying that if anybody gets credit for the economy it to him now listen I'm I'm never a fan of crediting the president with the economy I just don't I I think the economy it's too complicated for that I usually think that it has more to do with a predictable policy emanating from the halls of Congress the fact\nIs that since Republicans were elected in two thousand ten we've had a consistent rate of growth in the United states economy accelerating when they didn't have to battle it out with rock Obama regulatory policy if you actually want to attribute economic growth to anyone body give the credit to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell\nAnd all the other Republicans who have been instrumental in the formation of policy under Obama end under from but here's brought them home and trying to take credit for himself\nWe did a condiment whirling or do we started the longest streak of job creation on record recovered another twenty million people on health insurance we brought housing but\nWe cut out for more than ... by making sure the wealthiest\nAmericans books like the ... the first show\nWhen he doesn't cut the deficit and half what he means by that is a he blew out the deficit in his first year and then the deficit numbers went down the next couple of years\nAnd the reason that that is cutting it happens like saying you know what I did last month last month I went ten thousand dollars over my credit card bill this month I went five thousand dollars over my credit card bill I just got my deficit and half that's what he's talking about and they're cutting the deficit and half but again\nRock Obama was the creator of the Trump phenomenon but this is the thing the Democrats really don't have a lot to offer at this point and so they're doubling down on on stupid coming off the Democrats are struggling for a message\nBut Hillary Clinton has come up with something brand new something no one's ever thought of before if this thing called federalism why Hillary Clinton bracing federal is always play this venture of [laughter]\n\nShot out the ... don't even know what I'm
