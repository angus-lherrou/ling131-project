President Trump's\nFrom job approval rating has jumped to forty seven percent according to the wall Street Journal and and became a poll that has the highest mark\nYou ever had an office in that poll is no higher than President Obama's average pull approval rating before the two thousand and elections now is worth noting that President Obama got skunk and the two thousand election but with that said President Trump has gained significant approval\nOnly forty nine percent disapproval so that's about as close to parity as Trump is ever going to get he's never going to be a fifty five percent president is just too polarizing figure\nForty seven percent for President Trump is a very good number and that is a reelection number if he gets up to forty seven percent public approval ratings he wins reelection and twenty twenty that's an improvement from September that's where the forty four percent approved and fifty two percent disapproved of his performance\nAnd then Democrats decided it would be a great idea to shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly with and they are Fifteen and now President Trump has soared and the approval ratings Democrats still do lean on the question of which party should control Congress among poll respondents identified as likely voters fifty percent prefer Democrats\nForty one percent prefer Republicans which is about the same as was in last month's hole\nBut the blue wave is now running into a rip tide of uncertainty according to some certain ... certain pollsters although Democrats are preferred and the national poll overall here's the key their advantage has vanished in the house districts that matter most\nAnd districts rated as the most competitive by the nonpartisan cook Political Report the parties are dead even on the question of which one should control Congress\nThat means that in California Democrats are really fired up in New York Democrats are really fired up in Ohio not quite as much or at least Republicans are justice fire it up as Democrats are in Ohio\nAnd last month Paul is an amazing thing in last month's Paul Democrats led by Thirteen percentage points among registered voters and six points among likely voters interest in the election has jumped among many groups that tend to favor Democrats Latinos African Americans young people more than two thirds of black hole restored high interest in the election that's up from fifty seven percent and the average of polls\nTaken from January through September but you're also seeing a massive increase a massive increase among white voters among Republican voters among older voters it's consistent so we do not know what the cases are but there is a math and gender gap in this massive gender gap\nIs again the result of two things President Trump is toxic to women and Democrats are toxic meant the gender gap is not one factor it's not that Republican ... it's not that men\nOf Republicans and love President Trump because they hate women or anything like that if the President Trump is uniquely off putting to many women particularly suburban moms and the Democrats are supremely awkward intimate and this is why you're seeing the polls close\nThe gender gap that has actually opened up wide in the last month is not between women and kind of a normal electric in men in the normal electorate men are now favoring Republicans in heavy numbers this poll found Democrats with a lopsided advantage among female voters\nFor the second month in a row women in the survey say they prefer a Democrat controlled Congress by twenty five percentage points fifty seven thirty to which they massive yeah\nMale voters however what Republicans to lead Congress by fourteen point margin fifty two percent Republican thirty eight percent Democrats in competitive swing districts are mostly in suburban areas urban voters favor a democratic controlled Congress by thirty six percent margin rural voters they were the GOP by thirty one voice\nAmong suburban residents the parties are virtually tied\nForty four percent favorite GOP control forty five percent favor a Democratic Congress now why because voters continue to trust the Republicans on the economy on trade issues Republicans are preferred by Seventeen point margin that's up from eight percent in August\nIssue has been in the spotlight because President Trump was actually able to closing after deals all of the talk about terrorists in trade wars\nBut it's basically receded into the background so all of its is good news for ... does that mean Republicans hold the house is still more unlikely they're not bought\nThis upsurge is is pretty amazing stuff for Republicans in the lead up to image from election\nAnd again a lot of that has to do with the fact that the Democrats are just terrible at everything written they're terrible at everything I mean they're completely off putting on the most basic basic issues and that's what we are seeing none of the story of today's politics is is how off putting the Democrats are and Mitch McConnell for example\nLike cocaine Mitch as we're fond of calling it OK Mitch was eating at a restaurant who's confronted by protesters if this thing becomes consistent is not good for the country and it is certainly not good for the Democratic party which seems to be embracing it in a way the Republican Party is not Nancy Pelosi was also confronted over the weekend and protesters shouted it hurt\nThe differences high level Republicans condemned that\nI Love all Democrats are not doing a great job of condemning what's going on here look at these protesters confront cocaine mission Elaine Chao they're eating at a restaurant\nAnd I mean frankly there just lucky that cocaine Michigan go ballistic on them and tell them to say hello to his little friends many I don't know why you'd want to go up against ... they will ... out your eyes and seniors the ravens but this is what these protesters decided to do [laughter]\n\nAnd all the papers I get the hell outta here nobody likes you leave\nAnd this is why it's so funny I I've been asked before if anybody has ever confronted me at a restaurant or tried to make trouble the restaurant and like no I ... was one of my friends are you coming to a kosher restaurant and you tried to confront me these are all my buddies much security or the Jew crew and it's a real real fight you off\nBut cocaine meth basically has that in Kentucky as well so he just activated\nHis his goons to basically buy back and get these guys by sitting there\nThe cool collected turtle got all of it and meanwhile\nDemocrats determined to show that they are just as ... as you think they are in other ways as well they've decided that they don't work is most important person on planet earth is deeply important why they decided they don't ... I have no idea they're trying to say that you sort of like rock Obama except without half the charm or the racial appeal but\nThey're still trying to manufacture this this kind of quasi enthusiasm for me to or\nA ... there was a report from ABC News that really fond over him last night but the best stuff the best stuff from these campaigns and it was true for President Trump and it's the thing I despise most about politics generally is for Obama and Trump\nAnybody who has any level of political notoriety has a certain number of bands are completely crazy\nAnd those fans you completely crazy

borders\nPresident Trump is a great so President Trump has responded to this rolling caravan of migrants that have left Latin America that are moving up through Mexico letting in Central America and moving up in Mexico and toward the United states border\nHe has responded I think properly by pointing out a couple of things one we need more security to the countries that are allowing them to do this\nOr doing so with the intent of creating a pressure situation on our southern border\nWhy should we continue funding governments that are going to continue creating the situation if the hunter and government is going to allow folks to simply walk over the border to Mexico with the intention of going from the United states why exactly would we be funding that government same thing is true of the Mexican government and things for the Salvadoran government there is no reason for us to back\nGovernments that are going to create pressures on our southern border without actively working with us on the immigration issue president from his efforts are being made stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border people have\nTo apply for asylum in Mexico first and if they fail to do that the U.S will turn them away\nThe courts are asking us to do things that are not doable that's correct that's correct we do have procedures one of the problems here is that you can actually show up at a point to that for and you can apply for asylum that's a legal way to do that that's not what these caravans are doing some of these ... are simply finding places that are open in the United states for and crossing their\nFrom says the ... the Democrat Party\nChanged the immigration laws now now I'm not sure what immigration laws he wants to change the typically we actually just have to enforce the laws that are already on the books are not allowed to illegally enter the country we are allowed to deport people we can streamline that process maybe those laws and want change but it is true that the Democratic party has been\nUsing the immigration issue as a club against Republicans suggesting the Republicans don't care about Latino votes\nBecause they want to defend America's forests that argument isn't working very well with typically because a lot of Latinos in the United states are also interested in living in a country with border they're not interested\nIn living in the country or anyone can go and calm as they eat that one of the great lies in the media is that everyone agrees with an open borders agenda virtually no one in the United
