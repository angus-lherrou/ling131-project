screaming because those two women were not just ordinary women walked in off the street and these were these they meant to do this they were paid\nOperatives doing this but flake just collapsed and he said All right well you know that the Democrats have been trying to do everything they can to delay the vote just because they want to get to the midterms they hope they can take back the Senate they hope they can keep Trump from having any more Supreme Court picks or anything if they get the Senate they'll stop them from doing anything\nSo he caves in he says All right we've got to have an FBI investigation FBI investigations nonsense that doesn't mean anything\nThe most telling clue that the FBI investigation doesn't mean anything was an article in the op ed written by your old friends James call me in the New York times former newspaper former head of the FBI and a former newspaper\nWriting a an op ed that says the FBI can do this and he starts out with this long self serving paragraph about how impartial he is\nPeople kept calling impartial people kept saying that he was for the Democrats and not for the Republicans the rest of the op ed is an attack on the Republicans he says we live in a world where the president routinely attacks the FBI because he fears it's work\nHe calls for his enemies to be prosecuted and his friend was free and we live in a world where the president is accused cereal abuser women who was caught on tape bragging about his ability to assault limits\nThat by the way is not true he was caught on tape saying that women would allow you to do things if you were a celebrity as an assault as women allow that's why I I think that's why when it got so angry at\nMost disturbingly we live in a world where millions of Republicans in their representatives think everything I just said is okay so he hates the Republicans and he says the FBI's up for this it's not as hard as Republicans hope it will be Republicans hope they can't find the truth stories already telling you what he thinks he's already telling you what he thinks the FBI is going to find\nThis is a shameful disgraceful thing for a former Trump with show right the fire this

says I saw a murder and I saw this I saw Mr ax murder mystery why and they said did you lie on your resume in Nineteen eighty two\nGuesses yeah it was that they needed a job she well if you live then you would lie now so everything he says is wrong it it is not true it is not true that ... the time doesn't affect memory time does all kinds of crazy things with memory\nTen minutes can affect your memory and make you think you saw something that you didn't see it it really turned out to be\nIntellectual but this guy the guy who just uses his pretense of honor and dignity to uh to bully other people meanwhile Rachel Mitchell the prosecutor that the Republicans brought into question\nAh Christine Blasey Ford sheen gave a report for the Republicans they brought her in to get the truth they didn't bring her and she didn't say this in public they brought her into get at the truth\nAnd she said I'm of Christine Blasey Ford said she said remember this is a woman train in prosecuting mean you sexual cases\nHe said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove that this case is ... ... even weaker than that Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the bed and those witnesses either refuted her allegations will fail to corroborate them for the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case\nBased on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard which means you don't even have to prove beyond a shadow of the doubt and you just have to bring a lot of evidence\nDoesn't matter Jeff Flake caves lesson to Jeff like listen to what the women say Jeff Flake gets into the elevator and these women across and listen to what they say\nYou know [laughter]\n[laughter]\nSo what is what is just Brett Kavanaugh will have to do with this woman why is Jeff Flake telling this woman anything about herself\nShe's saying I was assaulted and therefore if you let somebody else who's been accused of assault and apparently according to the prosecutor number incredibly who's been accused of ... you were saying something about me and this is the left wing why not just so you know that was Anna Maria ... Maggie Gallagher the two women\nAnd according to John ... who is an excellent reporter ... or ... is an executive director of the center for popular democracy\nShe spent the previous week in Washington engagement protest against Kavanaugh\nShe's a Gallagher is uh twenty three year old activist with the group the center is a left wing group and his heavily funded by yes who George Soros and these are short roast operatives doing what Soros wants them to do and I mean I think that that's important to know it's an actor and what's the tactic\nThat tactic is to make Brett Kavanaugh the symbol of all rape is not an individual accused of a certain crime more buttoned just a second the\nFirst you know this radio show is just one small planet and the ... bureau universe you want to hear more you should head over to daily wire dot com we can catch up on any of them shows you've missed or listen to me on the Andrew claim ensured that wall or even Michael mold\nYou can listen to every past episode of all for daily wire podcast and if you become a subscriber you get access to video burns them all episodes as well you can soak up bands political inside or my own satirical destruction of left wing culture or Walsh his religious steak or whatever it is knows is doing\nThe entire daily work team has it's been gr on the pulse of politics and culture and we'll keep you up to date on the most important stories of the day and hey if the death of western civilization is getting a down there were specially want to listen to the Andrew claiming show to find out why it's all much more hilarious and the new thing\nDon't wait any longer it over to daily ... dot com and become a subscriber for lousy nine Ninety nine a month or a lousy Ninety nine bucks a year you get all episodes of the bench of heroes show Andrew claiming show not Walsh show and Michael Moore show daily wire dot com\nSo the whole point here is to make Brett Kavanaugh a symbol of all rapist instead of the person\nThat he is and and she went on TV this woman Anna Anna Maria\nOr who confront them she went on the the unreal dealer she went on TV and listen to what you said\nWe have a culture that fundamentally doubt women and every respect\nOur ability to lead ... to a ... to exercise power our ability to control our bodies that common or represents that he represents a culture that's fundamentally does not believe that women are equal and that's why he's so dangerous\nAnd she has expressed that his actions as a young boy actions that he's willing to take responsibility for\nHow he has expressed that in his politics I think he's dangerous to their country and not just because he's accused\nOf with very credible allegations of hiding violated several women I met him he ah as also dangers because\nThere were some justice as about recognizing when harm happens taken responsibility for that harm and beginning to repair it she's not able to do that in his own life he should not be sitting in the highest court in Atlanta\nSo now Kevin represents the entire culture not compare that to what Kellyanne Conway said the Jake Tapper as they've covering this because she said she was a victim of sexual assault and listen to her conclusion\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment and rate\nThat [noise]\nI ...
