the name of terrorists or measures on the program I don't want to give them any sort of Lori this mass shooter used a little known social network this new hatred towards you as they call them the children of Satan as he showed off his family of firearms you know facing death penalty after unleashing the guns on worshippers at the tree of life synagogue\nHe was particularly upset about a non ... a Jewish nonprofit providing aid refugees or the Jewish nonprofit is a is called highest and he tweeted highest likes to bringing invaders they kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics\nI'm going in those last week that he sent before he went and murdered a bunch of Jews most of them over the age of fifty including a Holocaust survivor he\nAlso had a particular dislike for President Trump he just met President Trump as a global less rather than as a national if he said there is no matter as long as there is a hike infestation and they use the word here because I think it's imperative to know languished at these these monsters use\nEvil evil people so\nThat the media take on all of that has I think\nQuite simplistic and foolish or they have of course and said that President Trump is responsible for everything President Trump is responsible for the shooting specifically because President Trump and two thousand sixteen thousand Seventeen winter not at the alt right\nNow I was highly critical of President Trump or doing that I Am highly critical of president from for doing that I was the number one target of All right anti Semitism on line two thousand sixteen with bullet was not close\nForty percent ... anti Semitic tweets by the alt right into thousands of humor directed at me personally as I'm well acquainted with the folks that President Trump pointed not at this guy was not right it was a white supremacist there is a slight difference is not a member of the modern alt right movement which is discussing an evil and anti Semitic enough itself\nBut he is a white supremacist with with a longer standing path because this is a complex topic going to try to parse it when it tried to part that's because they bunch of things can be through all at once\nNumber one just I said last week with regard to the attempted bombing against democratic targets as I said that you cannot connect it politicians rhetoric so violent action on the politician actually\nCalls for the violent action President Trump has engaged\nAnd nothing even remotely approaching incitement against you know one can him a single comment that he's ever made that looks like incitement against Jews in fact as president of the United states has been extraordinarily pro Israel and pro Jewish and the president's comment in response to this particular anti Semitic attacks\nWere far stronger than his predecessors responses to similar anti Semitic attacks for example here's what the president of the United states had to say in the effort this clip Fifteen is what the president had to say in the aftermath of the attack\nThe scores of anti Semitism cannot be ignored cannot be tolerated and it can not be allowed to continue with general our chickens and [noise]\nIt must be confronted and you're damned everywhere it rears its very ugly head we roasted with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat and ... and very where's the forces of have that's what it is\nOkay so his his statements that anti Semitism must be eradicated\nIt was a far stronger statement the rock Obama sweet to here's a ... and I want to say the contrast between this because\nAgain if we're going to talk about standing with the Jews\nAnd we have to talk about who's response to this attack was actually a better President Trump's that it was better than Obama's ear was Obama's response on Twitter we agree for the Americans murdered in Pittsburgh all of us have to fight the rise in anti Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those look lover pray differently and we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocence get their hands on a gun\nPresident Trump took on anti Semitism wipe one\nIs an anti Semitism is evil and must be eradicated\nHe didn't try to liken it to hatred against any other group you didn't try to make about gun control ... both of those things\nThe west has a tendency to obscure anti Semitism with a broad brush 'em bigotry simply saying the anti Semitism is like any other hatred it is not like any other hatred every hatred has its own diagnosis\nEvery hatred has do symptoms anti black racism is not the same as anti white racism anti black racism is not the same thing as anti Semitism\nAnti L G Beatty homophobia is not the same thing as anti Semitism rock Obama simply wants to push a progressive agenda and so he lumps in anti Semitism with all other forms of hatred and it's inaccurate and that is true and it does have some consequences when it comes to policy now let's go through some of the elements here that I think are important personal as I say\nPresident Trump and two thousand sixteen thousand Seventeen did wink and not be All right\nOkay again I've said there's a thousand times I wrote editorials about it I was for nearly vocal about it from his willingness to condemn David Duke on CNN does unwillingness to condemn all like a tax on July ... D GQ journalist will get you on a second to bringing on Steve Bannon who called himself the progenitor of the Web site\nThat was it became a gathering place for the alt right president from winter not and as I Know this because I think in the target of the alt right from statements in the aftermath\nCharlottesville providing aid and comfort to white supremacist I don't see any way around that\nBy Trump is not a white supremacist and he is not an anti Semite\nYeah they pathological aversion to criticizing anyone who says anything nice about him point number two is a bunch of things that are true at the same time and if you want to understand what's going on we need to recognize that point number two white supremacist them is not All right mad that they are not the same category of people white supremacist long predated President Trump they're not a new development\nThose people were going to shoot Jews regardless of what anybody had said they had been shooting Jews since long before I was born in Nineteen Ninety nine as I mentioned it white supremacist shut up our local Jaycee said that same year six Orthodox Jews were shot in Chicago along with a black man and several Asians by white supremacists the sort of stuff has been happening\nVery very long time has nothing to do with President Trump third president from his separated from the ... right and dramatic way to say that President Trump is still associated with the alt right in the ignorance of President Trump's administration or what he has done the alt right is enraged with him if you go look at Richard Spencer if you go look at at some of the other members of the alt right they're angry at him\nThey believe that he has been hijacked by the global is in the same way that the shooter about that President Trump was standing up too much for the hikes and so that is the way that that that that is just a basic truth\nPresident Trump has been extraordinarily pro Jewish and pro Israel in his actual presidency that as a basic foundational than if you fail to acknowledge it you're lying by omission in a second I'm gonna get to a few more points we have to keep in mind that we'll get to the media's response which again I think is simplistic despicable and partisan\nBut first let's talk about your underwear so do you follow this year as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect her underwear now is the

write up on ya that Tommy John dot com you've probably been for twenty percent off\nOr get a few more points that we have to keep in mind with regard to the shooting in Pennsylvania and what it has to do with President Trump which is to say very little president from say\nHad separated from the alt right in dramatic way so the first three point that I've made here President Trump did wake and not be All right for two years to white supremacist I'm not the same about right now I got three\nPresident Trump has separated from the ... right in dramatic way than they are pissed at him over it and that is true the shooter too with anti Trump pork if we're going to talk about how flirting with anti Semite and anti Semitic rhetoric\nAnd it's making things let's say for Jews and look to actually talk about that who do you think has made the world let's say for Jews President Trump and his winking and nodding at the alt right or left which mainstream was Farrah Khan which mainstream when this our store which mainstream media movement which mainstream wildly anti Israel and anti Semitic policies\nWhich one do you think is more damaging to Jews all across the world and in the United states do you think the party that might have removed in Jerusalem tried to remove Jerusalem and twenty twelve from their platform or is it the party that move us embassy to Jerusalem in Israel you'd think that it's the party standing up religious freedom or do you think that it's the party looking to obliterate a religious freedom\nIn the name of so called anti discrimination you think that if the party that main line Keith Ellison and tries to make and head of the DNC after he uses in ... years\nBack in ... or do you think that it might be the party that opposes that mainstream members in the Democratic party\nRoutinely hobnobbing with anti Semite he for the Jewish community really for for Jews really care about being Jewish there's not a ... of difference between a Jew being murder for being a Jew in Jerusalem a Jew being more for for being Jewish in France or dripping murder for being Jewish and Pittsburgh\nIt's all of the peace is ever going to talk about anti Semitic rhetoric and who's to blame for rising Jewish that the world over a rise in hate crimes world over the lead to actually talk about I don't think alike wants to talk about that I think what they want to partisan hackers are many are happy\nTo talk about President Trump winking and nodding at the alt right in\nTwo thousand sixteen two thousand Seventeen they're significantly less apt to look at themselves and

media stuff like that he said he said there's great anger in our country cause in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting on the news the fake news media that fruit enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and reported accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame I agree with President Trump that the media are doing a terrible job and they're lying
