just so much about what good nutrition means and what it could mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today\nThank you it's great to be here thank you

as a result of the shooting incidents [noise] there were no children were additionally six centuries to include for the police officers that does not include the suspect\nIs good news interestingly enough it shows a little bit of a mixed picture geographically but we can get into that it seems that the consumers um have shown continued interest in purchasing homes that's the bottom line of of this figure and a contract hunting is obviously reflect that\nYou make a really good point George because there are a lot of challenges for buyers out there there are many homes for sale and prices are on the rise and sore and mortgage interest rates so the buyers who are putting their signature on offers must be really determined to get a house\nYou're absolutely right or based on on the latest the clothes sales figures which we released this past week\nObviously sales are declining to go to a point a lot of that was driven by shortage of inventory the head when as you clearly stated come from prices which in September ... up a four point two percent year over here a mortgage rates which now practically at five percent\nAnd worth reminding listeners that if if the basis point increase of four\nPoint five to five percent mortgage rate doesn't sound like much but it translates to about a hundred and twenty five to a hundred and thirty extra dollars a month to a to a mortgage payments which for a lot of buyers\nIs a significant increase so with all due to fight the buyers are still active in the market and indeed put pen to paper you know ... or or or digital\nAnd during September indicates that the buyers remained determined to ah to look at at home buying as a valid housing options\nAbsolutely and George as you said the biggest challenge of all is the lack of homes for sale but we understand there are signs that there are more homes coming on the market can you tell us about that\nLooking at a home a permits though building permits new home construction we've seen an increase in that activity\nEven do a lot of builders are themselves facing headwinds both in terms of of um labor costs so there are contending with a shortage of labor also materials cough cough the timber cost of a lot of of input into the construction process\nBut we've seen an increase in that during the day here my only concern and going into the the colder months traditionally has been with winter weather construction tends to slow down in the ...\nThe northern half of the country\nInteresting so George as you said earlier the different parts of America were wildly different in the pending home sales report can you tell us about that\nCertainly so while nationally were up half a percentage point into the picture was was quite different so the west a net the pack would a four point five percent increase in the index of of contract signings\nUm which indicated that this region um this ... um high prices still sees a lot of ... interest on a daily basis he was down seven point four percent\nOn the however obviously the region is one worth watching because it it's basically the area where we're seeing the highest home prices on where Janet expectations are walk on the the the biggest impact from increasing mortgage rates and prices\nThe Midwest was also um a showing good results up ... percent from the prior month\nIn the meantime the northeast was down to a point four percent of the south down one point four percent from August it's worth remembering that in the south we obviously had Hurricane Florence this here uh which impacted the Carolinas we also had Hurricane Irma\nLast year um which it shows\nA little bit so the year over year for the south or seeing a three point three percent increase which showed that even with a strong impact of Hurricane Florence was nothing like that left in the wake of Hurricane Irma so or the south obviously while down on a monthly basis still looks much better than a year ago\nI see well George many times you've been on the show this year and we've talked about a decline in pending home sales and even though the increase in this time was just half a percentage point off is up\nYou're absolutely right that and it's worth pointing that out because there's a lot of concern broadly speaking and and the economy about the impact on housing or from some of the factors we touched upon in our conversation\nThe inkling being that a lot of consumers are getting up and the truth is that we have a strong employment we have a wages which even want adjusted for inflation are beginning to take up enough that the fed is concerned about inflation\nSo with this as as a background it it's worth noting that consumers still remain very much interested in purchasing a home which broadly speaking still a means that for the remainder of the year we can expect a healthy market\nExcellent well George I really appreciate you coming on the show today and talking about the latest pending home sales reports from any are thank you\nThank you Steve and always a pleasure talking with you\nYou're very welcome George or to the director of housing and commercial research at the national association of realtors

thanks bill [noise]\nContinuing our with our special show scary thing our annual treat for you\nAs we observe Halloween all throughout today's show we're looking at things that terrified people when it comes to real estate but we're here to tell you that once you understand them those things aren't scary at all in right now here's a really big one the down payment\nThe idea of coming up with twenty percent for a house since ... some people running for cover but let's take a closer look at that because that down payment might be less than you think and you might have help getting\nLet's talk about all of that now with the pro joining us is Rob ... with the organization down payment resource Rob launched a down payment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties were hard to find downpayment programs Rob welcome to real estate today\nThat gets David it's great to be with you again\nWe are so glad you're here so Rob let's begin with your organization down payment resource state by state guide to programs that are out there to help homebuyers come up with the down payment can you tell us about that\nSure they don't pay that resource is a database of programs all across the country over twenty five hundred programs to help people whether it's with down aim at closing cost and other ways to make a home more affordable\nRob I understand that you have some new research to share with us today about two days potential homebuyers\nThe Urban Institute has released its barriers to homeownership report that found Twenty one million people under the age of forty are ready and able to get a mortgage can you tell us about that new research\nYeah it's very exciting save it and we heard that too is just a great job and were were pleased to a partner for the second year in a row and every teamed up with Bernie Mac to um to support this study\nThese Twenty one billion renters under forty years of age our mortgage ready but what's even more\nCompelling is that about eighty eight percent\nOf those are roughly Eighteen million are all a mortgage ready but they have the income to afford a median price home where they live but Eighteen million people are getting ready and Ken and have the income to buy a home in their area\nAnd you know when you think about it that's three times as many homes as are sold every year that's a lot of people\nThat is a lot of people and so Rob what does the data say about why they're not going forward with a ... purchase\nA single word Steven it's this perception I think that with a down payment is always the most challenging part of getting home ownership in this case the data tells a story and the story is that\nBecause of ranchers misperceptions about how much they need for a down payment they actually are making it worse than it is for example this research shows that about sixty five percent of these were editor think that they need at least\nFifteen Percent or more down to this report also showed that it made in down payment\nFor first time homebuyer it's five percent so right there you could say there's a big gap between what people think and what reality is\nIf you could tell potential homebuyers across the country the truth about down payments what would it be Rob\nDon't give up on homeownership just yet there is hell out of there and you might find they can eat Fifteen Percent out and you can get in for an average by that it really is a day long three at ... percent\nRight there you may be ready to buy on even though you thought your work and you can get it to 'em for as little as three percent down a conventional loan strip banning gay or straight act\nThat is awesome Rob and so the thing that you bring to the table that is so valuable\nTo homebuyers all across the country is that where ever you live in America chances are there's a down payment assistance program right in your area\nAnd people don't know about and that's where a down payment resource does he tells people look here and you might find money for your down payment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Drive at 5 with Curtis Sliwa", "city": "New York", "day": "27"}
