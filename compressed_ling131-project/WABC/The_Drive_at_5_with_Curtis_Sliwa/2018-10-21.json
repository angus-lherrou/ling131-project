easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take and it gives people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottle today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing has become a very big these days so if you're doing something like that the jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDump it right into your juice dumping pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it

we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers call this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula the product we are talking about right now the ever strong powder so\nDouble blind placebo controlled studies thirty golfers took the ever strong powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our original powder for one month in

I. P. rank has its privileges that's what I'm choosing to talk about tonight tonight will be a full look at the privilege and responsibility of success speaking of rank having its privileges\nThe ranking lawyer millennial and co host of always in fashion Jesse Weber Jesse speaking of success and responsibility what are you got to think about this one\nAnd listening to this that I actually thought about me as a lawyer and how hard it was for me to get to become a lawyer to become an attorney law school was very challenging three years of law school studying nonstop and just at the end of it you think it's the conclusion of studying\nAnd then you remember you have to take the bar exam which is where you shut off from society for two and a half months you don't see anybody you don't talk to anybody you just in the library studying and it all culminate on one exam that determines really the fate of whether or not you will become a lawyer so it's a lot of responsibility\nSo you're happy you did all of that I Love the title so there are a lot of people who are not\nSo happy with the legal profession they get kind of bird doubt they have their own problems that title is what I really love the rank of attorney I Love that because when you start a conversation and say hey I'm an attorney oh oh excuse me it gives people pause\nYou I'm very proud of you that you don't have this attorney title I'm very proud of you starting your career and looks nice but while we're on the subject of rank and having his privileges which is the theme of Tonight Show\nI have been told that you out there need to know who your host is and it's been quite some time since we talked about how I got to where I got who is Marc Weber [laughter] very good you know the whole thing then\nWho is Marc Weber is a self made this issue is that it is here to help you find your success I could keep doing it but\n[laughter] it's great [laughter] you know what really upsets me and that's when I got to thinking about this subject when you hear of politicians talking about hard working Americans what they want to do for the hard working Americans and I can tell you and I can promise you\nThey're not talking about me you see Americans\nCreating some kind of class system right now when someone like me who started working at fourteen years old and never stopped since this isn't a hardworking American because I'm successful and that's why I'm not apologizing at all if I'm not a hardworking American\nThan who is it bothers me that I'm segregated\nFrom hard working Americans because some successful um\nBad guy idle deserve a break\nI pay more taxes than you can possibly imagine and even if I didn't just think of this thirty nine percent federal tax eight and a half percent state tax psycho Medicare real estate taxes town taxes and everything I purchase of the money left over this tax food gas closed\nEven the interest for my savings that I've saved this tax I've never been in the cash business I've always been a salaried employee so I have nowhere to hide what comes in gets taxed I don't get money hadn't on things I pay taxes\nI get a bonus check I'll tell you I got a bonus check when I was with Elvie image an amazing check for a job well then I took a company that never made profit and I made the extraordinary profits and I got a great bonus check when I saw what they took out a tax is\nNow my office at the time for this particular division they lose the corner office on the Eighteenth floor surrounded in windows that opened it was an older building I opened the windows after receiving the bonus check and seeing the taxes and screamed\nOut I Hope you're happy out there because I just paid for all of you to do whatever you're doing\nAnd then somebody down ... thanks [laughter] nobody said anything to the point is in today's environment\nSome politicians are trying to create a class war that's because they have no class and they have no shame I Am not appreciated as hard working Americans but yet I I'm not ashamed of my success I did it the old fashioned way I earned it\nHowever I Do recognize that with success comes responsibility\nAnd more importantly as we talk tonight we have to understand the business and careers in this show has to be precise when we discuss it if you are in a position of rank which has all the privileges you also have power and with that power comes responsibility [noise]\nYes with great power comes great responsibility Spiderman those who do you any one of you out there you are responsible for the people you work for\nThis company\nHas privileges when you're successful great ones doctors get the best parking spots lawyers beat their parking tickets money buys first class seats I Believe these privileges are there for every one\nI dedicate to shoulder the premise that anyone can be successful in America it's not easy you have to want it you have to make sacrifices you have to make smart choices and you have to create the best you and forward privileges tonight the show is titled\nOr H. I. P. rank has its privileges and I'll tell you what I Am so confident and the concept for this show because in spite of the nuts in spite of the politicians and in spite of the talk of socialism and the confidence in our system\nI Believe we have a great future you know why because millennials want great futures I'm going to take a break we'll be back in a minute [noise]\nAlways fashion [laughter] [noise]\nAnd then the surgery [noise]\nFor the world of luxury shoes she was trained as a surgeon and knew that women deserve to feel comfortable in their shoes and develop shoes that were designed to make the human body comfortable\nShe partnered with design experts in tech innovation to create a collection of shoes that look beautiful and yet there were incredibly comfortable tearing rose food where it is about luxuries materials sophisticated silhouettes and comfort\nThe feature in his native comfort technology ladies you want to be comfortable in your shoes you want to be safe in your shoes but more importantly you want to look great new shoes tavern rose developed by this brilliant surgeon\nDetermine rose woman as refined and refuses to sacrifice comfort for style or for that matter style for comfort the shoes of perfect for women who think on your feet but not about their feet discovered the latest tearing roast collection at tearing rose dot com\nTearing rose luxury of comfort\nWelcome back only here's your house marked whatever [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] this is our lives in fashion we're talking success right now [noise]\nI talked to earlier and I'll talk again I'm not going to ever apologize for my success I Will never ever ever apologized for my success I work too hard to get there and yet yet there's momentum in the country right now where I Hope it's turning around\nWhere success is applauded where people want it I have faith in the future because I Know millennials want success I can tell I can see it by talking to them all the time\nThey're looking for a quick a route they want to get a quick and easy it doesn't exist waited minded if you're a Kurdish in yeah but success has its rewards it's not easy\nBut let me just summarize for you where I was before so that we could all get back on the same page\nI've had a great career I've worked hard to achieve that\nIt has brought me privileges I Will never apologize for much success I Believe in the capitalist system is the only one that has ever worked in the history of mankind\nI have faith in the future now why you may ask I'm telling you again young people they want to succeed they know a good thing when they see it so Tonight Show is rank\nHas its privileges and with it comes very important responsibility my favorite millennial right now happens to be here Jesse wherever I Am the only ...
