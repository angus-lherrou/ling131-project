visit to Pittsburgh with millennia Trump and protesters of course show up to protest President Trump now this is not a bunch of people who happened to be you know pilots to medic wonderful pro Jewish people are just angry at President Trump or his failure to sufficiently condemned the alt right in twenty Fifteen\nIt turns out that all of these protesters\nAre radically last generally anti Israel protesters are out there protesting President Trump shocker but to me is going to cover this do this is a referendum on President Trump's rhetoric when in fact it's just a bunch of people don't like Trump and they're using this as an opportunity to come from and then doing this for a while now media the media malfeasance on the pitch even on Pittsburgh\nHas been truly astonishing and the the story that I talked about a couple of days ago in which the media suggested that a Jewish Jewish leaders didn't want Trump to come to Pittsburgh and then they quoted a group called bend the art and refused to acknowledge that that was a group run by Alexander Soros George Soros son\nThat stated mission is to stop from that media malfeasance media I mean another example media malfeasance on Pittsburgh issue do the chief rabbi of Israel is a rabbi David loud so rabbi lab there's a lot of controversy in Israel over whether the conservative and therefore movement\nIn Israel ought to be accepted by the rabbit my personal opinion is no because they're not ... and they don't they don't work according George while there's a good argument to be made whether or not they are actually ought to be\nA rabbit in Israel whether they're out to be like an official religious rabbit Israel but put that aside that controversy has existed\nIn the aftermath of the shooting there was a story that went out at the Washington Post and a bunch of other leftist outlet Frank suggested David lab refused to acknowledge the shooting happened to the Senate up they suggested the rabbi allow had said the shooting did not happen at a synagogue it happened in a place in significant Jewish character\nThat was a why if you go back and you read David last comments and he ... he calls it specifically a big mess at which is to say a place where people pray\nRight which is a synagogue and the media completely misreported because they have an agenda which is this even split the Jewish community between the orthodox and the non orthodox in the middle of an inch mass shooting and I get these protesters gather for Trump and watch the media coverage pretty astonishing\nSadness that absolute shock and what has happened has turned into anger with news or the president's visit there are several hundred people here actors pro just getting ready to march just as the president is expected to land in in Pittsburgh and and move\n\nThe neighborhood of president Donald Trump in this neighborhood tonight is definitely unwelcome\nOkay he's unwelcome in this neighborhood and then you look at the video and there are people wearing FBI you jackets and carrying ACLU handmade\nAnd not not had made printed out placards\nOkay that the idea that all of these people are just grassroots folks who are showing up with no agenda other than they are just very upset about President Trump and his and his feelings about\nAnti Semitism it's just nonsense but that's not the way the media cover all of that and then the media of course decided they were going to cover in great specificity a family of one of the synagogue shooting victims rejecting a Trump meeting saying that he was blaming the community in a glass of course I mentioned that one of the people who was shot\nAnd survive was in fact a Trump voter and that there were other Trump people who may have banned from Trump's polarizing guy\nThis is not any great shock I mean we've all known this for a while the media have decided to play this up and the Democrats have decided to play this up to for political purposes so President Trump wanted to do a unity rally in Pittsburgh he wanted the mayor to come\nYou want to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to come the alternative down they all turned him down why would they turned him down or specifically for political purposes must be real that does not over outrage at associations with anti Semite if it were\nIt wouldn't be running Keith Ellison for the head of DNC this is specifically about they don't like Trump and this is a club they can wield against from that's really cynical dividing Americans even further on the basis of this stuff is cynical now\nBut that said this President Trump have an unfortunate tendency of putting his but so far down his mouth and it goes through his calling out his ass and then back into his mouth again creating an ... stupidity you buddy does the President Trump tweeted this out after visiting Pittsburgh I\nMean it's it's just ridiculous it's without ... ah we've treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh the office of the president was shown
