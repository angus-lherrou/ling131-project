Virginia was trying to explain that lives in it was barely audible over protesters outside his office\nOr in bed with the stuff that people at your door and very much for me and that we have to do something as we had to deal with Russia had him from a man\nAnd forge people call them Kaiser and tried to get her to change her story that pressure hurting change her story\nIn order to go after Brett Kavanaugh that's fully crazy and if it happened on the other side if it was Brett Kavanaugh calling people up saying I Need you to change your story entity you denied it people would be saying wow that guy is evil thing that\nThat to try and pressure somebody to change your story in order to convict someone either in the court of public opinion or in court may in fact be criminal activity ramming into to get somebody to change their story for the FBI is putting pressure on the natural witness at the witness tampering maybe is that that's that's pretty dicey stuff here's all the stories that\nWe're in Kaiser who Dr Ford has said was president of the gambling where she was allegedly assaulted in the Nineteen eighties told investigators that Monica McLean retired FBI agent and a friend of Dr Ford\nHad urged her to clarify her statement that people say now is worth noting that Monica McLean has only come up in other contexts in this case so far so it turns out the Monica McLean wet you forge actual testimony while some you know Monica ... name anybody remember a quick quiz on whether you've been up on the news in the show\n... Monica McLean was the woman who was mentioned by Christine Blasey Ford's ex boyfriend in his letter when he said that Christine Blasey Ford train somebody to pass a polygraph\nThat we've been Monica McLean ... McLean when she was trying out for a job with federal government\nShe then said that that had never happened it also turns out the ... is probably the quote unquote beach friend that Christine Blasey Ford was talking about who urged her to approach Democrat so Monica McLean was he democratic activist was involved in that thing basically from inception\nThe statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr Ford the allies or working behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions of the alleged incident\nAs we're judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh who Supreme Court nomination will be debated in the Senate friday has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct\nOn Thursday after sending to the White House the report on its investigation into the allegations against judge Kavanaugh the FBI sent the White House and Senate\nAn additional package of information that included text messages from miss Micheline to miss Kaiser according to a person familiar with the matter ms ... lawyer David ... said in a statement called any notion of Clinton it missed Micheline pressured wheeling ties are to alter ms Kaiser's account of what she recalls concerning the alleged incident between Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nIs absolutely fall is Kaiser's lawyer\nOn September twenty third sending a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee had no recollection of attending a party with judge Kavanaugh\nThat same day she told the Washington Post you believe Dr Ford on September twenty nine two days after Dr for and the judge testified\nBefore the Senate Judiciary committee miss Kaiser's attorneys sent a letter to the panel saying his quite wasn't refusing to forge accounts and that you believe that couldn't corroborate at a person close to the former classmate said it was her understanding and mutual friends of Dr Ford and ms ties are including Mr McLean had contacted ms Kaiser after her initial statement\nDoor and her that her statement was being used by Republicans are about the allegations against judge Kavanaugh the friends told me this Kaiser that if she had intended to say she didn't remember the party not that it had never happened she should clarify her statement the person said\nAdding that the friends had not in fact pressured miss Kaiser now and then he pressure at all so good stuff happening there from the from the politically oriented legal team and friends of Christine Blasey Ford this is a not obviously good workout and obviously\nVery seriously so Chuck Grassley who is the\nWas the head of the Senate Judiciary committee on behalf of the Republican\nActually sent a letter to Christine Blasey Ford legal team and this letter is pretty explosive stuff for Christine Blasey Ford he basically said why don't you turning over any of your records you testified about your your psychiatrist record and then you won't turn them over to us you know show them to the Washington Post won't show them to\nYou testified about a bunch of material that you will turn over to us so why why won't you turn over any of that stuff\nHere's what Chuck Grassley wrote to Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer quote\nRepeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to the doctor for delegation I don't know what other as parents we should drop from inference we should drop from your refusal but at the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford delegation\nIn quite the way your claim I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to the therapy you know the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence and here's where it starts to get real life he for legal team forward\nIn addition to the evidence I requested my October second letter and white originally uncovered information\nPlease turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or representative than any of the following one US Senators or their staff particularly the offices of ... senators Feinstein Hirono other than your communications with me and my staff in preparation for this September twenty seven hearing in other words were you coordinated with Democrats\nIn order to try it out a particular PR line to the ... witnesses identified by Dr four wheeling Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith in other words we think that you've been corresponding with witnesses including Lee link Kaiser about what they ought to be saying on it\nAnd three Debbie Ramirez Jewish sweating it or the representative in other words were you coordinating with other people making allegations against judge Kavanaugh Chuck Grassley does not actually released that letter unless you've got something that's backed by a Chuck Grassley is a very cautious center and this is not a guy who's going to go out there on a ledge and then suggests that\nAll this is is some giant conspiracy\nWithout some evidence V. isn't as inappropriate so we will see\nWhat arises from all of that by the way we're athletes office did release and executive summary of the FBI finding the FBI findings basically said that there was nothing when they talk to eleven different individual tenable agreed to be interviewed that include mark judge PJ Smith ... or as well as to other individuals included\nOn judge Kavanaugh's July first Nineteen eighty two calendar entry remember Democrats were suggesting that on on Capitol calendar there was a party for July first Nineteen eighty two and what you listen to some people\nSome of those people had crossover with some of the people mentioned Bible as you forward even lazy Ford's lawyer is announcing it wasn't the July first party funny how they only say that after\nThe FBI interviews all these folks are the batteries I'll eat bugs and then and then for the words come out and say she would never have said that it was July first as possible date some of the people listening on his talent or she knew well and would have remembered ... interesting interesting how that works so again\nI've never suggested not one that she was one or making this up I don't know the answer to that\nI Do know that suspicious political activity around an allegation makes me more suspicious of the allegation than it otherwise would in just a second we'll get to the chaos that is happening on the hill right now but first\nLet's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like usa why would you buy a generic mattress built for

worthwhile noting that having lost on all counts or the Democrats have turned to their final game and they said that Brett Kavanaugh was perjury her\nAnd then they said the Brett Kavanaugh was a rapist\nAnd now they're saying Brett Kavanaugh cried and that makes them a baby is it I'm I'm Serious there's an article in the New Yorker by a person that Michael ... who apparently is is kind of a what a person who repeats garbage on a regular basis\nHere's what he said Brett Kavanaugh's years make a kind of sense from a single phrase by Thomas Jefferson and public life is about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the\nFulfillment of the white American manned Adam eyes desires as soon as the force of the out and became\nThe ultimate purpose of this country society so if you don't understand what he's talking about that because you have a brain what he's trying to say here is that the\nPhrase pursuit of happiness means that white men get to pursue happiness but everybody else is a giant victim and therefore if you believe in the declaration of independence because you're a racist which is an insane statement and then he says\nIf a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis in his body and his body politic both really that's weird because it seems to me that rape laws have been on the books and for ever since all of human history written into America's founding document is a franchise for a man like have not a week when he is in a film\nThat isn't really in her kitchen that not really have you read it is in this it was a citizen of his society and one of its disgruntled customers were always right there is an originalist arguments to be made for being a cry baby\nSo it's bad that Brett Kavanaugh got emotional not what
