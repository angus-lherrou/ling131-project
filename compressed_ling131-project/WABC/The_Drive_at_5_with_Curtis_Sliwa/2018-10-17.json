U. I. C. K. to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine\nThat there is a level of solidity and Americans' perceptions which way the economy is going to move namely in the direction of business as having more freedom to pursue the closet than they wish to pursue and now President Trump\nIs is singling that the great danger to that is the Federal Reserve the federal is or has been heightening interest rate\nThe reason they're tightening interest rates and they don't want a bubble they don't want a a lot of folks taking out cheap credit from the Federal Reserve bank lending out a cheap rates\nAnd then all of those athletes being overvalued and then the economy collapsed and you get like a didn't adapt and Seventy thousand eight and the Federal Reserve actually isn't doing the worst thing in fact in government ... the fact that the economy continues to grow extraordinary right with the Federal Reserve tightening credit is actually quite a good thing but here's President Trump suggesting that the economy might be a little bit more fragile\nThan we think it is by going after the Federal Reserve\nRead is the fed because the fed is raising rates too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nOkay and it's and it's you know debatable as to whether offended even exists but if the fed is going to a jets and raising interest rates in a time of of economic boom is not the world's worst idea however there is a problem we do have a booming economy like seven million unfilled jobs for all the talk\nAbout the hollowing out of the American middle class and the people who are living in despair in small town community is seven million unfilled jobs and they live on until job as a lot of unfilled jobs and we are a country originally of pioneers ... people who are willing to you\nIn short out of the spaces from which they were born in order to find new economic opportunities and new jobs the problem is that an economy is booming liked it but then also may require you to add new skills and move out of your home town it's deeply at odds with some of President Trump's campaign promises\nIs deeply at odds with a certain perception of the economy that's pushed by the so called populist right now want to talk about populist right I'm Talking about folks who I think\nTo a lot of truth things and a lot of stuff on a lot of subject but not on this particular subject or the ... and in this in this particular camp accounts are a bunch of folks\nWho have made big names for themselves based on the idea that America's economy is bound to fail that that there's too much income inequality is from the right people supposedly from the right I mean there's too much income inequality\nThe manufacturing jobs are dying that small towns are dying and therefore the government has to step in and regulate we need terrorists when you'd regulations we need redistribution we need heavier unionization\nAnd this comes from a value system that doesn't actually see the morality and the free markets per se now listen there's nothing that isn't necessarily moral and how people use free markets but the basis of a free market system\nPrivate property ownership in control of your own labor\nThat is a deep moral good there is something moral about free markets that is not moral about restricted market that can only hold true when there is no exploitation that can only hold true when the government prevents forced news of labor for example but when the government steps in and starts trumping on\nFree market principles on individual property rights and individual use of labor then you get into trouble and the problem is that there is widespread perception among a lot of people in the populist right then America's economy even when it's going great guns is still unfair this is where the Trump being right meets the Bernie Sanders left\nA Tucker Carlson has a new book out called ship a fool's we're gonna have Tucker on Sunday special sometime in the near future and Tucker is sort of an economic economic populist\nVery talented guy obviously and Tucker's economic populism borders on sort of a Bernie Sanders perspective on how the economy ought to work he talks a lot in his book about the sort of suffering middle class that was left behind and one of the things he says in the book is that I was reading it last night and it's really well written it\nAgain Tucker's deeply held and got one of the things that it says it says that well the rich and gotten richer and the United states\nThe poor and gotten poor now he acknowledges that the poor getting poor and the United states is not actually a thing that's happening at the poor and the United states are still extraordinarily rich by any sort of global standard\nThey are richer than they were in Nineteen Seventy nine by any standard they have better stuff but that's not enough because he says that they're still envy between the rich and the poor and as long as that exists the government has to step in to help prevent\nThat envy from overtaking the political system that's a perspective that probably Bernie Sanders supporters hole\nAnd you saw some of this during the election cycle when President Trump was trying to appeal to Bernie Sanders supporters with the same sort of language the free markets were flawed\nThat globalization was a bad thing this is the stands and by the way for free markets that the the dirty word that people use instead of free market these days is globalization now they're significant problems with globalization on the local level in certain areas so for example you're getting out competed by a business in China and your business goes out of business that hurts\nFor you or globalization is just another word for free markets because if you were getting out competed by a farm in California and you're in Ohio that wouldn't be ... that would just be the free market at work\nTheir moral questions is whether we should be doing free markets stuff with dictatorships like China but there is no economic question than it is beneficial economically consumers in the United states and you producers using what's in the United states\nTo have free trade and yet by suggesting that capitalism and\nFree markets are not enough suggesting globalization is a bad thing what we needed economic nationalism more government intervention President Trump is actually under cutting the cause in his own economy which is not based on anti globalization it's actually based deeply on a global free market\nAnd on less regulation President Trump's economic system is based on less government intervention in the economy the President Trump has been preaching more economic intervention in the economy by suggesting that the economy is leaving people behind well that's an eternity that that is he talking point that can be used against him\nTalking points it can be used against him an election and it's also a talking point that it's not particularly conservative which I'm going to explain in just one second but first let's talk about whether you're sleeping at night\nThere was nobody on the planet like he was why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else he would sleep built asleep with it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers metro body type and sweet preference as to the perfect mattress or the other side sleep or a hot tub or whether you like a pleasure from back but he like\nThere's no more guessing and there's no more confusion\nJust got a huge leap dot com slash Shapiro\nTake their two minutes we've cause they will match you to a map for that will give you the best leap of your life for couples he was even split that mattress down the middle providing individual support needs and he'll preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now it looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders that to a hundred and twenty five bucks off\nAnd he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro this is a luxury matters any non luxury price that she would sleep dot com slash up here over a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or my wife and I love\nOur ... we took that two minutes leap was we got her masters in the mail we unwrap to put it right on the bed because it in place right in front of you it's really cool and it's really comfortable it's so good I got my sister one for her wedding go check it out he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro for a hundred and twenty five bucks off\nOkay so it's not just Tucker I don't wanna pick on Tucker they're they're a bunch of folks again who I really admire intellectually Tucker is one of the another person who I admire it's actually is a guy named Oren Cass\nLesson book out that I recommend it on the show called the once and future worker and in that book or and talked about this kind of new populist economic what he says is basically capitalism is designed to provide you the cheapest products and the best\nProducts at the most available opportunity and there's no question that this is what capitalism\nIs cheap this globalization issue we live in times with us down\nAny human being from even fifty years ago we live in a time economically where legitimately you can have any product on planet earth delivered to you within days made in ten different countries assemble at a factory overseas shipped directly to your house and you have to leave your house while he was push push a button\nAnd these things arrive at a very famous economic asked they called I pencil all about how no one on planet earth actually knows how to make a pencil\nBeginning to end why because there is a graphite factory and then there's what factory and then there's a paint factory there is a metal factory there's a rubber factory all of those places have to generate small pieces of the pencil and then it as a symbol and then he was brought to you for pennies that's the magic of capitalism\nThat's magical globalization and free market that when people say globalization\nAgain because people think the globalization means that we're giving up control to people who are outside America they don't understand the globalization really just means remark as we just had free markets\nFolks would be on board or globalization is an easy way to do it it's kind of a ... left liberal term for free markets has been used just like trickle down economics and the less liberal term that has been used instead of supply side economics\nOren Cass in his book he talks about capitalism\nIs great at generating all sorts of consumer good\nWhat he says is that we may be living in a time very soon where people can't find fulfillment\nIn consumerism instead they find the woman's in job now there's no question that a guy making twenty thousand dollars a year and working is probably happier than a guy making twenty thousand dollars a year from welfare and not working but the real question is how much economic wherewithal you have to sacrifice how much free market you have to sacrifice\nNow in trouble again this time not really his fault the Saudi Government apparently\nFound an enemy and cut them up and listen to fight him and this became public knowledge now President Trump is having to deal with the fallout will talk about how he can deal with the fallout and why the media for president from kind of unfair his is a bunch of Hiroshima\n\nThe one big reason mostly cloudy Iraq dos and what the stories you'll be talking about on Seventy seven WABC New York city health officials say six

he's very close with the Saudi regime and there's a reason for that it's because right now the Saudis are one of our partners in dating off uranium threat in the middle east\nThe fact that the president of the United states is close with the ... though has created a problem for him because the Saudi crown prince is apparently responsible for the murder of his daddy didn't there's the

to be his deli all the talk about the Saudi regime modernizing\nAnd moving toward liberalism like classical liberalism all that was over said it it is what it is an Islamic dictatorship which people still have their hands chopped off of that is not exactly a modern country but\nWe're all very shocked and appalled as we should be when Saudi operatives decide they're going to murder a dissident at a Saudi consulate\nIn Istanbul so here's the wall Street Journal with the latest reporting Saudi operatives beat drug killed and dismembered\nIt does it in Saudi journalist in the presence of the kingdom's top diplomat and assemble\nTurkish officials had Tuesday as Washington or ... provide answers\nPresident Trump cautioned that Saudi Arabia should be considered innocent until proven guilty and secretary of state Mike Pompeo on a visit the kingdom\nAnd Saudi leaders and strongly denied involvement or conducting a furious credible investigation but turkey is now suggesting that they have tape of the entire thing happening at least audio tape the entire thing happening which can be very pleasant I mean that that sort of audio with me it's almost as hard to listen to this Lady Gaga record\nAn interview with the Associated Press Tuesday Mr Trump compared the allegation daddy agents and tell them to start to jogging and the accusations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh this is where President Trump gets into trouble this is not particularly smart now here and there there are\nSeveral possible responses to the Saudi situation\nResponse number one this is really that\nWe should put some sanctions on Saudi Arabia at least temporarily until they provide some sort of answers on all of this\nAnd until they punish the people responsible and until they reform their conduct that possibility number one possibility number two as you say yes this is really bad also every country in that region is basically a garbage ...\nOr is run like a garbage eight and then the countries themselves all the people are I'm sure wonderful in many countries by the administration of turkey\nIran Iraq\nCertainly Syria certainly not certainly Lebanon Jordan like none of the universe rations are great western democracy and these are all garbage administrations so well he could say is yes\nThis is really bad also for geo political realist reasons like Henry Kissinger we still need to work with the Saudis to contain the Iranians are that's possibility number two and then there's possibility number three which is from telling the Associated Press quote\nHere we go again with you know you're guilty until proven innocent we just went through that with justice cabinet and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned\nSomewhere justice Kavanaugh screams and silence add any as compared to Saudi dictators murder people in conflict and then liquefy their bodies that is just it's like when Trump said during the Kavanaugh hearings that he'd been accused of things to a cabinet just must have been snacking\nHimself on the forehead drawn the card style double faced palm it just it makes you know the ... because the president sees things in black and white terms on every score\nHe says this sort of stuff but equating Brett Kavanaugh where there was no evidence other than the allegation alone against him with the Saudis murdering a human who has disappeared and where there is apparently audio evidence an audio recording\nShared with both the U.S and Saudi Arabia comparing this Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh I Can't be a happy camper right now come that how on I mean really apparently on the recording of voice can be heard inviting the constants leave the room the voice of a man Turkish ... identified as
