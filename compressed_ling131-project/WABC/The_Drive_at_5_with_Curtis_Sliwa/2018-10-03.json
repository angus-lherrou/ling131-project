my family and uh obey the law like that with an old white guy though you know he was part of the forty fifth for for years the vision that liberated Sacco\nAnd I'm thinking of other old white men you know like Plato Aristotle Moses Shakespeare Mozart Beethoven Jefferson Franklin Lincoln Feinstein I Wonder what the world with your life with us for voices\nRemember I did a show many times on the conventions of the white male I don't know if you've heard that it was very controversial\nI did it over the years since Nineteen Ninety eight the inventions of the dreaded white male I maybe I could do it again for the army's I've been saying who think that it's okay to vilify an entire race in the entire sex\nAnd uh I don't think it's I don't think it'll matter though once hysteria starts it doesn't end very well it it doesn't burn itself out immediately it has to go through the the virus has to do\nAlmost read before he stopped\nAnd the virus that started on college campuses amongst the most fringe feminists usually the sexually fringe the most sexually fringe females on the campus just started this virus of hatred their hatred for men their hatred for the patriarchy their hatred for their fathers\nHas is the cause of this movement against white males by the way didn't come out of the year it was an incubator by the way by itself is it didn't start through spontaneous combustion\nExactly what they're doing to cabinet or\nHe's ... he's the representative rather of the white male if they hate so much\nAnd they're out to get the patriarchy not to get Kavanaugh and so after they invented stuff about him which is now probably gonna come out to be a hundred percent false now you gotta Cory Booker Amanda was disqualified himself from being a senator as far as I'm concerned should be removed from the Senate\nBecause he has said he's into breaking the law\nCory Booker a U.S senator from New Jersey is quoted as saying Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence doesn't matter\nYou should be removed from the nomination now that man is a law give her what Cory Booker what is this background what does he ever done that should disqualify and well the justice qualified himself here is a law give her who says he does not respect the law\nHere is a law give her who says the law doesn't matter he was a law gave her it was as guilt or innocence doesn't matter he was a law gave her who says condemn that man guilty or innocent get rid of him that's a U.S senator who would be president\nWho else is unqualified in these hysterical times who has disqualified themselves\nAlmost every Democrat has disqualified themselves from reelection but since most of the population is either ignorance or drugs that will be almost no ramifications that's the real problem you have a high population of stupid people\nIllegal immigrants who can't even read the English language who've been permitted to vote even though they shouldn't vote Mitt the qualifications I've been

American public life they won't\nReally they want\nA lot of folk to ask me if I ever want to run for office I'll tell you that ten years ago I was much more interested in running for office than I Am now and one of the reasons is because the way people are free and when they run for office or are on the judiciary or in in good stead making policy\nThat is not something you want to put your family through\nIt's also a by the same token it's difficult to watch all of this it's also clarifying\nAnd the idea that the bail is being stripped that and you're seeing people for who they are\nOne of the people who we thought who he was over the last several days and I had to comment on this because I missed the opportunity to Monday was James Comey and James Comey who was touted most honest man in American politics he had he lived for a higher loyalty rabies a higher loyalty James Comey the FBI Director that President Trump fired\nAnd President Trump called immigrants that are at the time and I said President Trump was right to call in the grand entered a fired immediately upon taking office origins call me in the New York times had a piece earlier this week and I want to read you some of the peace because it sets the baseline for where Democrats where folks on the left we're going with Kavanaugh\nAnd now it turns out that none of this is going to come through to James Comey had a piece earlier this week and it was called\nThe FBI can do this to the FBI is back in the middle of it when we were headed to Hillary Clinton email investigation and twenty Fifteen the bureau's deputy director said to me you know you are totally screwed right\nYou meant that in a viciously polarized political environment one side was sure to be serious with the outcome sure enough I talked with declaring the political hack although the author Adam tongue and cheek I just can't figure out which side\nAnd those were the good old days President Trump's decision to order a one week investigation into sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh has Supreme Court nominee comes in and humble indescribable pain and anger lies and attacks\nAnd he goes on talks about how terrible the president to the United states as and then finally he gets to Brett Kavanaugh and\nHe suggests that the time ... nature of the FBI investigation is really bad because of course Democrats built on what they do on cabinet nominated the whole goal of this investigation the whole goal democratic tactics here is just solve beyond the election that's all they want now it turns out this that Byron radically I Will get to the polls and just a minute\nHave not been as unified and motivated since the twenty six you know Washington probably since two thousand\nIt's been a long time since I've seen Republicans is motivated this unified and is ready to go to the polls pretty astonishing but here's the James Comey says the FBI is now being asked to investigate on a seven day ... sexual assaults with the president says never happen at some senators have decried as a sham cooked up to the Supreme Court nominee\nAnd the other senators believe beyond all that we are committed by the nominee if truth we're the only goal there wouldn't be no clock an investigation wouldn't have been sought after the Senate Judiciary committee already endorsed to nominate instead it seems that Republican goal is to be able to say there was an investigation\nAnd it didn't change their view while the Democrats hope for incriminating evidence she's around the nominee will know the Republicans didn't ask for an FBI investigation because they're already been sick FBI background checks and Brett Kavanaugh none of them and raised anything in the Senate Judiciary committee as mentioned as more investigative power than the FBI\nThey went ahead with this because Jeff Flake felt\nThat maybe this would make them a senator sitting on the fence a little bit more comfortable but James Comey continues says although the process is deeply flawed\nAnd apparently designed to thwart the fact gathering process\nThe FBI is up for this it's not as hard as Republicans hope it will be FBI agents are experts in interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world follow with additional interviews and look limited in some way by the Trump Administration they can speak to scores of people in a few days if necessary they will confront people with testimony and other accounts\nTesting them pushing them into professional way\nAgents have much better nonsense detectors then partisans because they aren't starting with the conclusion yeah this is the best part yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has very little to do with memory and his ... the former FBI Director saying that time has very little with memory\nThat as an insane statement that is insane scientific evidence proved that memory has nearly everything to do with time as a further something is in the past the worst you remember it you may think you remember something clearly\nThe truth is you probably don't I Love this from James Comey has FBI agents know every married person remembers the weather on their wedding day no matter how long ago significant strides memory they also know that little lies points a bigger lives\nYou know the obvious live by the nominee about the meaning of words in your book are flashing signaled the dig deeper so James Comey already condemned Kavanaugh's wire even though I have not actually had to lie about anything and there's no proof cabinet lied about anything will get to that and just a second\nBut I Love the time and he says the FBI agents know that time has little to do with memory and its significance drives memory because everybody remembers what the weather was like on their wedding day first of all the reason you remember anything on her wedding day is because there was a photographer there taking pictures of the whole thing and then you go back and you look at the pictures of your wedding day\nAnd that is what you call an age memory second of all if his argument is that everyone knows what the weather was like on their wedding day then why doesn't Christine Blasey Ford remember where it happened when it happened what the weather was like on that day\nWho drove over there who drove her home who else was if the party she doesn't remember anything so significant strides memory\nThen why exactly doesn't she remember anything about what happened except supposedly the Brett Kavanaugh was there to all of this has completely self defeating it's just the than but James call me you know acting as these suppose a\nGood guy in the room the objective observer in the room is already inviting Brett Kavanaugh without even recognize into his own words basically undercut the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford this is where we are people who are purporting to be objective or just falsifying people were purported to be objective on this\nInstead of saying we don't have enough information yet\nAlready in the beginning of the week they were saying the Kavanaugh is guilty and that was the expectation that Kavanaugh was going to be guilty and then no matter what happened we can be assured that something would arise that would stop Brett Kavanaugh's nomination instead as it turns out there's some evidence that is now a rising suggesting that Christine Blasey Ford has wide and lied repeatedly now\nThese are uncorroborated allegations of wise from Christine Blasey Ford but no more uncorroborated than foreign testimony itself to the same people who are saying that the testimony that now been given put forth about Christine Blasey for the same people say\nThat that's uncorroborated stuff are perfectly fine with her uncorroborated testimony destroying Brett Kavanaugh\nSo either you want evidence corroborated or he don't on evidence corroborating you don't get to pick and choose you don't get to say that Brett Kavanaugh should be taken down on the basis of uncorroborated allegations but Christine Blasey Ford testimony\nShould be respected until it is disproved by corroborated allegation either Robert of evidence is necessary or Robert of evidence is not necessary we'll get to the holes in Christine Blasey Ford story\nIn just one second but first let's talk

Christine Blasey Ford has this tape it they statement given under penalty of perjury stuff the person's wine than they can be brought up on charges\nAnd here's what it said this was turned over to Fox News I'm Blake I'm a court resident of California\nAt first met Christine Blasey now Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nIn Nineteen eighty nine ... nine in California in Nineteen Ninety to Ninety Ninety One I was friends with Ford from approximately Nineteen Ninety two Nineteen Ninety eight I was in a relationship with Dr Ford I found her truthful and maintain no animus towards her during our time dating Dr Ford never brought up anything regarding her experience as a victim of sexual assault harassment or misconduct Dr Ford never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh\nDuring some of the time we were dating Dr Ford lived with Monica element lean my understood to be her lifelong best friend during that time it was my understanding the McLean was interviewing for jobs with the FBI and us attorney's office I witnessed Dr Ford helped Micheline prepare for potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs work\nAnd help McLean become familiar and less nervous about the gym Dr Ford was able to help because of her background and psychology Dr Ford and I live together while we were dating and stay together and a long distance relationship when Dr Ford moved to Hawaii sometime around Nineteen Ninety eight\nAlthough I'm not sure of the particular year and I might have been a bit earlier or later while visiting born in Hawaii we traveled around the wine islands including one time on a propeller plane\nDr Ford never indicated a fear of flying back to my recollection back and forth never expressed if you're close quarters type spaces or places with only one exit I system Dr Ford with finding a place to live in California she ended up living in a very small five hundred square foot house with one door\nJust by trying to maintain a long distance relationship\nI ended the relationship once I discovered Dr Ford was unfaithful while living in Hawaii after the break up I took her off the credit card we shared a nearly one year later I noticed Dr Ford had been charging the car in charge for about six hundred dollars worth of merchandise when confronted Dr Ford said she did not use the card to later admitted to the use after I threatened to involve fraud prevention I didn't speak to forward again until about two thousand to\nEven a marriage counseling isn't it the door was not an escape route but an entrance fruits and the attorney

that I don't want to mention it's personal since the second front doors installed students from local colleges have lived in the additional room with the private door\nSo in other words there are a lot of holes in her story all which suggest that maybe there are some serious questions that need to be asked about boards account and this week it seems more questions have been raised about that account\nAnd I've actually been raised about Brett Kavanaugh coming off the president of the United states could not hold himself that you know\nAfter a couple of weeks I was the president felt the
