uncovered this racism at Harvard a Harvard University dean testified that the school has different SAT score standards for prospective student's based on race and sex\nNow this trial was brought about by Asian American applicants who have said for years they've been discriminated against at Harvard no kidding no kidding is a shame in Berkeley Princeton Gail all the other institutions have lower living\nThey haven't left the best and brightest then not at all they've discriminate against Asians and whites did you know that if they want to have diversity they want the catalog to look like an inner city\nThat's what's important not whether the students get keep up with the learning not whether anybody can excel at Harvard or what matters is that the brochure looks good\nSo the agents had it up to here and they decided to sue trial began Monday\nAnd all they heard from so far was the dean of Harvard\nAnd they learned that Harvard sense we're proven lettuce the African American Native American and Hispanic high schoolers with only mid range SAT scores around eleven hundred on math\nAnd verbal combined that about possible sixteen hundred but if you're an Asian American you only get a recruitment letter if your score at least two hundred and fifty points higher that's Thirteen fifty for Asian women and Thirteen ready for men and the story but the the law\nWho runs it at Harvard says\nIt's not discrimination midst if it's him and said no no no there's just not discrimination\nWhen it hit oh no no no we ... certain groups in order to break the cycle and try to convince

because of the very loyal Savage Nation audience stop mass hysteria made it onto the New York times best seller list\nIt doesn't really matter what the position as the competition was so overwhelming we made number eleven now you say what's the big deal OK you try to write a book she if you make it into the top five thousand we made it into the top eleven now here's the interesting part the way the New York times calculates best sellers\nIs they use their own algorithms in essence my book is probably realistically number five or six but the way they rate things is very hard to figure out but we made it America's and Saturday from the Salem witch trials of the Trump which on\nAnd that's only the beginning of where we're going to go I think that this book once people actually read it and see that it's not just another derivative book\nSupporting Republican talking points which is what all the other books are they are all the river to books you know what that means the rebut of asking

you want to send\nYour kids a Harvard I Want you to think again about forty thousand applications arrive every year and the races to run Harvard with all these forty thousand down to two thousand acceptance letters unfortunately\nThose accepted and not being accepted based upon their qualifications they're being accepted based upon race straight out race discrimination that is what's coming out in the trial right now or that as a result of Asian Americans saying enough is enough\nBecause they're sending SAT scores higher for Asian Americans and higher for whites and this is absolutely violating the civil rights of everyone as a matter of fact because affirmative action is racism one way or the other\nAn attorney representing the students for fair admissions accused Harvard if given the Asian Americans significantly lower ratings for certain personal qualities listen to this that's how they used to get around that let's say you were a kid I got a six hundred SAT instead of sixteen hundred and they wanted to assure you when\nThey said you had great leadership qualities let's say and you had compassion now how can you judge compassionate leadership that's made us into made up things right\nSo they give Asian Americans lower ratings for certain personal qualities such as leadership and compassion\nThan any other race can you believe this\nBut the liars at Cambridge, Massachusetts Harvard said oh no we don't engage in discriminatory practices our doors are open to students of all backgrounds and means yeah but it's open more for some students than others\nThe doors only cracked open for Asians and whites while it's not taken off its hinges for others if you get the picture\nNow you know this is an interesting turnabout because no matter how this case turns out\nIt will go to the U.S Supreme Court well which is a really good news for all those who want fairness in admissions and hiring is in the biggest you see as a comedian said when I think it was when Clinton took the presidency\nThere was a comedian who looked up at the sky is the air force than in a fly over and the comedians said at the White House that's our air force now remember that famous line\nWell guess what that's our Supreme Court now [laughter]\nAh\nOh yeah that's our Supreme Court now and so we'll go to the Supreme Court\nAnd finally the debate surrounding affirmative racism what you called affirmative action is a policy from Nineteen Seventy eight that has given mostly African American and Hispanic students a great advantage in the college application process will finally be turned by our Supreme Court that's oh\nThat's so you want to live in a world of racism idle idle I was never given anything based upon my race or upon anything other than how hard I work and by the way I did poorly on the SATs as bright as like I mean in some areas I'm a terrible test taker personally\nI don't memorize things very well never could I'm a dreamer a philosopher thinker\nSo I in my mind would drift off of school I didn't memorize very well I didn't test very well so believe me I don't think SATs or the be all end all but they are pretty fair way of uh ... uh judging whether you could do well in a setting that requires memorization you understand that\nMeaning ... meaning college so that's that are there any Asians or listen to the ...

F ... scores are not everything\nWe want some type of affirmative action but that might be more fair than what's there now what if we increase the wage put your rank senior high school class that this would give a little bit of advantage\nTo know why why would that matter let's say you go to a high school where there's all slow learners or or or such and you're like number one what would that mean when you go up against kids were number one in schools where there's tremendous competition huh that's not a standard for everyone to follow\nThe ... the ... it's still somebody you came from a disadvantaged background gives them an opportunity\nTo forget what the disadvantaged I came from a disadvantaged background and no one reached out of gave me anything I just had to work harder to get where I Am somewhat disadvantaged community there are plenty of kids that come out of ghettos and rise to the top biggest driving that brain stopped with garbage about disadvantaged\nThat's that's another watch more deliberate left disadvantaged what is it actually mean what does it mean disadvantage tell me what does it mean\nIt it it means that they don't have as many resources that parents are not as education\nAlso in other words a kid who comes from a family with the parents killed themselves to be educated and to keep the kid in school they should be punished now\nBy calling star star one two three four you agree to receive a semester MS text messaging standard rate of life you also have anybody to stretch into state federal or corporate do not call registry\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI Walk in a while ago I was walking and find that site and I don't know what happened I had the after effects of that in my hand and my late and I noticed that except that it I don't have that anymore that is one thing that I Am\nVery wet and I don't feel any that they should have like like in fact my nerves are getting killed it's just wonderful I I'm very well on it\nFor a limited time use discount code W.
