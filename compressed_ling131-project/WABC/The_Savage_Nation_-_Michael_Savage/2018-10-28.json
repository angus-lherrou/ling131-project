I mean currently he's participating in a um New York state health plan a that was a\nI I guess it was a substitute for Obamacare\nGotcha so here's the issue um each state has their own financial eligibility rules for Medicaid\nSo he needs to find out whether or not he is entitled to medicate and this is a big deal for him because\nMedicare will charge him more than four hundred dollars a month for his part a because he doesn't have enough hours in Social Security so\nPart a and part B with cost him five hundred and forty dollars a month which is probably well beyond what he can afford so there is a\nA free a non profit consulting agency that can help him\nIt's called the state health insurance assistance program the acronym is ship\nAnd its publicly funded it's non biased and he should get in touch with his local ship office which he can find on line you just Google this\nAnd there are so low cater that would take him to New York offices if he's in New York or or whatever say to them and he should ask for a counselor to sort of walk him through the financial eligibility rules so that he can make an informed choice\nSo if you um if they didn't qualify for allowing off he can get insured through Medicaid OK so a Medicare is not absolutely mandatory because this is my understanding of what you've just told me\nGets Medicaid he will get Medicare he's his income slow enough he duly eligible for both programs\nSo he's if he gets medicate he's gonna have to get Medicare it's not mandatory but it's the only way you can get insurance you can't or just Medicaid only\nYou actually qualify for Medicare and your dual eligible because your income and assets are low enough to qualify in your state for Medicaid so you're considered duly eligible for both program so that's the way it works if he didn't have any insurance and roll the dice\nHe doesn't have to get Medicare but if he later changed his mind he may have some enrollment penalties but again if his income slow enough the enrollment\nPenalty shouldn't be an issue for him Medicaid should help him so I think he wants to explore Medicaid right off the bat to make sure he has health coverage\nUnderstood you know unfortunately who's a ... even for the uh current insurance program here just right on the bubble of being eligible for you know his income is just a hair below the cut off or above your name\nOr above ... a much much yeah I don't I don't know and it's and it's a good it's a good amount of money relatively speaking on the order of twenty some odd thousand dollars a year but a few you know a dollar above that threshold he's pushed into a Medicare prince\nThank you bill we got we got to go and get a bunch of what our callers yeah except believe Karen who want some basic guidelines for picking Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans you're on if you're just joining us I'm Josh Joe Lenski the financial quarterback with Philip Mohler I was asked\nPhil for PBS and he's the author of the book were giving away to those of you who schedule and keep you know obligation review if you're in Pennsylvania New York New Jersey Connecticut Long Island and around the country\nOr through Web than ours call us at aged eight nine ...
