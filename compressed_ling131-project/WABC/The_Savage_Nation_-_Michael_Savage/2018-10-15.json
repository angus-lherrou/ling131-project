F. in in the oval office he used the F word he called the Seventy two year old president broke\nThe rapper had no respect for the oval office he wore no try\nHe wore a stupid baseball hat on throughout is this the kind of behavior you want in the oval office uh-huh would you ever expected me when I went to start when I went in there to start dropping F bombs the president\nWhy is it no conservatives have said that this was unacceptable\nBy that low life rapper I Am the only voice just had the nerve to point out the behavior like they should not be accepted in the oval office that as a sacred office even Obama didn't prevent that kind of behavior to be shown publicly why are we turning this nation over to whatever pop culture\nDemands there needs to be the core and brought back to our nation's capital remember where it starts it starts there\nNot only in the White House but in the Capitol building to there was no civility left\nIn our leadership during the Capitol building with a gaggle of reporters on the ground with dirty clothing I'd make them wear suits and ties and I'd limited to a few ... press pools and that's just a few in the excuse me in the press pool sitting there and then he to hearing the clicking and the lights it's a disgrace the whole thing is a mess\nI Want to talk about nothing related to the low life rapper and the White House although it's a symbol of the decline of our civilization\nThe way I Want to talk about something else I'm I'm a student of history as you know and I am a student of war warfare revolution\nI Want to tell you something I saw last week or two weeks ago that one third of American youth\nWould be unqualified to serve in the military because their fat slobs\nOne third of American youth are fat blobs of garbage sugar or salt dairy just useless piles of DNA useful only for a social media\nSo one third of the youth couldn't serve in the military so I look back on how many died in the last weeks of World War two and I look at how the people lived through it I don't understand how this country could live through anything like this\nAnd are focusing instead on one part of World War two when tens of thousands died in flames when the allies bomb Dresden, Germany it burned for seven days in seven nights\nFifteen square kilometers of the city was reduced to rubble bodies or carried away from the center of Dresden, Germany days after the bombing how many died twenty five thousand to forty thousand civilians now why my telling us\nYou'll figure it out soon okay how many died in the fire bombing of Germany the you know the answer how many died amongst the Russians to take Berlin in the last weeks of the war you know how many\nI'll tell you how many of the show goes on in Hamburg forty thousand died in one month in Nineteen forty three yeah the number forty thousand here if you break it hanging they'll call like shy still lawyer and as soon as the company because slipped on the floor do break hang in there and a department store and they get a ... lawyers so forty thousand burned to death in Hamburg\nTwenty five thousand the forty thousand killed in Dresden Berlin twenty two thousand one month\nForce I'm Seventeen thousand killed in Nineteen forty five one month dumps that Germany eleven thousand killed in one month to Nineteen forty four cities reduce the ashes but how many uh Russians died in the last weeks of the war to take Berlin when they bury the third wife\nYou know how many died you have any idea how many Russians was shot in the back by their own officers if they didn't go that you know that here in the military if you have let's say depression or bipolar you don't feel good that day you wake up at the wrong side of the bed you got to pass a day you get shot in the back at that time by the by the Soviet military\nYour nominees Soviet tanks were lost to the streets of Berlin eight hundred tanks were blown up just taking Berlin and the last weeks of the war\nBecause the idiot maniac crazed drug addict Adolf Hitler refused to let his troops even though the war was lost he refused to let his troops give up and save themselves and of course save a Berlin from total destruction this is what happens when you have fanaticism\nThe battle for billing took twenty two thousand civilian lives in the street battles twenty two thousand\nWhat how many died amongst the Russians or I'm telling you this well I'm telling you this to show you the scope of human tragedy and how we in this country are so diluted into thinking that every one of our complaints and cranks and this and that is something important it's stupid\nIt's stupid it's an embarrassment to the human condition and was so soft I don't know how this country can survive much longer we have become so soft\nI don't know how the nation can go on\nBut I'm a I'm not I'm increasingly pessimistic about the survival of America incidentally that's really what I'm getting it\nYou might think I'm supposed to sit here and give me give you a charm show a charm job it's a wonderful world everything's gray everything's coming up roses you take away welfare from the fifty five percent of the American people who don't work\nYou take away the food stamps from the lazy bums who don't work\nYou cut off the s as the guy from the fake crazy people you'd take back all of you know how many people are on disability federal disability payments due to how many people on federal disability payments it went up on the Trump not down\nBecause they're not cracking down on the fake disability I think it was twelve or fourteen million people are faking it twelve to fourteen million people declare their to their unable to work you hear this and you're paying hundreds of billions of dollars for all of this\nThe country is so soft that all they want is more free things you understand that so then you've got demagogues on the left say we'll give you anything free that you want and all of the losers of the world so yeah yeah yeah we want the free stuff will vote for them\nBut where's the money's supposed to come from where for me for other people at work that's where it comes from so what happens is when when they tax us to death and becomes too high what do you think happens do you think that there's a limited money we stopped working\nWe just stopped working and

take it as\nIf Trump had only understood that he needs a scientist who's also at communicating a communications expert around him he would have done much better with Leslie stall\nHe could've devastated our with one torpedo one line you're going to say well actually if you only understood the boss dog ice core samples she would have fallen back out of her swivel chair is that she would have to buy what does that mean when she says oh the ah the ah the what you're saying well\nWhat about all the scientists to support global warming you should have said well they don't know they should know about the Vostok ice core samples but he doesn't want to listen to me because he's surrounded now by people from Fox News\nWho are very loyal only to Fox News host God Bless them all\nThey don't know everything there are people know more on certain issues than anyone knows they're called experts not everyone can be an expert in all things you understand that so if he had said Leslie the Vostok ice core samples of what I'm referring to what are they\nIt's research it's real data it's not created by Al Gore\nWas obtained by drilling down into the ice above lake Vostok in Antarctica last year already do adaptive ten thousand feet those of you who will follow rap music already fell asleep you don't know what ten thousand feet means\nAnd you see French in Russian scientist obtained deep core samples which allowed them to look at among other things the history of temperature and carbon dioxide over the past four and twenty thousand years I realize I just lost Ninety nine point nine percent of the audience on that that was too many words too many syllables too many facts\nShould they drill down all this depth into the ice and what did the sample show\nPresident Trump\nThat show a lot of things that Leslie stall would've been stumped by\nThe main thing that show the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere did not cause warming\nDid not cause warning warming the increases in carbon dioxide consistently lagged behind temperature increases by about eight hundred years Leslie stall would have fallen out of a chair but wait that's about all\nThis could have finished their off\nVostok ice core samples tell us more\nTour of the three hundred twenty five thousand years ago long before there was rap music\nThree hundred twenty five thousand years ago long before Twitter came along global temperatures and C. O. two levels were higher than they are today I guess Morocco bomber didn't get any of this when he was at Columbia University learning how to become a community agitator so what I'm saying to you as of course I Want to clean up your earth\nMore so than you might imagine and I've been working in ... conservation movements and somebody youngster that doesn't mean we have to have hysteria in order to make our point and it's embarrassing to me that the administration refuses to permit my wisdom to get anywhere near the president it really gets me angry actually\nBecause he's losing great opportunity and so when he was interviewed by sixty minutes and she said what about the scientists who say global warming is this and that he could have devastated her with one word Vostok ice core samples and a few more line she would have been finished and it would have made it look so smart because he is so smart\nBut you can't just wing everything that you talk about your catcher showed it on to everybody like everyone's stupid moron and no one's really listening to you and I go on to the next point\nIf you want to make points with the public and I mean the educated public tried to use some educated statements is what I'm saying in order to use educator statements you educated people around you not people who dropped out of high school and got very rich bamboo selling the public

continue to grow after death they show what the hell is he crazy now\nWell I think about a lot of things I pre birth after death and we've always seen the mythology about nails seem to be growing after death I Want to give it to science and that in a few minutes and the optical illusion that is responsible for the idea that hair and fingernails grow after death is a is something that you need to know about\nIt's the same as the optical illusion about global warming being caused by mankind\nAnd or unless you know the science and don't listen to the fact scientists you're not going to know the truth\nAnd as I say I've probably done more for cleaning up the environment and saving the environment than most of the gangsters in the global warming business because I've never received a nickel from oil companies or from the global warming gangster business Sheldon I'm WABC go ahead please make your point\nMichael how are you this afternoon a police what's your point\nMy point of mind to make Michael's that's OK you talk about on on global warming I agree with you but I think another issue that has to be a fast to be addressed to the concept of global climate change and that that is a different issue\nWhether that's that's just shifting the the rhetoric about the same scam\nReally Michael let me let me try to\nKnow well well my child and hold on shoulder and hold on a did you hear anything I said about the Vostok ice core samples\nI did I did I did\nAll right so you're a reasonable man how can you deny what was discovered by the science\nI'm agreeing with you OK let me let

is\nDraining the swamp so what we're doing is exposing the swamp and exposing the hypocrisy so it's just about that is about going into these different districts\nLet's see how these Democrats are running these districts especially the ones that keep running around talking about we have to impeach forty five so what we're doing it would give you the truth with proof we're giving you the facts and we're not held in anything that and we'll give it to you straight from the gate to\nFry who go do you go into Maxine Waters district to see how she's managing things\nOh absolutely because you don't stay in her district she say outside of her district oh\nYou mean like Nancy Pelosi and their Feinstein ever come down from the hill and the bunker not up there on the human human feces doesn't

bond bond bond bunk so what uh I Know you went around the country to make this movie which are the cities that you looked at managed by liberals or shall I say mis managed by them\nWell when we look at San Francisco I mean I was taken aback and appalled by that you know to see homelessness to see people dropped out on their minds to see them to advocate in in the streets I've never seen anything like that you know so we catch a glimpse of that\nBut we need to expose that see it long long gone are the days with these congressmen and women think that they can work for their own greed and not the need to people if they don't want to work for us it's type of the vote them out but instead of people listening to south by we have to show the proof that's right and tell the truth\nBut how can you vote out in the trench candidate like Dianne Feinstein when the machine does not permit and he wants to run against her\nThey're like Tammany Hall was in New York for a hundred years nobody could compete with them because they only voting machines\nOkay so they own the voting machines but we own the people's mind that the people on their own minds and they're going to have to see for themselves and they're gonna have to go to the polls listen I I I'm not going to believe that they own the voting machines and they can switch our votes because if\nThey don't know I don't I don't mean that they own the machines in that regard I mean they own the voters they flooded San Francisco with illegal aliens they made it legal devoted six or seven languages and you all know\nThat unless you speak English you don't even know what's going on in the country right when you look at the people will do speak English for half of them don't know what's going on now imagine someone who speaks Farsi and votes doesn't know during the voting for as long as the next their name\nSo let's go into the movie itself or who you are hoping the movie will reach\nListen everybody and I don't care what side of the aisle you're on everybody I think this is a bipartisan movie and the reason why is because it gives everybody shaking awake and let them pay attention to what's really going on especially from the wife is walking around here\nThey don't come to the table for tax cuts they talk about impeaching our president's they don't come to the table to make life better for American the only worried about illegal aliens we need to expose the hypocrisy about that and let people see I think you can make your decision at the polls and the Mets are rising\nI understand you fill me one red casserole is that still in the movie Michael Savage of critters little hopefully\nYes we did a wonderful interview a sit down interview with you that is still in the movie\nOr I didn't I didn't get cut on the cutting room floor then you're left on the floor\nNo you didn't get left on the floor as far as we know now you are in the movies\n[laughter] joke to come on you're a jail let me ask you something did you interview people like Maxine Waters which you sit down with us she voted you write\nShe she what you're gonna have to watch the movie because we went looking for we went looking for but I Want everybody to watch the movie tonight to see what happened with that\nWere you able to interview Nancy or a Diane in San Fran I'll bet none of it they voted you like the plague\nWe'll see but see that's the deal we have a right to expect answers from these Congress for Congress period if they don't want to give an answer about their hypocrisy about their own greed then we're gonna have
