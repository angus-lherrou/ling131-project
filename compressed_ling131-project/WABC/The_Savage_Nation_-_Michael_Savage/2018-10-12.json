say it's a smart move I thought that the ... the White House to be honest with you\nWhat have you seen a scientist invited to the oval office or a great classical musician what there weren't enough votes in it none of the people go to classical music\nWhat is it less than a cultural event in the White House by the way never\nNever I mean there was a an age when presidents had a leading intellectuals and artists in the White House what is going on here I Can't sit here and say I thought that was so smart does it agitate me day and I know\nWell I get over it yeah I already have gotten over it but I'm just trying to say to you\nBe careful with your worship not healthy\nYou're not supposed to worship of president no matter who it is that's why my monologue and the first hour or so British what went over the heads of most listeners it did I Know it it it's just like my book stop mass hysteria because it's not a cartoon cover of people with the a cartoon\nPeople don't want to read history you don't want to understand the history of what they're living through they don't want to understand the context the new ones they don't want it they weren't black or white white or black good bad they're good they're bad where the good guys that are bad guys or you want to hear\nSo when you were a man like me who grew up thinking about everything since he was a kid looking for answers walking down the street in New York and my down and ask them questions and not wise a sky blue I don't know what I asked them who who remembers what kids ask their fathers I always was taught to try and come up with my own answer my father wouldn't answer a question\nHe was from the old world he made me answer my question\nAnd he taught me how to think for myself\nAnd that makes me a great minority in a nation of true believers and true haters\nMost people in America today the true believers of true haters there's actually no in between this is the problem that I'm trying to tell you about this is why the country's falling apart this is why we're on the verge of civil war because the the large large middle ground has been lost\nThe middle grounds gone there's no middle ground in the media you see people on both sides taking a hard position one way or the other and if you don't take a hard position what happens you don't make it in the media\nYou don't make it simple as that there's no room for the middle ground there's no room for the new launch there's no room for thought there's no room for discussion you see the lover hey that's all it is so it you know if you're a man like me to grow up thinking\nAnd now you're living in a in a ... you know in the medium of radio and the best selling author and you want to come toward a true answer a reasonable answer a rational answer a civil answer\nAnd you're living with shackles on both sides taking hard positions\nIn lead you to believe maybe it's time to step off the stage you get out of the spotlight I I'm telling you I'm going through a lot of soul searching right now even though on the verge of a whole new career I'm asking myself\nIs it going to get worse leading up to the president said forget the terms we already see what they're doing on the left egging crowds on to violence we see that already from Hillary onto a lemonade\nViolence is good now all of a sudden the people thought to children not to hit remember just a few years ago the lives of saying oh we don't hit we don't have we don't have we know now it's kick people start a civil war anything goes because the which hasn't become president yet she thinks by whipping up the masses she's going to become president oh no the opposite is going to happen\nWhen is they're ever going to be civil living in this country again I don't really know I don't think you can never ever return in in the near future\nSo having given you a nice uh nowhere introduction leading to nothing\nUh I'd say what you do open my to my left who should
