thing or if you're a panic or nothing at greatest idea could be the true bucket list item if you're not careful yeah yeah you don't want to you want to keep that bucket list concept or abstract yeah if you can we do have a call\nFrom someone or John from the Jersey shore hey John you are on the former travel show how can we help you John I'm\nNot sure though I'm On a different shore okay but I I was out in California about Twenty years ago one of the most transcendent moments was when I walked into a mirror woods it was about Ninety degrees San Francisco when I got in the mirror what it must have been Seventy five I say and that was just mesmerizing for me I happen to like plants\nAnd trees and it was incredible\nIt really is one of the most beautiful rows of trees in the world it's interesting 'cause Jon your it was known for hanging out in Yosemite for for quite a while but now his woods north of San Francisco or one of the most popular attractions in the entire state wouldn't you agree Chris\nI Would in fact I'm going to be a lecturing on our on our California crews and a few weeks and the first place we're going when we get off the ship in San Francisco is getting on a mini bus and heading straight up to your woods\nAnd everyone does that they're ... it's a pretty crowded place these days\nThe actually it's become a challenge for the national Park Service or and so it's nice that we are going to be arriving in many buses because if you show up in a cart we'd have to make an advance reservation now they just put that in place in the last year or retain month John did you have to make a reservation when you went there\nAbout that at that time it wasn't that traveled it was beautiful and San Francisco as one of the most amazing cities too so that was a that was both the wonderful trip\nAnd you could combine Muir Woods not just with San Francisco but with the wine country and I hope you did that when you were the rate\nThat absolutely we did that that would about it that's what we did this next summer we're planning on taking a motor home out west and only is that many I've never been there so thanks for that had\nTerrific idea just my advice for that and I'm sure Chris will agree is make your reservations as far ahead as you can because getting in a motor home and going to camp site is one of the most popular things to do in California and so that stuff books up early\nAbsolutely another thing to know if you haven't been to Yosemite is that the um at the entrance to the park is about forty five minutes from Yosemite Valley so just when you when you cross the ranger a station or on the way into the park you still got a little bit of driving to do and those are two lane country road\nTo try it during the day like John thank you so much for giving us a call we appreciate that call if you have a call about California or anywhere else on the planet that you'd like to go and want to know about the number is eight hundred eight for eight nine to to to ah do you have another idea for California bucket list item\nChris I'm well I'll stay with waterfalls for just one moment to say the other waterfall that people are I think close their eyes and see when they imagine California is the waterfall in Big Sur you know the one I mean the cascades down pictures from the rocks and lands on the beach it's gorgeous it's called ... falls although most people for outside California don't know that\nAnd it's sort of represents for me the impossible California Dream because it's great and you can just imagine standing underneath it and letting the waterfall your head but you can't get to that beach\nUm the ... there are too many rocks and too much rough surface to come in by boat in a ... you know in a safe way and there's no trail down there there was a great flat easy trail that goes from the PC age\nTo up the glucose ... ends meet Pacific coast highway that takes you know it's maybe a mile maybe less than a mile that takes you a spot where you can look down on the falls in the surrounding view but it's it's a waterfall you have to admire from it is\nIt sounds like a recipe to get tourists in trouble if they can't get there safely may try I I have seen international tourists Bush whacking in places where they should not be pushed whacking like at the top of hundred foot drop yeah and this this area of the California coast line it does sometimes have land slips yeah and in\nFact that's the thing to bear in mind about the Big Sur area because for um for more than ... year the Pacific coast highway was closed south of Big Sur because of a great big landslide was just recently yeah it's been they've cleaned it up they've cleared it off tons and tons of dirt to be moved and in I Believe it was July they reopened\nUh and the good news is that means all those businesses around big serve which are really dependent on the Pacific coast highway for for business can go back to business as usual there's a fancy resort they're called the post ranch and they were getting older customers by helicopter for a while\nThat it must be very expensive oh yeah [laughter] that's another normal practice I imagine I think it is their occasional practice\nEven when the road is open but um but anyway the road is open\nNow and there are lots of great things to see their and now that we're heading into fall um there's going to be a little bit less traffic on the road and it's a better time to visit well\nThat's good to know and good to plan for and if you have traveled that you want to plan for we used to give us a call ... eight hundred eight for eight nine to do to we're also on Twitter\nAt ...

have is sitting here with me today traveled journalist of the year and massive California expert\nOr Chris Reynolds from the Los Angeles times so take advantage of it but first\nWe're going to go to the phones we have Tom from mended New Jersey gave me a giving us a call Hi Tom your life on the air how can we hope you\nAre gentleman a side of the question is not about California although I Love the state uh has All right\nI'm interested in traveling at this point in my wife is put care and oil and so I called about ... care in Ireland and I'm guessing that you're familiar with the history it has to do with the bounty and captain bligh who are I guess his\nHis crew mute need a throw them off the ship with a few loyal sailors ... made a a a a a famous navigation all the way back\nHome on a like a rowboat with twelve other guys meanwhile the crew that had a mutiny didn't taken over the actual ship ... ended up out of supplies and basically running aground on a desolate island ... Karen island\nThey out there in the south Pacific ... you know more ...\nAbout ... some of the details but I I'm I'm somewhat familiar with the history and uh I think a whale are taking on water saw either some of the last few survivors or uh maybe about twelve years later and then after that there were there there wasn't any contact for quite a few years and I think the English\nUK made it like a ton of a protected area for a while until the descendants of the mutineers died off and\nThat's all I Know about it but you know what the bounty itself the ship can be seen I understand from an aerial view still in that little\nOf that ... an ounce I didn't know that that is really no for the very few people who are able to do that paid Karen island because as you said it's very very remote I'm Chris how do you get to to pick\nHer nine when if you really wanted to go first to save up a bunch of vacation days yeah and a lot of money I imagine yeah I Would I Would think so it's um the way to do it I think is to fly to Tahiti and then once a week\nAir Tahiti does a flight or the that gets you to ... by way of anger raven please don't ask me questions about ... it was not really sure about that but um yeah ... it's a it is a remote place but it's one of those places that looms large in our history and I think if I go I Want Thomas my God\nYeah right it seems like you know a lot about it already and I know you can we'll watch still um they do quad bikes tours and as you say you can see the racks of the ... and another ship called the corn Wallace from what I understand yeah\nAnd there are more and more cruise companies going there now I think the whole South Pacific region is getting\nMore heavily trafficked by cruise ships and just their profit goes up every year at ... in many cases you'll only stopped there for a few hours which might be a special kind of torture if you're crazy about the history yeah but um but the diversity of cruise ships that are going in their means that it it may become a little bit more affordable\nAnd if you're really crazy about captain bligh in particular you can stay in his house in London where he went after all that went down they made it back home even though he was thrown off the ship it's called the captain bligh house it's ... it's almost across the street from the imperial war museum\nIn London and I think he's buried in a church inland but that has now been converted the concentrated and made into the garden museum so there's still some captain bligh around as well you can see a ship and you can\nSee where he eventually dropped banker I think they are ... the museum in London to accommodate everything that ever happened in the world\nBut there's a guarded museum for ... or yeah yeah yeah some I Hope that helps yeah as much as we can do because neither of us have been\nAll right Larry from queens Larry we'd love to have you on the travel show next do you live how you doing\nLarry alive how you doing\nOkay we don't hear Larry Larry maybe you'll come back to us so instead we'll move to Leslie on Staten Island Hi Lesley or you're going to be alive on the air and the travel so lovely how ya doin'\nGood I'd tell you my daughter had a wonderful experience Italy and I heard your show and I got her the book on farms will then is uh-huh only Eighteen and she said that all the different\nShe said I guess in bed and breakfast whatever other places where there are some young people twenty five and she\nVisited a lot of places it's just been happening\nAnd I am so happy that you call this to tell you know we don't always hear back from the people after they buy a book and they talk about the trips but we don't hear how the books worked for them so it's always really gratifying for us to hear that they were successful and tell me she's a she was a single girl travelling alone is that right\nYeah it's a little concerned about unfortunately she had an unfortunate marriage with divorce here before we were concerned she'd be traveling more by herself\nAnd there was no concern right she was she did just fine she didn't seem that some people left her travel back their part a backpack and she was for granted you know no problem\nIt's a great lesson don't let fear standing your way you can have a great trip but thank you so much for letting us know that our guidebooks worked for you it means a lot to us because we worked so hard on putting them out\nAnd did it is also encouraging to hear because people have been to Europe multiple times begin to begin to um complain about crowds I'm making some places on visible ... and\nThere are a lot of great red places there and also a lot of European be places out of like modernist houses all around town\nIs plus raise is famous for its mid century architecture so if you really want to stay in this really great sleek you know ... minimalist house that's the place to do it\nYou know there was a former Frank Sinatra house that they rent out a there's the whole place feels like a rat pack thing and I will say I'm for other folks who are thinking about Palm Springs\nI'm and who are interested in modern just designed every ... every year in early in the year I think this coming year it's in February they do modernism week in which people who were lovers of that kind of architecture show up from all over the place and really celebrated\nThe other thing I Would say is um unless unless you\nUnless you're ready don't don't go to Palm Springs between April twelve and April twenty first or next year because that's when the Coachella\nFestival ... people you know filled with people go into the the the answer to rice prices go way up a streets clog and if you're not there for that it will be difficult to San Diego though it's doable easily right it is it is um I mean you'll be on the road for a few hours but Sandy was great and its counterpoint\nTo Palm Springs actually grew up in San Diego\nI'm used to be the most the hotels were in mission valley new stayed there but San Diego's downtown over the last few decades has really gained a lot of momentum\nAnd if you stay downtown you can park the car and then leave it in the garage for a few days\nUm there's a lot in the in downtown will be the wrong time of year for baseball season but there's there's a lot going on here in the downtown is right next to the waterfront they've got some historic ships or corn auto was there the hotel del Coronado that great historical until it goes back to the Eighteen eighties\nUm uh and if you go a little bit farther north along the coast in San Diego which will be able to do because you have a car or Islam ... which is a community of the city of San Diego but it would be nice\nI'm kind of sandstone cliffs University of California San Diego is they're kind of at the top of the cliffs in fact one of my favorite places are in all of California is the glider port a next to the UC San Diego campus\nUm I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of the Salk Institute is this really severe piece of I think they call it brutal list architecture but it's right on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean you can kind of look at the Salk Institute and then walked down to where the handlers take off above the cliffs and there's a little place where you can get a you know get a snack like a sandwich\nAnd watch these men and women are run and jump off a cliff\nAnd way down below is a black speech which is San Diego's foremost nude beach so there there is that\nFor those in a lot to do that at the ends actually yeah this is talk is due to the ... on a piece of architecture if you're a fan of of Louis ck on if you're in architecture and you know\nHis name Joanne I there's a lot of vacation to pack in but we hope we gave you some great ideas so thank you for calling Joe and Joe ... we're going to get to us but we have to sneak in a very quick break we'll be back in thirty seconds right here on the former travel show\nLet me welcome you again I'm Arthur from or the founder of the former travel guides this radio program is only one of the means by which we couldn't have a a type of travel information\nThat we think is unique in America first we publish more than one hundred travel guidebooks that voice our Frank opinions both pro and con about everything in travel we're also in every form of social media\nBut equally important we publish daily website called ... dot com to tell the truth about travel in a way that is quite special we of course are grateful you tuned into the Frommer's travel show we think you'll be equally pleased when you go to your computer\nAnd type in the words Frommer's dot com I'm Arthur former\n[noise] Seventy six [noise] lean from the show only here in New York comes to talk of Seventy seven WABC\nNo polling former today she is taking a well deserved day off but I'm Jason Cochran here with Chris Reynolds from the LA Times and we are still

there's a difference between ... and ... the audio is by owner vacation rental by owner is what it stands for so that's a transaction usually between you and them air being be though Chris how's that different and it's safe\nWell there's a there's a company acting as an intermediary that um that demand certain standards from the people who put their houses into or B. and B. and um I've used it a few times and I you know I'm someone who stayed in a lot of hotels and just sort of accustomed to that drill\nAnd um you have to get past the idea that there's no one at the front desk right mhm but once you get past the idea of that than all the things that you like about staying home or or a condo rather than hotel come to the fore you usually pay a little bit less you have a little bit more room you can feel a little bit like you're in a home away from home and ...\nI mean you can look to the previous reviews from people who have stayed in the same place if there are no reviews maybe skip it and find one where you know you've seen enough people who have stayed there before\nAnd liked it and and I think as far as your money goes it goes through air being be on the way to the owner so a ... it's not going to take your money and run right though I think you you and also pay with a credit card so that if anything bad happens of course you can just eat it but I've never ever ever once heard about ... it'd be it'd be taking when he wants money and running\nAnd in fact um I think the first few years of everybody and be the hotel industry didn't really take them seriously as competition but that has changed and in fact I should mention\nThat I'm Mary it is actually realized that they are going to try and fight fire with fire and so there's they've been signing up people who have homes in London Paris Roman Lisbon and there's going to be a myriad sort of\nAnswer to air in the\nUm that they're going to make them outfit their homes to marry that standard but what really cracks me up is on the website the Marriott urges would be host to make sure that their homes are furnished with unique pieces to reflect personality for the heck I mean because when I think the Marriott Hotel\nOn the right person out a lot of fish [laughter] so does that put your mind to rest at about ... we wouldn't worry about it\nYes it should just make sure you get those or do you is that Yes sir and don't forget there's someone at air B. and B. who can help you if you have any trouble while you're at the state as well so thank\nYou very much for calling Joe now we're or not Joe but Jonah from queens hey Jones were alive on the travel show can we help ya\nYes Hi gentlemen thank you for taking my call howdy high on\nMy family and I are in the planning stages of a trip and one of the places where you are considering within Francisco ... and in doing research about San Francisco it seems that there's an exploding homeless problem and there are certain streets that can't be\nYou know you can't go down the street and\nCompanies are canceling conventions because of the the ... state of of the the streets in a homeless problem and I'm Wondering is that somewhat true or is it is it an exaggeration yeah\nYou know there's some truth to it we can't we can't sugar coat it you know a lot of the people who come to California as homeless people come because they know they're not going to freeze to death over the winter so as as social services fall apart in other states California gets more people coming there just to keep themselves safe\nOh Chris in your opinion is someone who covers California do you know every single day in the Los Angeles times what the situation in in San Francisco and how does it impacted a trip there\nUm is it is a factor to think about and it's certainly in the last five years almost news has become more pronounced as the cost of owning or renting a place in the city has gone up so um if if you want to\nSee less of it or stay off market street market street for many years has been a place where you have kind of seen a lot of light in San Francisco they've been really working hard to improve it in a number of new like high tech businesses along that court or but still if you're off market street that will help\nAnd if you're not in the tenderloin neighborhood that's that's sort of ground zero for for desperation and\nA lot of ways you mentioned ... each earlier during the program that's a pretty good neighborhood to stand up and measurements work is more tourists the but it's also considered a good neighborhood to stay in absolutely yep so I mean that will you will have some of it but it is avoidable\nUm and if you just have your streets march the way you would in New York City um I think you can handle it it's a it but you know remember New York city like in the eighties and the seventies he wouldn't go to the lower east side too much you know it just it just didn't feel very comfortable that's sort of like that but mostly in the tenderloin and around the civic center\nI'm been in a lot of other parts of town they're coming up so quickly you know when when Twitter moves in and and you know work for seals worst moves in you know they they tend to squeeze out a lot of this stuff and so the lowly happening but maybe not quick enough\nYou know and the their convention a judge will is still pretty darn fault so if you're anywhere near the ... convention center I'm you're still going to see lots of people\nYeah yes oh yes it is a concern but you know I'm no more than I think it has been in lots of other American cities in the past and hopefully we'll\nOn almost salesman among the phone all day\nLong and I I live by showing I deal with people all day long\nAnd it's not often I get the courtesy

shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond ... studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where it needed\nAnd also even studies about the viscous city the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood flows through the beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels all of that put
