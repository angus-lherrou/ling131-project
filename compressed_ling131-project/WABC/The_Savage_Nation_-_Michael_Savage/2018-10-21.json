shelters personal staff at the ... and be\nSo uh so basically the fed is not that powerful in European\nNo sense I just don't I don't see it I think everything hinges off of what the fed doing but uh that's just how I take it I mean\nI'm not as learned as you are but I I don't I I it appears to me this is just as somebody who maybe isn't as in the know where you are a it appears to me that the fed is almost trying to derail the economic growth we're experiencing I mean it it\nUh I don't know why we should have rates or be raised any more we've raised them enough the economy hasn't cratered but we have experienced a\nTo a mini corrections in the last you know so many months wouldn't that be time to stop or the rate hikes for a while\nI Do agree with you about this there's no need for the fed to raise interest rates inflation is as low as it is by the inflation is extremely low and extremely stable\nSo I agree with that my my point is that even if the fed does raise interest rates and it seems like we're stuck with it that's what they intend to do [noise]\nAh it isn't going to turn upside down now you mentioned some setbacks in the stock market to lose while I'm In February and another one very recently\nThey don't seem to ... the fed is actually doing they results I think from an uprising of uncertainties about different things and the fed could be pounds of uncertainty ah butts or the the actual\nActions by the fed don't ... anymore with downturns pauses or even stock market panics\nNow a ... when I'm when we're talking about the history of interest rates when when did the fed kind to start this and I also want you to talk about\nUh later on inflation because and and flushed this out for the average person you know we hear this stuff than\nIf you're in finance you kind of know a little bit but the average listener I think's clueless as to how these all kind of are interconnected even when you said you know inflation is low the average person might say hey you know my my cost of a\n... a gallon of milk is going up a little bit I cost of bread is going up my packaging is you know I remember when they give you usually give you a half gallon of ice cream now half gallon is\nThe uh uh there is no such thing they give you a pint for the cost to half gallon used to you used to cost you know what I'm saying\nWell yes so we have lots of inflation over the years when I say inflation is slow or low now that's because we haven't really had any substantial changes in the average price of all the goods and services in the last year or two\nSilver\nThe history of strays and the history of the Fed's involvement and interest rates go back I Would say the best place to start looking at this is around Nineteen thirty nine when they don't break the law\nOr in Europe or the United states already was starting to prepare for the eventuality that it would be how involved in the end the war and they needed to be financially\nI'm ... I'm well equipped for that and the fed began at that point\nTo a fix a multi decade to fix it and just strange but to get involved in the\nInterest rate market and it did so in the market it was a ... influencing the long term bond\nPrices on long term bond\nYields a bike in Nineteen Seventy nine forty and this and of course when the U.S to go to war in ... she won a there was a a logic Spanish and in this plan\nAnd their idea was to keep interest rates as low as possible so the federal government could borrow at very favorable writes in order to finance its war effort\n[noise] and that's a evolved over time it was um a effective during the war and then after the war\nThere was a short period where the fed really didn't have a functions of that sort\nOf the beginning of the Nineteen fifties and of course we had another war of that time the Korean War but at this point the fed has moved over to take it a more interested in short term interest rates and the fed began to peg\nShort term interest rates roughly\nI'm the Korean War came to an end to speak Peggy short term interest rates ever since\n... were were David ... talking about the history of interest rates so basically the fed has been\nShould we say manipulating do you think it's been a constructive force in the economy and negative force\nFor my opinion is that they have ... latest constructive that she'll find many many economists so fake at times this is very disputed my own belief is that a\nFinancial markets couldn't take care of their own and that the interest rate that they come up with\nIs the right to strike to allow the economy to operate without any frictions ... manipulating interest rates are creating uncertainties and frictions wish for that so that that's my personal point of view\n... and and we're seeing this too with a lot of people questioning the independence of the fed now\nAnd I'm trying to bolster their independence and in some way or almost like the U.S Supreme Court members there they're appointed by the president but they're trying to say hey we're independent no matter what and we're not going to let the president tell us how to\nAccommodate I mean by their party you know it it's been sort of a staple\nBut what about the the the onlookers who says you know\nWhen uh we had a president that was maybe ... more palatable the members of the fed or interest rates were kept a low for a little too long\nAnd they always invoke you know these various rules\nTo say well no we were following this rule but then when you look at the rule or that might have caused for negative interest rates and I want you to flush the sound way that our listeners been sort of understand what's going on with\nNegative interest rates the Taylor rule inflation and the next segment because I think a lot of people\nAre are kind of clueless on that their eyes glaze over so we're going to take one more or the next segment to break down all of these rules that the fed uses\nAnd we'll talk about inflation up next this is Josh ... the financial quarterback and if you want the window of opportunity review there is a seven year window\nOf an opportunity to potentially get smart about taxes on your retirement\nThe smart retirement book will be yours free when you schedule and keep your no obligation review will be in New York New Jersey Connecticut Long Island in Pennsylvania so call us now waited eight Ninety they Josh shaded eight ... five six seven for don't touch that dial\nA deferred vehicles such as for all one k.'s and IRAs sound good upfront but did you realize that when you retire you'll have to pay taxes on all your earnings you can legally minimize your taxes when you withdraw retirement funds with tax free IRAs and other tax favorite accounts\nCalled the ... ski advisory group now had eight eight eight nine eight eight Josh that's eight eight eight nine eight eight J.

C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff\nYou get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life in Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I knew that we turn to him or the ... the green tea in the Cuban your new green she she aren't liquid soft you know formula which purity is giving away free and first tell me about the third nutrients in the list the risk of enrichment which is super hot right now some of the headlines and the science behind ...\nI Know it's from red wine and the French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera troll is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries\nWhat we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation\nIn tissue and insulin sensitivity ... helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator\nAnd you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called\nFrench paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but was there a trial appears to be key in that and additionally\nThere is a brain benefit like there is with the Kirk human\nWith blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resume or a trial you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that we're just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing all she needed the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes medicine hunters will chrysalis laser in on how this wonderful formula you created to ... to ...\nI Know the purity it's been a business now for\nWhat is you know Twenty years ago ... reading the better Business Bureau and\nPeople can get a complementary bottle of this green T.
