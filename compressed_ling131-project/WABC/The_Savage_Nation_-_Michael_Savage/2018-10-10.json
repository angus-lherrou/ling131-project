state in which every damn so has an appropriate place and an appropriate punishment\nDante did not know it at the time but he wrote an apt description for socialism when he said this the miserable condition afflicts the melancholy of those who live without infamy our praise\nThis call from Bernie Sanders to quote build and our common humanity and do everything that we can to oppose all the forces weather on accountable government power or on accountable corporate power who tried to divide us up and set us against each other have you heard this before\nDoes that sound like the American ideal of being free to use our individual talents to achieve the best that we can for ourselves and in turn providing goods and services for those who can't or does it sound like the hell adult they describe\nNow this is not the first time America has flirted with socialism\nIt's happened before and later on I Will tell you about Eugene Debs the outspoken leader of the labor movement\nWho oppose Woodrow Wilson of the socialist party in the Nineteen presidential Ninety draw presidential cabinet election and we're going to talk about socialism communism and now the street riots are being whipped up by these leaders such as Bernie Sanders and others in fact Hillary Clinton today as you will hear\nTells us to no longer be several he tells you tells the mobs we no longer and should not have a civil society so where does that leave us\nIt leaves us with the police\nIt leaves us with the men and women of law enforcement they are the only bury a we have between us and the mobs\nAnd stop mass hysteria you heard me right is dedicated to the men and women of law enforcement who are on the front lines protecting the rest of us from the violent radical left wing street criminals who has a who's goal is to terror society into pieces that's the dedication to my book\nAnd I have asked those of you\nWho believe in the police and believe in my message and the bigger message pleased by a copy of this book and give it to a local policemen or a local police precinct show them that you care\nAnd so my motto is donate a copy to a cop\nI realize it's an uphill battle to get some attention in the media today I Know that seven books came out yesterday had my book come out three weeks ago it would've been number one on the New York times list immediately because there's no more perfect book for the times the mass hysteria none better\nBut it didn't come out three weeks ago it didn't come out two weeks ago it doesn't come out a week ago it came out of the worst possible time which was yesterday when seven major books came out\nIn the political arena so we have an uphill battle to get our message across in a very short window at that and we'll talk about what we have to do to stop the communists from taking over our society which leads me to the main question of the day\nIf you are attacked or harassed by left us as we see going on in this country whether the congressmen senators in Washington DC restaurants or and hallways or in Portland, Oregon where a bunch of black lives matter thugs\nTook over the streets and directed traffic illegally while a cop stood by in Portland on a motorcycle doing nothing what would you do what are you allowed to do if you're in a restaurant with your wife with say\nI'm Talking to you the whites of America because you're being targeted make no mistake about it this is all aimed at whites in America is a race war it's a class war and is being conducted negatively in this nation you listen to the rhetoric and don't accused me you're making anything up\nBecause when they were screaming at the people to the streets of Portland directing traffic these dogs\nWhat did they say get out get off the street Whitey you're\nAn old weak Whitey get off the street Whitey\nAnd so they have they have whipped up the wins the Nancy Pelosi telling everyone to be a disruptor and now we are all facing the world when that I don't mean hurricane Michael\nSo I mean they ask you a simple question what can you do within the confines of the law if you are sitting at a restaurant\nAnd the group of these dogs come up to you and try to chase you out of a restaurant what are your rights\nYou know where this is going to go because I Know where this is going to go\nFirst of all in California pepper spray is legal\nSo if you live in California and you are a conservative and you want to talk about your politics over dinner which is you're right in America and some thug called some thug by Instagram to come there and harassed you you warn them\nThat you will protect yourself if they do not get out of your face that you feel threatened\nNow what's gonna happen here is that every restaurant that America is going to have to hire security guards that is where this was going because the liability here is in the restaurant by the way you ever right if you are seated in a restaurant\nTo have a piece of peaceable dinner peaceful dinner you're allowed to sit there and eat your customer\nAt a restaurant has the right to refuse the service to anyone by the way\nSo they have an obligation to protect your so is the same applies in any place of business uh what's her name Maxine Waters the hater\nHas been screaming for months if you see them in a department store if you see them at a gas station chased them chase them harassed them\nShe is committing crimes by doing so that's not free speech if you cross state lines\nTo foment a riot you're violating several federal laws at once Maxine Waters belongs in prison for what she has been doing but we are cowards who are afraid to go near her for fear that book called a racist but what are you gonna do if you were in a filling station\nAnd let us say one of these groups she's you I don't know where the magma had in the back of your car or stop mass hysteria book on your seat and they come up and start screaming at you what are you legally allowed to do to protect yourself\nWhere does the liability of the gas station light\nYou can have a cop on every corner you can't have a cop and every gas station you can't have a cop and every restaurant at the end
