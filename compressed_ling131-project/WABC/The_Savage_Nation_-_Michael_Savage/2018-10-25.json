wake up today and I see that Andy blooper perhaps the most vacuous person in the history of the media they gave him a pair of clear eyeglasses to make it look like an intellect\nAndy blooper on CNN says he's no longer going to show pictures of the hordes of illegal aliens approaching our southern border to invade this nation for the free things he said no we're not going to do that anymore because they're not a threat to the nation Andy why don't you take a few into your apartment\nWhy don't you put your money where your mouth is and take a few of them in and then I'll believe a word you say\nNow here's the guardian us rights ... book demand George sauce faces attacks rooted in anti Semitism right on time anyone who attacks George sauces and anti Semite\nNow I find that bubbly offensive for three different reasons even though I say W offensive it's actually Tripoli offensive they say that anyone who attacks George Soros is doing it because they're anti Semite let me deal with that for a minute I'm probably more Jewish than George Soros that's number one\nAnd if you're going to tell me as a person of the Jewish faith\nIs not allowed to criticize another person in the Jewish faith without being called an anti Semite I Will say to you go to hell how's that George Soros is the most disruptive individual in the history of the American political system nobody has ever spent more money to disrupt more advanced than this man he has funded\nOn the far you know the good folks have been beating people up and attacking police George Soros funds them\nBlack lives matter don't tell me they're not a domestic terrorist group because I disagree with you that's my opinion what because as the word black and I can't say that they are violence is something I should ignore sorry I see him and I call them as I see them\nDon't hide behind the Holocaust and anti Semitism every time someone criticizes George that is a standard operating procedure on the American left I've seen it a thousand times in my life George and you know I think people are on to you\nAnd I do think that the government has an obligation to investigate any zillionaire who sets out to disrupt the political system\nBecause that's what you do that is what you do for a living us funded that detectable group media matters ever since I've been in radio they've been smearing me\nAnd why have you done it to keep us off your back George Soros and your son your pee wee pitched squeak son there is never or the diamond his life of his own sits there and there's a big big tower they're throwing missiles down at the world you and your son and you have the nerve to publish an article today saying\nThe president and his anti Semite supporters ought to blame for bombs being sent to his father's house says that the little son\nHe wrote a new op ed for the New York times called the hate that it's consuming us this is ironic since George Soros funds hate groups I mean it's unbelievable to make sure us funds the biggest the most powerful hate groups in the country and he says the hatred is consuming us and then he says his father has long faced anti Semitism\nOh really but something changed the twenty sixteen he calls in America the stop demonizing politicians Diddy then why does your father fun groups to demonize Donald Trump once you start your own backyard Alexander Soros\nGeorge Soros son uh nobody called against it as a threat to the future of American democracy and he hit out at the president and the New York times op ed entitled to hate that is consuming us\nNow this kid Alexander ... in my estimation if he didn't have a father was a bit you know like his father he couldn't get a job selling apple computers in in Zimbabwe I don't think you'd get a job selling computers anywhere\nThen he jumps ready to white supremacist an anti Semite ... this is stupid or just stupid they're all trying to hide behind a standard operating things that they use so let me read you my latest headline and I'll see what you have\nBut I'm sitting here waiting for them to release the Lee Harvey Oswald I Want to know who the Lee Harvey Oswald is\nAnd by the way this is all an attempt by the way if it's left or right wing who's doing this so we don't really know at this point but you got to read my headline to to actually hear what I said\nI said mail bombs high probability they could be false flags to distract from hordes of illegal aliens\nThat's a logical statement high probability could be false flags high probability could be false flags to distract from hordes of illegal aliens who have been dropped off the news or screens and everything was marching army coming from under us just suddenly disappeared\nRight so you know you don't put two and two together now I don't know who planted the bombs neither the you but I'm waiting to see who the Lee Harvey Oswald is going to be who's the patch either going to dig up\nWhen will the passing be shown high probability that could be false flags to distract from hordes every legal aliens now we can talk about that if you want the phone number is eight five five four and seven to eight too\nBut as I said yesterday and I was the first one to say this I thought it was laughable that four of those receiving these quote bombs or check their mail at the very same time\nAnd prior to the normal delivery time of mail in their areas I thought it was ironic and really suspicious to me I didn't say all of them I said three or four of them at the same time\nRight now this plot was coordinated by someone and yet it if they did all of law enforcement in DC and New York Florida how could how could that be do you have a department of homeland security that looks for these lone wolves\nAlso as I said yesterday and I was the first to say a copy today by America as a news blowhard none of the packages were stamped none of them were posted marked rather meeting there were all hand delivered\nSo they were hand delivered but we haven't seen one image of one surveillance camera on all of these high powered billionaires property so that was that even possible\nHow how is that possible\nWhy would a conservative give left this this kind of talking point two weeks before the most important election of our time\nAnd by the way any bomb expert who intended to target a hope a high profile individual would they put a bomb in an area they know would be checked by an assistant of the target not to target themselves I mean if you were a nut\nAnd yours evil nut and the violent nut and you wanted to hurt somebody would you put your bomb in a place where you know the person you're intending to harm never even picks up the mail\nRight you know that Obama doesn't get his own man you know Soros doesn't get his own male you know Hillary doesn't get our own male so do you have to have any common sense anymore is there any common sense left\nNow by the way where did they get the private addresses of these people where they get the private address of George Soros and good tone in New York I didn't know about it until yesterday with the day before\nThese addresses a non public information and ah didn't a democratic staffer recently got arrested for stealing Republican addresses from the office of Sheila Jackson so who was it who stole these private addresses from the Democrats files that's where they got him from\nRight now what about CNN the most evil network in the history this is not a network this is out of the Soviet Union union CNN is the equivalent of his ... and probably the wrapped in together\nSo they open their package they took a picture of it before calling the police of the bomb squad\nRight they opened and it took a picture of it before calling the police of the bomb squad or you people back gullible to believe that a company like CNN would open a suspicious package without calling the bomb squad first or they're in on the scam\nRemember what I'm saying to you I'm humid or using common sense\nAnd then the mainstream media outlets all had the same talking points uh at the same time\nSo I think that this is either a classic sigh op operation in order to distract us from the actual mob violence against conservatives and also to distract us from the army that is marching towards our southern border from Honduras\nThe Democrats had a disaster with the Kavanaugh hearings Dianne Feinstein little trick blew up in her face\nShe tried to crucify Kavanaugh was a false set of claims and the whole country turned against her except Democrat operatives so that blew up in their face\nThen they figured let's get a couple of hundred marching in from Honduras women and children with carriages will do this again to Trump all of a sudden thousands joins then more thousands joined then more thousands joined and now it's an army mainly of strapping young men of military age marching towards our border with new sneakers and new clothing\nAnd where were they getting their food from Diane\nHow can they all have clean clothing on where the washing machines along the way this washing machines in the desert\nWhere how would they keeping themselves clean where are they going to the bathroom George\nOr even the most knuckle dragging conservative can ask these questions we don't need the blank stare at Andy cope with the answer it for us\nWe don't need those stooges on MSNBC to answer it for us you know most of us are very intelligent George you may not know that living in your little tower their hatred\nThat George Soros tower of hate where your number one product is dispelling hate against Donald Trump and the American people voted for George that's why you're despised in this country not because of anti Semitism well I've got to take a quick break because this

people live and die by what they see on television and they think that what they see on television is the truth we are in such trouble\nBecause most of your don't read books most of you don't read newspapers the only true that you believe is what you see on TV\nAnd in fact as an entire generation that knows nothing that does not come out on social media the gospel for you is not the Bible nor the word of Jesus nor the word of Mohammed nor the word of Moses nor of Abraham the gospel is what the\nJudge to run the social media to tell you is the gospel they're they're the ones giving you the revelations of today\nAnd uh the president knows very well how to use the media thank God which is why he's fighting back it has more power than you could imagine more power than any president except

think the age of thinking is over I think the age of ... dead\nAnd so now we have this thing about the suspicious packages and none of it makes sense to anybody who could still think\nSoros bomb was the first one the next day gives a speech thing Donald Trump will be gone by twenty twenty or sooner that kicked off the entire football game the very next day a multitude a plethora of such\nSuch a bombs or packages that looked like bombs appear and all of a sudden the whole country's in lockdown\nAnd what is the ... what are the people in the media tells you immediately they jump to the conclusion that it's right winger right winger as right wing or as anti Semite Trump supporters Ku Klux Klan ... immediately there they were central casting psi ops from the top to the bottom\nRight out of the communist playbook right out of animal farm clearly psi ops in the minds of anyone who knows where I'm even talking about\nSo the propaganda or is it spinning the propaganda is running around the clock the narrative has already been laid down\nAnd there's no answers to what this is why didn't they release the wind that releasing the surveillance footage there's got to be on all these properties heavy duty cameras but I've said this over and over again yesterday I said it today and today apparently or\nI won't be voted against them are they made a big mistake of quoting me and uh\nSo many newspapers from my show yesterday and I think the reason they quoted me was not so much to um ... me for me to be quoted all over the country all over the world even from Australia to England\nOn the calling in a false flag even by the left and it's interesting to me that this one is the one they picked up on\nDaily Beast which is a left wing publication owned by one of the most senior spent on the planet says minutes after news broke of potential explosive devices being melted the homes of four presidents Barry Obama Bill Clinton the longest standing in the dark corners of the conservative Internet would declaring\nThey secret plot to gin up empathy for Democrats than they say right wing radio host Michael Savage outright declared quote it's a high probability that the whole thing is set up as a false flag to gain sympathy for the Democrats end to get our minds off the hordes of illegal aliens approaching our southern border\nNow I Would ask berry dealer who owns that it doesn't very dealer on the Daily Beast yeah I Would ask berry dealer in Beverly Hills or wherever you may live or the Upper West side of New York does he actually want more illegal aliens in Beverly Hills in in the Upper East side of New York\nHe how many housekeeper skinny have how many gardeners cutting\nNeed in Beverly Hills why does buried Dylan make believe he wants armies of illegal aliens coming into America does he think he's fooling\nHe's a brilliant manage the successful man he's a billionaire he's got everything in the world and his building by the way on the west side is one of the most beautiful buildings in Manhattan\nI remember when we were tied up at that dock couple of years ago and they got the big yacht I saw this most beautiful glass building and it was his I said boy this guy is really smart sees that smart why does he continue to pound the drum for open borders along with his good buddy Iraq Obama Bill Clinton\nGeorge Soros and Jeff Zucker\nI Wonder if they actually meet somewhere of some kind of dark restaurant and have some kind of meeting my if I'm One of his the dark corners of the of the media and the right wing or as they say that I should
