I'm surprised that boat tied into rip it off yet and make believe that it was his like he did three four five times this year why did X bow tie not do it\nWell there's a story about bow tie in his connections to see you have to understand the connections between many people in the media and the very same ah connections let's put it to you that way\nYou don't know about that of course because you are kept in the dark as I told you many times you only see the shadows on the wall you don't actually see the players ... see the people who are lighting the fires behind the players all you see the shadows on the wall\nSo how do I Michael Savage the independent\nStand a chance in this forest of shadows how\nI'm going to ask you another question why is it that Trump's war became a number one book on the New York times without any appearances on any TV shows why is it that that my obscure book God faith and reason\nBecame a best seller without any media except maybe a it was certainly on the Drudge Report which is an enormous and big the TV show I was on was the Huckabee show\nOn an obscure network disease and honest guy this guy said on a straight shooter he likes to get at the truth but every last one of them on Fox News is absolutely afraid to talk about me for some reason I think I Know the reason why\nAnd it has nothing to do with the intelligence agency\nSo what I Want to do for you today is asked these questions\nI Want to find out why you think this big story of her connections or her legit connections so far not this proven or not being picked up by the media why I don't understand it you say well OK people are afraid well I'm afraid I'm other increased security as a result\nOf that posting by the way but I have to ask myself\nMaybe they're a rogue factions inside the CIA who were actually in favor of\nThe patriotic side maybe not every element of the CIA reports to duty\nFor that bomb that they threw out the Trump pulled is a security clearances of I forget his name Brennan maybe there's a lot of Brennan holdovers do you think they could act rogue or are the robes going to stop the road from acting grow I don't know\nI Know this I'm so far in there's no way to go out\nYou understand what I'm saying to you I Am so deeply committed to the truth there's no way to pull myself out of it I Can't I Can't go back there is no going home again do you understand that\nEither you are in this business to get to the truth or get the hell out of this business then you're nothing but a clown you may as well get Emmett Kelly up their beeping a horn calling himself it gets\nEr but of just get Emmett Kelly to get up there in Belgium the air every day and call themselves a radical wild conservative because that's what you're getting now\nYou're getting clouds making believe they're really getting the truth I don't see the truth out there it's the same garbage every day Democrats though good Republicans excellent Donald Trump Virginia's Donald Trump the greatest Donald Trump this Donald Trump that Well Donald Trump's great but he's not everything they say is\nNor is he that great by the way and so here we are facing the music is wanting to read Trump trade deal with Canada and Mexico\nOn and on on and on the trumpet tears were out they're\nGlorifying the new NAFTA deal did any of them actually look into the deal oh I did I looked into the NAFTA deal the one that was greatly loaded this morning or as some great savior of America's businesses\nAnd I was actually stunned to see it's all BS by the way\nDid you know the Canadian oil exports up to a to point six million cars will not be impacted by the U.S tariffs on foreign cars\nDid you know that Mexico got the same threshold level of exporting two point six million cars in to the u._s. but here's the kicker neither country export\nExports that many cars to the U.S so much smoke and mirrors it's ... it's just a charade it's just a charade the businessmen who are running the country are doing a very good job in the economy on the economy\nDidn't do anything for the average ... out there nothing I saw nothing in this\nThat's positive so what do you want me to do get up you're like Emmett Kelly and tell you it's wonderful because the blimp does it every day and the bloody throw it does it every day what do you want me to do be one of them I won't be one of them I'm an independent I always have been always will be\nAnd so therefore have to go back to the original story\nWhy is this major story being ignored by the media\nWhy how do you let this happen all these talk shows have call in lines why don't you call in and ask all these great genius was in the media why they don't report about this is it because I brought it to light or what what their bosses told them no no no no you can't touch that one no no we don't go there\nWe don't go there it always stick to the basic vanilla maybe get vanilla swirl every once in awhile but you're not going to get into the real McCoy yeah we don't want to go there\nWell those are some of the questions that are really bothering me right now because this is a gigantic story which is Dr fraud\nNow don't get me wrong I don't think cabinet or is the uh Knight in shining armor that they want them to be a great choice but he's a Bush\nMiddle of the road Republican how many times do I have to say that to you know he's not the flaming conservative that the illegitimate or making them out to be he is a middle of the road conservative judge from the Bush administration but even that's too conservative for the communists thieves on the other side\nAnd I still don't understand that despite all of the attention on her why Donald Trump himself does not stand up there and say wait a minute now Senator
