Time for the midterms here's another quote\nSpontaneous group coming in from Central America spontaneous right\nWell is it spontaneous who is funding the migrant caravan\nYou're not much it costs to bring each one of these people over to this country about seven thousand dollars each one is the per capita income in Honduras to point three thousand a year so where the money come from when it comes from who's sending in their money\nWhere did it come from well we've traced it for you it's not a mystery you can pretty much say it it's a word that begins with an asset ends with an S. and it's five letters left this billionaire and all around America had earned Trump pay their George Soros\nIs clearly in the minds of those who have studied this funding that's\nThere are also American Ultra left his foundations in corporations supporting this open borders policy you want the names coalition\nCalled Tara family detention pro bono project and who are the Catholic legal immigration network who

lawyers from New York the way is three to four groups that I just mentioned are funded by the George Soros is open society foundation [noise]\nSo I friends there is a leader as well of this group of invaders\nAnd what is the oppression that their allegedly fleeing from\nWhat ... what's the oppression and Honduras they're running from well\nThe answer is as according to my knowledge remittances what is remittances mean that's the money sent home by so called illegals who've come here are ready and pay no taxes and work or scam or bringing drugs and send money home to them\nThis asylum scam and open borders and free cities and things of that nature is all about money so something's happened here and the remittances for America or the main engine of support\nFor the country of Honduras the remittances sent back from America to Honduras comprise Seventeen percent of Honduras is gross domestic product ... eleven according to World Bank estimates the second largest share of any country

all little loud mouth like well who who the black leaders what you got Louis ... Jews he's busy on his latest anti Semitic tirade he's not concerned about the illegal immigration\nThe leaders of the African American community who are standing silently by while the bottom of the nation is being invaded and the services that should go to Americans for black and white together are going to non citizens tell me what the black leadership is\nWears out big mouth the shark Sharpton where's the irrelevant Jesse Jackson has disappeared from the landscape ... not seen any more it seems like he's run out of steam where are they\nNow what are we going to do about this is the question we know who's doing it to us the part that got me\nReally angry was hearing them singing the national anthem and waving their Honduran flags it bothered me deeply because here in America one of your last heard your national anthem what have you last senior flag being waved\nYou go to a boxing match and what do you see Mexican flags on during the flags of Salvadoran flags because they're great boxers and I admire the fighting spirit that great warriors and I admire that but they are in my country\nI never want to hear a foreign national anthem played in this nation again I don't want to hear it it gets me sick\nIf I'm In a sporting event I only want to hear the U.S national anthem that's how I feel and I'll tell you something else if this keeps up there's going to be a revolution in this country it'll be the second the American revolution not the second civil war member I've been telling you stop stop becoming civil war\nMy most recent book is stopped the mass hysteria\nI'm telling you if this keeps up and if Trump doesn't stop it there will be a second American Revolution because the people have had it not up to here were drowning in illegal aliens were drowning in them\nWere drowning in the lives of their Chuck Schumer is Nancy Pelosi's these leaders millionaires and billionaires who make believe that they care about the poor from these countries\nBut what goes around comes around I tried to stop the mass hysteria did not I tried to warn Pelosi to shut up big mouth and stopped stirring up hatred as I said it's going to come around to bite you and guess what had happened to her in Florida\nA group came in mob to her she had to run away screaming with our security guards I tried to warn these left this there's going to be blowback what goes around comes around I said Nancy Pelosi shame on you shame on you with your big mouth\nRemember what I said many times read the Bible\nYou will have sought the wind and you will reap the whirlwind\nBut it goes for all of us in this great nation I Am an immigrant son that gives me a very special position in the American media there aren't too many like me who made it to the position I meant I I Can't name of one

only so many resources and with all the vast amounts of poor people in this country can we really afford to take in all of the poor of the world of course we can't\nGo tell that to the pope go tell that to Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer and Governor Cuomo and Governor Brown all of whom would not be an office were not for the votes of people who don't even belong in this
