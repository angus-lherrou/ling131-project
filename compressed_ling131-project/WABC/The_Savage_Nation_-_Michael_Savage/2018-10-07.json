did you how do you answer people say you're too young to teach them about finance\nAnd and I'm really excited to hear your answers book that I Know there's a couple of things I think because of the journey that I that I went on I I took two years to learn and didn't make money in those two years\nI uh really know what I'm Talking about as as long as I can say that it's I I think one of the thing is when when it usually the guards are up first couple of minutes but there's a reason I wrote a book there's a reason I have a podcast or the reason I'm doing all this stuff is so that like\nThat we can share share knowledge and so people are pretty like once they understand that\nI Know my stuff and they trust me I'm it's usually it's\nUsually not a problem at all and then the other thing that I'll say it\nLooking around as most people in our business is going to be around and you need that involves um and and I there is a good chance that I I I Will live longer than most people in our business because\nMost people in our business are over the age fifty\nAnd um and so those are the two things it hasn't been much of an issue I think because of the approach that cake and but it it could very well I could very well encounter those in the future for sure\n[noise] yeah I mean I I tell people I Believe Alexander Hamilton was Twenty one and Seventeen Seventy six many of the founding fathers okay the the people we base our lives upon\nOur constitution our declaration of independence I believe Thomas Jefferson was thirty three year old he wrote that for many founding fathers were younger than forty in Seventeen Seventy six in fact a dozen of them were thirty five or younger\nAnd so all we all have the same amount of time you know people always say to me you know ... ... how did you how did you do what you're doing why didn't screw around in my twenties I applied myself so the\nYou know not no judgment that people you know want to have fun you know whatever their twenties but uh yeah I got married when I was Twenty one twenty two bought my first house and it was like twenty Twenty one\nSo it's we all the same amount of time and people don't realize that decade from twenty to thirty is one of the most impactful decades of your life why you could work like two AM and get up at six and you don't write you really don't feel it\nI mean I I amassed so much knowledge Marquis de Lafayette was Eighteen James Monroe was Eighteen in Seventeen Seventy six Arab or was twenty Nathan Hale was Twenty one Benjamin ... was twenty two governor Morris twenty four Betsy Ross was\nTwenty four James Madison was twenty five Henry knocks twenty five ah there's there's much John Paul Jones was twenty eight John J. was thirty Benjamin Rush was thirty he's an unsung hero of um [noise] you know the early colonial era Robert living sim was twenty nine\nOut of jail Adams was thirty one Elbert Jerry was thirty one Thomas Jefferson thirty three ... um you know there's more to but you know people don't realize that you can accomplish a lot when you're young\nAnd and we can ... we could probably have a cold conversation on there\nIs some some other time about how the education system I think is really make much grow up later you know I think I saw them in a ... thirty now now the twenty which is quite sad\nMm and that's the thing you know people still ever does it you know you know not everybody does it there is a counter culture brewing\nAnd you know many people are decrying you know what's going on I'm tired of the world that's going to\nHell are you know uh you know this person does this and the Obama does that and and my answer is change the children changed the world for a reason why we educate our kids are at home I mean these kids know so much more than I did\nAnd I was blessed with a with the great dad and mom who taught me a lot at home but uh\nSo I so I mean I was probably I was in public school I just saw how much time wasted\nRight and you know nothing against public educators or we have a ton of good ah listeners who are teachers as well my wife is public school teacher but it it just you know it it's a it's a function of time\nNow I go okay the end as you mentioned pillar number one\nEfficiency mhm\nAnd we're going to talk to pillar two and three but first we're going to go to the phone lines and we have Ken go ahead Ken your own with Josh Dylan ski and Kayla Williams\nA show just wonder what you think about if you have a non Charlie life insurance policy and you're over funded sort of points um right before it does not turn into a ... or modified the Dow the contract or the deferred taxes\n[noise] yeah it could be a great strategy depends on the type of policy or you know whether you're talking universal or whole um do

about how your approach in the book could maybe help the gentleman who's looking to get you know being conservative but also grow\nRight I I I when people ask like\nPicture about my book I I tell them what separates by go through a lot of other people out there is\nI'm not teaching what to do I'm showing you a better way to do what you're currently doing so versus like I'm more teaching how and so but I Do with my clients and it's it's not for everyone I I'm a little bit by it I think most people need to read my book and apply it because it can literally help anyone but what I ... I Would say is\nLook like I Would simply say\nPut your money in a place it's going to go the rest of your life but it's only going to grow conservatively three to five percent you\nKnow and attack three three to five percent could be an equivalent to six or seven not not that great and\nThen be smart investor and invest in things that you understand\nAnd and if that Amazon rate\nOr is that real estate greatest that helping you make more money great so does my big thing is I take a step back and say\nI don't want to comment on the stocks that I think that you even ask the question you're on the right track because you're sticking a information I think taking it taking a step back yourself in a due process and that strategy to gab dollars that I said for the rest of my life and\nBut I think my coach can help you do whatever you're currently doing better\nFantastic final break up the hour we'll go to a final question and get the book it's going to help you I think to one of the things I Would say is you're looking at it as an either or you're looking you're saying I Do I Do\nGrowth stocks or income stocks I Would say you need a process first so called and said it eight nine today Josh for the process and will help you ate it eight nine today Josh we'll be back after these messages\nTax deferred vehicles such as four oh one case and IRAs sound good upfront\nBut did you realize that when you retire you'll have to pay taxes on on your earnings you can legally minimize your taxes when you withdraw retirement funds with tax free IRAs and other attacks favorite accounts calls at ... advisory group now at eight eight eight nine eight eight Josh that's eight eight eight nine eight eight Josh\nTo learn how you could enjoy a higher standard of living with these tax favorite accounts\nMake sure you don't get blindsided by taxes on your retirement plans called Josh children's ski the financial quarterback now for complimentary one hour consultation to empower your financial decisions\nLeave your checkbook at home they will not selling anything at this meeting but educate you on your many options in retirement in fact if you call right now for one of the complimentary no the tax fighting reviews they will give you a copy of the book tax free retirement as a free gift\nIf you call within the next three minutes called eight eight eight nine eight eight Josh that's eight eight eight nine eight eight Josh\nNow let's get back in the huddle with a financial quarterback\n[noise]\nJoe Lenski the financial quarterback and okay so we got two minutes left to one of the most important two minutes that you have to tell people about ah what they're going to learn in the book and why they should read the book the and apps that\nThey you know and usually I'll take a step back your audience has to know that they are the greatest asset to whether they're listening to at home or they're in their car it has to take a step back and say I a liability to bank at value and you know make decisions is\nMy greatest great value that can offer the world now and now knowing that\nWhat you have to know about money to help\nYou know increase your value as a human being and it's a book I talk about the power of the stations a how to latch might enough major especially in your life to take advantage of like ... ... arbitrary number five but like 'til the day that you die and then show you how to take full control of your money today\nLike like immediately but then on going in the future and if you have all three of those things with their right mind that whether you're an entrepreneur and best or whether you're someone that the high performer company like\nI really think that the process but you are staying strategy that can really say that your heart and um and it's it's a lot of fun I we we get to an amazing business Josh\n... degree and ask that J. lo ... who's a lover folks get the book and the big picture is the pillars are efficiency control and most of their pillar\nAntoni compounding so I'll get the book the end asset you can also look up\nAh I guess you could get it in the Amazon where they sell the ... people do it on Amazon\nOr my my website better well solution that\nI'm real solutions or you can call us for a free one\nAt eight hundred ... ...

any moment it was great and I I'm I'm sure glad I I did that get\n... and you've been to ring on was ... around the world would teach me the most about that is\nThe ability to be able to take a my band mean a lot of jazz artists you know they'll they'll go to Japan and\nEurope or something and they'll pick up a band over there and they they you know they they kind of have like a\nHodgepodge together different musicians all over the country instead of a world ah and I'm I'm lucky enough to be able like travel with my crew and it's you know it's my my little family you know and there's you know nine musicians and a couple of guys and the crew and and uh\nAnd and it's it I think that's what makes it it deal of all I mean I have some of my friends that are classical musicians and they traveled by themselves and that gets really really lonely but to be able to like you know go\nWith your same crew all over the world that's what that's what makes it fun and makes the long long travel days and stuff like that are very very ideal of all and uh and great\nAnd to use a very very special credibility sound and I'm Wondering how long did it take to developing that signature sound\nThat's something I work on every day you know the the trumpet trumpet is a very very unforgiving instruments so the early part of my day first few hours of my day is is is is paying attention to that and so over time I've been able to like craft a sound that people can recognize\nBut how I got that I'm not really sure I mean I I think if you're lucky enough either with your voice or with the trumpet or whatever you're lucky enough to have some sort of identifiable fingerprint\nMusically speaking ... you're really you're really really lucky because I mean it just there's millions and millions of great incredible jazz musicians\nBut somehow the sound of my trumpet it's sort of resonated\nWith ... in the way I play it sort of resonated with a lot of people um and\nAnd I'm I'm grateful for that but I I I Can't really put my finger on when it happened or how it happened to you know it it's just a lot of trial and error and keep practicing and keep working at it and and uh and over time it you know your audience grows in a word of mouth as a powerful thing\nHe ... and ... boot you on stage at what I Love boat you use your amazing energy on state you\nHave money it's just it's focused it's fine and it's so powerful and I'm just wondering how do you do that every night and what do you do before going up and said do you pray do you meditate to jump up and down or maybe doing some sit for energy drinks it gets people\n[laughter] I just ... approaches so I'm just wondering\nI don't I don't really have I mean I get to the the um to the show real early so I put it in a couple of hours of practice before we we hit the stage and then I just hang out with the band before maybe we could we have a glass of wine or something like that and then hit\n... made me a\nLast time you still can you tell me you don't have any possessions and you know life is just basically your ... and I'm just wondering is it still the same\nStill the same time uh I I live in a hotel in New York I checked in four and a half years ago and\nIt well [laughter]\nBut I yeah I don't I don't own a plant or a dog or a cat or I'm not really a one that's you know like possession crazy and so I'm I I adore my trumpet obviously and and I have that and the carry on bag and one suitcase and we're off to the races that's how it's done\nWell it must be liberating at these this is how I see because maybe to some people would be like scary [laughter]\nWell you'd be you'd be surprised how many really talented musicians when it comes to really putting their kind of their foot forward and being a touring musician mhm they don't want to give up that\nYeah sense of home we're having that that refuse refuge they can go to and and and and for me my refuges the road you know when I'm home I'm a little you know anti but a home in the hotel or whatever it is I'm a little more anti ... when I'm On the road it's it's that's my rep you'd\nDo you have time for anything else except music maybe have some hidden tenants who don't know I was\nA ... I'm addicted to but a lousy chess player\nI Love it but [laughter] so I'm feeling\nTerrible and then I you know try to do yoga or exercise or whatever and that's basically the day that's the day pretty much\nMhm she manages musicians play chess there's something about it\nThe yeah there's a there's a similarity to the to the improvisational aspect of jazz and you know that how you plot your\nYour mind ravaging chefs it's just that\nYou know I recognize that I've played my whole life and trumpet and and it's still in there\nApproved by the of the simplest scripture and medication\nAnd the two of us are the final steps of the real world they are available under the new law which is right which I Love you have to I like to emphasize during the first month or two\nIf that's the trend is really ... able to join us a shrinking the tumors are gone\nAnd wants to be a conflict going through the end and yes we move forward than the ... of either of any of normal genes you it's going to detecting ration system in the lab then finally when this happened this is something that's going to be called ... if it says what a number of years\nThat was the was the most rewarding in your work\nI Believe that most of it is to see their patients who was sent us about it like three month old child who is buttons or when possible place and the confidence filings they came to us around the track probably should the week so life loved\nThis was ... years ago the tribes completely recovered from ... to ... by by stone\nNow she found out that picture when she successfully married than she does her own shot their own like the company or the Joffrey this is this going to go for sure is love jobs get let me though that you don't want to be sort of come back\nIn another month for to go at it over to ... live events in life when I say twenty or Thirty years after going through that so that's the cure\nThe most beautiful uh some area to see I can imagine I'd like to remind our listeners about us on testing documentary called\n... to the movie and the movie is about you\nAnd uh became a must have success around the world received numerous or\nIt was produced by internationally award winning film director producer and ...\nAnd to find out more police visit ... ski movie dot com ... movie does come\nAnd that's be you are is Z.
