theory out there no there's no news handled through the book stop mass hysteria that's why they're not running it on Fox News because there's no connection to the news instead as a connection to a cookbook or to a cartoon book but nevertheless we plod along doing the best we can\nI Am like Donald Trump during the campaign when they said he couldn't win a and it's up to you as to whether or not the message when just that simple\nNow I realize many of you are sick and tired of hearing me talk about my book I understand that\nBut let me ask you something\nI Want to ask you what's your question have you heard about my book on the other is themes conservative shows\nHave you ever heard in the audience about Michael Savage on Fox News or any of the other so called conservative stars no you haven't so I'm Alone you're alone but the message is really most important today because unless we stop the mass hysteria\nYou will see a disaster in this nation unlike any we have seen in modern history there gunning for us\nI saw an article yesterday in Oregon\nAnd I put it on Michael Savage dot com it's a fourth down I Believe\nAnd it's shocking it's a video of Soros funded anti ... took over the streets of Portland, Oregon\nDirecting traffic blocking cars threatening people didn't obey calling anyone white a Ku Klux Klan member or a white supremacist you add militant disgusting so called feminists you\nHad airtight whites in the streets directing cars and the way that gets worse\nA Portland policemen on a motorcycle sat there and did nothing\nAnd I couldn't sleep last night thinking about the ... that is raining in San Francisco\nAnd in Portland and in Seattle and in other Dennis ... of extreme left ... that is spreading like a cancer because of a mass hysteria where they think anyone or they've been told that anyone who opposes they're communist agenda is white supremacist\nWhat they don't understand what I Do understand is that this is a civil war that has been fueled for a number of years by Nancy Pelosi who at UC Berkeley that's University of California at Berkeley like you\nAre in a commencement speech three years ago said we're all just ruptures she encouraged people to go in the streets in cause chaos to block traffic what does she think what happened or how about Maxine Waters who should be in jail for what she's doing\nA encouraging leftist fanatics like those in the fall to beat up Republicans harassed Republicans a drive them out of restaurants I refuse to live in fear that I Will not cower myself I'm a public figure\nI perhaps the most prominent member of the opposition in the San Francisco area I Will not cower to these people\nI Will protect myself at all times I'm an old boy scout I remember the boy scout motto I Will protect myself at all times and if I feel threatened I Will react accordingly I Will not be driven out of my own city of my own home and I hope you feel the same way what began with a Trump witch hunt\nHas now spread to anyone they disagree with so of course there is no tied to the news you won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News\nBecause it really isn't news hysteria there is no ... in the air what you saw against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria there was a witch hunt against Kavanaugh he wasn't the ... not up for all white male heterosexual Christians why she of course he was\nWell that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very historical times and very dangerous hysterical times and the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new house I have a new car and too many\nWhat I'm trying to do here is save America before it's too late and so I'm asking you to Savage Romney to help me and that means have you gone\nTo your local bookstore to look for the book were ... were was the book where it's supposed to be I have a list of where it's supposed to be in Walmart\nAnd Sam's it's in bestsellers and I heard was there\nAt the books and millions on they're making news table I heard it's there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble it's a purchase to be on the new release table between the night of October would just today in the twenty second of October which is not today and I have gotten one picture after another of\nThe book not being on the new release table or buried underneath other books on the new release table so it's up to you to go there and demanded the book to be put where the publisher are paid for it to be put because it's probably the most important book of our time in fact I Would say can you tell me about\nOf are more important book tell me what book tell me which book is more important right now because I don't know of one\nAnd so what happened when you went into the bookstores and what are you going to do with the book many of you are buying the book for yourself and friends to try to have a dialogue with them\nAnd that's the main thing did you buy one for your liberal neighbor to read will they even read a book you know I Am pretty active on Twitter since Trump started trading at first I thought it was for children only but I realized that there are many people who do\nTurn to these outlets for their opinions and for their for their to debate people so I put some stuff up and one of them was do you think\nFox News has blacklisted Michael Savage\nAnd why well I Know why\nAnd then I make another statement as the only major conservative TV outlets Fox News is like our public utility and yet they engage in the same censorship as Twitter and Facebook now how's that for turnabout we've been hearing that Twitter\nIs engaging in censorship that Facebook is engaging in censorship and we've said no that's not fair even though they're private enterprises and the argument we abuses that they're so big that they're like\nPublic utilities or shutting the same reasoning apply to Fox News\nThey are the only conservative TV outlet and yet they're blacklisting some people myself included should they be allowed to do it now don't give me the garbage about that there are private enterprise you can do what they want that will be true if there were three of four conservative TV outlets but there aren't there is only one\nSo they're doing the same thing as Twitter and Facebook and getting away with it because we haven't thought it's wrote\nAnd that's the opening to the program judicious timing Michael Savage new book mass hysteria by are more of world net daily I suggest you go and look at it is a great article by our\nAnd another one came out from the times of Israel which again you'll only find links on Michael Savage dot com apparently uh the times of Israel world that daily Breitbart News is no longer good enough\nFor anyone in the conservative media they're banished me Breitbart world that Daily Times of Israel all normally linked by those in the media are suddenly blacklisting them as well\nWell you have an option you can read these things thank God Newsmax is still out there they had me on Newsmax TV and my friend Chris Ruddy is not stab me in the back\nThank you Christopher standing by me a in a critical time in American history and if you want to see the Newsmax TV ah interview I linked it up on Michael Savage dot com and I suspect there'll be more of this to come\nLet's go to the callers on the Savage Nation chaos
