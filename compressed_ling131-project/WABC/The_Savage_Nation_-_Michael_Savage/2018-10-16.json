start ... for all that eventually got me into a whole year school so they did a great job on it now I Want to pay them back and what are they doing this fishes and insomnia so that way that's what I'm saying you don't really seem all that I read the food you're right\nIs this what it's all about why do you think we've asked the question what is the meaning of life since the dawn of time because we all have this whole that has to be filled\nAnd if you're not filling it with the only thing that can really feel it\nThen you always want more and you always get more extreme in more demanding and that's exactly\nWhat we're seeing with the far left and you're saying with some people on the far right too although I think some of the people that are that are actually called far right parties are really far left these because if you're truly a fascist you're far less not far right far right is total anarchy\nSo what is it that really fills it well\nFor me and I really believe for all humans it's your belief in God and affirmed face\nNow I Know a lot of people don't believe that or understand that and that's fine but I'm I'm just telling ya from my personal experience I Know that's true and for others it can be a very strong family or a very strong network\nOf friends that's the closest they can get the feeling like that void is filled but I you know senator Sasse who I disagree with and a lot of stuff he's written a new book where he talks about this problem of loneliness in America\nWith decreasing faith decreasing nuclear families decreasing amount of friends that you actually have real friends not Facebook friends not people who give you clicks on Instagram and Twitter and Snapchat you with the streak\nReal friends that you talk with that you go to the bar with their maybe you watch football with or you go to the bowling alley whether you surf or hunt with or whatever it is that you love to do play golf\nReal friends that you can go to when something's wrong that you support when something's wrong with them the ones who help you move when you move\nThe ones who come to your house when you're sick real friends and we have fewer and fewer of those\nSo when you you don't have a faith in God you don't have a strong nuclear family you don't have an extended family you don't have a close friends you're changing jobs every three to four years so you don't have really close work friends what do you have\nWell you have your belief in your tribe politically\nAnd so that void gets filled with all the crap that you hear from the far left professors in the far left media and the far left politicians telling you you're a victim a hobby that's why I feel so empty because I've been persecuted all my life I've been oppressed all my life I've been put down all my life and it's hard for me to hit back and and these guys are so awful that I can do anything\nThese guys are like Nazis and you know we did the Nazis we killed not be so therefore we can do anything we want to and that's why our quarter says when they go low you kick them that's why Hillary Clinton says how can you be similar to the people that you're totally disagree with\nAnd that gives you like me\nAnd now you feel like you're part of something you're part of something\nBig your part something that could change the world and now that void is filled at least for a little bit\nUh it'll be empty again but at least it felt good for the moment and then and now I've got people around me who are who seemed to support me who seemed to be my instant friends\nIt's their new religion because they don't have a real one\n\nI think that's happened and continues to happen I think it's really dangerous and it's really sad\nLook at the increase in depression in this country over the last couple of decades look at the increase in the loneliness the last couple of decades because the increase in the destruction of the American family\n\nThen look and see how it coincides to this tribalism in politics that we've been seeing\nI just Republican Democrat but what is your tribe on black I'm white I'm Asian Hispanic I'm Native American well maybe I'm One one thousand twenty fourth Native American but I'm Still\nLaugh America to some degree\nA five five hundred Savage get you on board they pop I pointed Savage and that that gets ascended Elizabeth Warren thing I got to talk about how are you kidding me yesterday I was like oh man this is amazing and it just keeps getting better because yesterday of course we learn about the test Elizabeth Warren had claimed she was a Native American\nOr places that she had gone to school claim that she had been Native American\nAnd they use that to look like they were more diverse than they really were she claims that had nothing to do with are getting into law school had nothing to do with her getting hired to do very prestigious positions but by the way it was true because my grandmother told me about it\nAnd then we do the test and we find out a couple of very interesting things okay first of all we find out that the test\nShows well somewhere between one sixty fourth Native American and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American owned by the way\nWhen you get to you know around one five hundreds Native American that's less than the average European immigrant to this country [laughter]\nSo it means nothing but then you go back even further that we now we\nFind out that the DNA test didn't even use DNA from Native Americans in this country\nI I I don't know where they couldn't find that people didn't want to give it to them but here's what we found out\nThey use the\nGeneral population samples from Mexico and South America as these so called Native American sample to compare to Elizabeth Warren\nSo what she has doesn't qualified or to be a percentage of any known tried in the United states and she claimed victory\n[laughter]\nI mean that's just an enormously hilarious she is claiming victory and it took the Native American tribes to tell her that she didn't know what she was talking about and Warren Elizabeth Warren is trying to troll Trump\nIs when the washing of this may the day when I'm watching the trumps mockery of war in this claim of Native American history he's called her Pocahontas\nAnd said if they're offered to pay one million to charity if you took a DNA test clearly got into her head okay let's stop right there he actually didn't say he would offer a million dollars to cheer it if you took the DNA test he actually said I watched it yesterday several times\nHe said you know if she runs for president and we're in a debate then I'm going to\nChallenge her and then he went on to talk about the test and a million dollars so she hasn't run for president there hasn't been a debate and he hasn't challenged her it was a hypothetical that he talked about it at a rally as a joke\nAnd yet Elizabeth Warren in some in the press or trying to make it seem like he promised or a million dollars to charity if she could show quote one drop of Native American blood in her remember the old one drop slave rule for\nBlacks I thought that was a bad thing now we're making it a good thing a good thing\n\nAsked about the promise to donate to warns charity of choice Trump said\nOnly do that if I can test her personally that will not be something I enjoy doing either to which one are flies\nWe all know why Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about me right he's scared he's trying to do what he always does the women who scare him call us names attack us personally shrink us down to feel better about themselves and makes his ego but it won't work um where was the physical threat\nDNA tested the physical threat\nA Utah Republican Senator Orrin hatch who's eighty four years old he treated a photo of himself looking at his phone at his own DNA test results and it showed that they had a small\nFraction of terrain a source rex ancestry the rest of their dinosaurs [laughter]\nThat's pretty good pretty good cook and Trump is now gone after\nPocahontas to bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took bogus DNA test it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her DNA test is useless as with the Cherokee Nation said even they don't want her phony\n... what do you mean what do you mean even say what do you mean Donald even they don't want or what do you say\nAbout the check more on this uh let me get done in in Virginia a

documents for all Americans it made sense and it's long overdue\nWell because like you say Donna all of us now could claim because really we all come from the same place if you go back far enough right we all come back from the from the three the confluence of three rivers around Iraq right so if if you go back far enough we're all African American we're all Asian American we're all Indian American we're all everything because we all came\nFrom the same place and and and I haven't my notes down a kind of what you're talking about I mean why do we care about our DNA in our ancestry and

Thirteen we've given at least a hundred million dollars a year\nAnd for what is anything changing\nAs a nation of nine million people and how many million have already fled\n\nSo this idea that we can just have open borders and let anybody come in because otherwise you don't care about people you got to care about your own people first charity begins at home\nAnd it would make a lot more sense to help the people in Honduras improve their economy and improve their way of life in Honduras than it does to say come on it\nYou you can't use poverty as you were excuse to break our laws\nBut they are so the AP story quotes Disney um until you are volunteer assisting the illegal aliens they're calling a migrants in here but they're illegal aliens there just crossing the border on their own and then you know it doesn't matter\nWhen they come to America but it's very interesting 'cause listen to this is the second paragraph didn't even tell you a volunteer assisting the migrants said Sunday that the group had grown to an estimated sixteen hundred people\nAnd that many of the group might not be allowed to enter Guatemala because they lack official identification documents\nWhat I thought it didn't matter if you had any documents I thought the whole point was undocumented is okay I thought the whole point was no person is illegal I thought the whole point was you know only evil America seems to care about borders Guatemala might not let them in Guatemala might not let them in and not just Guatemala\nMexico's interior ministry issued a strong reminder this weekend that Mexico does not issue entry visas for those who don't meet the requirements to transit toward a navy neighboring country\nAnd Mexico Set of issues visas that the conflict abroad and not a border entry points what is that I thought I thought only the evil America was telling people that had to come in a legal entry points\nAnd by the way if America is so evil if America so systemically racist if that's America is the problem in the world\nWhy so many people want to come here\nWhy there's so many of the poor people still want to come by to so many people want to claim asylum to come to the United states I mean if you're claiming asylum what you're supposed to do was stop in the first country that you come to and if you grab a map then\nThey shouldn't be coming to America I mean if you're leaving Honduras why are you stopping in El Salvador all Salvador's bleep hole to waste I thought President Trump got in trouble for calling these countries Lee pulls\nI mean why would you want to leave Honduras unless it's a bleep hole country\nThink about that why would you want to leave your country unless it's a ... country\nWhy would so many risk everything leave everything behind risk their family being robbed and members of their family being raped were murdered on the trip unless you're fleeing a bleep hole country\nSo why wouldn't you stopping El Salvador believe all country why don't you stop and Guatemala bleep hole country why don't you just go north a little bit and stopped and beliefs I mean Americans retired ...\nWhy would you stop and Mexico believe all ... they're all we've all countries\nI thought that was a horrible thing to say well why don't you go south instead of north why don't you stop in Nicaragua leave all country how 'bout Costa Rica again we've got Americans who vacation in Costa Rica go surfing in Costa Rica relocate and retire in Costa Rica\nOr go a little further south Panama Panama again that's another uh ex patriot retirement home community down there and ... they can't hardly bleep all countries can they\nSo why risk all that and go so far just to get to the United states since it's such a horrible racist country\nBecause we all know it's not that puts the lie to everything you hear from the far left\nSo they're coming again because you know people are poor and hunters\nThat's not an excuse for you to come to our country illegally so President Trump is is getting out ahead of this and he said that he will cut off U.S foreign aid to Honduras if they don't stop the caravan\nU.\nA.
