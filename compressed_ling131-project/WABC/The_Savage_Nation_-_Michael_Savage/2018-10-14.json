age if you have collected benefits early and you have lost some benefits because you work and earn too much money\nYou'll get those benefits back once you reach your full retirement age in the form of

with the argument that because the employer and the employee each pay seven point six five percent of of wages to support Social Security and Medicare the arguments always been oh you really hurting

In the business owner because if you're an escort\nOr you're in L.

two hundred thousand or more or married couples with killing income of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more they pay in additional point nine zero point nine percent\nBike attacks ... for the purpose of funding Medicare and that applies to both um employers and employees\nAfter so so it it's an additional ... and the and the and the it kicks in at two hundred thousand two hundred for individual is two hundred and fifty thousand married couples okay great thanks very much\nWell the way it works is you can earn next year up to Seventeen thousand six hundred and forty dollars if you earn more than that that's when you would start I'm losing benefits they would take away\nOne dollar in benefits for every two you earned over the limit so hold on a second I'm going to do so quick

your benefits are reduced big cause you're collecting early compared to sixty six\nHonestly estimate what your earnings are going to be and what they would do is withhold the first few months of

percent higher\nThan it would have been at age sixty six and the important part of that is\nWhen one spouse dies the bigger Social Security benefits continues as the survivor benefit and the smaller one goes away but the really important question because there was a change in the claiming rules a few years ago is what is your birth year\nIs it before Nineteen fifty for\nA it's after\nAll right you can't choose which benefit to claim if you're born in Nineteen fifty four or later the\nOnly people who get a choice of jade pay me as a spouse in my own benefit keep growing our people born in Nineteen fifty three or earlier when was your eyes been born\nNineteen fifty five on both of us are off\nBomber yes you're both out so what I Would say is I'm One of you should probably go ahead and claim it full retirement age that might be you if your benefits with smaller that bring some cash flow into the house or in the meantime it takes away a little bit of the sting of having your husband wait until Seventy to get his benefit\nAt Seventy he'll claim you'll get this nice big benefit um which will continue our both of your lives if he happens to divert which statistically is likely you would effectively inherit his entire benefit including all those delayed retirement credits and your smaller benefit would go away\nOkay mine is a larger so I really think and I'm the youngest so okay

will I'd say it's a different thing or this is my view\nAnd his one man's view but I feel very strongly that this is totally destroyed democracy in America I just don't think that democracy is what it was meant to be\nI don't think it was meant to be bought and sold I think it's the fact that corporations are now treated as people as individuals and have the same rights lesser law but when the Supreme Court all I Know I Know that's a bad law I don't see a corporation that has a child and conscience\nI don't see that I don't see it it just that's what distinguishes people from corporations as people have families say they have ... offspring they got children they got to be careful with these children they're or they're looking out for the future\nThere they're looking out for everything that's happening right now they want their kids to be well taken care of they really care parents really care that's that's being in a family and being human being\nSo um the corporations don't qualify as as human\nBeings I mean as you say this and you've been saying this not just leave you've been saying for years some version is your weather an awful lot of people who like your music was a\nWhole new talks that way he is um put in quotation marks and he he's pretty far left wing socialist come bomb throwing ... you know\nLooking to stand before the media got a hold of these things with their red states and blue states did they not separate the country into two pieces did they not say left and right\nWhere did this all start these are all Americans\nEverybody is an individual in this country and it's a great country and I truly believe that at the soul of the whole thing is people\nNot corporation so it bothers me to see corporations usurping what should be the vote of the people in in choosing the candidates paying for the campaign\nIt doesn't happen everywhere in the world it really is this is one of the only places in the world where it does happen in this is where we have so many problems ah with with the corporate government control just I just don't like it\nAs you might expect on the young strong viewpoints your not limited to his views about GMOs and Munch on two or even his opinions about the government [noise] he's developed a new system for how he believes you should be listening to digital music\nIt's called the polling place and we'll talk with him about that\nLegendary journalist Dan Rather returns to access TV with the new season of the big interview I'm asking envious Kansas cat with all new episodes every Tuesday at nine eight central ... still miss big stores including rod Stewart now\nYou can't do that ... great by the way I wouldn't know [laughter] I live scattered\nWe add more northerners now and the bad\nAnd we do have southerners undecided I sell\nReduce guard he said you were in a secure I was I never for advantage to gather I've always dean inventors joins Van Jones ... victory account Dan Ackroyd it's my favorite character off Kansas that intensity staff ... to the NASA Buddy Guy\nSkinny log in these ideas are precious can't medieval or the big interview with Dan Rather fall new episodes every Tuesday at nine eight central only\nHas children that has family it has relationships that has nature has beauty has all of these other things that rock and roll is part of the rock and roll as its own thing and it's an animal all to itself so I was thinking about\nRock and roll but for rock and roll if that's all you are and that's all you want to do exploding is not bad but there's a lot more to life than just rocket will there's a lot more to your music and rock and roll yeah\nBut I Love to rock and I'm Glad to be here with rock on\n[laughter] that's a good way of\nOften been cold shoulder rock and roll what is the show for a boy I don't know if that's a big question\nSo I get by you to have to have somebody bringing an expert [laughter] 'cause\nUh uh you know rock and roll as as a free expression and uh it's uh it's bigger than the words rock and roll it's a creative uh living performance art\nThing with music\nAnd has a lot to do with youth and expression and a feeling that you're convinced about something and trying to bring it to light and make it explode so people see it\nAnd uh also as just personal expression or you just let yourself go and if you're at the right people you all go together and when that happens improvise ... happens things start to rise the people in the audience realize that you're now on your own\nEverybody's going together there with you you're with them everything's happening at once right here for the first and only time like this and it's really integrate groove and the primitive thing of the beat and the people together and the growing kind of Rob\nIs is the heart and soul of rock and roll\nOther way when you root you and those who in in rock and roll who burned out at or near their peak when prince pass it at least some we small part of you say\nIn a way but it's looking things and he went at or near the top and did you say you so here I Am I've had to topple along did you do not senior so maybe it's better that we're now\nNow I didn't I I think a prince a prince was a ... is a victim of a of a few things want one of them a a problem yeah with some of the drugs that we sell people and er then prescriptions and warnings\nThere are some drugs that we sell to take care of pain in this country that are very very dangerous and people really liked them\nSo as you can go from one doctor to another to another and get these and that's where the governments could help the people in some ways just by eliminating this was some sort of controls or something like that then we get into freedom tracking what you're doing and all of these things so it's very complex than we have the money of the drug companies who want to sell these drugs\nYou gotta ask yourself is cancer a cure for cancer going to be a good thing for the drug companies\nWould be a good thing for people yeah it would be so corporations versus people ... ... where do you go there's a there's a human being at the head of Pfizer or ... or one of these companies as a human being up in there and there was a human being at the head of Volkswagen or somewhere\nOr you know Volkswagen did this thing with the cars where they said it was cleaner than it was they take the test everybody bought things was fraud one guy resigned and that was it\nThat's a corporation that's the difference between me doing that and corporate doing you know\nYou're angry about that you were able to go to the little things up for it was a machine\nYou know I got a lot of love and it's my love for the planet and my love for\nEarth that makes me mention these things and I may sound angry but if you look at me you don't see a lot of anger I think you that's fair to say you know\nSo I'm just eliminating these things and they deserve to be brought to light and the opinions that I have are worth me sane people don't have to listen if they don't want to and I wouldn't mind it either way but I have to be able to make the choice available [noise]\n\nNeil Young has
