the border patrol and fiscal Eighteen twenty team\nShattering the old record of about seven eight thousand set and twenty sixteen Stephen ... of the Washington Times reports\nSo it's good to have a great inspiring president but it's better to have action\nI mean Donald Trump's a man of action not just the man of words he's built buildings done a lot of things that are requiring action is not just a talker\nAll other presidents have basically politicians that we're talkers that I can think of all it's all laid back the eyes and our great general then you have a well your skip ahead some were lawyers\nI don't know what the what an Obama do nothing even ... a smart 'cause the beginning and said I've never produced a product or service anyone needed that's right so he didn't do anything it was a talker great rhetoric tuition but Trump is not just the rhetoric ... should do or so why is he what is he going to do to stop the hordes of the border\nYou know on my website this morning I posted this I saw pictures of the illegals coming over with a new group from Mexico joining them and they're all strapping young men of military age and and clean the clothing that is what my headline was give us your tired your poor your gangbangers\nThat so what do you want me to say\nWhat can I as a citizen with a radio show say give me your tired your poor your gangbangers so what can he do also we're gonna talk about the one point six billion dollar Powerball jak mega million jackpot and how much tax you actually pay on it I Know it's like an obscure point but look a lot of people are betting on that thing\nYou have no idea what kind of taxes I pay you'll find out soon when you see what people pay a who make real money you'll see how it shaken down by the criminal governments in our states\nYou'll see what we actually pay this corrupt government of ours no matter what great tax deduction I paying more\nTaxes the tax rebate and I'm not mine went up my taxes actually went up in California I was punished even though I didn't vote for Obama I was punished as though I was a bomb us support us everyone in California even those who are conservative are paying more under the under the Trump tax cuts same in New York were being punished that's not fair\nPath federal income tax rate is thirty seven percent here in the criminal state of California run by the gang that can shoot straight\nThe top tax brackets near Fifteen Percent on top of that so you wouldn't that Powerball and you wouldn't have mega millions you'll find out what it's like to make a living in this country that so\nYou look at the Drudge Report virus killed six kids but don't pay any attention to me even though I've written twenty nine books and health books you never heard of and I want you about immigrants and epidemics the un screen immigrants coming here with diseases but no no I don't know what I'm Talking about to turn to Jake Tapper he's a genius he has a PHD ally allergy\nDid you know that's a new field at the people in the fake news business can get a degree in a PHD in lye allergy\nTry to figure that field out so I have a PHD partly an epidemiology I've tried to warn America for twenty five years about immigrants and epidemics my grandfather had to go through health screening your ancestors had to go through health screening\nWatch the godfather you'll see what the old Vito Corleone in how to go through when he came in with a cough they put him in quarantine but today know bringing fifty thousand with tuberculosis what's the difference\n... what's the difference TV doesn't matter all welcome\nSo we have an a gigantic problem because we voted like crazy for Donald Trump and so far with thanking God that it wasn't Hillary Clinton which is true and we've gotten a lot it's a lot of good stuff but the Alamo now is the illegal immigration army that is swirling toward the bus a surging toward the border\n[noise] this is his Alamo and if he does not stop them it will become has Waterloo you'll have to refer to Napoleon to see what the Waterloo was\nAnd as a student of history Waterloo was not a good place for Napoleon in order for Trump to stop this massive arming of invaders and to make sure this is not a Waterloo for him and for America\nHe has to crack down as fast as possible on Mexico and make them do the job that they promised to do when we were finagle emphasizing the NAFTA deal with them because that that horses out of the bond as they say and American parlance\nAlthough some of the topics there are other things I Want to talk about the uh immigration thing is about the biggest thing on my mind\nThe taxes on the Powerball thing is another big story that I Will get to a little later on in the program\nAnd what else oh did you hit a new opening Tonight Show I cut out the other two books and now I'm going to the Savage Nation the most ... author of stop mass hysteria would cut out the other two books because we had to promote now since you're listening to the first hour of the show I'm going to reward you\nBecause we're already moving on to the end of October which means there's only two more months or so of the Savage Nation as you know\nAnd although I Will make by official announcement around November first I mean I've already made the announcement because people are confused I met someone over the weekend he said gee you're only doing podcasting in January I said no I'm doing one hour of radio across America\nEspecially here in San Francisco you'll be able to hear me that first hour the second hour will be a podcast\nOr another piece of a radio show but the point is is that if you're losing me as you well oh into political considerations in some markets that I mean major markets where the audience is I Love\nYour going to have to listen to my podcast everyday and it cost you nothing that's the good news is free\nYou got nothing to lose so it'll be a hybrid one hour of radio one hour of broadcasting and most of America except in liberal quarters\nOn the east coast where they only want one position position to be expressed and by people who are moderate Republicans or modest Republicans are middle of the road Republicans posing as hard conservatives heart conservativism is gone\nAnd the American media as far as I can tell\nSo you want me to play Davy Crockett you want me to uh\nTalk about I don't know I'm not even in the mood to talk about the illegals I've done it for twenty five years every one of my books going back to my first political both that is sorry for that had an issue about borders language and culture I was laying in bed this morning I got up at four AM and I thought about it this is my signature issue\nMany Johnny come lately is jumped on it over the last few months they make believe they knew about a care great welcome to the club now what are we going to do about it\nTell me what you are going to do about it now that we're all talking about it what are we getting cars the president didn't have to do now that we're all talking about it\nWhat should the president do now that we're all talking about it\nWhat do I as an immigrant sun suggest you do in a compassionate yes yet forceful way to prevent this army from invading the country telling I don't want to hear any more about it's a humanitarian crisis that's utter rubbish that is our absolute garbage looked at the young men they're stronger than you are\nMuch stronger than most of you are there in great shape where new clothing someone's feeding them none of them look like they're hungry who's cooking for them along the road they went on the road for a month who's making them food every day where's the toilets\nI I mean can you answer the question are we build that wall build that all we hear it but nothing's happening here in San Francisco I Want to lead a rally I Want to get a ten thousand people down by city all screen build that stole\nBuild that stall build that stole build that stole that's a joke some of you don't even get it you don't have a a a comedic gene than you are comedy Jean either genes even receive what'd you go back to my first published book I'm looking at my beautiful I'm using a Trump\nOh gee now Trump phraseology I'm looking at my beautiful shell through my broadcast studio at the beautiful coverage of my beautiful books and my first beautiful political book\nIs Michael Savage the Savage Nation and what is the subtitle that's the great picture of me with the sunglasses under the Golden Gate bridge with a star over the glasses in the rye voted I look at look at your age my God\nSaving America from the liberal assault on our borders language and culture\nSaving America from the liberal assault on our borders language and culture so I've kind of been an actor so while a quarter of a century that's so\nWild Jake Tapper was still taking Ritalin or in junior high if he took Ritalin I don't know maybe that maybe he escaped that you show looks like a type of was raised on something other than Americanism\nAnd here's what I said if you're tired of being attacked and school whenever you celebrate the achievements of America huh\nIf you're weary of being trampled on whenever you speak in favor of morality if as a boy scout you become a pariah while the perverts have become the victims you've come to the right place Michael Savage the Savage Nation that was a huge bestseller do you know when you know what year that was two thousand and two\nTwo thousand and two\nTwo thousand and two so believe me the issue of borders language and culture has been near and dear to my heart\nBecause Without Borders there's no language and culture\nThe borders are the key to the entire a subject Without Borders there's no language and there's no culture it's a ... mix of\nThings and there is no longer a cohesive nation which exactly why the sorrow sled mobs want our borders dissolved in one open borders do you understand finally what they

see just getting older like you and that's it so that's what it is life goes on so America's getting older\nAnd the older people in America are losing their will to live\nAnd they don't know what to do they came out to the polls in the last election with one last hope that one last candidate who was not a politician would save the country\nAnd thus far they're not sure what's going on they love the rallies they loved the speeches they like many of the policies they thank God the truck that Trump is there and she is not there but they don't know why he's not doing anything more visual for them with regard to the border\nThey don't know why it's one thing to give a speech with Ted Cruz and inspire people that's very important but I think the next thing you need to follow it up with some action biggest each day that we lose is a day we can't replace\nIf you see it on me coming what is general do let's just put it in military terms with or without weapons you see an army marching

it oh today they probably have breakdowns they wouldn't let them do it but we did duck and cover you could look it up on YouTube\nWe were told by the teacher that any this was in the early fifties now I was in grade school\nAnd we were we were trained to jump onto the desks when the alarm bells went off or go into the clause if the case there was a nuclear attack on New York city can you believe this now could you imagine the hysterical school mount moms today and the the men who are not really men in the school of business saying that it would cause anxiety and the children\nIf they had to actually run under a desk because the ... you have to medicate them they start to scream and yell out what a nation of weak links so I grew up hiding under desks I used to like it it was a lot of fun to me away from study I hated school\nI couldn't stand sitting in a regiment of the you know environment you got to play with the other kids from the desk [laughter] crazy things I mean imagine a bunch of young school kids being forced into a closet what the kids did to each other and we play with each other you can't believe it the fun we had we didn't take it seriously we didn't get kids at wonderful\nKids are resilient yeah go jumping the ... though the idea of a nuclear weapon going off in New York was not real but we know that was such a threat hanging over our heads of a nuclear you know into training\nIn fact I Lived in Queens New York when I grow up but it was a kid rather when I moved to queens from the Bronx\nI remember to this day they wouldn't Nike missile installations in empty lots along like in the LA pond park area with Donald Trump grew up would you believe that I remember to this day I could almost picture it in my head\nDonald Trump grow up in Jamaica estates I grew up on the other side of the highway in the middle class attached houses and in that area there when Nike missile installations with missiles pointed to the sky would you believe it\nSo what I didn't get it from the scaring the missile I was proud that we had missiles pointing up we loved it all the boys love that we had defensive weapons in our neighborhood would you believe it\nWe don't sit there frightened of it we understood that there was a potential for a war that we were glad we got a nation run by a real man calls white the Eisenhower who was ready and willing to take on the enemy\nSo now fast forward to to today I'm In politics as a commentator in America\nAnd I've been doing it a long time and I wake up and a man that I thought was a man of peace Amanda was not an interventionist all of a sudden his administration seems to be hijacked by the global is who have come in as Johnny come lately they've been uh\nYou got to understand something you don't even see what's going on it's my job to see it for you\nI Am the senior before I Am the talker and I see that the Trump Administration of today is not the Trump Administration of yesterday and that the global lists have taken over his administration notably when that\nWhatever is I Can't even remember his name I block it I Want to think of it that outcast that ... that moustache showed outcast came in I don't know put them in there or have some suspicions but this is Neil ...\nBolton is you've got to remember is history every politician has a history Bolton and as the ... got us into the Iraq War by lying to Bush\nAnd saying that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when they have a war that Saddam was about to set off a nuclear war against us do you remember the justification\nHere he is again first he lied about Syria and he tried to get Trump to launch Tomahawk missiles not oh I don't two months ago Nikki Haley was screaming her head off and the un ... threatening Syria I was terrified that they were going to do it and set off a war\nAnd the Haley somebody probably stopped there and I would think in General Kelly my suspicion is by what I've read and what I see and what I'm observing as an outside observer\nIs that the military is extremely cautious in this country run by extremely brilliant men and women by the way who are very very cautious in their actions and very ...\nAnd the state department is run by crazy hawks who have never seen an ...\nYou can experienced that first hand with distinctive one of ... shootings impeccable tailoring and luxurious
