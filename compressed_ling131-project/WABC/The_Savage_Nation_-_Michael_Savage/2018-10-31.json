is on and they were afraid to fire him now Jeff Zucker should be fired as well because this isn't the first time\nThis man has done something like this in twenty Fifteen over thirty thousand people signed a petition demanding that lemonade be fired from CNN after he attacked police\nWhen Donald Trump became president\nIn January twenty Eighteen Don lemonade the racist in my opinion on lemonade introduced his broadcast on CNN with this this is CNN Tonight I'm Don Lemon the president of the United states is a racist and yet Jeff Zucker does not fire him\nWarner broadcasting does not fire him a TNT does not fire him so let's look into Don lemons background because now I'm interested to see why he's so twisted and how he's gotten so far as a a hateful person you went to Baker high school in east Baton Rouge ...\nThen he went to Brooklyn College which said he majored in broadcast journalism it doesn't say graduated\nThen he attended out last year we don't know if he graduated but apparently oh into the hiring laws in America he was moved right up to this position rapidly began as a news assistant that a little station then move right up\nAnd here he is and he has spoken about a lot of issues\nIn September twenty ten lemonade said that he was a victim of sexual abuse as a child and it was not until he was Thirty years old he told his mother about it I'm reading from a computer in his memoir\nCalled trance parents Don lemonade came out as gay\nAnd discuss this color isn't in the black community I don't know what that is never heard of it and I I like to think I Know words but I guess that's the thing I never heard about called color as them in the black community\nAnd the sexual abuse you suffered as a child he has Creole ancestry his great grandfather was a French accent in addition to the Nigerian Cameroon and Congolese ancestry\nIn January thirtieth on January thirty first twenty Eighteen oh that's this year lemons sister died at the age of fifty eight police concluded that a death was an accidental drowning in upon while fishing\nAfter being absent for approximately a week lemonade open the show unfair every six by thinking everyone who wished impression words were encouraged ...\nMhm he said that conservatives like Sean Hannity were among the first to call oh how cynical can you get\nAnd they actually respect each other out good rely on them of course that is so typical of the wall Bangor have good relations now why would showing at all you have good relations with a lot like this and work behind the scenes to make certain that I'm

three Seventy\nSpanking children yeah and the U.S army POW Bowe Bergdahl he suggested to an electric bill Cosby rape victim should have resisted all sex biting him despite claiming in his book to be a victim of sexual abuse from some there's not much here that you can really\nUse in coming to a conclusion as to how an overtly racist man\nHolds such a position of CNN other than perhaps the payout would be so high\nAnd they'd be afraid of being accused of being racist themselves if they got rid of him because they certainly have to understand that their advertisers on CNN that could be boycotted by people like you who listen to the show I'd been subject to boycotts for twenty five years and yet this loud is not subject to boycott go figure that out\nAll right well you could let me talk on this for a little bit more boycott ATM through the parent company I think he'd rather talk about other topics you saying what's new about that no I think you can't let this go I'm Sorry you cannot let this go\nYou can't let things like this go because the hatred for whites now is becoming and that Mick in the United states of America and it's one thing for idiots with low IQ's to be able to say it on Twitter it's quite another thing for this anti white racism\nTo be prime you'll gated on major media like CNN and make no mistake about it this is what triggers whites at the bottom to become psychotic killers is this kind of words these kind of words remember what power will remember I have a radio show where I can attack this guy for what he's doing\nAnd it gets to that in my system but many of you are listening to the show you have no outlet whatsoever maybe you are I'm poor maybe you have a bad job maybe your wife has cancer maybe you yourself are sick what do you think those of you will not like that this is doing to them\nWhen they hear a man like this saying that men like them should be banned from America\nThe biggest terror threat in this country is white men or
