they going to do next here's what's coming tomorrow if I'm correct and I do hope I'm correct meeting at the bombs are fake put out by the dams\nThey're going to send a couple in the next few days to people on the right and one of them will go off and kill someone or or maybe someone and then they'll say you see that\nWe're all victims of terrorism and then of course they'll release someone from one of the deep holding cells owned by the NSA or CIA who confessed that he is I don't know fill in the blank whatever you want that's the movie script they got to understand something\nIn addition to being a break and talk show host which I Am highly prized highly analytical I Am also a published successful novelist\nI've had three novels on the New York times bestseller list wanted which is called I think abuse of power is called abuse of power jackass feel set right here in San Francisco\nAnd I'm Talking to you is I Would if we were in a tavern or a bar or a coffee shop together\nAnd I'm telling you that this is how the scenario plays out if I were writing a novel that's how I write the novel that the left wing is in deep trouble this character Soros has that everything he schemes backfire on them from the caravan to the capital here he's they matched to\nSo there's two cases there are renting we can throw in a third K. and then give the left what they really want this uh three Kate lead\nSo we got the caravan even though it's where the see we got cabin or even those with a K we're waiting for the third K. and we don't know what that one will be but I'm starting to think it's their own cake I think it's the left Klux Klan behind this but if you want to chime in and I know all of America's very excited about this\nAnd don't think I'm taking it lightly I mean I'm a I'm a man of peace in fact wanting something ironic last night at midnight I couldn't sleep\nAnd I tweeted that I'd like to start to Savage piece Institute what do you think of it I got overwhelmed with people responding\nBecause I thought that would be my greatest legacy is to set up a piece Institute from one of the last phases of my life and I'm actually going to probably do it on my lawyer looking into a nonprofit status all incorporated probably in Texas because I wouldn't do it here in California you got to be crazy to set up a non profit here with the communists in Sacramento\nAnd I'm then I'm going to run the smallest of to the peace because I think there's always a peaceful revolution resolution that mostly there are peaceful resolutions to conflicts\nAnd I talked all about this yesterday with regard to this crazy man who has in Vegas way into the White House who's looking to start a war with Russia but that's a separate topic if you will remain suspicious of this suspicious packages you can call me or on the other hand\nLet's say you're a die hard left us and you don't believe that Mike skepticism is an appropriate right now\nAnd you think that I Am exploiting this for partisan reasons even though you're exploiting for partisan reasons uh and you think I'm negligent and even questioning authority\nI Want to hear from all of you left us who believe that you can prove\nBeyond a reasonable doubt that this was in fact a conspiracy by those who hate those people who receive those a a pipe bombs can you prove it in any way no can I just prove it no but what am I using what am I using to present my position\nAmusing original Jillian logic it's steel trap logic I don't think you can argue with that but let's go to the other side I mean there are other ways to look at it as well what are your ways of looking this how can you prove\nThat these bombs were sent by some right wing nut in order to hurt the wonderful generous George Soros and the kindly\nOld lady Hillary Clinton who else got him I don't even know Wolf Blitzer got well I Know who got on there at CNN\nSo who actually did it we don't really know but my position is based upon knowledge of politics which leads me to a skeptical position today but if you care to take and none skeptical position make my day the phone number is eight five five\nOr hundreds Savage eight five five or hundreds seven to eight to now remember George Soros has funded the last I checked the gave Ninety million dollars to black lives matter\nThe last I checked the funded the dangerous communist left on the far has been beating people up and chasing them out of restaurants for real George Soros these are his children and so if you have forgotten\nWhat he has been doing and if you were forgotten\nThat he was the first out of the box yesterday to say the Trump will be gone\nEither by twenty twenty or before and then all of a sudden the next day for more bombs are suddenly described as being having received the whole thing stinks to high heaven so let me play this from yesterday which is a Frank and Frank and Soros himself when he said this yesterday listen again\nClearly because the the dumping

that one they found a bomb that didn't have the handler went out he was tending to the crops went out and put the bomb in the field and this and that\nThe next day the very next day ... says this
