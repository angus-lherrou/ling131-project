address its Frommer's travel show at Yahoo dot com and we got one from a fellow named Rory it says Hi Paulina Jason I have a question about illnesses that by about illnesses that people picked up when traveling I was in\nMexico recently and I got sick despite being careful to avoid drinking tap water or eating raw vegetables now I Would feel hesitant about going back\nAnd nervous is if I were to go to other countries that are and more southerly latitudes I Wonder what advice you might have about this problem how do you handle that traveling as much as you do do you build up an immunity after over time if you travel a lot um\nSo what would you say Jason ... what what what's something that you do for\nTwo things one is yes I Do think a person can develop you know are stronger stomach overtime but you know that's that's a hard thing to do right now going to be some misery to reach the happiness\nI have a feeling that the her food or his or her her food preparation aren't reading habits\nRory cameramen on yeah I was in the ... food eating um protocol may not been has been as stringent as it needs to be for example um you you can eat a salad and get sick in certain places you can eat grapes in certain places that get sick because they've come in contact\nWith bad water so you really do need to only put things in your mouth in places where you're worried that you're seeing cooked in front of you and you only eat bottled water drink bottled water ... beer or something that you know is nothing ... what do you think\nIt was also you have to worry about ice ice senior Jeff can also get used to act I read a great travel tip once and I used to my last trip to India which is a place where a lot of people get sick and he did not get sick\nNeither did I and the uh advice was bring Pepto bismol with you and have a teaspoon of that before you eat and it coach your stomach apparently and makes it more difficult for you to get sick I write about this I\nI Am from a source that I trusted but I Can't remember the source anymore uh all I can tell you was that worked for me in India and worked for the whole family\nThey might just turned down foods that I wanted to eat like I didn't have any milk because you know ... with water sometimes I didn't\nLike I said in a sour grapes if I eat any fruit and it was something I could peel myself huh right though I knew it had such leave out water\nAnd I didn't get sick I was there for over a month or so we know it works um but you know you have to be vigilant and you have to think\nYou know two steps we had like bowling said the ice is not something you would automatically normally think of and you always have to ask the waiter has your water been filtered you know sometimes they say yes when I say well not for cooking but yes for ice in August\nYou bet so could be a problem with no food without water\nAnd he said he was worried about places in all southern latitudes you don't have to be I was just in Barbados\nAnd actually all of the water there gets filtered through the coral at\nThe coral that in the island and that actually ... the aquifer and that makes it very very safe water so I didn't have to worry about it they're also brushing your teeth sometimes don't forget or use bottled water when and then taking a shower with your mental health I mean there's there's ways to get sick without\nIt sounds like a pain but its second nature after one day of this you know you don't think much just always get it from a bottle and it works out pretty quickly and the places we find that places where are the water is not safe to drink there's a lot of bottled water available and it's cheap\nYeah okay so we have to take our first break of the show but I'm going to give everybody our phone numbers

where we're considering going to Washington state and Oregon and\nWe would like to know what would be the best time of the year to go there and do you have any particular sites that you would think that would be good to say we do love going to the national um ah parks\nYup OK well there is no shortage of great national parks up that way I I Would say springtime I'm\nGay because then you also have the option of seeing all the gardens it's a it's sort of a a very guard in the area as well because they're so eager for the summer to come around and there's so much water it rained so often that you get these beautiful lush gardens and if you have time\nYou can skip right over the border not too far from Seattle and go into a Victorian Vancouver and see but short gardens which is one of the most famous gardens in the world but\nThere are so much to see and do that you know there's lots of hiking you hiker\nI and my husband is not so [laughter] but I Do yes\nAnd you know I remember once I went with my family that to take this exact trip and we even went to mount saint Helen's which you can see or you can actually drive up and peer into the the side that blew off back in Nineteen eighty and that's also that's uh in Oregon but you know all within reach aren't you just drive on the five or to get in between all of these places where do you think of his\nThose are they're getting more intense and they're going to be getting even more intense than they are now because the airlines especially United or putting in place training programs and protocols that will require them to\nSoviet CU during every single flight and do you know why why they make so much money for the airlines in fact there are some economists now\nWho think that the frequent flier slash credit card you know arms of the airlines operations are more valuable than the airlines themselves and the flight attendants are earning between fifty dollars in one hundred dollars for every application that's turned and so there's an incentive\nFor flight attendants to get up on that horn and the middle of the white when you're half\nAsleep and try to start selling you credit cards and they're not very good at it I mean I've heard of\nOf um of accusations and and people writing down or incorrect information that is given by the flight attendants they wrongly advertise\nThe benefits sometimes because they really just want to get that application right so it's a real problem I I was reading a book by one flight attendant who said that she knew someone another flight attendant\nWho had made almost twenty thousand dollars on these white applications in a single year wow the sounding my so no wonder there's absolutely incentive to to ... to pass through new\nTo get you to to to find these things

radio or were you can find us during the week in many different ways um first all we're on social media and we have a really really witty wonderful woman named ...\nWho does our tweets who does her Facebook post there a heck of a lot of fun\nTo follow if you want to follow us you'll find us on Twitter on under Frommer's F.

there and adjacent is editor in chief of Frommer's dot com it's such a fun site you're going to find really really great slide shows with vibrant photos of places you can go we have message boards where travelers help each other out\nOr by uh you know a as putting up questions and putting up answers and the nice thing about our message board says we have travelers from all over the world so sometimes you'll ask a question about Paris and appreciation will answer it\nAll right let's get back to the phones I see we have a call from roe coming in a row are you there\nHi I Am here my name is low at fellow\nOh okay nice to speak with you\nNice to speak with you I listen to you all the time my question is what would you recommend doing if you're on a flight of five and a half hour right and the couple next to you had a baby that cries the whole time you're on the flight\nA I Would say peek a boo a\nI Would say maybe help the the couples I mean you know it's a rough thing I've been the mother with a baby I usually the baby doesn't ... even the baby\nUm that there's not much to do I mean unfortunately things like air pressure can set off the baby they have much less developed inner ear canals and so they actually can be in pain from a flight and can't help crying\nI'm I don't know Jason ... or do you have\nA I Know I've got some noise canceling headphones yeah earplugs um I I Try to to be nice as I can to the parents 'cause they don't want to be going through this either you know they ... the last thing they want us to screaming baby as well and they feel terrible most of the time so you know let them know in some ways that have not yet we're good patterns\nOr I heard of one by one one parent who has a baby who passes out goody bags to everyone sitting here though [laughter] before the ... just in case the kid freaks out\nWhich I think it's a lovely justified you know it's the younger members of the parents are going through something as well so whatever you do try not to be difficult if not anyone's fault\nAnd you know what I've found I think if you glare at the parents or if you give them a hard time they will get so uptight that the baby maybe more likely\nTo cry because I think he said no fear baby smells the parrot feeling uncomfortable so I I whenever I see a baby on a flight I always chat up the parents I always let them know that I've had a baby on a flight and I'm not going to hold it against them if anything happens it relaxes everybody and usually the baby doesn't cry you\nI'm On a Saturday to put an airport in put ... noise canceling headphones over the earplug and also put classical music and all three going on in the best you can\nDo I hope that you know I see we have ... we have to sell them back on the line a show a Zelda ... did you want to add anything to your earlier question\nYes I just wanted to know is it worth while these two places he thought that I mentioned a couple of say look is ...\n... yeah yeah are they really outstanding or if I can just as well as a have a same good time in Florida or California\nWell it's hard for me to know because I don't know which resorts you're going to\nI think the resorts in Mexico are much more expensive there's a lot more choice they're not somebody all inclusive resort choices in either California or Florida these days are there tend to be very expensive a la carte resorts in those places right she'll probably one of the ... of experience go to go to Mexico don't be afraid of the water so\nThe pills are full half the time people just like you and me who don't get sick because they have their own filtration systems\nAnd and part of our to have the atlas food I really like ... and the so called a Riviera ... uh which leads off from Port of ... it's a
