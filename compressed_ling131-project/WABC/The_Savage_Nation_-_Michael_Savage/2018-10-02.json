communist agenda but once a gay person or a minority goes off the plantation they become open game to be haunted like animals look what they did the Clarence Thomas\nNow I Want to go to the issue of women and beauty it's a little obscure point but I was looking at the guidelines for beauty back in ancient Rome and look how things have changed I remember it before I read this to you\nIt's not directly related to anything it's just a little pope or even opening here because my new book stop mass hysteria is somewhat of a mixture of politics and history\nListen to the guidelines for beauty now remember before you listen to this and say wait a minute I agree with that I don't agree with that\nA beauty is a cultural thing different cultures look of beauty in a different way so I'm going to read you the standards for beauty in Rome and women are as the pick that in the time first of all they all ... they all ought to have had\nThe angelic look\nThey had to look ... and so having tanned or dark skin was not regarded as attractive\nAnd pure white skin was seen as the sign of the upper class in ancient Rome as a native Roman women would not naturally have white skin they use the white shark lead or arsenic too it's in their faces\nLarge eyes with long eyelashes or also prized why did you know why large eyes with long eyelashes lashes what price did ancient Rome\nIt was believed that women's eyelashes fell out from excessive into costs so long eyelashes became a sign of chastity now you understand where some of these beauty secrets are still a operation that our society with fake eyelashes right wait a little more\nGuidelines for beauty in ancient Rome\nHair was a function of beauty for men and women in ancient Rome so thick curly locks where admired most women would die their hair black red or blonde to emulate the lush thick styles of the goddesses they would also where wigs any here and not on the head was seen as an attractive\nAnd removed by plucking stripping or shaving\nNow here's something odd for those of you in America\nOr a modest ... very different today isn't it but small round bras were actually admired far more than a larger ones large breast was seen as being humorous or a sign of old age in fact young Roman girls was so determined to have small brass\nThat they wore a kind of early ... in the form of a band\nOr excessively tight to inhibit the growth of their breasts\nWhat was the ... the perfect child bearing figure in was in the little skinny girl of today with no hips at all because being thin was not regarded as an attractive trait in Rome with so much of a woman's life focused on rearing children wide hips were regarded as very attractive\nAnd all the men didn't like that women excessively large a plump from body was seen as the ideal type one more point about guidelines for beauty in this age of a women\nLess is more extravagance was frowned upon although wealthy women that sometimes wear jewels and necklaces anything more was viewed as showing off or being overly boastful a very negative trait attention a rap raps out there\nAnd this is likely why almost all contemporary depictions of Roman goddesses are quite simple minimal and modest that's Roman women in mythology\nFrom not from mass hysteria but from a book I read all about history book of the Roman empire\nIt's fascinating to read about ancient civilization but now have you heard the phrase ... since I'm at the Capitol hearings Dr fraud was held up and made into a sacred leaves your vessel of origin as you well know\nNever had ... and no one asked her about her background what she was like in high school or college because of the vermin on the left foot screen that that was somehow sex is to do so but I think that that is an important point I mean what what's her background\nNow what is a vessel version while it was very important in ancient Rome and not going to read it to you because you can find it on your own in ... in Rome and a mythology I'll just give you one hand\nYou have to go back to the story of ... and ... who is Ramy lesson who was Remus well\nIt was a ... version by the name Maria silver not an accuser of cabinet or\nThere was a vessel virgin name ria silver apparently ... he hasn't been able to find her yet\nWho after being raped by the guard Mars gave birth to the founders of Rome name rummy lists and Remus did you know that while the rest is history and I give this to you to show you that what we're going through right now\nWhile not related to ancient Rome is related to history in many ways what Camelot Harris Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker\nJuly name all of them and the others on the committee are doing today is actually nothing new under the sun\nIt went on in the Soviet Union were all you have to do was denounced someone and their life was ruined\nIt went on in Hitler's Germany or you had to do is renounce someone and their life was ruined and they were imprisoned if not executed\nSo the new left are actually the new right the new left or the new fascist as many have said but what we are witnessing and the average person certainly see through it is unfounded accusations are not um\nIt all in fact they're very on American which leads into the house of on American activities committee of the Nineteen fifties\nHow many years where you left this lecture to about a set of their McCarthy being a very bad man because he accused in some cases\nAre falsely people in America mainly in the government the media and an academic of being communist or communist sympathizers right and we're told that was a false thing of it gives it ruin lives and McCarthy was set to be a bad man now let's put aside the fact that\nMost of the people that McCarthy out of this communist turned out to be communist as we learn in the Nineteen eighties wouldn't have known a papers were released you'll have to research that even own a papers it confirmed it almost all of the people accused by senator McCarthy war in fact fellow travelers in communist but putting that aside\nHow many times have you been lectured by leftist professors that McCarthy was a bad man that McCarthyism which became synonymous with false accusations was an evil thing\nWe wake up and we see the Feinstein is now McCarthy only there's no troops were allegations we see that every one of them on the committee or the new Soviet ... and I am only hoping that the fairness of the American people will shine through all of this mark\nAnd that Kavanaugh will be voted upon and approved\nHowever I Am not optimistic that will happen because I did some research on who Senator Flake is and you'll be shocked to find out that Senator Flake well appearing to be somewhat middle of the road is anything but\nI think the flight will vote against him no matter what the FBI says now remember this before we go on\n\nCapitol had at least three FBI investigations along the way to becoming a federal judge Iraq Obama have none in fact I said it when Obama became president he could not have passed an FBI background check and be an been even ordinary\nFBI agent Obama could not have become an ordinary FBI agent because of his associations with very dangerous leftist including bill layers and others but he never was subjected to a background check\nDo you think Feinstein could pass a background check you think Cory Booker could pass a background check do you think Camelot Harris would welcome a background check\nDo you think that turban Durban who called our US Marines Nazis and fascist could pass a background check I really wonder why we don't have an FBI background check of all of the new Soviet ... this is Michael Savage author of stop mass hysteria\nJoy those Savage Nation coal know eat

mornings before now on [noise] [noise]\nOh for him in a town the average station about libel and slander better known\nIn the broad category of defamation I'm a broadcaster who's been in the business twenty five years\nAnd I have been the famed I'd been lied about slander and over the years that I've defended myself every time and I've won every case but we're we're witnessing right now a form of defamation never before seen in American history perhaps since the Salem witch trials\nAnd in my book mass hysteria I have a chapter titled from Salem to CNN\nHow hysteria taught us too and that's and that's the ties ourselves and I say we are at risk of returning to this medieval state as we allow the corrupted mainstream press agenda driven agitator to gain control of sections of the population\nThat I ask how is the nation's best interests or\nWhen the self serving New York race or Al Sharpton calls for federal the funding of the Jefferson Memorial well that was one example now here's a man who's background included vocal visible support for Fifteen year old to wanna Brawley from wiping ... falls New York\nWho in Nineteen eighty seven lied and claim she was raped by several white men police officers among them Al Sharpton was joined by those are the pillars of the black community the racist nation of Islam had Louis ...\nAnd that famed booster of women's rights Bill Cosby well together with a complicit media they whipped up blind frenzy and mass hysteria all of it based on a lie\nTo water Brawley later converted to Islam change their name became a nurse and moved to Virginia though Sharpton lost all credibility for his rush to judgment he continues to do now what he did then spread mass hysteria that elevates him in the eyes of his community\nLike the inhabitants of seventeenth century village is people hear him speak with authority about subjects in which he has absolutely no objectivity yet they cheer and following call for blood\nToday it's mass hysteria raised against one of the towering figures of American history Thomas Jefferson\nToday's youth you see are the targets and cause of campus progressive ... children have always been victims of manipulation the testimony of children was used against the suppose it which is in Salem, Massachusetts\nChildren are the ones whose minds are being and that's the ties and destroyed by drugs including marijuana\nThroughout history those who perpetrated hysteria our immune from the consequences the essential question our nation has been forced to ask over and over again today who is pulling the strings and why why we finally have the faces of those\nAre in in injecting America with these lies and this hysteria the names are to be seen in plain English the defamation has to be seen by all Americans Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker Camelot Harris shy name all of them or you don't know who their names are\nSo let's look at libel and slander if someone accuses you fall asleep and it causes you harm you ever civil remedy if those words ended up causing harm to your reputation or your livelihood libel as a written or published defamatory statement\nWhile slander is defamation that has spoken by the defendant\nSo you have to look at proven libel and slander\nI Would like to propose that anyone who slander as anyone in public even a public figure\nHas to pay the price in a paying the same penalty that the individual who was slandered all live all would have paid in other words if someone slander as let us say public figure and that public figure by being the fame loses a position\nAnd loses their money or something like that a certain amount of money\nAnd then it turns out that there there was false based upon a false what's through the which on\nThe individuals who slander ally build that figure should have to pay the exact penalty that that individual would have paid had they been found guilty of such slander or ... what is wrong with that nothing so here's the problem the law itself as the as\nThe law is an ass said the great great British SAS\nSamuel Johnson and the Eighteen hundreds he said the law is an ass\nShakespeare has some wonderful things to say about lawyers which I cannot repeat on this program but the fact of the matter is most lawyers as you well know are not at all in it for the truth\nThere in it to crucified people just take a look at
