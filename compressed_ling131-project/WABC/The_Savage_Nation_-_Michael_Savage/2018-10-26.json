{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "To that respect for law and process that allows people to accept legislation elections court rulings with which they do not agree\nThis is the central feature of our system of government you advocate for your beliefs enthusiastically but we peaceably unlawfully comply with the results\nPlease know that from the beginning this investigative team has made this matter a top priority focusing their great talents and expertise on neutralizing this threat they moved swiftly and professionally\nUsing extraordinary technical expertise to apprehend the one alleged responsible\nThis is a demonstration of the skill capability and determination of our American law enforcement best in the world\nSo I Am pleased to participate in this announcement that a suspect is in the custody of the FBI\nI Want to remind everyone that to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he has been charged today\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers\nFor these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation proceeds\nThis is a law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\nAnd so I Want to thank FBI Director ray and his team all about law enforcement partners who are here ATF Secret Service postal inspectors Capitol police\nUh in New York City police department and the United states attorney Berman on the southern district of New York and us attorney for the southern district of Alabama already on our or some\nFederal state and local law enforcement officers from across this country responded immediately to the cause and contributed to this effort we are proud of each one of them\nI Want to reiterate to defend it in this case is innocent until proven guilty\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone regardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further in a gym\nWe will find you we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and now director right or who's gonna incredible job leading this effort over the last few days he will give us the details of the day is important arrest Chris\n\nAs the attorney general as confirmed we have arrested seeds are say Iraq\nIn connection with this investigation\nAs our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive when I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest imports our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nBut but and I I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today\nA threat of this scope of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder and today's arrest is a testament\nTo the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab in Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nThat requires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort and getting those devices to our lab from around the country we can confirm\nThat Thirteen IDs were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off heat and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelopes containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that for the seas are saying\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say back in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe we see unbelievable work like this on TV and Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping\nPeople safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every ... to try to keep the American people safe from harm and who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now\nAnd other packages on so we need the help of everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got\nTo help with this investigation in the days to come if you've got any information please call us on our tip line at one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips the FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every chip could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone\nUp here today understands that\nWe take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together of protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans now I'd like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from the NYPD [noise]\n\nLike Chris ... every one of the men and women are the NYPD quite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to commend to thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement partners in his effort including the attorney general's office and us attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives along with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorism task force\nThe J PDF in New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to terrorism in New York City you might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing relationship has never been stronger\nThis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought to justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service unit for intel bureau ... a counterterrorism bureau\nOr they just take it upon himself never forget the Timothy McVeigh once brought down\nA party and it's happening again now many of you will argue that he's a deep state plant that he was taken out of a deep headquarters location I don't believe any of that it looks to me like he's a lone wolf nut who was triggered by all this hatred coming from M. MSNBC CNN\nSoros and all of the others that he targeted I'm not blaming them but I'm telling you that it's very easy to hate them for what they've been saying about this country\nEspecially those have been screaming yes let the whole world into this nation if you're a poor guy on the bottom who's living on scraps and you're a party that wants millions of people to come into the country you might also snapped\nNow how can you drive around with that van and not be hassled by Democrats who have harassed people for a lot less just wear a ... you'll get harassed in this country how could he have driven around in that car without any cameras tipping anyone off\nHow can you drive a van legally with all of those windows covered can you say for sure with a hundred percent certainty that he's not a Pepsi why would a supporter of Trump and they registered Republican commit such an act right before the midterm elections let me repeat\nThat that line why would an avid supporter of Trump and they registered Republican\nCommit such an act right before the midterm elections why would he sabotage his own party when they were running so strongly\nThe motive is a rational and usually acts of terrorism are committed when there's a sense of the feeder desperation\nRepublicans in from doing well right now why would send these packages now\nWhy kicked a left when they were already down they fail or taking down Brett Kavanaugh they fail to gaining support for the migrant caravan the timing of this lone wolf mail bomb suspect is odd irrational\nBut he does have a social media presence of supporting Trump for the Republicans he does have a criminal record there is violence in his past these are things that cannot be denied and so while we entertain the possibility of a false flag earlier in the week\nWe left open the possibility that there was a real Trump supporting ... wearing person who would be found to have done this regardless this was a disaster for the Republicans in Trump no matter how this may turn out right now the left wing media\nAnd the left wing politicians or for open borders and anti America will go all out on a full frontal assault on us patriots and on Donald Trump\nThis would be worth millions if these were political ads riding themselves and that's just what happened the media will now used their power to go full negative on anything patriotic anything Trump supportive they just got their blue wave\nOr do you think I'm wrong do you think Trump is finished as a politician because of this do you think the Republicans are finished in a selection\nI'm going to open it up to you as I continue to give you a news about this man because I found some things that are worth disclosing I don't think you've seen yet the phone number is eight five five four hundred seven to eight to eight five five four hundred Savage\nOn a website entitled a heavy dot com which I linked on Michael Savage dot com we see statements about him he's a registered Republican his family was involved in fighting the Communist Party of the Philippines so it's in his DNA\nLet's see uh what else did they say that you haven't heard yet everybody knows everything we know about body building not he likes scantily clad women worked in a strip club as a bouncer he claims to be a booking agent was seminal hard\nLive claims to study prevent medicine number of our college in Florida claims to studying business at UNC Charlotte\nWe don't know any of this we do know there's a little history of his arrests in the past and we have that for you on the Savage Nation\nTwo thousand and let's go back to Nineteen Ninety One convicted of a grand theft given two years' probation and paid sixteen hundred and twelve dollars Nineteen Ninety two the bomber was arrested in Miami Dade for shoplifting\nNinety for his spouse accused of domestic abuse to the civil filing oh for rest of the twice for possession and sale of steroids oh nine arrested on the criminal traffic violation for driving without a license\nFourteen was arrested in Miami Dade for shoplifting\nTwenty Fifteen arrested in West Palm Beach for shoplifting to Walmart light said he grabbed a ... a rolling briefcase and luggage bag worth fifty eight dollars and tried to leave this still without paying\nSo ah there's enough for everybody\nWhichever side you're on you can take your side now with some justification\nBut the biggest winners you are going to be the anti American communists who are for open borders and hate Donald Trump and for those of you on the other side I guess you could always say but but but wait he's only one one thousand twenty fourth Republican\nAgain at the end of the day he has a lone wolf and he's an impotent nut and thank God nobody was hurt I open it up to the callers and a five five\nFour hundred Savage eight five five four hundred seven to eight two people are saying this why are the stickers on his van not faded they look brand new\nBroward County is a major Democrat area of the car would have been vandalized immediately number three the van would more than likely be illegal to dry but would have been pulled over immediately and they say there are so many things wrong with this picture please use your mind and think\nAnother caller says ... using mail strip her was able to mail bombs to the U.S postal service directly the home addresses of an international villain and Secret Service protective politicians writes all those missing as as ...\nYou know people are asking these questions why is they know domestic terror threat driving around in a totally obscured van arousing no suspicion I can drive without sirens lights and the cop yelling at me through a megaphone if I even have a broken tail light for five minutes now we looked up Florida law\nWhich says no person shall drive any motor vehicle\nWith any sign poster are the non transparent material upon the front windshield okay side wings or side over your windows\nOf such vehicle which materially ups trucks obscures or impairs the drivers clear view of the highway or any intersecting highway if you will look at the suspects van you will see that his side unreal windows are completely obscured with Trump related paraphernalia\nWhen when they apply to the windows\nWere they in a CIA crime lab and FBI crime lab\nOr is it really this guy how can you drive around like that without being pulled over I Know I look here's the thing is something in this for every one of those have you on the Republican side of it are you going to say it looks like a phony set up it looks like he's the ... like you said there would be yesterday you're right you're going to remember what I said where's the ... areas right\nWell here's ... well we got him now now if a Jack Ruby appears before he makes a statement will know is complete Fager let's pray to God there's no Jack Ruby that's also going to be released from a lab somewhere some training lab\nNow having said that on the other side they're convinced that you are all nuts like him remember I Want you to see the world through the eyes of an Upper East side New York liberal I Want you to imagine what it's like to wake up and immediately reach for your anti depressant and you're anti psychotic medication that's even before you brush your teeth\nYou then do a speed dial your psychiatrist to confirm the the appointment or later that morning\nUse that immediately turn on the news and you start raging then you have your minute of hate against Donald Trump\nLater on in the day you turn on Michael Savage again you get your minute of rage minute of hate\nYou listen to me and you have another minute of hey do you have any idea what this does to them do you any idea what an Upper East side whack a doodle left wing fanatic is saying today do you realize that breaking out their uh their their medication today they're going to celebrate they're going to share matched tonight\nI mean they don't drink we know that's dangerous they're going to share their meds over a lot to be before it before the ... the sun is setting today there's gonna be mad sharing latte party tonight somewhere in New York City all around the city to going to break open their bottles of ah of whatever the medication is used for psychosis I don't even know what used today\nSo there's enough to go around for both sides and I would be remiss because no one else will do it to say to you if he does not represent\nClearly represent what mass hysteria is on both sides I'd like to know who does the man is a walking example of America's insanity\nAnd if you think he is alone and having been triggered by George Soros Hillary Clinton and all of the left wing fanatics and America haters your mistaken and there's a lot more like him out there who are much more dangerous than him and I'll let that hang in the air\nJoy those Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven
