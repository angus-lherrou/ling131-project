say on the Switzerland of talk radio well for one I'm not a registered Republican I never have been\nIn fact uh I don't go to Republican events I generally don't like Republicans however in the times that we are in there's no clear a choice than ever\nAs to the safer party for most Americans and that is certainly not the lying filthy degenerate Democrats to be very ... but and this is a hard one for me to say and I know I'm going to be attacked for it but since I'm the Switzerland of talk radio I have to do this\nBoth sides are lying right now for example just today America's so-called anchorman amount of calls herself America's anchorman\nWent on the air and he said only he pointed out the Gurley a voice of Dr fraud and it was crazy I was the first one to talk about it but here's the part that gets me and I have to say\nApparently this anchorman is deaf\nAnd you can hear the release can't hear very well\nSo how could have even heard how could he I've even heard Dr fraud and then get up and say only he's an expert on voice recognition which by the way as my line from several years ago it was almost ... verbatim stolen from me when I said a few years ago I'm an expert in voices is what I Do for a living\nI have a great sense of voice recognition\nSo if the if the conservatives or the right wing\nAre lying about things like this they also lack credibility you understand what I'm saying to you\nKnow we can scream all we want about Dr fraud lying and she's apparently lying she was set up and coached to lie by the fraudulent Democrats her own ex boyfriend said she coached the friend on how to take a polygraph the woman committed perjury in front of the world\nAnd we're all outrage but when you get people on the other side of the aisle saying that they heard her say they're suddenly up girl voice and they know and you know the man can't hear it all and it's very sad\nWhat does that tell you about people on the other side both sides are filled with fraudsters\nIt's a terrible time to be the Switzerland of talk radio I'll tell you that right now\nAnd the phone number here is uh what's the difference with my phone number is what's the difference that I Am a producing a book that will be out Tuesday called stop mass hysteria what is a difference I mean I Know you're going to go buy my hard core audience will buy it you'll never see it on ... on Fox News because they are part of the cartel\nWhich is a shame\nNot all conservatives are a member of that cartel they also are blocked from fellow news which by the way is going through a big change now that lack when Murdoch took it over you're gonna see heads rolling out of that studio he's a super liberal from London\nHe does not want some of the people who are on Fox News to remain and they've known the actual is gonna fall one day wait until you see what happens in the next few months\nI don't know what they're going to do once they get off the phone news I don't know where they're going to go watch CNN MSNBC I don't know where they're going to find a job I guess they could always get to Dixie cups and the string in a video camera and podcast themselves\nAnd then they'll find out what it is to be obscure in America when they had the chance to open themselves up to a man of tells the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help him God and they chose to ignore him\nWhile so many people listen to him they'll find out what it is to be on the outside one day and as I said you last week lead Godspeed vengeance I don't I never have and I never will\nYou know they are now accusing cabin or of being angry and not having the temperament to be on the Supreme Court where'd that one come from well Dr frauds themes lion fraud stains false accusations fell apart on them\nSenator frauds things accusations blew up in their face or they they demand an FBI investigation and the Republicans call their bluff and said okay we'll give you one now that the investigations\nBe hidden and they won't even released that one that's a big one wire all the senators saying don't release the investigation what ally they're putting out McConnell now are saying no don't release the FBI investigation of cabinet we agree with Dr for US Senator frauds thing why one of those Republicans doing catering to her now\nNow in other words the FBI investigation probably exonerated cabin or from these charges of rape and such\nSo why are they not releasing it so what have they done they've now come up with a new tack to attack him he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court and I want to ask everyone listening\nLet's say you were just excoriated in public ripped apart lied about destroyed and you'll get up now and you meet some of those accusing you\nWhat would you say to them thank you well you'd be angry so they're saying is angry meaning showing his male illness showing his humanity in essence is a sign that he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court how much crazier kind of get\nThan what these these are folks are doing on the evil Democrats side\nAnd I'll tell you the man who's ... these hearings have been good for America in many ways we've got to seeing the faces of evil\nWe've seen the pure faces of evil and\nAnd vacuum the camel or Harris they said was going to run for the presidency I can guarantee you America sees that

ran are up the flagpole she's gone I can guarantee you should go nowhere she still vacuous\nAnother one who who flamed out is Cory Booker called themselves Spartacus you gotta Spartacus moment but he went further he's shown himself to be an ... actually idiotic\nI Want you to listen to Cory Booker listen to this carefully he says that Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence doesn't matter you shouldn't be forced out right now irrespective of whether he's guilty or innocent now this means Cory Booker believes\nNot in the rule of law but the ... and the rule of the lawless and the rule of the Martin in Marlboro how can anyone vote for this man so I think both of them have now disqualified themselves a for\nA any serious consideration beyond what they already are doing here is Cory Booker saying that Mr cabin or his guilt or innocence doesn't matter listen to him and oh three astonishing\nWhen his temperament has been revealed in an emotional moment where do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of ... not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial for all the ... has enough questions the raise that we should not move on to another candidate for\nThis is beyond comprehension so they've been found out to be liars and attempting to pin the tail on him saying he was a rapist and or this or that that didn't fly so now they're saying because he reacted to being smeared he's not qualified to be in the Supreme Court\nLadies and gentlemen the Savage jury let me ask you something if you had been publicly\nExcoriated humiliated lied about and you had a chance to answer some of these questions what would you have done sat there like a moron\nYou wouldn't have gotten angry what what do you want out of a human being and by the way what do you think the
