tell you what you can do if you're attacked by anti far or west or or over the mobs because everyone's asking me\nWhat can we do the left is out of control Eric Holder saying when they go low kick them Hillary is saying let's have a civil war they're all trying to outdo each other and appeasing the left wing fanatical Mars now of course what you have to understand as it's coming to your doorstep whether you want it or not\nThere at war and they want to bring the war to your door already a rap for you were at war and they want to bring them or to your door I'll wrap for you so you're asking yourself what are your legal rights to defend yourself you don't know well okay\nDan Horowitz and I had a discussion this morning about the law\nOn this and you'll be surprised what you could actually do if they do to you what they did to that man in Portland, Oregon when he's left wing scum ran after the car and hit his car with pipes\nDo you know that you have the right to defend yourself with your cars attacked by a mob you don't have to sit there and wine and call the police and you're going to find out what you actually can do to these these people\nSo now I treated this morning Savage won't stop the mobs or nation will fall\nAnd I gave some of my solutions one one of the solutions to stopping left wing Democrat mob violence one one fold the nonprofit status of the ACLU\nAnd also Ross funded groups that's number one Trump past that what's already to authorize the IRS to pull the ACLU was five oh one C. three status because they violated all of the rules of five oh one C. three when they came out against cabin or\nHe can pull all of the vital wants the three which is the nonprofit status of all the front groups that George Soros funds and if these are mob these mobs are not funded you're going to pull a lot of the action off the streets\nTo enact the Espionage Act enact the Espionage Act and if you can prove that any of these leaders\nNational lawyers guild ACLU I can name ten other groups their old to be found and stop I Know you already said I I'm not a lot of say you're upset that I say that my books name as a stock mass hysteria I'll say it again\nEnact the Espionage Act and the rest of the leadership if they're violating the Espionage Act and he has a nice one for you\nI look very carefully the videos of the left wing moms and they're filled with illegal aliens who are being abroad out to these riots especially here in the west coast San Francisco Los Angeles Portland Seattle they're filled with non citizens\nDeport any alien courted mob actions arrest them immediately and deport them right over the border these are all\nLegal tactics but what you're going to hear from my attorney and your attorney the attorney the Savage Nation than our which will actually make you say are you kidding I can do that did you hear me Savage won't stop the mobs donation will fall that's the screaming headlines\nWhen you see the former chief law enforcement officer of the United states of America I've always known what was I Want you about Eric Holder from the get go I knew with this man was\nHe said when they go low kick them Hillary says you can't be civil with Republicans another she wants a civil war that Hillary Clinton so let's listen to your friend Eric Holder who is now a criminal suggesting criminality and violence listen carefully\nThey have to use the powers that may have gotten for all the wrong things they want to keep themselves in how they want to cater to special or you just time for us and you have a grant\nTo be as tough as they are to be dedicated to millions and committed in them Michele always there and sell them all over you know when they go low we know bagel [laughter] [noise]\n\nThat was his new democratic already about\nThe new Democratic Party is clearly about violence and you have a choice\nHow do you fight back against violence now there are many ways to do it you can avoid the violence which is the best method\nWhether Europe or sportsmen are not even if you're in the boxing arena or I mean let's say martial arts the first rule was always avoid a fight outside the ring that's the first rule my advice to you is avoid situations where you can let the left wing worm and get near you but let's say you're out to dinner with your wife\nAnd a waiter is one of those with let's say rings on his lips\nOr those big ... earrings that look they look like a bugs crawl down there is hanging off each year whatever those symbolized big things hanging off the lobes I don't know what that means I I used to know what a ring and the left the amount of ... around the writer you meant something else now there are so many rings and things hang your people's heads I don't know what they mean anymore\nBut let's say you get one of those bug jobs with the rings on the lips serving you and they have you're talking about something that you believe in ... Trump\nStop mass hysteria whatever it is you're reading my book and then they go and they tap their little phones and they get a mob to come in the restaurant and they surround you at your table and start screaming at you what are your rights you know what they are you have to run like a coward\nOr what if they tread you out of the restaurant you decide to leave because you don't want to fight\nAnd you're getting your car and these these bombs start banging on your car with pipes as they did to that poor man in Portland, Oregon what are your rights you know what they are I don't think you do\nBecause all I hear people whining which is how we going to stop them well less you know what your rights are aren't you unless you know what the law is\nYou're going to run from them\nAnd I'm saying don't run and don't hide Eric says Eric Holder says that the new Democratic Party stands for war and violence that's what he just said\nSo he's very clear at least Eric Holder finally came out from behind a charade of being some nice guy from New York City he's not a nice guy from New York City he's always been a thug from the get go and now that he has shown himself for what he is you have an obligation to know what your rights are\nAnd go back to what I said at first you don't misinterpret Michael Savage\nAvoid at all costs confrontation meaning do not confront these violent mobs that's what they want however if you get into an untenable situation what are your rights well you'll hear that as the show goes on the other topics are\nThe main topic would just stop the moms or the nation will fall right\nHave you given a copy of my book to a cop yet I'm going to just plain ask you have a yes or no and on the third day of publication I normally do this can you please call and what's your favorite sentence or paragraph or part of the book I'll be right back\nJoy both Savage Nation coal know eat bugs or Hubbard Savage eight by four Hubbard seven to eight to ...\nJust Savage Nation is sponsored by switched America the only company I trust with my financial future recall eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or switched America dot com if you were a loved one struggles with like a foot graph you've got\nCity or if you consider how much do the Japanese premium brand US News World Report and into the two thousand Eighteen best friends they build some of the most psychological SUVs voice overs available today\nOne reason is active technology more power to performance out of their engines that means you spend less on gas for the best places to ... to see a five months of the ex nice as Ramsey myself beautiful place a new Seventeen as soon as Bergen County New Jersey we don't need that some best Missouri dealership in New Jersey\nHow do they do it so much for fighting experience that means no waiting around to get prices of payments quickly floods of choices front or will drive SUVs but the most of the uh five is a great choice not to go to a big family feed that third row seats about checking out the Missouri the ex nine studies a premium SUV for you visit Ramsey myself here a test drive today\nSpecial offers available all my fault qualified by our subject to primary under approval all costs will be paid by the consumer except for the taxes on the cell lines Halloween October thirty first of Eighteen\n... had Hackensack Murray and help we believe the best healthcare is perfectly orchestrated researchers working with doctors to treat the most complex conditions specialists identifying problems sooner and everything you need for primary care to emergency care home health to rehab\nOne reason is active technology more power to performance out of their engines that means you spend less on gas for the best places to ... to see a five months of the ex nice as Ramsey myself beautiful place only Seventeen as soon as Bergen County New Jersey we don't need this ...
