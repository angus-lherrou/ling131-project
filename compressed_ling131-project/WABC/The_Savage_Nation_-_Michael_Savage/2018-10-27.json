more on animals that's right\nSo you you you kind of wish you had gone to Tanzania or another African country will thank you that was really really helpful for our listeners who are considering so far as we appreciate your calling let's turn next to Mary in Trumbull to Connecticut Mary I hear that you weren't going to answer a question of the day why do you travel\nA yes for our family we have a travel to discover or genealogy and our roots\n... what a great reason yeah a lot\nYou know what the landscape looked like or the country look like that your ancestors came from\nSo where where have you traveled than where where your ancestors from\nUm my father's family is from the um\nWell actually Lithuania was pole and then um illness area of it was polling and then it was Russian and now it's all this land and um he's my mother's side is from um the ... the check Slovak Republic\nHuh so a lot of a lot of Eastern Europe and I and what did you find when you when did you find relatives long lost relatives or a site that you'd been told about as a child\n[noise] I'm On my father's side he wanted us to a discovery has a cousin or his father's a\nRelatives relative yeah and I'm actually I had given him the uh one of the DNA tests and I was disappointed in a result because it came back and said that he was from Poland and and then it's at five percent lithuanian Russian huh we already sort of knew that\nRight so not no big surprise ... rise yeah like um because you wanted to go to Italy you wanted to go to Tahiti instead no I'm kidding I as I said if I thought that\nIt was really interesting to see 'em you know the some of the relatives and then also in Lithuania to see what the landscape looked like and what the town look like and what the culture look\nFor Iraq you know I got to go to Poland because I I also trace my heritage once uh\nAnd my grandmother had been from a little town that went back and forth between Poland in Russia it's right outside ... stock which I never knew was a real town I just thought it was a punch line and the producers or this or\nAdd and she was from a little town called ... which is actually spelled aloe an essay but I learned how to pronounce it\nAnd I'd always heard terrible things about Poland from my relatives because my ancestors were fleeting pulled and they were Jews and so they were being hit with pogroms you know they were in ... fear of their lives and going there I saw for the first time\nThe beauty of what they left Poland is absolutely a gorgeous country with green fields and ancient cities and\nUh it it I never saw I always knew that it was great that they got out but I never felt so keenly what they had lost by leaving and and that was what I learned when I went uh that\nThat it ... in a way probably marry learn both about herself and about others yeah combine both of our answers one of my favorite\nTV shows is the genealogy show it's called the who do you think you are oh yeah that was ... years first on NBC and now I think it's on the learning channel or something\nBut they'll take a celebrity and they'll do their genealogy and wherever it leads the celebrity struggle\nSo it's really a travel show too\nThat you know you start on the celebrities living room and then you find out that his grandfather was fought with William Wallace or whatever and you go around the world with them and there's a faster than trouble walk as well so I think a lot of people now are getting into geological travel and it's a real touchstone for a lot of feelings with a lot of learning yeah yeah I ...\nOn my father's side one brother came to the United states and the other one stage huh and the question is why I did one commonwealth escaped World War one right and why does the other one's day yeah yeah\nAnd those are the questions that you're probably you know are in your mind for years and then you traveled and you get maybe some answers or maybe more questions you never know but it's fascinating thank you so much Mary\nFor calling let's turn next to Alan Asbury Park he out your live on the Frommer's travel show thank you for calling\n...

I mean it was a little bit more expensive to Hawaii but I mean it was an enjoyable experience but now I mean I was on the fight the harder it was just ... with all their their ... a boarding group\nI Know I hate on U.S born in groups but I kind of scale\nThat was probably what five percent of the time you spent on vacation I mean the flights can be uncomfortable but isn't that the travel when you get there worth it or is the flight so bad that it cast a shadow I'm On the rest of your travels\nA ways into the discussion I'll I'll put it that way and\nUh actually the other part and my question is so I I Am going to a RO in\nA in the area and I just booked on Norwegian Air out of stores have you gotten any feedback on on Norwegian Air because I Am Hawaii for three twenty seven round trip but\nI Know isn't that amazing no region is very basic cell you know you may have to pay extra for your bags do check that you may have to pay extra for your seat assignment they get ya on the little extras that used to be free a but other\nThat they're safe or you know it's not going to be any less comfortable or than airlines that charge more on that round which means it's going to be uncomfortable that's flying now a days but it should be you know it should be fine ah I I haven't heard anything really bad about Norwegian of you\nKnow and they're expanding like crazy too I Know people are now putting up with those airlines that offer less in order to pay less it gives you the option just to bring a carry on for a few days to worry about all those other expenses so yeah it's

Douglas Howard the\nFounder and formulate or of balance of nature [noise] this is a conversation you don't want to mess as we discuss the variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life Dr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard thank you so much for joining us today and I just\nWant to ask I have so many questions about balance of nature I don't even know where to start how you it's great to be here again Hi Laura good to be back I'm very curious as to how\nThey can actually be a product on the market that's nothing but fruits and vegetables with absolutely nothing else in it how in the world can this be life changing and where did you get the idea for it and how did you know which fruits and vegetables to actually select for the product balance of nature\nWhat started out I studied in Russia for several years and while I was there I started seeing the need for nutrition more and more and when I returned back to my practice in the United states then I started seeing how lousy our diets really were when I started really realizing how important the balance of chemistry is how much\nA to see the deed easy and\nBack then I still believe that the was the vitamins nuts and hormone anyways and\nAnd I started seeing the the necessity of balance of chemistry\nAnd so I started searching which one was the best which by them was the best in balance and at the same time then the the notion started coming of um\nYou know we're we're discovering more and more chemistry and fruits and vegetables ... of course it and uh\nThe accent then that all these different chemicals that we're finding have positive effects\nBut they were from different fruits and vegetables and so then I was on that path and I was looking for which of these vitamins [noise] is going to be\nThe magical vitamin there was a day that that I was like well I'm searching for the perfect balance of all of this chemistry and at the same time there's all this chemistry we haven't even discovered yet that's when I started learning that there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals just in an apple alone\nAnd hundreds of thousands in an orange and and all of them and then I went well wait\nAll you may be dead when we find this magic chemical I'm looking for because out of all of this how am I going to find the needle haystack and on top of that I already know where the perfect balance of all of these items is it's in our fruits and vegetables who's already made for us for our bodies\nAnd so that's when I went okay I've got to get back to that I just have to get my patients to be able to consume that\nAnd as I did that first I started trying to have them have better diets well that was like leaving a horse to water and trying to get him to drink to didn't want to drink\nAnd then and then I started having some people juice 'cause I thought okay well I can get them to juice and get a concentrated amount well\nLater I realized that's an extract because for example I got people to juice but they were using mostly ... apple let's say maybe cared apple and celery but I've had patients starting to come in with kidney mia which means\nThey were turning orange because they just were consuming so much you know and a carrot juice well that wasn't healthy that we're not supposed to be orange then I started ...\nYes yeah but it was all\nBut I was having a depression and that was before nine eleven ... that was the ten years before nine eleven from made it a Ninety Nineteen Ninety One to two thousand and one then nine eleven it\nAnd that was like a and I was supposed to work that day I worked a day before and uh which was my birthday September tenth\nAnd that was relieved by two of my best friend's sadness cross who was a battalion chief in my division tank commander and he was acting deputy that night so I was relieved at six o'clock\nOn Monday Night by Dennis and to me ... who is the captain and the ... road with him because there was no place for him to work every ... every\nEvery unit was covered so and when that happens in a captain is assigned to work he rise with the deputy chief and that's what happened or that morning that road together and ah I never saw them again\nSo can you just give us the name of the books really quickly and six terror\nShowed her first book is a left or tears in muscle drums
