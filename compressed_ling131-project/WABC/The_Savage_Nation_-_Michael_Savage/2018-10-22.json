I'm Rob dos and what the stories you'll be talking about on Seventy seven WABC the migrant caravan with thousands run the Central American country of Honduras continue their track toward the United states\nAre happy right now because they say oh this is great we can't wait to see those illegal aliens who we call citizens are on that border let's see what he's going to do that huh\nWell I don't know why is Nancy Pelosi not there was fourteen thousand foot ... she can give them all foot washers that she did in a great show solidarity with the illegals in the past and why are the others not there with a foods and whatnot\nMoreover I Want to ask you something where were they relieving themselves along the way\nWhere the fourteen thousand people relieving themselves I don't understand that who's taking care of them they can all be coming to Nancy Pelosi city in order to relieve themselves on the sidewalks\nI mean they heard about it is a great place to do with our New York subway is a picture today in New York of a bomb dropping his pants or the subway in front of everyone and urinating on the tracks and the train comes to a screeching halt Holt\nThis is not civilized society we are no longer a civilized nation and I don't blame the conservatives for it we would never permit that's never in a million years would we permitted bombs to deprecating urinate not streets Norwood we permitted armies to invade the nation\nThe blame squarely belongs with you the good nature liberal who's never found any way to disagree with anything that I say\nAnd so can you tell me all your liberals are so concerned with health care\nAnd your health care benefits that's all you're worried about where's the money could come from you have all these illegals come across the border where where's the healthcare going to come from for you you know that they're going to get better health care then you you know that don't you do you do that right now illegals can go to any emergency room in America and qualify for the best health care in the entire world without showing any ideas you know that\nYou know hospitals are not allowed to ask for any idea because of you and yet you're complaining that your health care isn't good enough\nWell I'm going to ask you again you are now an advisor to the president of the United states of America the caravans have now combine and they're grown to at least fourteen thousand illegal aliens who are invading the nation and it could become Trump's Waterloo while right now it's only Trump's our most of it\nIs an existential threat to the nation and to the presidency of Donald Trump now you've seen the footage\nStrapping young men and good new clothing\nOr in front of them women pushing strollers with five children in the stroller\nAre we supposed to take care of all of these people every third world impoverished person in the world is coming here on the truth is we can't take care of them all moral but there's another question that is begging to be answered according to the Democrats we are a racist nation\nWhen the Democrats were very very bad to illegal immigrants were racist to Hispanics and what are they coming here for if this is such a horrible nation and so racist widely all breaking down our door to get in here\nAnd I guess another horrible truth for all of you\nThere's not a liberal listening to this program who wants to them here can you name any one in the Upper East side of the Upper West side of Manhattan who really wants hordes of illegal aliens in the neighborhood\nDo you actually think they're going to rush out an invite these people to dinner now they don't want their quiet little lives ruined\nLet's be clear this was an attempt by the Democrats\nTo create mass hysteria against President Trump against Republicans and against the Americans who support them that means you when I this is how evil the Democratic party has become because if we were a sovereign sane nation there would be no division on this issue\nBut they would like to see Trump send the military to the border\nAnd they would like to see immigrants brutally mistreated or shot and killed at the border they'd like to see a killing at Kent State they can hold up the pictures but make no mistake about it this is an invasion and invasion army it's an army without guns\nYou might say that no one of the nation on earth would allow something like this to happen but you would be wrong\nBut he's communist president Angela Merkel did this to Germany and look what happened to them\nLeaders in Germany are now getting up in gloating and saying there are no Germans any more there are French communists was saying the no French anymore they're English communist saying there is knowing with anymore and now in America that you want someone to stand up and ... there are no Americans anymore\nWell this big caravan and the others that will come after it or an existential threat to the survival of the nation that but it's not stopped\nAnd the question goes back to the first one I asked them to Savage Nation how does Donald Trump stop it he is the commander in chief he does not need Congress to approve his actions when it comes to the military so what should the military do\nWhen they're sent to the border\nTell me what they should do what you their rules of engagement big are they going to be water cannons rubber bullets\nHow far should they go Trump is the man in the driver's seat we put him there just for this alone did you and I just said\nNever forget what Trump was elected on he was elected on stopping the flood of immigrants coming into America I don't care what else you may have voted for that's the number one issue that he took and ran with right\nWell this is now his moment so how does he stop the human wave\nWell here's a ... a thought this a little troubling\nIt doesn't really matter what Trump does if he sends the military to the border the vermin in the media will follow and they will make their pictures and videos and frame interviews with women and children to fit their sick narrative and we'll make it look like Trump their military the border patrol the Republicans are all evil white men\nResorting to drastic measures to keep brown mothers and children from a better life in America you can you can bet your Social Security on that\nThey did the same thing with the separation policy at the border\nDid you notice that every media member every Democrat in Congress every democratic spoke every Democrat spokesperson all of them said Trump was ripping children from their parents remember the narrative ripping children from their parents ripping families apart\nYou think that's the ... the word was chosen on purpose and they all collaborate and then using it it was to create an image in your mind and it was to induce a mass hysteria against not only Donald Trump but against this nation itself\nNow I Will invite you to call on this issue but I don't want to flood myself only with this because there are other issues that are plaguing me I almost did a periscope performance over the weekend on Trump ripping up the nuclear\nControl agreement with Russia\nIt scared me to my core because this was one of Reagan's signature achievements was working out a nuclear control agreement with Russia and then I wake up and I see oh Trump's gonna rip it up and throw it out why now I'm going to make is very clear\nDonald Trump is surrounded by nationalists and global is over the last several months the global is taking control of this administration\nMost notably the walrus once I saw that little bellicose walrus enter the inner circle I knew things were going to go really bad in this country and in the world\nThat bellicose nuts the walrus the national security advisor is struggling around the world stage throwing his weight around threatening Russia as we speak\nIt's not going to end very well for the world because I Will tell you this I hear all of Russia violated the agreement first of all how do you know that's true\nWhat because you read that in the newspapers do really know Russia actually violated the agreement number one and number two if you have an agreement with someone and you think they're violating it if you call them and say I'm ripping up the agreement they no longer have any reason whatsoever to talk with you about abiding by any part of that agreement\nThat is the stupidest thing I've ever seen the dumbest thing I've ever seen and it's a turn from what Trump was elected to do never forget why I backed him I didn't know Donald Trump before he ran I met him once or twice I didn't know him but I made it a rational decision\nOn this show and I bet you if you haven't voted in the years to come out and vote that you remember when I said to you I said this may be our last chance he's not a politician but most importantly\nI did this because I knew he could beat the others and I knew that he alone could beat Hillary Clinton I was right but there was another thing about it that you may not remember I kept saying to you Donald Trump as a man of peace\n... Donald Trump is not an intervention is Donald Trump once our troops out of Afghanistan he wants our troops back home Donald Trump even set on this show in November of twenty sixteen that if I win Michael he said I Will meet with President ... and he said that right on the show long forgotten but I haven't forgotten that\nDonald Trump ran as a man of peace and as a non interventionist\nThat's such a big issue that I also want to get to but primarily today we're going to talk about the confrontation at the border the Alamo as I call it and I'm going to ask you\nWhat would you advise the president to do can you come up with a solution to the bathroom and thought up yet\nNow over the weekend I came up with an interesting one liners from Russia collusion and the on the left to Russia collusion on the right stock mass hysteria and I'll be right back to discuss these topics on the Savage Nation\nJoined us Savage Nation coal no eight five or four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to ...\nSavage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future recall eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com are you taking my anger\nHas arrived and it's time to fall into the health\nTo excuses\nAnd yet we still need\nAnd I W J Barnabas how\nWe offered the latest in comprehensive breast health services\nIncluding mammograms reading anagram genetic testing and breast surgery [noise]\nNot to mention peace of mind [noise]\nWith breast health centers located throughout New Jersey [noise] finding is simple\nTo me the most of breast cancer awareness month\nBy visiting I W J.

was going to work and he worked as hard out till he was able to open a little store in Manhattan and they got a heart attack and forty seven from working so hard and died\nThat my father died in his early fifties from killing himself so I man Charlotte the promised land could do it the right way\nAnd every step of the way on my road has been difficult and hard maybe it's me maybe it's my karma but I'm Still here and I'm here for a reason and one of the reasons I'm here was to help elect Donald Trump I played a big role in this election well I'd like to suggest\nThat you the audience that voted for Donald Trump helped Donald Trump stop this invasion but I don't see any creative ideas coming out right now\nAnd I will tell you that that was a strategic era in the Trump Administration\nYou probably haven't heard this yet because either the media is against Trump or lick his boots either America's anchor ham who attacked you and I America's ... ridiculed Trump for your strike it's OK I'm Glad he joined the team because it's good for ratings\nUh but citing NAFTA before the midterms was one of the greatest mistakes strategically ever made why do I say that\nBecause Donald Trump should have waited until after the elections to negotiate with the Mexican government because if he had waited until after the midterms to have a negotiated NAFTA completely\nHe could have had the Mexican government stopped the illegal aliens from entering this nation through Mexico he would've said here are the terms okay we want to do a deal with you but this is a big deal to us so we'll sided after the elections\nBut you're going to stop them before they even get near the border now what would you do a few Mexico you would've said okay look we we got to do it\nOr what would you do if you're Mexico now when you got everything you wanted to NAFTA and then some and now it's not their problem it's our problem to tell me what you'll do now for your Mexico nothing tell me what what what what what leverage that we have over Mexico now that they signed away all of our negotiating power so they say the ... of the deal I'm Sorry that was a disaster but like\nMany of you are under the mistake of the notion of Donald Trump is not a man you think he's a God this is the worst thing you could possibly think\nHe's a man he's only a man he's a smart man but it's only a man why you're turning a man into something that he's not\nWhy do you people think that a leader should be a God or a demagogue you did it with a bomb on the left thought he was a God look adapted to this country\nThe damage is done to this nation internationally has not yet been told just look at Iran and what he's done so that nation's ability to destroy so many people on this planet but let's put Obama aside right now Donald Trump is president\nAnd as a man I'm sure he's up at night wondering what can I actually do every scenario imaginable runs through a person's mind doesn't run through your mind when you're facing a problem\nWhether it's a child who's in trouble or a bad marriage you probably neutralizes everything you think that you're going to do I think I'll do this than something then your mind says no you can't because of that so if you weigh him you'd be saying okay well put troops on the board and you can't do that because I\nWas a hundred of reasons why he should but he can't so what county do tell me what he actually can to\nBuild a wall well that should've been done a long time ago that's what he was elected for that was his signature campaign

all about I tried to warn you that this was a movement to stir up mass hysteria on both sides by the way\nAnd I've also so far in this program been as constructive as anyone in the media could ever be because I've told you what I think the president must do and that is called the national news conference at the right in the in the oval office not excuse me not by treating\nNot through a bellicose speech in front of a crowd which changes his demeanor\nBut in the very somber setting of the oval office\nDesk residential seal unannounced conference the president speak tonight at eight o'clock to the nation and the world and he announces we have an international crisis on our borders it's a national emergency no nation can survive an influx of this nature\nI Know that most Americans want health care for all while that is not possible and while we do have the best healthcare system in the world\nI'm here to tell you that each illegal alien cost this country approximately eighty five thousand dollars over a lifetime is probably much higher than that in medical care and medical costs alone\nAnd if you do the numbers\nThis medical system will be broken if we let these poor people in and while I have compassion for them wanting to improve their lives by coming here\nWe cannot permitted because we'll lose the greatest medical system in the world for everyone and for that reason I Am here by authorizing the military\nTo a approach the border now the problem is is that they have to be stopped before they get to the border because by international law I think once they cross the border we have to process than for an asylum claim that starts with the laws are thanks to the Schumer polo she a complex\nIt's going to have to be a little different than that and I haven't worked out the details I think that since we signed NAFTA unfortunately an foolishly NAFTA was signed a few weeks ago it destroyed and he would go shooting power we may have over the Mexican government\nUh but I assume there are still some elements of NAFTA that haven't been ... that we have some draws whatever the Mexican military must be stationed way before the border\nLike a hundred miles before the border in Mexico\nBelieve me they know how to take care of the ... the immigrant problem trust me on that they don't have the human rights problems that we do\nOkay just speak to any Guatemalan who came here you'll hear about the Mexican military now nicely they and how you mainly they treat other Hispanics just in case you your mind is so twisted you think that it's all one brother you know\nSo they they know how to deal with the problem you have the detention centers you give them the humanitarian care that they need in Mexico and maybe we pay for it there but they can't come here it's that simple and that's the end of ...\nHarder to well what's so complicated why it's so hard to think about doing that why is it so hard I Want to take some calls have been on the air for an hour and a half having taken one call\nWe had a a former da and call and tell me that he knows for a fact\nThat many of these people are smuggling drugs ... was a logical to assume that have Seventeen to twenty thousand people at least a few of them would be carrying a drugs in the in a baby carriage how many movies do you have to watch the figure it out you haven't seen enough of them\nOkay\nSo what do you think should be done ... when there are other answers\nWhat if a million Americans went to the Mexican border what if there was a million American marched to the border\nAnd we the people went to the border and said enough is enough what would happen then well that's terrible thought isn't a but what if a million American people went to the border I don't know the logistics of that may be Al Sharpton could help organize that he's real good at bringing people Bernie Sanders probably knows how to do that\nThey wouldn't know an went around the buses probably owned by Republicans\nYou know probably on the buses and the Koch brothers probably on the ... the water supplies on the border for all I Know I Know they should they own them a lot of the detention centers the so called the conservative so what's your answer down there\nHuh All right we can get your calls if you want or rather hear me talk about it\nWell let's begin in the segment by playing some rational sound here is representative Louie Gohmert on the migrants invasion and clip the number one on the Savage Nation\nThe president made no bones about it and uh uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite president smut and lightning ... gangs came across\nThe border and New Mexico and get with a bunch of people are not only did he four Seventy
