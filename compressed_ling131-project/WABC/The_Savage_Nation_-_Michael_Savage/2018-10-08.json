that time are still alive and they've cultivated an entire generation of new hippies if you want to call them that\nAnd the old hippies got the mobs in the streets against the Vietnam War against LBJ and they started rioting on the college campus called Kent State\nWell the governor of a state called out the national guard they fixed bayonets and they faced off against the rabble the long haired rabbit was threatened to take down take down the whole campus\nAll the riders didn't stop no one had ever stop them before unfortunately the rest of this historically factual and that is somebody amongst the national guard open fire on them and then others that the little form of mass hysteria by the way and the number of students were shot dead on that campus\nOne of the results of it in addition to the tragedy of the students being shot\nWas that the entire student movement came to a grinding halt\nSuddenly they cut their hair went home to mommy and took a job in McDonald's there were no longer out there in the streets rioting because they were afraid that they could get shot dead by the national guard\nAnd I'm afraid that this was going to happen if they keep talking to

amusing to me\nIt's a form of violence that must be stopped and the only way to stop them is by passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stopped at the people's house garbage already we're not living in the in the early days of the founding here where we're now infiltrated\nWere infiltrated they're everywhere they're running the television shows they've infiltrated the university's they've infiltrated the ... the peaceful front groups\nAnd it's only a matter of time until one of these lunatics shoots a senator or congressman and I think that we need to take
