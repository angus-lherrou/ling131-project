full but it's beautiful and not too cold um I found something really interesting on the boulevard subtle wrong which is a it's a major avenue going north up to Montreal\nOn and it's a historic district and it's been one of the major thoroughfares for more than a hundred years hundred and fifty years I've noticed that when it became a historic district on the sidewalk between each building they put a little plaque and on one end of the ... the other side on the building to the left do say Eighteen eighty one\nAnd on the radio saying Nineteen eighty five whatever the numbers change you realize that it's their tone you wind the building\nWas built so you can walk along the\nThe the pavement and say okay this is going to be doing Seventy nine news from Nineteen thirty four it's really quite interesting that has an interesting effect of making you've really appreciate the architecture and the history that you're walking in front of the average buildings would they know a deli and the bottom of this one in a store in the bottom of that when you start to realize\nThere was a long history and it also makes you realize how poor modern architecture has been\nNo it's not going to stand up like the ones with the Eighteen in front of their building date yeah it's a really cool thing so if you're in Montreal and the son of the wrong avenue yoga boulevard you'll see it's a little edition\nAnd just a comment on Schwartz is people don't realize when there was a big uh immigration of uh Jews from Eastern Europe they went to New York and they went to Montreal and so you get some of the best deadly food and bagels in the world in Montreal a\nLot it's been open since Nineteen twenty six and not blowing around it's going to almost a hundred years of history and I know you know

days but we want to know where we said go and not ...\nThe most people when they do a quick little trip or a three day trip 'cause it's a it's quite a rugged country and have to to drive a lot if you want to see the whole thing they just do the south western portion of it\nOr that means you fly into ... which is the airport for Reykjavik\nWhile you're near um ... you go to the famous blue do which is the uh it's a hot springs full silica water at the beautiful color and uh it's a great way to either start or injure trip you have to kill a little time going to the airport\nThe city of Reykjavik the sites are pretty obvious uh we see this beautiful gift these real you'll see we're Gorbachev and Reagan had their famous or some it in the eighties or it's not a huge town so that's pretty self explanatory\nBut from there and you should probably rent a car and go east to see a couple of the giant ah waterfalls again these are the tourists\nPlaces because they are close to regular but so far is one ... another these or you'll hear everyone talked about these wonderful\nUm and just sort of take your pick the road um they're all well paved roads they just go a day or two east and then turn around and go west you won't have any trouble you will need anything but an average rental car um you'll find it quite easy going places to stop and get them into drink but\nIt is you know there's not a lot of cities in between you'll be we go across the empty countryside for hours on end in between stops and do you really feel like he got a taste of Iceland\nI okay Patty we have a great guide book

back it's great to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to\nPeople all over the country in terms of uh encouraging people to take their fruits and veggies everyday\nDr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept in the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits and vegetables into a capsule and why well\nActually years years of study you know it's interesting other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad we're not a fad were something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this is made it happened and\nI always ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours and blah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nWe don't get it is not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just a business it's trying to get on the shelf and convince people were about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said that the health coaching for example that's why we offer that is to help people like celery the result is no extra fees there's no extra charge for it\nInfects business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that to bomb but it just costs you money no that use what we are about results\nSo people say to me often oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take you know balance of nature because I keep\nI I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so

are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me\nOh no I take the vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you you need tend to eleven servings of fruits and pets\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond ... studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out where new to you know to even studies about the discounts to do the blood or in other words\nThe thickness of the blood how flows beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels all of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different vegetables that made the greatest impact on those things and the DNA for example how to protected the most\nAnd how quickly DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard
