solo cups parties and celebrated Brett Kavanaugh arm and maybe through a cup of ice on your neighbor or something just for good measure\nThere is say there is an establishment in Washington DC where Brett Kavanaugh is known to to to hang out a place he is known to frequent and\nThe people that go there many of whom are liberal Democrats it's Washington DC have known him for many years and speak very highly of them even though they're liberal Democrats and voted for Hillary and so on\nA day we're at this establishment they were handing out buttons on Saturday Night\nThat say I like beer or

are they're not good people they're not nice people\nAbsolutely wacky these are these people\nHere's another headline from the New York times white women come get your people as they are very angry

tell them the word white is a pejorative\nTo them the word men is a pejorative\nAnd when you combine them it's like search you know to to things that one\nWhite men say that's that's a double pejorative it's say smear it says slander to refer to someone as a white man we're talking about anything that's white men uh and honestly I really I Want to start taking away electricity and things I Want to start taking right things that white people have given\nTo other people just start taking them away\nUntil they start to appreciate comes sniffling grumbling back and and plead please no please give me electricity back\nI really need electricity sorry no sorry you can't have it the New York times electric screwed out with a daddy issues I think Eli Watkins was in the news ... wasn't you this weekend which she putting out she ... she was a Eli Watkins at the New York times she puts that she has sex for scoop should she uh she gives in ...\nIt's acts of journalistic\nGratification provided by Eli Watkins at the New York Times She's a reporter in good standing with a New York times just sex for scoops with men as far as we know plural multiple but listen to this the New York times white women come get your people\nAfter a confirmation process where women all ... slit their wrists letting their stories of sexual trauma run like rivers of blood through the capital the Senate still voted to confirm judge Brett am cabinet or to the Supreme Court\nShe's very emotional I think not not really stable I I'm I think rivers of blood through the capital it's quite an image that she's conjured up your slit their risk now let me ask what is Brett Kavanaugh will have to do with this because\nThey didn't game gang raped the teenagers after dragging them with quite loads and the punch we we all know that didn't happen um the didn't wagon Sweeney at a Deborah Ramirez at Yale in her freshman year\nI Know this because she told a bunch of her friends a week earlier\nThat she didn't remember who I had to wait to get her in college but then after sitting on it so to speak for six days ah she she went to the New Yorker and Ronan Farrow and said oh yeah I'm definitely I've consulted with my lawyer and I've wrecked my brain for six days to see if my memory would come back\nI assume that she used the heel of her hand to pound the side of her head repeatedly commit comeback memory comeback comeback memory I Need to remember I Need a memory\nAnd so she pretended to remember after six days of thinking real hard\nThing getting into thing can and then she remembered real good and then she went to the New York is the New Yorker and she said yes it was Brett Kavanaugh even though I just saw a number of my friends that I don't remember who it was and all this and now they're splitting wrists and the rivers of blood and the capital and and as soon as this is the New York times this is just not\nLike the Huffington Post like other hate screwed over there and and it is um boy\nIt is amazing to me what bad losers there you know get used to it because Trump is president\nAnd a winning winning just keeps winning President Trump just keeps winning\nBut remember that it's all Michael ... his fault because he went too far the Washington Post they were fine with the ah Christine Ford he jumped on me and did the gator in Nineteen eighty something but I don't ... remember what and then they got the bagging woman Romero's from Yale nobody believed to not even the New York times\nAnd where they wanted to but they didn't believe and then Michael ... came out with the the are really the the jewel in the crowd I think they that they knew it was remarkable\nAnd the Washington Post on Saturday\nTalking about how great it was when they just had that we need a rag are and the and the growth for the Christie and Ford and Deborah mirrors\nAnd that ... ah the post they think that he took it too far but be additional claims had an unexpected effect\nNow I I and I love that line widely deemed less credible than forwards assault allegations they gave Kevin supporters fresh ammunition to cast all the charges as a political his job and it's called evidence\n[noise] it's called evidence and and we like evidence where conservatives we believe in due process\nUm that you are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law uh where where ... and we're in favor of drinking games we'd like drinking games are due process and the concept that you're innocent until proven guilty\nBut Democrats say they apparently they just they like Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton and Anthony winter and John Edwards Eliot Spitzer\nAnd the list goes on and on Barney Frank can\nUh Gary ... they love Jerry ... she was bending over the pages and the house of representatives and they're getting a standing ovation as it's the all ... the old joke was as Democrat Jerry ... was having sex sex with teenage male pages\nThat their parents said to Washington learned about government boy did they learn about governor\nThe hard way that got the shaft and it was a Gary studs given at Germany it was a Democrat remember the house of representatives when it was discovered that this Congress members having sex with the underage male pages that were were running messages around Capitol Hill\nThe Democrats gave them a standing ovation in the house representatives they literally did\nThat's not an exaggeration that's not a joke and and I I just like let me pause on this for a second but the additional claims had an unexpected effect well what was the expected effect [laughter]\nBe expected effect was that it would drive Brett Kavanaugh out of the discussion that was the expected effect that's\nThat's what they do that's who they are I have a great deal of audio from the news media from over the weekend up attacking the president for daring to tell the truth that they have cirrhosis funded groups and their representatives out they're organizing protestors on Capitol\nHill and when President Trump tweeted that over the weekend the left what Missouri and I made the news media west Missouri saying oh no that's false that's not true there are no paid organizers at and are not paid protesters you know I [noise]\nThey're sad they're really they're sad [noise] the news media is tragic\nAnd they're doing a little bit of navel gazing
