he had convinced several friends in Honduras to try to reach the United states again with them [noise]\nAll my life is there he said waiting for me [noise]\nHe's at an English I miss my PlayStation I miss my buffalo wings I miss my car\nYou think what he was deported they could have put the PlayStation and some buffalo wings in the trunk and and driven back or you know through a very old maybe ... where\nPeople were some Barrows and drink my ... and sort of a sudden it's a wonderful place and then there's this thing well you know that's great I understand the United states is nice and um\nI don't use a play station buffalo wings or find not one of my favorite things but this is what he says he's coming back for a moslem you out a PlayStation and buffalo wings ... all of which I think are available in may ... if I'm not mistaken [noise]\nDidn't get all of those things may be the buffalo wings will be a little more spicy maybe a little different I don't know\nAnd yes we're going through various versions of the song caravan because\nAs I said I have ten rendition of the song and remind have to go through\nAs this caravan heading toward the United states of America\n... found or\nYou'll let 'em in or else and that's kind of what we're getting this is what we're getting from the Caribbean and from the Democrats and Mexico is a they've decided to screw us I guess that's what they've decided\nAnd I think that President Trump should launch cruise missile strike against the central government in Mexico city and then see what they have to say about it [laughter]\nI'm kidding race shouldn't really do a cruise missile strike against Mexico\nMexico should be helping us out here or we should uh kick them firmly in the box and politically of course an economically as a means of correcting their behavior because their behavior need some correction\nAnd I honestly do believe at this point that the Trump Administration should be looking at we were sent secretary of state Mike Pompeo down there the other day to talk to the Mexican government about stopping this travesty\nAnd they apparently decided they're not going to do that they said some federal ... down there and they were a paper tiger the federalized they're dressed all like black ninjas on you know they can beat up innocent people on the beach but if you actually call of nothing to stop the caravan coming into Mexico from the south\nThey're not capable of doing that we should look at all available punitive options for Mexico for Mexico\nFor allowing this to proceed economic political sanctions whatever sanctions we can inflict upon them if Mexico screws a sudden they're screwing us right now the president United States\nShould take it out on 'em they should be them like a teenage girl with the Taliban party they should give them a give 'em a little bit of a what's what was going to get to a to president former president I'm happy to say Obama and all of that good stuff\nOther things going on in the world as well and I want to get to some of those this morning\nIncluding the fact that uh that vandals attacked the congressional office of congressman Kevin McCarthy and California\nWith a giant that they say it's\nA giant Boulder a giant rocket less slab of rock of some ... and apparently two white guys are attacked the he's the house majority leader and he may be the next speaker of the house even though he doesn't talk real good\nBut his office in California was vandalized Monday and the congressman's office posted on Instagram\nPhotos of the uh the per se the perpetrators and the assailants they're white guys that are left these they're liberals they took a big rock they threw it through the window of the congressman's office because political violence is now\nAn everyday occurrence thanks to the Democratic party and the left and Brock Obama and Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters and the rest of them calling for conflict and getting in their face and and all of this good stuff\nSo it was a there are thousands of dollars in damage they stole some things from inside the office after smashing the a big plate glass window picture window kind of window out with the big giant rock\nAnd a and you know that's what we got from the Democrats these days the Republican Party office in Wyoming was also set on fire\nIn September so uh you know weeks ago the Republicans office in Wyoming was set ablaze by leftists who are violent vandals also attacked the metropolitan Republican club in Manhattan\nOn the Upper East side and they smashed out a windows and things and spray painted their swastikas on the side of the building which are they're they're um you know their anarchists symbols they're they're a kind of cross as with the circle rather a star like things with the circle around it\nAnd that's the new swastika of the twenty first century for\nThe left wing anarchists and and all of that good stuff\nThere was also a a an incident apparently in the home of\nGeorge Soros the Hungarian billionaire who funds left wing causes an explosive device was found on Monday the New York times says\nIn a mailbox at a home of George Soros not his home but one of his homes the billionaire philanthropists that's that's what they call them they don't recall the Koch brothers the billionaire philanthropists because the New York times is filthy corrupt they're a horribly corrupt\nOrganization and they had three typists here who are all left wing Democrats at the New York times who typed up to say oh he's a um he's the billionaire not a left wing and they they don't sign any politics temp and they they don't say that he funds left wing causes now he's a billionaire philanthropist ... that's a\nThose are positive words when you're a philanthropists the Koch brothers in every described that way and how they know it's an explosive device I think they removed it and they don't know whether it's an explosive device but maybe the New York times knows more law enforcement officials confirmed that advice was found near ... near Mr Soros is home\nIt did not explode on its own hey Bob squad technician proactively detonated it\nAh now did they determined that it was actually an explosive device or they just do that on their sorrows was not at home at the time he was at home but it was ... lake come over and [noise]\nSwitzerland or Monaco or some place else like that because also some nut case attacked the Fox five\nBuilding in Washington DC yesterday there's video of this and he went up to the front door and turned around and did a one legged mule kick on the\nWhat appeared to be lightly armored a glass doors they stopped small caliber bullets are but he did a meal kicked with one and it's like a textbook example of how you get through these windows they did a good job thirty eight years old ... year old George modems\nForcibly entered the front lobby of the Fox news headquarter on Wisconsin Avenue headquarters on Wisconsin evidence is just blocks from the radio station where I sit right now\nAnd he then smashed through they second set of locked secure lightly armored somewhat bulletproof doors a where upon and armed security guard shot him in the torso\nAnd he was down I happened to be down the street yesterday afternoon and I saw the ambulance going by with a Mr oh the ... in their\nIn a police car following very closely behind the ambulance with its lights and sirens I mean like hanging right on the bumper like it was a a trailer on the ambulance\nWith lights and sirens going and I I learned a few minutes later from a police officer friend of mine Paolo that it was the uh channel five attack or\nA there now this guy is made threats against Fox five or and Fox News before by way of emails he's apparently also threatened the police before and he apparently has a history of mental illness\nWhich I think at this point most democratic voters do don't they I mean every in every every story that I read these days everybody's talking about their therapists [laughter] I had no idea it was such a booming industry this therapy thing\nEverybody's talking about their therapists ... you know uh what's her name I'm Christine Ford my therapist everybody's got therapists they're all California people yeah sorry doctor for the doctor for\nTherapists singer therapists that so there's a nut case attack Denny's or not but this is the kind of you know these nutty people are set off by the Democrats or demonizing Fox News and demonizing everybody and everybody's terrible accept them\nWhile they harvest the organs of millions of children\nAnd pat themselves on the back for being wonderful speaking of crazy left wing people as well I'm getting to your calls and back to the Kevin and President Trump yesterday as well [noise]\nHolding a rally for Ted Cruz and he was an ... go as the Democrats like to say\nPeter I think is a mostly lefty cause now I Am definitely in favor of the ethical treatment of animals I Am I like animals especially the tastier ones were the crispy crispy edges and a little bit of crunch when you take it off the fire\nBeat up people eating tasty animals is that people for the ethical treatment of animals I I don't think generally speaking if they're bad people accept that it's been taken over mostly by nuts because\nYou can't have this is my chicken snow known like this crazy

misunderstood I made a mistake I thought they were on the wrong side of things and I was wrong I was mistaken it turns out bill with\nThe public interest legal foundation is in fact a wonderful organization or a great organization doing wonderful things and Jay Christian Adams former Justice Department official is there is a general counseling and president needs a good guy and I know

President Obama from yesterday who thinks that the world revolves around him he really does they talked about himself more than Ninety times more than Ninety references to himself\nAnd his speech yesterday a and also I have sad news about former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor that I Want to get to and and just a moment stay right there\nO'Connor was nominated by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat on the court in Nineteen eighty one she announced her retirement in two thousand five at the age of Seventy five\nAt the time citing her husband John O'Connor the third who was suffering from all ... disease at the time as part of her decision he passed away in two thousand nine\nAs a young girl from the Arizona desert she said I never could have imagined that one day I Would become the first woman justice of the U.S Supreme Court she said Tuesday\nNow the Democrats of course fought and Sandra Day O'Connor's lifetime to prevent women from getting the vote and they effectively did that for about two decades before a Republicans finely secured the vote for women\nOver the ... to ... of a Democrats let's go to well let's go to some audio that's a very sad she's a lovely woman every one that knows her legs are very much\nI've never met her myself I I um I have admired her from afar though she's always been straight up ... look under a great smile and a and a serious person in a smart person an honest person truthful person\nAnd that kind of person that you want on the Supreme Court of the United states of America\n[laughter]\nAnd the Democrats are very upset about gender [laughter] being defined has male and female and this is another very upset about\nEvident Greer Trump Cantor race transgender people with a memo but he can make our lives a lot harder I uh I not not really I don't think anybody really can megawatts let her to\nThe state might soon tell me that I don't legally exists well now that's not true that's that's well none of this is true so far I mean we're just from the headline in the southern headline and it's all demonstrably untrue we won't stop fighting I Know that's the Adderall disagreeable and you're just can't stop being disagree billing\nAnd fighting for the basic rights to be ourselves a you know alright boom you've got the right to be herself\nThank you that said there are very upset and here's the sign up for a a screaming protester at a protest with a sign that says the future isn't binary\nYeah okay take your pills\nAnd we'd go oh let's go to President Trump President Trump\nAlso have there's too many things they um\nWhat's her name Stacey Adams through as a the Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia video or picture is just emerged of her burning the Georgia State flag\nBurning flag not a foreign countries you know they just it's a American their home that they have their their maladjusted they're missing ... their malevolent their malignant\nOr and or they don't like America I Know that that doesn't rhyme or whatever but Stacey Adams the Democrat running Nineteen Ninety two burning the Georgia State flag on the steps of the judge Kevin but it's okay because\nAt that time it had a little miniature Confederate a thing on it so she was burning up because the confessed so that makes it okay\nThat's not a sin and Democrat Party circles that's an endorsement that's good\nIt's like Cory Booker trying to force that man to you know give them in the men's or that actually that I was thinking about that yesterday I think that might elevate Cory Booker stature in his party\nTrying to force a man to perform an act of oral gratification upon them in the men's room at an algae beat G. Q. event I think that that will actually improve his standing in the party\nThat's not the grow up to him he physically mould him genitalia and so on are digitally and and then tried to force him and uh\nAnd the guy is now speaking up about it and the news media couldn't care less they're going to bury that story\n[noise] man like Lee Harvey Oswald politics\n[noise] also a crazy story NBC News this is Ken B. C. news Republicans out pacing Democrats in early voting in key states NBC News find the data suggests enthusiasm among early GOP voters that\nCould put a dent in Democrat democratic hopes for a blue wave in the mid term\nThey and that in every state except Nevada Nevada the Democrats are outpacing the Republicans in early voting it's amazing how they can monitor this stuff is are they already counting the votes are they is this exit polling what is the\nHow do they how do they know but what they're saying is that NBC is come on Democrats you got to step it up because again with the program\nBut that's counter to every picked up the news media has been telling us about the blue away from the ... uh uh uh being ... gap and all this stuff it's all everything is just\nFrom these people\nPresident Trump was funny last night we got to that he made fun of Hillary Clinton the only way we got to investigate Hillary Clinton he says if nominated to the Supreme Court\nThen she'll get Brett Kavanaugh treatment but she wouldn't get the Brett Kavanaugh trip because only the Democrats do this this kind of smear or let's go to President Trump will go to we're going to ... number one it was on the south lawn of the White House with the helicopter marine one hovering not help bring but warming up behind me ... rubbing up behind them because they do however\nAre just sitting there behind it and the news media he was headed out to hold a an event fundraiser giant packed the place to the rafters Eighteen thousand people in an arena that takes Eighteen thousand people\nSeventy five thousand people wanted to come maybe a hundred thousand people including some estimates wanted to come to this event but the arena only held Eighteen thousand\nSo they set up jumbo trans outside the news media didn't cover ... they they just left that out because they're very very dishonest like Bill we're\nAnd Don Lemon and uh and they wanted to say they want to create the pull a mix but it was media dust so a reporter so but you used to call a Ted Cruz ... during the campaign do you regret it they want him to regret something\n[noise] I think\nMetal rock is highly overrated a she asked\nHer this is just great and that that's good political chops right there you used to call Ted Cruz lion Ted do you regret it I think better Rourke is highly overrated there's the soundbite that's the right way to go Jon curl ABC coming back with another ally and Ted question\n[noise]\nIs it wise that Texas Texas says\nOh he's Texas dead now he's beautiful to so forget about let's go to number for President Trump skipping over number three entirely I'm Talking about Ted Cruz at the big rally in Texas last night Ted Cruz's my guy\nAnd I'll tell you what nobody has helped me more with your tax cuts with your regulation [noise]\nHe defended your borders that we are defending that border by the way it is you\nNow these people are in Texas of course and they're on the front lines of the border invasion\nAnd are people in the Upper West side of Manhattan don't care very much they just want you know like a Guatemalan to sleep on a dog bed down by the hot water heater and clean up when they're not around that's how they think I'm from the Upper West side people coming across the border\nAnd then there's President Trump surprised the world last night by announcing a ten percent tax cut for the middle class but apparently no one in the administration that no one in Congress had heard about until he said last night now\nThey're coming back to the jobs are coming back the plants\nAnd factories are coming back like never before they're all coming back from middle income people all middle income people a big tax cut ten percent [noise]\nWill be putting it in the heart of\nEveryone\nWas taken by surprise apparently uh the Washington Examiner of fine organization in Washington DC\nTrump promises ten percent tax cuts for middle class trauma catching allies off guard [laughter] President Trump called for a new major middle class tax cut on Monday adding to comments made over the weekend but backpedaled on the timing saying they would come after the midterm elections\nAnd uh this uh everyone in Washington state huh\nWhat there is a middle class tax cuts coming or I think there is just yes there is there is a middle class tax cuts coming and um you know the president said sometimes when the president so that's what it says it that's what everybody finds out about it that's how that works that's okay with me\nAnd you have a big balance on your credit cards and a higher interest rate than you would like like a Jimmy Carter interest right why not turn those balances into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate and start saving money seems practical doesn't that\nIt's a televised debate seven tonight on WCBS TV and it's the only debate before\nThe November ... election it's taken a week of maneuvering an insult to schedule with the
