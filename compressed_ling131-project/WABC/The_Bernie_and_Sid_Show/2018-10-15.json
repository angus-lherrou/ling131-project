O. two out point\nBy point nine percent we reduced the United states of America\nEven wild booming economically energy boom economic boom and still because of technology and because\nWe're real smart we reduced our CEO to output by point nine percent nearly a whole percentage point right so in a hundred years that means we'll have no CEO at that rate up pretty much his point nine percent put rounding a a hundred years we'll be putting out no CEO to\nThe European Union perhaps you've heard of them ... you ... the Democrats love the ... they hate America they love to you\nAnd uh the EU last year while we reduced our a CEO chart and increase their economic activity\nThat you actually increased their CEO to output in two thousand Seventeen by one point eight percent which if I'm doing my goes into his correctly is a actually\nA twice yesterday we reduced by point nine percent they increased by one point eight percent so that as a swing anybody anybody out there of two point seven percent we did to point seven percent better than them\nAnd a day from liberals get all the credit in the world for being signatories to stupid things like the Paris accord while day you know Obama

question who's on time they'll have to throw that out amongst themselves I suppose and then there's the movie that released over the weekend first man you're familiar with the movie first myth that has a Ryan Gosling\nI don't actually know who else that has ... other than Ryan Gosling not a lot of people I I think [noise]\nAbout Joe Biden's leading the polls isn't that great\nBut um the movie released a Thursday and then more broadly on friday\nAnd it didn't do that well at the box office apparently in part because a lot of people are not going to this movie\nBecause it has been deemed unpatriotic by many many people I was reading about it on the air when they first released to clip couple few weeks ago now\nFirst man opens at number three after a flag controversy\nFails to topple venom and a star is born there and this is the big splashy movie of the weekend and really of the movie going season it should be but they are to a lot of people with uh their their oaths\nOh God that we forgot to include that scene where they plant the American flag on the moon well that's not important anyway after all it was a human accomplishment or not a not an American accomplishment and\nForget about all that says gender white man walking on the moon and stuff where just leave all that and they also took the flags on the uniforms on a spacesuit sent on their jumpsuits their flight suits that they were\nYou know around the shop and they moved to the way down the arms instead of being up on the top of the arm\nOn the shoulder where you would find them in real life\nThey move them way down the arm closer to the elbow so that when they're shooting scenes and the capsule and stuff and they're all tight shots they can crop out the American flag from the shots now that's

of want to go see it I Want to see it to review it to ah to talk about it here and I haven't yet and I'm Still debating whether\nI Want to give my money I I'd I'd rather see it for free so I didn't have to pay\nA and then I'd feel better about seeing the movie and not putting money in their pockets but I might have to pay to go see it so I can talk about it here however I have a secret agent that didn't go to see the movie over the weekend and sent me an email about his experience going to see the movie\nUm [noise] he wrote me\nSending a link to a review in a newspaper he additives own
