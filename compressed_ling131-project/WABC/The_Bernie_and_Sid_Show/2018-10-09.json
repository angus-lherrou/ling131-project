secret rendezvous that only a local news reporter found out about it in a river revealed to the world\nThat this uh inappropriate meeting and then remember she lied and said that they just talked about the grandkids and about golf uh and of course are playing the game corn hall at a bar as I think was the other topic of conversation they love that outdoor game with the corn corn hole is what it's called I think rather than it is that what is going\nTo go to Scott so Jake Tapper decided that President Trump taking Rod Rosenstein who I think Jake Tapper reported a Trump was going to fire a couple of weeks ago\nAlong with everybody else member that was one of the biggest fake news stories Rod Rosenstein is heading to the White House where he's going to be fired or resigned remember that he's going to resign first\nSo Trump camp fire him a buddy is going to wait until Trump fires him 'cause he wants to collect the unemployment insurance and you can't do that if you quit something like that they made up all these stories that none of the stories were true\nI assume Jake Tapper told that story to\nEmpty offering his resignation resigning isn't getting fired I I'm confused why they're

that they just make things up they just make stuff up how does the cabinet fight save Rod Rosenstein\nThese traveling with President Trump\nTo the eye ACP police convention Trump says he has no plans to fire Rosenstein so the news media is very upset that he's not firing Rosenstein goes they report it again and again that he's going to fire Rosenstein and then they find out is not firing Rosenstein\nAll the news becomes fake news so they make up new BS which Jake Tapper did hear\nOld enough to remember coverage and outrage ... former President Clinton visiting and play you know I I

acknowledge they him for impropriety chasm between what we may suspect re Clinton slash Lynch\nIs still defending Clinton unless you know Jake Tapper used to work for a Democrat member of Congress um and that democratic member of Congress has a son that married Chelsea Clinton\n\nSo he's kind of still close to the Clinton family and the whole thing you know the impropriety chasm between what we
