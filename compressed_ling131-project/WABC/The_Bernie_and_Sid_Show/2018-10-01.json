about it they said oh this is so we can keep an eye on her it's because you found out she puts out like a you know like nobody's business\nSo now she's up there and I should probably working her way

of\nJournalistic gratification in exchange for tips\nShe went to the alley Watkins tip line that's a different that's a different ball of wax altogether and she just gets a free pass from all their
