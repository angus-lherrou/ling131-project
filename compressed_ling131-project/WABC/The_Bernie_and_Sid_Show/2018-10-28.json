happy person has nothing to do with legal why didn't show up last Thursday because he was afraid you were going to get the better of them\nI mean like when he made his ultimatum to me you know part of it\nWas um he had some guy could mean the thing about I don't know I had to put up thousands of dollars of you know over this a number that he said that I said that he um [noise]\nUm had in terms of his after number subscribers which I never said um\nAnd he was going to make the number at eight hundred anything over eight hundred and ten thousand dollars and all you do things every one if you want to get up the absence drivers you know tell us how many ... you don't we don't need this little thing you're doing here we've kind of using the charity as a shield the actually not do it and try to make me look like I'm checking out I got\nA and secondly you know we don't pay for ... years\nBecause then what happened was that the things and I so I called them and left a message forum culture and I'll turn off that that's better for me to talk\nWith Mike or you can imagine how you know mark it was a good guy Yahoo how he said it but but um [laughter]\nAnd he told me that that he won five hundred thousand dollars escrow to interview unreal and you know that\nWasn't the athletes who joined us by by the way one way or you ...\nAnd so I showed up and I was there\nYou know like some guy or anything like that but I mean I can talk on the radio with him or off the air about it and quite a story that covers sports yeah that's what I Would I Try to make this out and\nYou know you got very personal and whatever that's fine I and I listen and and and what he has a right let me say one thing he has more than a right and there's a reason I Try to all people just say what you want to say he's worked out there now\nI Would argue and I think you would argue and anybody who uh is ever written about or talked about you want people to have back his facts\nReally an accurate and Iraq again you start going back and forth with that we kind of have this I don't really get the ... we had that on both sides and end up arguing about why\nWhen the truth and vice versa sometimes\nSo I think you really if you're me I could go down each every one of them no notes at the white say you got this wrong got that wrong but the bottom line is so I showed up there and I got it started off saying I'm going to be there now you know you\nMight sit on the air which is I'm I'm going I like that on the air is to be there and you know I was there now to\nGrant I was not going to give him there's a good idea or bringing August ... that that five hundred thousand dollars or or like but uh but I there\nIs a worse what's in thirty seconds to go Andrew is you're going to quit the opposite you're going to quit the fan or or is it a bunch of audio because the fact is is that the app is not selling cars that number eight hundred his right that's humiliating that's humiliating and a ... even though he took a big pay cut he's still getting a seven figure salary from it but yeah and I was giving up\nSo without a bunch of well how do you have a couple of days ago\nI I'm guessing here don't don't know for sure um but I Would say that he was trying to negotiate yeah 'cause he claims you know you sign the contract\nBut you've been in radio I did in radio he agreed to parameters of the deal what are you going to be paid getting a check every two weeks and he's not making a deal I just signed a contract because I'm On my car jak\nYou're telling me not getting paid so he's been getting paid now he wants to get paid more I presume ... and he you know because he didn't do well in the race rehearsing back and we're doing what we have a little leverage which we didn't have before 'cause he was

not really you just drop the plants save that premiums than you can go explore Medicare so that's sort of the second piece of the equation if you are thinking of getting Medicare\nWhat kind do you want and here you have\nTo general pathways the first pathway is what's called the original Medicare you get parts a for a hospital in part B for doctor and patient expenses\nYou get a party drug plan and you may get I met a gap supplement plan which\nWhich covers things that original Medicare doesn't fully pay for particularly part B original Medicare which only pays eighty percent of covered expenses so that twenty percent of the whole can be a lot a money issue no because doctors aren't cheap\nSo a lot of people get that ...\nThat's one way into Medicare the other way is to get a Medicare Advantage plan which are private insurance plans that have become increasingly popular\nUm Medicare Advantage plans must cover everything that original Medicare covers they usually come bungled in with a party drug plan they have an out of pocket maximum so that you don't really need\nSome at a gas plant so you can get everything you want with Medicare Advantage and in addition\nMany Medicare Advantage plans cover things like dental and hearing that original Medicare does not cover\nSo with all of these benefits you'd say why would anybody never you know why wouldn't everybody get a Medicare Advantage plans\nThe plants have become much more popular but there are a couple of big asterisk with Medicare Advantage one is that Medicare Advantage usually provides\nA network of doctors hospitals and other caregivers and you have to use caregivers in their network\nSecond thing is they often have geographic limitations on where they will provide coverage original Medicare coverage you any place in the country Medicare Advantage may only cover you and your whole market um again many Medicare Advantage plans have started to broaden their coverage rules\nBut people need to be very aware of that there are possible limitations to these plans and they need to do some homework so those are your two general pathways\nOriginal Medicare with party\nUm and maybe Madagascar or Medicare Advantage plan\n... now now what's up with a B C D can you break down some of the alphabet soup of Medicare shark\nA part a of Medicare\nUm covers hospital nursing home and other sort of institutional\nA care expenses part a of Medicare is funded by your payroll tax at work and has its own ... just like Social Security does\nSo that's part of a and so if you work in off hours to qualify for Social Security your part a is premium free you don't pay anything extra for its\nPart the covers doctor's\nExpenses and durable medical equipment\nParts to see is the formal name for Medicare Advantage plans nobody ever calls on that but that's where they that's where they fit in the alphabet and party is for a you know a park the Medicare drug plant\nThere also is another bunch of initials if you get a ... plant they have like ten or eleven different initials and so if you're getting into met a gap you'd have to look and see what those different plans cover a every Madagascar like\nLetter S. planner letter G Plan must cover the exact same thing\nBut insurers are free of charge different premiums ... should price compete compare carefully when they look at ...
