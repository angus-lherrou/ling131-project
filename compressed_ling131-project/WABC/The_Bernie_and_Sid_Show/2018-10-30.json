pan and the bottom of the invitation was pants are mandatory for this event\nPets wear pants\nSo President Trump yesterday it was just a great example of of how filthy corrupt the news media has become President Trump\nTweeted yesterday ... you heard he has a Twitter account if you heard anything about this a a tweeted yesterday\nHe said and I read this yesterday\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by an accurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news he wrote\nThe fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open and obvious hostility toward him and Republicans and his voters and so on report the news accurately unfairly\nThat will do much to put out\nThe flame now here's the thing I agree with him I Do agree with him I wouldn't personally use the enemy of the people think and I've said this from the first time going to use that that particular phrase I'm not a fan of that phrase I don't think it's\nIt's helpful and I'm all for punching back and all this stuff that I Am just not a phrasing that I Would just in any event he very specifically as he has repeatedly in the past although I did I Do believe that he once referred to the news media not the fake news media as the enemy of the people\nI think that's wrong I don't think that's right I think the news media is horrible and awful and corrupt and there should be called out all the time but uh but I'd stop\nSomewhere this side of of that phrasing that that moving up\nFake news media the true enemy of the people\nWell then Jim Acosta he's got a Twitter account too and he says we are not the enemy of the people I guess that he is embracing the mantle of the fake news media\nBecause he quite explicitly referred to the fake news media calmer the true enemy of the people come must stop the open an obvious hostility\nAnd report news accurately and fairly well CNN and\nJim ... nothing to do with any of that reporting the news accurately unfairly is not their thing he's furious she's bitter with President Trump very specifically in ...\nCertainly apparently then again when I was working at CNN\nThere is no way my bosses would have allowed Jim Acosta to stay\nAt the White House and do what he's doing not a chance not a chance that my bosses and Turner no relation to Ted Turner who was the kind of the big boss at CNN in Atlanta never would have allowed anything like this my boss bill headline his name was bill headline\nThe bureau chief in Washington for very long time\nNever would have allowed or anything like this to go on for a day much less two years so it's just not a news organization it's a fake news organization Jim Acosta is not a real journalist he's a fake journalist so I guess it's appropriate\nThat he that he take on the fake news media mental the yoke and carry it because it's his to carry\nSo he waited back in response in a bitter thin skinned sort of way we are not the enemy of the people that is the fake news he's the fact that it ...\nI Am not your enemy now actually you are President Trump's enemy you've made that abundantly clear on numerous occasions and to pretend otherwise\nIt's just more fake news they now I Am not your enemy that's a lie that's not true Jim Acosta is lying and this week we are not the enemy of the people if you are fake news then you are the enemy of uh\nOf journalism let's say you're the enemy of civil discourse you're the enemy of the truth\nYou're you're the enemy of honesty and ... and you are gender cost is all of those things his anti honesty he's anti truth\nHis aunts anti truth and reporting an honesty and reporting you are not my enemy he says well you should treat them like your enemy and I've got to say that all evidence to the country Jim\nThis is we are not the enemy of the people there's something wrong with that sentence because he's weighing claimed to being the fake news media All right I guess you could do that that that's good for a laugh but he's not smart enough to realize that he's taking on the cause of the fake news am I right of course I Am\nHe says I Am not your enemy clearly you are you are not my enemy clearly he is just based on the empirical evidence that I've collected over the last two and a half to three years\nIt has ... call your fellow Americans the enemy\nOr it's also a wrong to call them ... deplorable it's wrong to call everyone racist Islamophobia ... every slur or you can come up as if you've got to the menu of slur as available in the English language\nHillary Clinton referred to her fellow Americans as all of those slurs and then on top of that said that we are deplorable and ... now ... is a big word that has a lot of connotation\nAnd ah this woman refers to us that way quite regularly and we learned after it became public after he started saying in public\nThat this was a big hit a Democrat fundraisers that she had tried this out again and again and again among Friendly's in Manhattan in Beverly Hills\nWho hate everybody in between ... and like the fly private when they go back and forth um because they see America that way I got I I Believe this is true on some level\nThe famous New Yorker magazine cover that shows Manhattan and you know than the St Louis arch and a cactus and then San Francisco and Japan the Pacific ocean in Japan\nThat's the starting point of the Trump revolution because the New York the coastal elites says they like to refer to themselves they're bi coastal too and that's a double entendre and in many many cases\nThey see flyover country as a a swath of land they want nothing to do with filled was deplorable iridium of all races bigoted stupid ignorant people\nAh that that they you know flush while they're flying over and that's their view of the American people that is on some level the starting point of of the age of Trump and it is wrong to call your fellow Americans the enemy shall I go down the list Jim Acosta\nHow about Dan Rather as ... over the weekend that all Trump supporters are guilt and it's again it's the rise of fascism and not see as a minute's Hitler and and this is the rhetoric we get on CNN on your network gem you can't disown it it's your network\nHe says we're all in the same team you know what Jim you and I are not on the same team we're not on the same thing we're not on the same team on any level I really don't think oh if there were a giant meteor coming toward the earth then we'd be on the same thing\nUntil that happens I really don't think we're on the same thing and it's a I don't I'm not the problem here because I'm actually quite reasonable and easy to get along with\n[laughter] we're all Americans he says well you know uh I guess half of us are deplorable era ... racist\nBlah blah blah so President Trump is actually\nYou know it says that will do much to put out the flame he says of anger about the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end honestly President Trump is really onto something here or there needs to be a reformation in the journalism business\nThere needs to be a major and I don't I don't know what will prompt those\nUh I I mean again I with all the hatred that that CNN and MSNBC put out I marvel at the fact that President Trump and I hate to even say this out loud that President Trump is a shot at every day by some left it\nThere was one and we don't know how many death threats have been lodged against President Trump but I'm sure the number is extraordinary remember how they tried to claim that Obama got more death threats because he's black and then the head of the secret service came out and said no that's not the case under oath on Capitol Hill\nAnd the news media in the Democrats just kept repeating it anyway because they don't care that that's sort of their bag baby [noise]\nNow I'm guessing that President Trump and you remember there was one English illegal alien that tried to assassinate candidate Trump in Las Vegas Nevada [noise]\nAh and I'm not ... and that reminds me of the thing you know President Trump on Saturday he went to a political rally and a Wisconsin Wisconsin and a and the news media is very upset because there had been this terrible event that day\nAnd they CNN they singled out something he told a joke when he was like after an hour on stage and\nOf fact

be on the left\nBut it's a standard practice for the news media when it comes to Republicans and President Trump in particular but but more generally as well it's a standard procedure for the left here it is to take what you've said change it until it's not what you've said and that attack you for what you didn't say\nThis is an everyday thing in Washington and they voted corrupt news media rich Samuels set the hill typed up a piece today\nWhite House won't say which news outlets are quote enemy of the people and quote\nEvent rites White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday declined to name which news outlets or journalists specifically President Trump believes are quote\nThe enemy of the people and quote now again what he said was fake news is the enemy of the American people so I again I don't I'm not a fan of the president using that phrase guy that said\nThey just reaffirmed what President Trump said by taking what he said lumping off a few words and not attacking them for what he didn't say he didn't say the news media is the enemy of not this time anyway the ... the enemy of the American people\nThey didn't say that no I mean I'm not even defending his years of the ... the turn of phrase\nBecause I wouldn't use that some people are fine with it I wouldn't be I wouldn't be a fan I'm not a fan that's that he can say it in the news media should just get on with their job which should be covering the news but instead there are thin skin was apparently ... and there are very very upset about this\nSo they then claim falsely as this type person does your breath Samuels that the president said that there are specific news outlets are journalists that are the enemy of the people where they quite explicitly said yesterday and they all they have to do is right at\nThe fake news media combo the true enemy of the papal comma must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly and what does the news media take from

he's acting like he's got to tell the American people what the truth is that's not his job that's our job\nCould have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control\nExactly what people think and that is that as you are ... yeah [laughter]\nIt's even better that I remember that just pick a troll what people think and that is our job [laughter] control what people think Mika first you

to have you send the pictures that's also the answer and I remember it well ... where a Kramer or was caught on tape\nDiet dot coms\nA and a reporter asked him well what about ending birthright citizenship can you do that by executive order and and the president is like yeah I can do it by executive order yeah I might do it by executive order I don't know if he got the idea right here you know bronco or not but you know Brock Obama he's the executive order for all kinds of things that were\nAt least stretching the bounds of constitutionality\nHe circumvented the Congress at every turn that\nThat awful horrible or ram deal was not a treaty ... even though in history you know it's a new film the nuclear non treaty we've ever signed up for and rock Obama he just he has no use for branches of government he just signed up in the news media who'd an odd and\nThey thought it was wonderful so the reporter with ... not vox but actually I was sitting down with President Trump yesterday who does more media\nInterviews and a week then Brock Obama does in a year or did in a year while he was president\nAnd um and he was asked about this birthright citizenship thing now to be clear for those who don't know\nBirthright citizenship is if you're on us soil when you give birth you're a woman or a Democrat man and you're giving birth and you're on us soil you can literally pole vault across the border into Canada land in upstate New York\nA pop out of a muffin and a boom the muffin as a U.S citizen now you can build wanted criminal in Ukraine and if you are on a layover at Chicago's O'Hare Airport\nAnd you go into the delta lounge and you give birth mother is not a U.S citizen and the mother is not with anyone else that child born in the delta lounge at Chicago's O'Hare Airport to Ukrainian\nWar criminal who is not a U.S citizen is a year as a U.S citizen the baby is a U.S citizen this is insane [noise] in\nThe age of jets and automobiles at high speed trains this is insane and I've been saying for years and years and years that we should put an end to this and President Trump has mumbled about it he's talked about it here and there are a little bit and um and yesterday he was asked about it and he gave this answer this little back and forth\nAll immigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the practice and ship without changing the constitution ...\nAh have you thought about this law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member\nAlso on and you don't get that number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing to do with the whole thing over and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just with an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas soon it goes\nAnd it has to end um have you talked about\nThat with the council yeah I have to wearing the price that it's in the process it will happen\nWith an executive order that's what you're talking about something that I didn't think anybody but knew that but me I thought I was the only one\nI thought it was the only one who knew that he says he's talked to counsel about it that it's come up and ah you know I Hope he does it'll it'll raise a a constitutional hack holes and there'll be a fight over it and then we'll be talking about it and it's something that we should be talking about\nOne way or the other well
