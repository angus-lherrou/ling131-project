them and he's taking billions of dollars from them\nHe has taken billions of dollars away from other princes in Saudi Arabia many of whom might have an axe to grind with prince Mohammed bin sell them on and that should be taken into account that should be considered\nAs now we're asked as a country to examine this case like we were with the cabin our case the Democrats love to litigate everything out in a public here on\nAnd this is a fascinating circumstance of Foreign Relations and economic relations their key strategic partnerships in the middle east and\nAround the world there are a arms

broadcasters are always there\nThat's because of the strengths of broadcast and the power of the airways but most of all because of the dedication over great New Jersey broadcasters were the power's out the Internet's down and cell phone and wireless networks on available there's no more reliable and trusted source of information and local radio were part of the communities that we sure and send you remind it all of us that are broadcasters\nDon't hesitate to put themselves in harm's way to bring critical information to our neighbors Hi this is Paul retell it from the ... and I'm proud to say that's just the beginning local radio and TV reach more New Jersey in ... and all other mediums combined\nIt was September eleventh and on September twelfth he's at a fundraiser and ah and then they made up that story about a videotape and buzz slowly but surely who's still afraid to show his face and public on the United states of America\nBecause he was thrown in jail by the Obama people and the news media never even thought out an interview with that guy and Susan Rice lied on five different Sunday Morning talk shows about it\nAnd it was fine followed oh there was a video of the news media just bought hook line and sinker whatever the Democrats told them and then they lied to us and there was nowhere near the apple flexi over for Americans being murdered\nBy the truck but I the truck but I'd say we're able to carry this out by the way\nBecause Brock Obama and Hillary Clinton bombed Libya for eight months\nIn a campaign that rock Obama promised would take days not weeks and then it took eight months the media completely ignore the fact rock Obama was bombing their country for eight months and then get out the was killed he was a you know brutally killed murdered by his own subjects because he's a\nSocialist Arab is bastard and he was killed by his own people and Hillary Clinton had that ridiculous line we came we saw he died she thinks she's Julius Caesar or something and that was and that was considered to be cool clever a pithy\nWe came we saw died [laughter]\nEverything will be so much better when we have women in charge they won't they won't be ruthless sun blood listen no and the Democrats shows Hillary Clinton to be their candidate for president the nine states let let me let hang on just a second\nHillary Clinton has once again not president of the United states today\nI feel good about that that's good that's a great victory yes President Trump tweeted horse face about Stormy Daniels yesterday he did but you know Hillary Clinton's not in the White House so\nWe got that going for us and that's pretty good\n... the ... the good\nOh let's go to a bit of audio\nLet's go to a bit of audio you know there there is this other uh before I jumped into the audio Michael there is a a there is another big story that's going on there are a number of big stories going on right now\nOut of Honduras there is a caravan of individuals headed toward the United states of America and I just read the story about\nHalf of America lives on ... of the world rather lives on less than five dollars and fifty cents a day and a huge portion of the population lives on less than a dollar Ninety a day\nThat they noticed I I noticed that they changed the metric it used to be less than two dollars a day but a lot of left wing regimes have populations that live on two dollars a day\nAnd and they don't want to call that an abject poverty so they lowered it they move the bar they do this all the time and you think over time the bar for abject poverty would go up and knock down but it actually went down they lowered it to a dollar Ninety a day\nSo the people of Cuba for example the slave ship called Cuba that the left just loves not just Michael Moore they all love it\nIt's a slave ship it's a plantation\nAnd uh the average Cuban lives on less than two dollars a day less than two dollars a day\nAnd and they don't want to say that they live in abject poverty so they moved to the bar that's that's what they do in any event Honduras Guatemala moved to stop migrant caravan after Trump threats oh no Trump is threatening the poor innocent people of type ...\nThat goes in\nAnd out of slash Washington and escort the last in Guatemala the Reuters news agency says the Oregon\nThere are of a migrant caravan is an organizer now let me let me just stop there for a second you know the infection that is the left um has spread it spread to the United states under the ... of rock Obama administration and then Brock Obama sought to it that it spread also to other countries\nLike countries in Central America\nAnd the community organizer movement where do you think needs caravans camera because they didn't happen before Barack Obama these are organized up\nAnd where do you think all the people got briefed on what they need to say to customs and border protection and and and to ice you got to say oh I'm leaving because I fear for my life because the violence in my country I'm ...\nAnd they get briefed on it right now is true for some people it's true\nBut not for everybody and they bring them up on it so they've got this community organizer that's marching your caravan\nOf about three thousand people toward the United states they're going to walk they don't they're not going to take a boat they're not going to take a plane they are going to walk and guess what the plan is to have them walk and walk and walk and then they get here just before election day oh you see election day\nAnd the Democrats are work and I don't know if you saw this story a couple of days ago the Democrats have pulling this came out about a week ago the Democrats have polling that show that the Latino vote in America which they expect will go to them because they're racist\nWill be weak\nWill be fame will be less than what they want on election day for the midterm elections when they must win back the house so they can and pizza and up in the American government and bring the revolution and the civil war more rapidly than they're currently able to bring\n\nThe Democrats\nHave a dog in this fight and the organizer down there I'm going to guess he knows people here I just I don't I Can't say that for certain but I'm going to guess that the organizer of a migrant caravan from Honduras was detained in Guatemala on Tuesday as the U.S government that's President Trump\nThreatened to withdraw aid from both countries and El Salvador if the flow of migrants north to the United states was not stopped take that\nUp to three thousand migrants courting organizers estimates crossed the from Honduras into Guatemala on a trek northward after a standoff on Monday with police in riot gear\nThe Honduran foreign ministry called on its citizens not to joined the group now the news media's been fanning the flames joking and say oh it's growing every day it's doubled in size and just 'cause it's drama and it's a TV show it's made for TV and it's made for the Democrats and it's made for the midterm elections\nThe timing is not just suspicious it's obvious it's it's like the timing of\nA Brett Kavanaugh accuser is coming forward it's obvious that this is the Democrat Party effort at least in part\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez set in a public address on Tuesday evening that's last night some Hondurans in the caravan had already returned home and the government was prepared to support them they're going to ... we will give you money if you don't go\nHey did not specify how many had turned back over the border Guatemalan police officers detained mark Tono Wednesday is a former Honduran lawmaker from the middle of the large crowd that he um three other organizers had led\nFrom San Pedro Sula Honduras since Saturday he moves followed comments by US President Donald Trump those his administration would hold aid if the Central American government's did not act\nHis latest effort to demonstrate his tough stance on immigration the owner that's not really the tough stance on immigration but it's true they present the United states made it clear that the governments will be held accountable and Central America if they allow this be asked to continue\nAnd you know because we throw money around all over the place where a diamond Jim and we're not twenty trillion dollars in debt we throw money to Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala and everybody else and to Saudi Arabia gets us into that and you know it but but listen because we give aid to those countries the president was able\nRock Obama could have done this too but he didn't the president was able to say listen you guys are sitting here watching this and you know that you're being a pain in our butts and we're going to pull the plug on the aid that we said you are harder and taxpayer dollars and unless you're stuffed up and guess what's happening\nAnd guess what's happening and guess what's happening\nAnd just in case that that isn't clear enough the president is a busy on Twitter this morning unease reinforcing this because he's going to make it stop unlike the ... and the little girls of the Democratic party and\nThe media and um I repeat myself Donald Trump on his Twitter account Donald J Trump president United States not Hillary die on route him but\nThey treated the United states has strongly informed or the president of Honduras but if the large caravan of people heading to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective\nImmediately you could\nHear the squealing breaks the screech of the tires as they threw the brakes on down there\nBecause hey wait a minute he means it because they know when you means and they'll just make it stop boom it'll stop and they'll say what I guess we shouldn't a poke the tiger but when a or\nAnd the news media thought it was wonderful now\nThe Iranians were
