if you have any thoughts on this article or by the New York times Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes\nSo they've been calling him is that he receives the equivalent today at least four hundred and Thirteen million of course\nIt's a day to day it's twenty Eighteen inherited in Nineteen Ninety five and you're\nReal if it was worth a lot less in the early nineties than it is today so they made the whole article on a misleading read of the value of real estate\nProperty now there's some things that may or may not be true that then he says he was earning two hundred grand a year in today's dollars when you look at the trust document would say so it's like Fifteen grand a year he was getting not not two hundred\nNow they say in today's dollars but the reader doesn't you know we can't

you do call us on the New York times Trump article about his wealth we're going to go to the phone lines Herbert go ahead\n[noise] a good morning sir I have a question about us savings bonds I purchased a\nA quite a few of them back in Nineteen Ninety and appreciated considerably they're sitting in my safe to say in my safety deposit box I don't need the money I'd like to pass some onto my grandchildren and I was calling to shift as a tax efficient way to do it\nWithout having to pay a a lot of uh interest somebody or under crude value well\nCeres e bonds can be transferred easily to a new owner series I bonds cannot if you have an eye bond that you want to transfer you can either add the grandchild is co owner or cash the bond pay the tax and use it to purchase a new bond and the child's\nName to transfer the ownership of the series e bond you need to fill out a form with the treasury\nOr the tax there are tax considerations as the former owner you'll need to report interest as income on your tax return\nThis is why bonds are generally not recommended if you want to leave money do your kids are grandkids one of the best ways to do it is through a raw or a\nTax favored life insurance contract you and if you're uninsured rubble you can buy the insurance and their name from the bonds and then that money after it's in the insurance you don't have to pay tax and they don't have to pay tax okay so there's a lot to\nDo just as easily then sell them pay the interest and write a check your grandchild\nYeah but where are you going to write the check to let's not make the same problem that you made with the bonds meaning the problem with the bond is all that occur interest you got to pay taxes on let's store that new money if you're going to write them\nA check so that they can get tax free compounding for the rest of their life so that makes sense yes because\nSo that's what I Would want to do you know I I also not into just giving gifts to kids I Want to see the mature I Want to see them be able to use it and I went off to see them learn about the power of tax free compounding does that make sense\nGraduated grandkids are the one of them was recently got married and they're just starting out and I'd like to help them out of a\nBetter yeah and and what I'm saying is I I I Want you to help them out too but it's all about the location so that they grow their money tax free\nFor compound interest so it makes sense because it does wonderful so give us a\nCall folks have you have a question and Herbert if you would like to meet a we happened to me it
