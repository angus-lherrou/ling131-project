set it on fire [noise] so the Associated Press can\nIt may be an I Love the fact they've got American flags but somebody had a can of black spray paint with them to spray paint a black swan lost her job in the American flag now\nThat kind of leads to stereotype so I think you got these people claiming to be economic refugees or something like that yet somebody had the presence of mind to bring along cans of spray paint what are you going to tag the country when you get here\nBut what if your show up with a can of spray paint I think you should be allowed I think you should not be allowed in and honestly there are the Associated Press I saw the pictures and I was like well I Want to double and triple check that\nThey're really burning the American flag and spray painting swastikas on it and sure enough in Honduras and I don't think they're part of the actual care man itself but people supporting the caravan\nAre burning the American flag in Honduras and spray painting swastikas on it and that's because they're looking to win friends and influence people in America funny thing is that the Democrats love that they burned flags and spray prayed swastikas on it too\nThey carry flags of other nations to remember at the Democratic national convention where they nominated Hillary Clinton to be the loser\nLoser or they forgot to bring any American flags murder the or the this is true I'm not making this up the day one of the Democratic national convention there wasn't that American flag in the hall not one nowhere no one thing nothing for the pledge of allegiance because they don't do the pledge of allegiance\nThey just condemn Israel and Jesus and the Bible\nAnd they get on with their Planned Parenthood business and the Oregon harvest things like that\nBut they literally had no American flags and it was pointed out it might have been the Daily Caller that first pointed out it might have been Vince ... first pointed out that there were no flags\nBecause sometimes it's it's more difficult to notice the things that aren't there rather than the things that are there so that's an old a detective thing [noise]\nBut there were no American flags that the ...\nThe national convention until stories were written about it\nAnd then you know what they did they went over to where it was a Philadelphia right\nThey went over to Philadelphia city hall\nAnd they took down all the ... from the building I Believe this is actually true and brought it over to the convention hall so they had the oh I Can't believe we forgot that we're supposed to pretend that we like this country for a couple of days so they went and got a couple of 'em are American flag bunting strings from city hall and dragged him over\nWhile somebody wrestled up an American flag from have probably had to fly it in because the [laughter]\nNo Democrats in the hall they did there were a full size giant flags you know six foot flags of Mexico and the Palestinian flag which is not really a country at all and uh but the Democrats had they had Palestine that everything but the ISIS flag inside the conventional that no American flex\nSo these guys at least out of American flags sure they're burning them you know after a spray painting swastikas on them\nBut but that's what Democrats do that that movie the American president with a a Michael Douglas and Annette Benning one of the big themes that movie is that the Democrat liberal liberal Democrat president Michael Douglas his girlfriend um wasn't enough bending it was in a ...\nUm she was a famous left the advocate in Washington\nAnd pictures emerge verb burning the American flag and the movie I think it's a Rob Reiner movie uh turned the burning of the American flag into a celebration of the burning of the American flag because you know they don't they never met anybody who served in the military and they don't know anything about anything they're just sort of\nBut these are the people that are coming and they're burning the American flag I think to put themselves in good with the Democrats\nJust in case the Democrats are wondering whether these are the people they one coming to our country they're burning the American flag and spray painting swastikas on it\nTo prove that they are the kind of people that the Democrats are looking for [laughter]\nThat was that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia where a Democrat man sort of wearing a dress\nCaught on fire while dancing on the American flag but they were burning at the Democratic convention where they forgot to bring American flags not a problem why would that be an issue [noise] oh\nBoy oh boy oh boy and of course we have a commercial G and uh and we have this this woman has just as dumb as Iraq\nThis uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nSays that fighting global warming is just like fighting the Nazis that we have to mobilize just like fighting the Nazis it's very funny and we have an audio of this\nReally didn't witted woman she is she is dumb she's let's just go ahead and say I believe the woman she's dumb every time she talk she proves that she's a dummy and uh she was at a public event with a microphone talking she's serious about how um you know global warming is just like the Nazis begging Shapiro\nHumorous leach waited I don't have it in front of me or I don't think bombing the Germans will do any good something like that\nI was a ... we're going to bomb the Germans over global warming\nWhere we're going to invade Normandy to change though whether it is people are there are mental cases that have all that it's a coalition of mental cases and they called themselves the Democratic party\nWe have that will be getting to that this morning as well and of course cuts showed G G\nAnd and um and people on immigration we have the um we have the caravan headed our way and I mentioned the uh the headline I Believe a little bit earlier man deported six times charged in California homeless killings\nWell what's the problem with that well the Democrats like this open door policy you deport somebody six times they just keep walking back in out of Los Angeles the Associated Press from September twenty six\nWhich is less than one month ago a man who was deported six times and is now suspected in a string of killings and beatings that targeted sleeping homeless people in Southern California\nWas charged Wednesday Wednesday with murder attempted murder robbery and um or various other crimes authorities say suspect or I'm On a Alberto Escobar\nHad a long criminal record in the U.S and has been repeatedly deported to his native El Salvador you have to say outside the door [noise] his arraignment is expected to Los Angeles later today forty seven year old Escobar charged with\nThree counts of murder five counts of attempted murder\nFour counts of second degree robbery because he's beating homeless people in stealing from them and this guy six times deported and the or the Democrats are like yeah well what's the problem was with them\nThen reading the Washington Post today\nUm [noise]\nIt's time for me to go back is the headline deportees joined migrant caravan to return to us\nAnd then there were the deportees they typed many of the migrants here had previously lived in the United states for years or even decades joining the carrot caravan to reunite with their children or to resume old jobs they're coming back to resume their jobs I don't think so\nThey were undeterred by the American authorities who are apprehended them or the U.S president to promise to keep them out again\nSome of them had returned voluntarily to their home countries long ago but eventually determined that there was nothing nothing there for them well run for office no they were traverse in Mexico well President Trump tweeted about their journey demanding that the migrants apply for asylum in Mexico\nBefore continuing north now you know when you when you're applying for asylum you don't just get to pick Monte Carlo or Switzerland and say well it's really it's where I've always wanted to live so\nI think burn is the place for me I'd like to shed so now the job if you've got a range that in the meantime I'd like to go on the Dole because\n[noise]\nThreatening to close the president threatening to close the U.S border has Mexican authorities appeared to allow
