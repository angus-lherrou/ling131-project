the Democrats love this I think it's a\nIt's a great election day ploy by the Democrats that I think we'll blow up and there are dumb\nFaces again because this is what they time the fed and like I mentioned this yesterday\nThere was a poll last week I haven't gone back to look it up again but there was a poll last week that the Democrats were panicked about because it found that Hispanic voters Latino voters were not energized by Brett Kavanaugh on gang rape and quite loads or something like that\nAnd the Democrats were threading because their whole coalition as racist it's a race based coalition and they racially exclude people and they racially include people and they got white people to condemn white people and\nAnd if you're Hispanic or you're not white even though you are and you know we're not Anglo shut up you're a racist and the black coalition because it's a racist by the party of Lynch mob and the KKK and Jim Crow they love race and racism they're awful people they really are\nAnd uh and they took a poll found that a lot\nThose were not nearly enthusiast enough\nLeading up to the mid term elections and then interestingly about two days later this caravan started out of a outside the door to door to us Micki call\nYou know if they're going to call ... hot so she shouldn't we called Mexico Mexico and uh and ... you know and a son or daughter shouldn't we really if you're going to play this stupid game that they loved to play from time to time\nWhat an embarrassment these people are they really are journalism journalism this is what we call it now\nAt age six three zero nine six two five is the telephone number with this caravan headed to the United states to the delight of Democrats and media people around the nation\nPresident Trump has decided hey yeah he really this is the game you guys want to play\nAnd ah he's filled a sock with rolls of quarters and he came after the Democrats are wack wack on them and they had listened to a President Trump this morning on the Twitter\nWhen it comes to this um this caravan\nNow they're saying a four thousand four thousand people it's growing instead of shrinking the caravan\nAnd a President Trump is laying down the law to these countries down there to El Salvador Honduras Mexico and enter the Democrats and to the phony baloney news media as well\nUm [noise] ... President Trump on Twitter earlier this morning\nI'm watching the Democrat Party led because they want open borders on existing week laws\nAssaults on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals in all caps including many criminals\nFrom entering Mexico to us but he's not done yet in addition to stopping all payments to these countries we provide a lot of foreign aid were very generous people it's why our debt is twenty million dollars and\nAnd why our taxes are so high because we give a lot of it away to people who ... your face in addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over their population\nI must in the strongest of terms ask Mexico to stop this onslaught and is unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border close our southern border in all caps\nThe assault on our country out of our southern border including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in as far more important to me as president then trade or the U.S MCA that's the new renegotiated NAFTA\nA court that's the U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at\nTheir northern border all Democrats fault for a week laws that you just I I just love that I just think that is an excellent use of Twitter and up the president's ability to to slap back\nA with a you know circumventing the media or politicians presidents have been talking about circumventing the media since at least Ronald Reagan\nAnd now Donald Trump is really the first one that's been able to do it very effectively\nBecause the media they don't own everything anymore they are they're ... that's code and they are and they are incapable of stopping the president from just he doesn't go around them he goes right over them right through them to the American people by way of Twitter\nAnd he very often as is the case with this\nCluster of tweets does it very very effectively\nSome of the stuff like horse face and things that you should probably leave on the table\nLeave that alone but um but nevertheless nevertheless hot showed gee now let's let's go to go to these are the Democrats they're really there's a lot of violence there out of control they are these are ah this is becoming a real problem\nUm bad stuff

child sex this has always been one of the things the child prostitution that uh you know Democrats that they are like different things I think but Bob Hugin put up this TV ad\nAnd in the TV ad\nThey pulled passages from these weren't FBI affidavit pointing out the claims about child under age female prostitutes a and the senator and has pal of failing themselves if you will\nOf this uh vulgar practice and I'm In the Washington Post New York times are furious with um they nominate the Republican nominee Bob hug him and um and they're going after him there they're going after him because they want to protect the\nThe Democrats and the Senate they don't want to see the Democrats lose this was what the doctor evil post does and uh and it's just amazing to me\nThat as a Democrat you have these people coming to your defense and calling everybody else a liar when technically all he did was pull out of passage from an FBI sworn affidavit that was submitted to the court\nAnd ah and pulled it up that say that's a real tough thing I guess\nBut hilarious lay almost hilarious lay these clowns at the Washington Post and those guys Salvador result they say that they should these charges of the child prostitution should be a a dismissed because they're old\nAnd unsubstantiated I'm Sorry Dr Christine Blasey Ford anyone anybody Julie sweat Nick\nHolden unsubstantiated old tired

we just go through this didn't we just go through this but they they have restored due process\nTo save\nSenator Robert Menendez with his little girl prostitutes that he pays to have sex with in the Dominican Republic where nobody's going to arrest him for it and it's in the FBI affidavit and if his opponent points it out the media comes after the opponent [laughter] because it's old and unproven\nHonestly Christine Ford is old and unproven her claims are old and unproven [noise] the the next accuser from a Yale who couldn't remember who I'd do any other when she was a freshman in

again\nUm Mohammed bin Selma no due process for him there is no presumption of innocence for him he's guilty now there's at least some evidence in regard to that case that certainly makes them look like he's guilty party and I wouldn't be surprised at all\nThe the claims are not completely outrageous when it comes to when it comes to the crown prince\nUh by the news media has no use for do they want a Lynch mob for the crowd ... they want us to be bombing Riyadh which are starting mispronouncing for us\nUh tomorrow I about a minute I got ... what what are you talking about you what I Do not
