{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "And pretty much that like I've got everything ... when then you're like wait a second I think we should run retirement plan which makes a lot of sense especially if you're about to retire\nYeah so I have a current clients who has an account with us but you know he's been working and he has is for us to be with this company and\nHe was just getting ready to retire and we thought that it might be a really good time to just you know up to his productions make sure that you know the income because he's going to be living on Social Security and he wants to make sure that his account is also producing income for him which is going to be really important because he's going to have to make up that gap that last for\nYou know the the retirement so we ran an analysis on one of the things that I did notice\nWas that he had that outside account that you know nobody had actually looked at and almost you know seven or eight years I think was the last time he said that he had looked at right so I asked him if I could take a lot he said no problem and when we actually ran the numbers he was a little bit horrified\nI'm going to have our fired or how did it would be [laughter] a little\nBit [laughter] he just really didn't completely understand exactly what he had any accounts for guys surrender everything and the numbers actually showed that he was a man that sixty five was actually Ninety percent and the equity market wow yeah which a\nLot of risk of almost all your money in the stock market and did he say well you know I'm I'm happy to count because it just keeps going up right that was his [laughter] just keeping it there yeah exactly I Will like until it doesn't [laughter]\nSo he's a lawyer outages exactly he had chosen it you know seven or eight years ago and it has done really well which is true but you know these things I mean within that Ninety percent he was Seventy percent just allocated and us large and small cap socks\nWhich have done really well but we don't know what that's going to look like for the next you know ten years so\nI ... a great example of\nYou know the markets ten years older than it was ten years ago but so far away and you know just just like Bill I was you know I was fifty five you know ten years ago [laughter] um\nSo it's a you know we're different than it and your target has to be different strategy has to be different than raw you talked about this earlier on the show you know you have to have someone constantly reviewing these retirement plans and make sure that your rebalance based on the you know the inherent risk that we face in the markets on a daily basis\nYeah and I think there was the most surprises there too besides like I mean the richest crazy right you're Ninety percent stocks and not only nine percent stocks it's all concentrated in the same place which is just long term a recipe for disaster but also am you'd said that he didn't really know what kind of easy was paying because all the fees were hidden in the plan\nYeah exactly so I mean you know like I said he has and looked at this and seven or eight years and he doesn't have\nYou know with his accounts here he has me calling him you know at least quarterly to say hey we have evidence any count her this is what the market's doing but he had just left out there so you know in this case he was actually pretty lucky\nThat those things have done really well but nobody was looking at it and he wasn't paying somebody but he was hanging on these internal cause to really not even know what the account was doing\nYeah it's like you're paying all these costs this mutual fund company rivers running most of the funds here and no one's even giving advice so it's kind of like you're you're getting no service and paying a real heavy fee for it you know four one K. that's I call that a bad deal about\nThe call that a horrible deal [laughter] those are the ...\nAnd the strategy or you can follow us strategy is I'm going to stay with us until it doesn't work that's not a good strategy you have to understand that that the risk is there there's a risk of all till the end that over the last fifty years or less forty three years that I've\nBeen advising people on how to do this you really don't give up a lot and a balanced portfolio rather than you get to sleep really well at night and it gets to achieve your goals with a high degree of certainty I think that's really what you want to look for\nYeah I agree so he was extremely overweight at you know and these equities and you know like I mentioned he wasn't even diversified within the equities he was really just concentrated it was you know Seventy percent and that us large and small cap and then\nLike a little less than twenty percent of it was just an in an international funds you know so he needed somebody to be constantly looking at that and he didn't so\nRight off the bat he decided okay I understand the ask you know I asked him in the next ten years do you want to have to go back to work [laughter]\nFor his answer was [laughter] yeah he was like oh\nThat's the situation and I was like yeah I mean if we don't make a change to this and something really does happen you're going to have to have probably you know go back to work part time so he very quickly [laughter] decided that he was going to follow my advice\nAnd scale back a lot more and you know one of the other things too that he had and there was the fact that he actually wasn't going to be able to really generate any income\nSo I ran the numbers for him and I showed him you know this is what you're making and in his household his wife so works but he is the breadwinner and she's only going to be working for another maybe three or four years\nAnd they're going to be missing out on this it wasn't a huge chunk but there's a chunk that he's going to have to start pulling from the portfolio if he doesn't make up for somehow so you know just an income alone\nBy you know changing it and and getting into a strategy that's much more you know tolerated for him and his situation I mean we were making almost about twelve thousand dollars for him just an income every single year that he is going to be able to use\nYeah put that in context I mean you doubled you said okay let's stop being so relying on the market going up every year and I'm going to double the income support for generates that you can live on I mean there are the kind of common sense steps you need to take I Would say to get your portfolio retirement ready to this is Rachel in this case by the way I mean this isn't really\nGetting just jumping out of harm's way because I mean the risky has in his portfolio\nTo your point I mean the chances of the market going down at some point in him having to go back to work it's that's a real thing so by getting him agree\nRuy I think this is a another total pain Capital Management financial masterpiece\nAround ... ... dollars [laughter]\nYou know if you're sitting there thinking to yourself I Need a plan like this I'm probably taking away too much risk my portfolio is not\nIn context of what my goals are we still have a couple of slots left if you have over two hundred thousand dollars saved for retirement myself Bob and Emily or an for you are total financial master plan will do that with no obligation or

Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or of balance of nature\nThis is a conversation you don't want to mess as we discuss a variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nDr Douglas Howard and Susan Howard thank you so much for joining us today and I just want to ask you I have so many questions about balance of nature I don't even know where to start high it's great to be here again Hi Laura good to be back I'm very curious as to how\nThey can actually be a product on the market that's nothing but fruits and vegetables with absolutely nothing else in it how in the world can this be life changing and where did you get the idea for it and how did you know which fruits and vegetables to actually select for the product balance of nature\nWhat started out I studied in Russia for several years and while I was there I started seeing the need for nutrition more and more and when I returned back to my practice in the United states\nThen I started seeing how lousy our diets really were when I started really realizing how important that balance of chemistry is how much a to see the deed easy and back then I still believe that the was vitamins not hormone anyways and\nAnd I started seeing the the necessity of balance of chemistry and so I started searching which one was the best which vitamin was the best in balance and at the same time then the the notion started coming of um\nYou know we're we're discovering more and more chemistry and fruits and vegetables raspberry tall a course of two and a ... thing that all these different chemicals that we're finding have positive effects\nBut they were from different fruits and vegetables and so then I was on that path and I was looking for which of these vitamins [noise] is going to be the magical vitamin there was a day that that I was like well I'm searching for the perfect balance of all of this chemistry\nAnd at the same time there's all this chemistry we haven't even discovered yet that's when I started learning that there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals just in an apple alone\nAnd hundreds of thousands in an orange and and all of them\nAnd then I went well wait all you may be dead when we find this magic chemical and looking for because out of all of this how am I going to find the needle haystack and on top of that\nI already know where the perfect balance of all of these items is it's in our fruits and vegetables it was already made for us for our bodies and so that's why I went okay I've got to get back to that I just have to get my patients to be able to consume that\nAnd as I did that first I started trying to have them have better diets well that was like leaving a horse to water and trying to get him to drink to didn't want to drink\nAnd then and then I started having some people juice rather okay well I can get him to juice and get a concentrated amount well later I realized that's an extract because for example I got people to juice but they were using mostly ... apple let's say maybe cared apple and celery but I've had patients starting to come in with care named mia which means\nThey were turning orange because they just were consuming so much you know and a carrot juice will die wasn't healthy that we're not supposed to be orange then I started trying to figure out how to get this and then I started realizing the number one component of all of these fruits and vegetables as water\nIf I can just remove the water without damaging all of the other chemistry\nThan I can packet more dance I never imagined I could get it as dense as we have it I never imagined that I Would be able to get it down to three fruit capitalism three vegetable capitalism and have the same nutrient value is eating over ten servings of fruits and vegetables every day\nYou know what I find so interesting is what you're talking about is\nWhen I Try to eat healthy and get the fruits and vegetables that I mean it's really a process\nI have to go to the supermarket it's very very expensive where I live you have to spend a lot of time chopping and in order to keep the nutrition and you basically kind of have to eat it raw it's really hard to get ten or eleven servings a day that you're recommending Dr Howard\nAnd sell for me balance of nature is just an easier way to do this and actually more economical yeah it it cuts out all the shopping cleaning chopping\nAnd chewing he just swallow it I mean it's it's really there is there's a lot of chewing involved in that much fruits and vegetables [laughter] absolutely\nSo now I'm not going to tell you don't need the fruits and vegetables anymore you do that but the beauty of this also is once you start taking balance of nature it's interesting your appetite generally starts to increase towards fruits and vegetables and many people report decreases toward sweets\nOh that's a wonderful thing yeah wouldn't it be great if we could all substitute that Dr Howard when somebody does take these at ten servings a day with balance of nature what is it that they can expect to feel I mean how is it that something so small like that could actually maybe prevent some of the\nDiseases that you were talking about and some of your literature\nWell it's interesting will have anywhere from somebody saying from minutes after I took my first dose or just like somebody flipped the light switch on and I just feel it all the way to nothing I mean\nIt doesn't necessarily mean you're going to feel something in your in your body by the time you feel something or by the time you feel a symptom you've lost over sixty percent of the functions that sell to shore Oregon and that's important to note\nSo what I really developed this was not to feel anything but what's to prevent aging diseases was my original purpose to prevent the risk of\nOf cataracts and strokes and heart heart attack and heart disease and cancer macular degeneration and aging diseases is what we really that was the focus of what I was doing it's not a cure anything I guess that's what I'm trying to save that purpose wasn't to cure anything\nIt's to give the body the chemistry and the nutrition that needs to do what it needs your body is far more intelligent too and knows what it needs to do more than I can can force it to do something\nFor those that are just

Paul who is the captain and a ... road with him because there was no place for him to work every ... every\nEvery unit was covered so when that happens in a captain is aside to work he rise with the deputy chief and that's what happened that morning they rode together and ah I never saw them again\nHow can you just give us the name of the books really quickly and six her\nShow the first book is a

Christopher cruise a man said to be an average with President Trump is in jail in Miami this morning charged with mailing pipe bombs to prominent Democrats\nFifty six year old Cesar ... was arrested yesterday he has a long arrest record and has been described as troubled correspondent Jo Jones is in Miami this morning the picture\nThat is emerging as a man who harbor some very dark thoughts particularly about minorities and others in this country particularly on the left and now authorities are trying to find out if the fourteen bombs they know of or the end of it\nBoth sides are digging their heels in and unfortunately and it is having an effect and um you\nAre getting worried at some point it will get resolved at some point interest rates which are affecting people's psyche are also going to stop going up they've been going up and in the past month or so you saw the ten year treasury\nWhere mortgages get their mortgage rates from consumer loans get their consumer loans from Kenya treasuries went from about two point eight to three and a quarter that affects people if you're applying for a mortgage you may not qualify anymore if your mortgage is now five percent interest\nSo if you are trying to get a three hundred thousand dollar mortgage on a new house or refinance and if your payments\nBased on five percent are going up by about two hundred dollars a month that's costly and the bank will look at you and say you don't qualify your income is not high enough so certain things\nAre affected by higher interest rates so a new construction refinancing and the entire effect that comes with a slowdown in housing could cause a recessionary environment a year from now or thereabouts\nI don't think that that is something the fed will allow I think they can control where interest rates are going and I think that the fundamentals in this country remains positive so here's what I Want you to ask yourself\nIs a very important question because there is a potential solution\nArgue most afraid of not enough income what frightens you the most not enough income losing all of your principal or market fluctuation when we return\nI'm going to tell you how to deal with

G. S. S. dot com [noise]\nLadies and gentlemen my guest in Studio ... head of our trading farm in member of the investment committee was very overt financial services and I ask Peter to come into the studio\nFor a reason I Want you to understand the logic there we implement when it comes to managing your portfolio and we returned our calls the day we get them so if someone has a question we respond we ever rule here you must return your calls a day to get him if by chance at the end of the day well\nThere's a little bit of leverage you can call in the morning but I Will tell you Peters usually here until seven thirty eight o'clock at night [laughter] what do you do for dinner\n[laughter] have a lady when I go I was late [laughter]\nThat's commitment that's what it is um so I Want to talk about uh some moves we recently made in our clients portfolios a few months ago\nWe sold in a one or two of our portfolios a sector of the market quote regional banks regional banks we had gotten a very good ride from then all of a sudden we made a decision to sell them and we substituted\nOil give us the logic behind what occurred and why it worked out for us\nHere Gary I'm the regional banks which we had invested in are going to be negatively impacted as rates continue to move up\nAnd regional banks as a general categories not one particular regional back in our ATF program in our mutual fund portfolios et cetera in our new ... no not in the ... but we did have regional banks is a sector in those a portfolio he certainly did he sold them yup\nAs rates move up a those banks are particularly impacted in two ways by raising rates\nOn number one the demand for mortgages as you might imagine is going to go down and already we've already seen that happening a new home starts a ... there was a report out today new St homeless arts are lower um and as more\nThe rates continue to go up it's going to have a negative impact on the housing industry which impacts uh the business a walk through the door particularly for regional banks because they're very very important in the mortgage a ... arena\nAnd number two it's more expensive for them to borrow money or from other banks from the\nFed if they need it now somebody might say well is still buying cheap and and the lending it out at a very high rates of the\nBig remains the same\nYeah well it spreads actually narrow is rates go up Gary I'm 'cause they can't always pass that difference on to the consumer as quickly as they were like\nAnd then why did we buy oil we bought oil dairy because I'm rise it\nFirst of all rising rates indicate a concern about inflationary pressures from the fed a now there's there's one argument that says the inflation is not there yet and we're really not seeing it in the numbers um but\nDown the road and may become a significant factor I'm number number\nTwo oil companies are traditionally cash rich um and and they continue to be so they're very high dividends which are well supported not only by their cash flows Gary but by the cash reserves so we have continue to use oil in our dividend program\nAnd we have some oil stocks they're paying in the neighborhood of five percent redo and uh people enjoy the dividends and again getting back to what I was saying before what is it you care about you care about your income the last two principal or market fluctuation of course oil stocks can fluctuate in price when you have an issue\nWhere Saudi Arabia acknowledges they killed somebody in the Turkish embassy and our president threatens them you think oil prices might fluctuate you bet they do perhaps that's an opportunity when they come down and that's the way we look at it and we have regular meetings in our from\nWe have your your research department meets about three times a week we have an investment committee meeting every month and we make decisions for our clients where the opportunities where the risks\nAnd it's been working since Nineteen Seventy two it has um so if you want ladies and gentleman a a an opportunity to have your portfolio examines stressed tested\nThere's no obligation no cause you can get in touch with me I'll be happy to be with you I'll be happy to entertain any questions that you might have\nYou are often shocked when you get the return call for me personally don't be shocked I Do return my calls and by the way so it is Peter Peter returns of schools\nAre and um You're welcome to call either one of us one eight hundred three seven seven fifty seven fifty seven Peter thank you very much for your commentary is always very very well for my pleasure Gary ownership for a moment on fire re\nMandatory withdrawals I think they should change the rules how many have you have reached Seventy and a half and you're forced to take a mandatory withdrawal and pay the tax\nAnd you don't need the money\nWhat do you do with it or you put it back in the market or you go spend it somewhere but you only get maybe eighty or Seventy percent of what you pulled out because the government ends up grabbing their tax\nWhen that was originally set up to Seventy and a half your age people did not live as long as they live now\nI Am for anybody working for the IRS who's listening to this program tell your boss has changed the age to eighty not seven eight and a half and at least get rid of the half that is so confusing we're living longer now this is not going to happen the fed is counting on the tax\nIt would imbalance our budgets but I Want to at least rattling the saber here because I hate having to take money out for our clients at Seventy and a half when they don't need it I also hate college loans that are charging seven and eight percent\nCan't stand them it's not fair kids come out of college and the burden for years and years and years with having to pay off college debt growing at seven and eight percent you know why they charge so much because they can\nColleges keep raising tuitions\nBecause they know they're being funded by college loans why don't we maximize the amount of college debt to thirty thousand I'm picky and number out of the year if you did not have the ability to borrow more than thirty thousand on college loans you think colleges would continue to inflate tuition by seven or eight percent a year\nI'm not running for office um venting\nI'm Gary Goldberg when we return I got to be joined by the former secretary of HUD his name is Leon Castro he's being rumored to be running for president in twenty twenty you've seen them all over\nTV and he wrote a book that is a very good
