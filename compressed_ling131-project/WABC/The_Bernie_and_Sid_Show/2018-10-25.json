actually [noise] but it's a complete mental case so there's a Canadian and they shouldn't be deported\nIt should be catapulted across the border we should bring them up to North Dakota catapulted him

eleventh two thousand one\nWe had a couple of other crazy things going on in the United states and in particular around Washington DC we add John Allen Mohammad done and I'm you know Melville I'm with the DC Sniper the beltway sniper thing and that was very creepy\nAnd we also had the anthrax attacks on the anthrax attacks say they believe they found the guy or did he committed suicide\nAh but um they never really nailed them and and uh when they were looking for the anthrax terrorists who had mailed anthrax packets to NBC News ABC News on CBS News but did not mail one to CNN I was working at CNN at the time\nCNN did not receive\nA packet with anthrax but the other three television networks did and other news organizations as well and other people and uh I remember concluding at the time I Believe correctly in retrospect that if you're looking and I spoke to investigators at the time\nAnd I said you know you're looking for somebody that has a an old fashioned TV and kind of on the roof\nAnd I remember the or whoever it was I was talking to looking at me kind of uh\nSideways and I said listen he sent to CBS News ABC News and to NBC News but not to CNN you know why didn't send to CNN\nBecause you can't take what you don't see but if he hated ABC NBC and CBS surely he hated CNN a buddy you didn't have cable so you're looking for somebody who doesn't have cable TV so you're looking for somebody with a Tv antenna on their roof\nRight pretty simple it's like a you know deductive reasoning sort of thing and I thought it was kind of helpful and it turns out on his house sure enough there was a TV in the old fashioned Tv antenna which some houses with tables still have anyway but nevertheless I'm looking at this one\nAnd to me and I was again it was my friend Dan ... in a

so that's a bomb that won't blow up what what is it it's like talking about the clock boy with is a little bring up the school thing it it wasn't gonna blow up so the media it's like it's not a bomb in his get even blow up but listen to them now over these bombs that can't blow up [laughter]\nIt's guys and honestly the argument that club where they couldn't wait to the fed them at the clock but\nHe's he's a victim of racism and Islamophobia no\nHe brought a thing that was designed to look just like a bomb to school so he could scare the snot out of people with this Bob looking thing that I come at the clock boy brought the school\nAnd his sister had done the same thing a year earlier and at the same school and he thought it was funny and he got like scholarships to MIT and trips to the middle east and the White House and and uh he was the hero of our nation for weeks because he was a victim\nNow he played everybody the whole time he was a little creepy I mean I'm sure he's grown up a little now so he's a slightly larger ... and and the news media just good way to say well that's not a bomb well why is it not about well they said they'd let us know explosive material can't blow up\nWell okay these have explosive material but they can't look they don't have ... blasting cats don't have the electronic detonation don't have remote detonation don't have no radio frequency
