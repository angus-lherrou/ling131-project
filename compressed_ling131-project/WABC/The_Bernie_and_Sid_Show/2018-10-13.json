A. Y. N. E. for the record that a specific retiree or a couple of had with a retirement planning and you and I actually worked on a case together about a week ago\nSomeone just gives run down and some of the issues that this certain couple and we we we really met with the husband he was having what he was looking for and then how we help them solve its problems\nSure absolutely so I'll let you say we met with Israeli nice couple de Seventy his wife a sixty nine and some of the the big things that they were focused on we're lowering the used in the overall expansion their portfolio\nThey are a lot of income so they were really want to trim down on their their tax burden and really just focus on lowering their taxes lowering their fees and are having some kind of you know tax sheltered plan to leave money\nFor the ... ... yeah which is I that's very common questions they have and then you know when you went through and you actually ran our portfolio analysis are are when I carport for X ray you know what did you find\nWell looking at just our investments um we did notice they weren't a lot of high cost mutual funds or as well as some annuities so that was really ramping up you know the the fees and overall expenses on the investment side and as far as the fixed income portion of their portfolio they were invested in a couple of Bob's favorite they were in bonds thoughts\nWell there's a reason why I'm known as the national financial advisor against bond funds and had been for Thirty years is because they don't work right they're not fixed you don't have a fixed rate of return you'll have six majority date\nAnd for a financial advisor financial planner like you it's almost impossible make well projections 'cause there's no way to know our estimate what the returns going to be when you don't have a fixed rate of return on your fixed income portfolio there'll be a problem\nThat's exactly right Bob and that was another focus you know as far as lowering their tax burden in such a high tax\nBracket owning your initial bond portfolio outright as a great way to help with the tax burden at like you said really accurately Ron wealth productions and do some real planet for them and in terms of their overall risk where they take more risk than necessary or not enough\nYou know I Would I Would say that they were taking\nMore risk than necessary in their investments and really you know a good portion that we would focus on putting in fixed income investments was really just and and money market accounts and and in cash you know which uh my my can be more risky over the long run because you're you're really not hedging yes inflation\nAnd that was a crazy part II at forty two percent which is very common by the way sitting in cash\nRight now earning virtually no return I remember I was just like hey you know you need this money to grow over inflation and right now he had almost half his net worth just sitting there and I think part of the problem was he just didn't know which way to go because he thought like hey\nMy visors charge me too much money I think I don't quite know I mean it was really just kind of perplexed about where the money should go right exactly and the other thing too is which I thought it was interesting you made a good point and is\nThere was a lot around just getting some real financial planning done a big thing for him was is a way to save money and taxes which we all want to do I mean we talked about some creative strategies especially 'cause he has those big irate distributions\nYeah I mean to your point you know these are integrating come yes these big IRA distributions that you know quite frankly he doesn't need and doesn't want but it turns out talking to him you know he's very generous guy loves donating to charity but it was kind of a no brainer ... outage distributions per year at a hundred thousand dollars out of the IRA\nAnd he can donate all that money to name charities and have no tax liability whatsoever\nWhich he was very impressive that strategy because I thought that was it was just great planning on your part I mean I think that's the big thing it's like okay you have an advisor destroyed you watch the hidden fees but where's the financial advice\nYeah doesn't earn a diagnosis I look through your analysis I see they're able to substantially reduce the overall management the by eliminating some of these hidden cost\nAnd then by taking that cash and getting invested in a high quality municipal bond portfolio increase the income by over thirty thousand dollars a year that's a substantial increase\nYour about it's really incredible what the percentage that we can we can increase the income I mean if you take that money compound it over the next Twenty years you're talking about almost a million dollars\nWow [laughter] yeah and none of that taking more resonance taking less risk and having you know more consistent income so it's not a matter of if the portfolio will grow just a better when\nAny great job and is there and and that that's really comes down to write a myth that holistic approach looking at everything if you're thinking

I've got to investigate that he's just so on and on everybody\nThat I talked to about it's the first thing I says if you were to balance of nature you've got to get on it it will save yet\nI just can't [noise] can Dr Howard enough he's brilliant\nWelcome back to our show we just heard our top success stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in an eight hundred two four six\nEight seven five one that's eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one next to listen to an interview that I had was Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or a balance\nOf nature this is a conversation you don't want to miss as we discuss a variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself\nHow can better nutrition improve my life he's a doctor chiropractic he's also director of Medicine He's a leading researcher insight on nutrition he's a good friend and he's the man who created\nThe product that has changed my family's life and so many others\nDr Douglas Howard a balance of nature hello how you it's great to be here again it's wonderful and I'm also so very glad\nTo introduce the very original how's coach a balance of nature a a a wonderful title because it's something that's so unique to this company will be getting into that as Well hi Suzy Hi Laura good to be back it's great to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to\nA people all over the country in terms of uh encouraging people to take the fruits and veggies everyday Dr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept in the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits and vegetables into a capsule of my\nBook actually years years of study you know it's interesting other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad we're not a fad\nWhere something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this has made it happened and I always ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours and blah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nWe don't get it it's not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just the businesses trying to get on the shelf and convince people were about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said that the health coaching for example that's why we offer that is to help people accelerate the results there's no extra fees there's no extra charge for it infects business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that department it just costs you money no that use what we are about results\nSo people say to me off and oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take you know balance of nature because I keep\nI I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so sluggish and\nFuzzy and when I take it and this is literally on a daily basis I can literally feel my body\nPick up and my and my thinking clearer me so I'm One of those people and I my parents are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me oh no I take the vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you you need tend to eleven servings of\nFruits and vegetables per day in their most potent nutritious\nLike Ninety nine point nine hundred percent of ... like a raw vegetable almost are you getting that a and B\nThey are not a vitamin and in fact you can it's just not true Dr Howard you can\nFor go some of those multi vitamins big companies put out here and just substitute it with nothing but the fruits and vegetables is that correct\nYes in fact I'm going to reverse a little bit you you don't you don't substitute vitamins just they're they're all of its there plus hundreds of thousands of other chemicals a buffer and assist those chemicals to make them work hundred fold and that's what's important about it\nThe reason people take vitamins just because they know that their diet is substandard if they were sitting down everyday and eating more than ten servings and in variety of thirty one different fruits and vegetables do you think they would even think\nTaking vitamins no I think they went down because that's why I'm already marketed as true and\nLet me tell you every time you extract a chemical or every time you you consume an isolated chemical there is a side effect is one of the first things you're you're taught and pharmacology in medical school\nIs there's a side effect every chemical but in a fruit and vegetables and fruit or vegetable then there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals that counteract those negative side effects consistently and there is a side effect of fruits and vegetables good helped\n[laughter] so part a lot of the so called lifestyle diseases I've I've heard you mentioned before and I've read on your\nLiterature that ... a lot of the life style diseases that we know today can be prevented from the taking of the fruits and veggies on a daily basis how and why is this\nWhat I Want to go back to one of the thing really fast\nIs because sometimes on on the vitamin aspect sometimes there's even a point where where I help coach will be working with somebody and they just aren't getting the progress that they would like to be happening and then they find out the person is taking\nA whole bunch of vitamins on top of it somehow they missed that hopefully not but\nAnd then we'll talk to them and say you know what let's start taking off some of this other chemistry so that the ... the chemistry from real fruits and vegetables can start doing his job and they start seeing the results that were really wanting to to progress with\nThe reason being is the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables has to go in and counteract some of the chemistry that they're\nUsing the ... the extraction so they have to\nUse some of the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables to counteract some of the effects of those vitamins that aren't necessary in the body so it actually most of the time works better without that now\nThere's not a danger you can continue to take your vitamins if you want but frequently most of the time to get a better result if you drop the multivitamin and I just asked myself let's see which one smarter guard or a scientist ...\nFor those that are just tuning in I'm Talking with Dr Douglas Howard the formulate or of balance of nature's fruits and veggies and fiber in size and I'm just amazed at what it is doing not only for me personally and my family but for so many others before we

microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most\nYou remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat the the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of

telling everybody that I talked to about it's the first thing I says about the nature you've got to get on it it will shave yet\nI just can't [noise] ten Dr Howard enough he's brilliant\nWelcome back to our show we just heard our top success stories of the week\nWhat plays a role in is your quality of life\nAnd that's what we're losing in medicine is we're ... we're forgetting about quality of life we don't save lives if we don't have quality left in it all of those aspects has to be\nWorked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your life to the surgery but they're rude and mean then you don't really feel real great and you might go home still depressed or whatever it is more depressed or more\nAnd more fearful to ya that's frequent more fear that drives me crazy when when we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no at the homes of nature we use education ... means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd that helps Chad is also just magical and ...\n... one wonderful thing as a health costs when you're working with people sometimes there's decided they helped triad that people can't face you know they're just they've been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I Can't do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore\nAnd so I ... the health coaches that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes up naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set that aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve than they get more\nWilling to look at that site that so difficult for them\nSo you have a health coach that takes the customers through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or how much you should take what time you should take them\nSome of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature\nWell the main goal of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or when you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true with gender research we know that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human ... if you'd just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is there and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example not use names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man and I'm an in\nRelation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches his it's based upon the try out of health and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's health is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it\nBecause we are based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything is based upon the raw materials of new up of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help\nAnd that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there is it at the mental spiritual emotional side of that is all one that's not three different things that's one side of your health try out\nAnd so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit and for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah\nAs I was talking with him is a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at and finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and finally I looked at me you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right\nI don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life\nBecause now we're working all three sides and we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had several several goals but 'til we found that one he wasn't a changed person he will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard answers and Howard don't go away\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nIt really does work I've had to upgrade to fetch and not not getting the little

what has made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving a towel on why does it work but the beauty of it is\nWe don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make it special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing added and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce it took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with\nWith the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most\nYou remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out where needed and also even studies about the\n... the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood how it flows through the veins and can get to the smallest possible vessels all of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature when I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits of the fruits and veggies and the ... the whole health system\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone's life no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today thank you it's great to be here thank you laugh\nProgram was sponsored by balance of nature abuse expressed by the preceding program are those are

think Gary Goldberg financial services personally thinks there were sectors of the market in general that will continue to plow ahead are you in those sectors if you're not\nWhy don't you have a discussion with us we'll talk about where opportunities may live so when interest rates go up what sectors of the market typically are less impacted well I can tell you the technology is less impacted banks are less impacted\nWhen a bank borrows money at let's say three eight percent if interest rates go up\nConsumer loans go up mortgage rates go up bank profits go up\nThe spread increases so the fed\nIn raising short term interest rates\nIs putting banks in a position where there are some opportunities we are\nGenerally in favor of technology companies we like pharmaceutical companies that

S. dot com [noise]\n\nThem back to the show ladies and gentlemen again my phone number you would like to have a conversation with me about your portfolio free review one eight hundred three\nSeven seven five seven five seven so I've told you not to become alarmed about interest rates\nThe Federal Reserve is doing what they said they would do and if you believe them they're not going to do anything extravagant for another year they don't want to cause a recession you don't want them to cause a recession then I had a bunch of dummies they don't want to derail the strong economy\nBut now let me give you the downside of higher interest rates\nIf you are attempting to buy a home if you have a variable rate more will mortgage rates\nJumped pass five percent more than five percent this week and a lot of millennials\nAre in their prime home buying years they use to cheap credit\nSo they may be in for a rude awakening because of this junk in mortgage rates and I might add that higher rates probably will throw cold water on those high home prices sellers might see demand fall off\nAnd they will probably see their houses sit on the market for longer than they are used to\nIn twenty sixteen mortgage rates were three and a half percent remember that and then recently they crept up to ... percent they hit five percent\nThis week or more people are expecting mortgage rates even go higher remember banks make money on these mortgages because they lend at a very big spread\nAnd I from my observation have noticed that home sales have been sliding for a lot of this year on this program I forecast a year ago watch out for these ridiculously priced apartments and condos in New York City\nI reflected on a walk that my wife and I took\nIn the city on the hive you along the west side highway\nAnd I couldn't believe studios that about a million dollars\nA million dollars studio apartments 'cause you could see a little bit of the river and perhaps the tree that's above all now prices are coming down\nAnd if you're in a position where you are not able to afford very high prices in different parts of the geographical area with mortgage rates going over five percent\nOr you're gonna find affordability is going to be a bit of a culprit and if you have the cash you'll probably do well rates are now a full percentage point higher than they were a year ago that ads\nAbout two hundred dollars more to a monthly mortgage payment on a three hundred thousand dollar loan and I might add it also knocks a lot of bar was out of qualifying because lenders are kind of strict and how much debt\nA bar with can carry in relation to their income so five percent takes homebuyers out of some markets and I'm just be aware of that\nThe stronger economy or on the other side is also fueling demand for housing but um there's a lot of supply that will come on the market will probably sit there for a while though\nAh my suggestion is keep your eye on declining home prices in certain geographical areas as far as other impacts credit card\nMy goodness the average credit card debt now is over Seventeen percent that's the interest rate on credit card debt and if you want to know how much the average credit card amounts to almost six thousand dollars\nAverage is fifty seven hundred dollars on credit card banks are charging Seventeen point one percent on average and it's the highest ever point in history\nIn terms of the amount of credit card debt that is out there over a trillion dollars in credit card debt so one of the most important things you can do after you cut up your credit cards\nIs try to renegotiate your credit card debt you can go to your courage carrier and you can ask because\nIf you ask is a good chance you get your interest rate reduced\nThey will uh want to keep your account and they will also waive certain the so the baby that doesn't cry does not get fed don't be ... will go to your credit card carrier and say you're looking at some zero percent credit card opportunities what can you do for me\nAnd some of these payments or or some of these uh charges of late payments cash advances and they can range from three to five percent just in that sector so when we come back I Am going to be joined by Dr Gary ... he's an economist and he and I are going to talk about\nWhat was NAFTA which is now referred to as the U.S Mexico and Canada treaties they tune will have a discussion and some edits occasion for\nYou on the new U.

G. S. S. dot\nCom in in ... [noise]\n[noise] I Want to re introduce you to one of the programs that we have here uh Gary Goldberg financial services it's one that you have never seen at your own from are you sure you wherever you are doing business they don't have a program like the one I'm going to tell you about because we created it here we trade market here\nAnd it is known as the G G fs tactical exchange traded funds strategy\nIt's our ATF program exchange traded funds now for those who don't know what do you have so are they are index funds they trade on the stock exchange they um are giving you as an investor an opportunity to kind of slice and dice what sectors of the market you want to be in\nBut do you yourself know which sectors of the market you should be in so we developed\nA program here which is driven by a software program that we created\nAnd this ATF strategy are tactical ATF strategy tries to achieve some long term capital appreciation because we invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of different exchange traded funds\nSo we do is at a probably a couple of thousand ATF we will select or track sixty of them\nAnd of those sixty what we do is we isolate twelve of the sixty\nOf the twelve we then determine which parts of the market\nYou should have your money it so for those twelve I can tell you our core holdings we don't trade them those to be the S. and P. five hundred the Russell two thousand in international ATF so put those on the left side of your mind they stay as core holdings\nBe other eight are dynamic\nThat I mean they're in different sectors of the market and we developed a software program that tracks the flows of institutional money where money is going run institutions pension funds hedge funds into what sectors of the market and what sectors of the market is it leaving\nAnd every night we get a report where are the flows of money from institutions heading or leaving\nWe then rate those eight that I just described into a rating system of ABC indeed keep in mind the aid that we choose for you\nAre going to be a rated\nAnd if in a falls to a de because we get a notice every night as to what's going on with the flows of money if it goes from an eight or D we sell it the following morning\nIf it falls to uh see will hold it for up to thirty days and see if there's a recovery if it falls to a beat goes on our radar screen and when something is sold it goes to cash\nSo to summarize we isolate eight sectors of the market those eight sectors are computer driven based upon flows of money from institutions\nIf money is going in we will get a bye signal if money is leaving will get a cell signal\nIf something gets sold it goes to cash and we wait for another a rated exchange traded funds to appear\nSo it removes the motion of selling\nIt removes the emotion of buying it isolates various sectors of the market that are attractive or an attractive and we've had a lot of interest from our clients in that particular program if you want to learn about our tactical exchange traded fun strategy\nArt tactical ATF strategy give me a call\nIt is not for smaller investors the minimum that count as a hundred thousand dollars but\nIf you have money that is looking for a place to invest you do not have a program\nLike this in your portfolio so if you're attempting to diversify this might be something that you want to learn about I Want to get back for a moment\nTo what I was saying about homes and how the extraordinarily high some of the values have gone in America today there are one hundred and Ninety seven towns in suburbs where the median home value is higher than a million dollars\nCan you imagine how does the average person afford it how can the average person with college debt with those types of debt with\nPensions that are there but just obviously they're taxable doesn't leave you with a lot so a lot of people are forced to sell their homes relocate to a lower tax state\nWell I just told you how it's going to become perhaps more difficult to sell your home because of higher interest rates so I'm just keep in mind now the thing that is hoping the market\nTax reform companies in the United states in the last quarter brought back three hundred billion dollars from overseas\nAnd what do they do with it well they're buying back their own shares the repatriating the money they're buying back shares their increasing evidence that's a good thing and I think that will help boy the market in the last quarter of this year\nWhen we come back I'm going to talk with the woman who's well known Mika Brzezinski she's written a wonderful book or she is the co star on MORNING Joe with her husband Joe Scarborough wrote a book knowing your value women money and getting what your work\nOur
