she's a you know a a a desk colder there she's a plant called her she she is a ah what are the owners of the company took it about three million dollars from Bernie Sanders and that's fine so he's a lifelong left wing a Democrat and\nAll that all that there is there's junkies sitting in his office and got a microphone in chunks of this is how it warms up for his big TV show on the cable cable TV or go hey John\nWilliams next door shut up you don't come out in the weather starts gathering junk you don't mind down with your\nMother or something to kiss the ashes of Democrats in rights on the

should ever junk should be the ventilator he could be a you know the the music men of or\nIt could be a professor Harold Hill he could be I think is the Herald hill of NBC News\nBut junk he's gotta he's gotta conspiracy theory now again everybody they're cutting ... this is the this is the program this morning by the way we're eight eight eight six there just by the way we're eight eight eight six three zero nine six two five eight ... six three oh nine six two five and a and if you if you don't say\nThat at Trump's fault and his rhetoric is clearly responsible and we don't have to know who does we obviously know this is a Trump supporter during this\nBecause he misspelled Florida and all Trump supporters misspelled Florida\nAnd other and they don't notice when their computer tells them to check the spelling of Florida that I've noticed that that's not somebody who's deliberately misspelling to make it look like a stupid person and the oversized American flag or ... and then uh stamps and then the er and CNN report in something that contradicted itself this morning\nThat they are all the packages went through U.S Postal service facilities\nTo were delivered by courier and some don't have postage marks postal marks whatever you call them\nUm and now how that makes sense and they wrote that out ahead of time and they sat down and say they all went through postal facilities but some don't have postal march and some are delivered by courier now make sense of that that's that ... their brains don't work as designed they're pretty pathetic\nA junk junk was on the television and he's got yesterday we were kind of joking about it that it's\nEither a righty who lives in a cabin and he's like a right wing Unabomber\nRight with a long beard and and he's making these things buddies to dumb dispel Florida and to them to spell shorts and to them ... spelled Brennan and then he puts stamps on but they're delivered by career and that\nWas enough to confuse CNN and um and he sent these things 'cause he watches Hannity\nAnd that's how we knew to send one to Robert De Niro and that explains everything say that and that's not a conspiracy theory that's just good journalists say that they're using the old knock him and and then if you say well wait a minute here all of the return address is go to Debbie was a man Schmitz guy\nAnd nobody hates Debbie wasn't mentioned it's like the Bernie Sanders supporters because she stole the nomination from Bernie and gave it to Hillary because they're corrupt and she was basically run out of town fired\nFrom the DNC issues that at the DNC because of that and and the people that are really angry with Debbie wasn't mention it or not Republicans\nShe's been irrelevant for a year or more more than a year and she's been silent for months so who's angry with her who what what writing your Unabomber is angry with\nSo angry with Debbie wasn't mention is that every envelope has her name on it\nBecause of the return address and I heard somebody suggest yesterday well they put the return address on their of someone they know so that they'll open the package\nWell that's fine but the package don't the packages don't detonate when you open them in fact they don't detonate when you do anything to them they don't detonate period\nSo that doesn't really watch when you say well that's to convince them to open it because then they blow up but but they're not ready to blow up when you open them\nSo that that really doesn't make a lot of sense and they've got these people are supposed to be smart people on television talking about these things but really they're they're morally corrupt they're ethically bankrupt and they and their dishonest and they're not as smart as they appear or their hair cut some ties not withstanding\nUh uh I don't know who did it it could be a righty some not Unabomber\nWho was a big lefty environmentalists by the way the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski huge lefty\nNever mind that\nAnd it could be some lefty it could be a writer you could be a lefty and then I said yesterday it could be the Russians\nAnd that's kind of tongue in cheek but on the other hand this is the kind of thing that they've done on line so this would be making a three dimensional and a more reality based except that those risky as we're doing it I think that actually blow people up so as we are discussing yesterday this this\n... there are clues bread crumbs but I Can't come to any conclusions not CNN and and the rest they can all come to conclusions they came to conclusions\nBefore the whole thing started they knew that if fake bombs were mailed that it would be Trump's fault in the future shrunk came up with this I I think he might have been listening because he he likes to and um and he said this could be the Russians\nI I have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to clear designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think ... and so in some ways we shouldn't allow um me and I didn't feel it in ... very strange moment\nYeah it's a very strange moment yeah I think most women so strange for you was that blow as some other uh Fla for I guess for the for the cause aren't they\nKnow there could be the Russians well that's always a possibility except I honestly honestly I think the Russians were to blow them up now who would not blow them up what an angry righty Unabomber not blow them up what's the point of that but\nIf you're an angry lefty Bernie supporter who really has a special burning hatred for Debbie Wasserman Schultz things are really your allies the Cory bookers and James ... these are the spokesman for the Democratic party\nSo if you're a Democrat you wouldn't really want to blow them up but you'd want to start a campaign that would allow the news media on the lead up to the midterms to blame Trump for everything which they predictably\nWill do everyone knows that before the whole thing starts let's go to the silly silly Abby Philips at CNN who is standing in front of the White House today and she was playing all grown up she was acting like she was a grown up and\nI she's a reporter I think her parents are probably proud of her the CNN gave her this job but she looks like a deer in the headlights and and she's standing in front of her and she doesn't really know what she's talking about but she's a highly paid CNN correspondent front of the White House\nAnd she is attacking President Trump and and CNN has been blaming President Trump for this since the get go as all of the news media have they don't need to know what's going on who did it why they they know okay and I hear ... Philips she uh\nShe is she's upset because President Trump isn't sitting still and taking his beating from these twenty two year old corrupt more rounds on the news media\n... ah it's attacking the media for criticizing the way ... von care what\nHe's criticizing the media is attacking the media for criticizing him I'd say is criticizing the media for attacking him and for blaming him for these but she did call them bomb scares which is in fact what they are\nThese are not really bombs\nKeep that in mind Abby thought still talking about the president the United states um and it's all because\nYou know he's been critical of people they received these non exploding devices it's got to be his fault this is a fallacious illegitimate anyone who's studied logic studied philosophy recognizes this as a fallacious illegitimate\nPresident Trump criticized Cory Booker Cory Booker had a not exploding device to him that we are going to call a terrorist bomb therefore it's President Trump's fault say textbook definition of a fallacious sill adjust Abby\nDoesn't mean that he focused on its ... and all of Jerry in telling the fact that he blamed fairly for filing that thought out people were out of high tide in particular that had been the target that his credit\nThey'd been the target service criticism huh where's that James Hodgkinson showing up on the baseball field audio because I think that\nThis guy felt that um he was critical of Congressman Steve school age son he was critical of Senator Rand Paul Senator Rand Paul was there that day he escaped alive\nHe was later attacked by his next door neighbor Democrat who broke six of his ribs or damaged a lung and uh and that was in the CNN will tell you that was over a bundle of sticks along the ah the the border of their property and and that's what they're sticking with because never mind all that\nUm and then Rand Paul was asked well what what was when James Hodgkinson the Bernie Sanders volunteer\nWeather forecasters say we're going to get whacked by Willa remnants that is up to two inches of rain expected with fifty mile per hour winds overnight into Saturday coastal flood warnings in effect from New York City Long Island and most of the ...\nThe seashore Con Ed expects down trees and power lines and has dozens of extra utility contractors on standby same with the at the end she NPs CGI Long Island I'm Sara Lee counselor for Seventy seven WABC news and the\nSubject of an HBO documentary is being charged with murder corresponding carry shoemaker has that story Los Angeles superior court judge ruled Thursday there's enough evidence to try Seventy five year old multimillionaire Robert terrorists\nOr the shooting death of Susan Berman at her home Eighteen years ago prosecutors alleged terrorists killed burning to keep her from telling police what she knew\nAbout that presume death that his wife his vanished in the Nineteen eighties there was the subject of HBO's two thousand Fifteen documentary series called the jinx terrorists with her mother and in the documentary he had killed them all he's pleaded not guilty I'm Carrying shoemaker now here's Joan checking her friday topics\nAre forced yeah well yeah I mean you continue to have these problems in and around the area because of this lease activity again we have delays now at the George Washington bridge and the reason for that is because they had the the cross Bronx close there for a while as they were moving the police equipment around so again as you hit that way expects them extra ...

least they spelled his name right and set up to CNN which is the correct network which again lead you to believe that it's a Bernie supporters more than more than anything\nBut clever as blase about it lays the bad guy whoever the bad guys that again the news media saying well the bomber whoever he or she is there was like we think it's a woman I guess it's possible it would be fairly unprecedented I think\nBut they don't want to be sexist by assuming that at the heat and referring to him by his pronouns of he him\nAnd also if it's a Bernie supporter you know his pronouns might be the ... and uh and ... and things like that\nBecause he may not identify as you know with the gender or with which he was born\nThis is part of the Democratic party's thing today don't you know congressman states voice I read the story yesterday the New York Times Book review asked five left wing hate filled anti Trump\nStory writers to write up something about the next chapter for Trump and this woman that they asked was do we they asked us Zoe to write up a a little story for the New York times Zoe sharp\nAnd she wrote a story titled how it ends and in her short story which the New York times happily published\nIt's about a Russian assassin on a suicide mission that Russian assassins rock usually on suicide missions but Bernie Sanders assassins have been known to launch suicide missions at least James Hodgkinson while yelling this is for health care and uh\nThen there are the uh the anti police suicide missions Ishmael Britain's Labour with officers Ramos Lou in New York and and the other's suicide missions in Dallas in Baton Rouge\nTo name a couple there are more as well but the New York times published this this story where Zoe says that um that\nHow it ends there is a Russian assassin on a suicide mission\nAnd and he's trying to shoot President Trump is up close and he's about to murder president President United States there are times loves us and his Russian gun miss fires\nSo the secret service agent according to silly sharp and the New York times Secret Service agent pulls out his walk and hands it to the Russian but first and says here use mine so you can kill the president because the secret service wants to murder him\nJust like ... wants to murder and she has murder in her heart and so does the New York times how many times have they murdered Donald Trump\nThere was the Central Park or Julius Caesar a thing where they had Donald Trump male stabbed him to death and the crowd went wild and the news media loved it and the New York times was uh thrilled by it and CNN loved it so they murdered Trump this Trump like a figure Kathy Griffin with the ah cutting the head off and holding the severed head up and posing for\nShe was kicked to the curb the Hillary people told her to be subservient to their campaign\nAnd she was and the reward was that they kicked her to the curb and they stripped her of her position of power and they've abused her and the elected her and told her everything's her fault they a pond off the stealing the nomination from Bernie on her she's the villain of the story right\nAnd um she's right now I don't really

people on the old order that you can call up right now the Democratic party is out of control not only the out of control what we're\nAll going and they don't want to do that was cool\nI got to say the funniest definitely I always look for the funniest outcome the funniest out ... as we have a Bernie Sanders\nVolunteer like James Hodgkinson arrested for those in the end and that's why all the Debbie Wasserman Schultz return addresses now that it's an effort to play the victim you know how they loved to play the victim\nAnd so we set yourself that yesterday um that Senator Grassley had referred he sent a letter to the department of justice about I'm Michael ... porn lawyer\nAnd Julie sweat Nick sweat Nick was their high school nicknamed again\n[noise] Grassley a referred Michael have an Audi an Julie sweat next to the Justice Department for criminal investigation yesterday he decided what next interview with NBC News as evidence that the two were trying to mislead the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat's in sworn statements by the way and the NBC News interview aired on October first Julie sweat Nick backtracked on or contradicted parts of her sworn statements where she alleged she witnessed then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nQuote caused girls to become an ... braided and disoriented so they then could be a gang rape today side room\nOr bedroom by train of boys that was all okay with NBC and everybody else at the time the allegation was enough not the case with Cory Booker Keith Ellison\nNBC also found other apparent inconsistencies in a second sworn statements from other women\nFrom excuse me another woman whose statement ... provided to the Senate Judiciary committee in a bid to bolster sweating next claims [noise] haven't had it could very well end up in prison for this and that would be kind of funny I guess\nAnd the second statement the owner identified woman said she witnessed Kevin ... quote spike and quote the punch at high school parties in order to actually take advantage of girls now what does that with vodka or with quite woods 'cause they were saying ...\n... less than forty eight hours before ... released her sworn statement on Twitter the same woman told NBC News a different story\nReferring to cabinet spiking the punch quote I didn't ever think it was Brett she said\nTo reporters in a phone interview arranged by having at a un September thirtieth after repeated requests to speak with other witnesses who might corroborate sweating next claims and she went on and talk to NBC um contradicted very directly the claims\nAs soon as the call began the woman said she never met sweat Nick in high school and never saw her at parties and only had become friends with her when they were both in their thirties\nWhen asked in the phone interview if she ever witnessed Kavanaugh act inappropriately toward girls the women replied no\nShe did describe the culture of heavy drinking in high school that she also took part in Ann Cavanaugh and his friend mark judge what part of that group\nBut the rest was pure fabrication I'm just going to fill in the blanks here from this point not\nBecause of the Caribbean porn lawyer with is creepy women I came up with these creepy stories which were critically um uh the confessed did and\nUm and they provided sworn statements under penalty of law and it's time that the full force of the law be brought against these people who tried to derail a a a government process in which we were selecting a justice for the Supreme Court\nBy smearing slandering and falsely accusing of hideous felonies\nAnd decades and decades ago and oh I'm for enforcing the law as as it exists along the border I'm for eggs enforcing the laws that exist when it comes to creepy porn lawyer and a vis a person Julie sweat Nick who said truly outrageous\nIf things and the sworn statement and then when I interviewed by Kate Snow who's a chicken I think if a chicken snow this is my chicken snow and the NBC interview she said well I I saw him handing out red solo cups to people at parties\nPigeon hole Brett Kavanaugh plural biking or punish for\nWhy why why I thought he would get and rent fellow kept quiet the girls are a lot time whoa\nWhoa whoa whoa gosh he was saying he got red so she can testify that thirty five years ago at a party a teenage boy that she thinks was Brett Kavanaugh\nHanded out red solo cups at a party that ended up being the accusation when she was forced to go on television on the record in front of a camera being as direct questions by Kate Snow good for kids now\nOf course they thought they were getting the the the interview of the year because they were going to bring down Kavanaugh\nAnd then Trump would be and chaos and that was the goal and then they went there and she said well I can tell you Mr uh I saw I'm heading out red solo cups in Nineteen eighty four oh they were read never solo cups I have that all covered that was a\nLittle old for the record has not been able to independently verify her class there I forget she told us on camera that differ from her ... ...\nYeah so NBC News publishing last night and today that as an adult and they they are that they uh they kept saying no no she's no her my story is is right that's right I haven't had a set of follow up message after she denied everything to NBC News\nAnd he sent a message to NBC News saying I just confirmed with her yet again that everything in the declaration as true incorrect ... said she must have been confused by your question he thinks women are stupid roughly five minutes later the same anonymous woman sent a formerly worded text backing Abernathy\nPlease understand that everything and the declaration is true and that you should not contact me anymore regarding this issue the text message set\nSo he's threatening her with legal action on NBC News is just all\nTwisted around their own ... with their confusion and it's it's nuts out there

department of justice news conference\nThat they want to have three hours in Fifteen minutes to get their act together\nBut that's that's good that's a that's a development that's major obviously an arrest and thank God I I don't care if the guy's a a you know the writer Unabomber or if he's a Bernie supporter of his or Russia or fees are jihadi I just want the guy caught first and foremost that's the most important thing\nAnd the politics of it I guess will uh will correct as we go forward and and I gotta I gotta say if this isn't some Trump loving righty\nOr the news media will instantly like that I just snapped my fingers like that\nThey're going to change the narrative and I talked about it yesterday the narrative will immediately become oh well thank God it was all a false alarm\nThank God thank gosh almighty it was just a false alarm and there was never any real danger because it was somewhat on our side who just wanted to he shouldn't have done it but thankfully no one was in danger now the narrative now is that it's a it's worse than the Lincoln assassination it's I heard on I think on the panhandlers yesterday\nThat this is the biggest attack\nOn our republic since the Lincoln assassination that's what I heard that's what they're saying let's go to well let's go to a little bit of audio she got a number of twelve I'm\nAvalon I think his name is

things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin job all things\nAnd what she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes\nTrump Robert De Niro is calling the president a devil and us devil worshippers in effect you know\nYou know no I
