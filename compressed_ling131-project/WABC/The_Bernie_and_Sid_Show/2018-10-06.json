{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WABC", "content": "And now we have our special guest on the show this morning for just ... area as we like to say it's always good to be one of Frankie financial friends\nHello good morning three for having me\nIt's always fun to have Frankie ... area on our show I think so surprised your colleagues European capital management one of our star financial advisors\nAnd this is our segment the solid segment where we actually reviewer real retirement plan and we talked about some things that we did to help you know in this case a couple get on track and become what we would call retirement ready and they actually asked us to give them a shout out on the radio this morning\n[laughter] I don't know I don't know if you're out there listening\nSo basically when you talk about the case that we worked on and just some of the things that you help them do to get on their path to financial freedom\nWe did a few things definitely sat down took a look at everything which is a lot larger than it seems because they had over Nineteen counts\n[laughter] I Know this is what all the data and I ... I was sweating and eating because I was putting so much data and\nBecause they had so many different accounts and that was one of the problems right is like the spouse was just like how am I going to deal with their God Forbid something happens to my husband and that's such a big single whereas occasion friday\nThat's what they called it [laughter] unfortunately\nWhen I took a deeper look at all those different holdings\nA similar theme kept coming up which was large kept gross [laughter] as we see a lot large kept grows cash and stable value finds those three different areas in Nineteen different accounts so that's not actually diversification\nGet the great irony right it's like you think okay I have my money at lots of different institutions I must be diversified but the reality of it is when you put it all on one spreadsheet and you look at it from a bird's eye view a lot of times you do a lot of the same things there's just a different places that's not diversification\nBecause the big issue is you know when when it's up\nIt's not that's awesome but the big issue is\nWhen it's down you have all these accounts acting the same and that's not how you want to you want your accounts to have you know different asset classes and you want your your account to actually be allocated differently you know you're not going to have a Roth account allocated the same way and your taxable account\nYou know you want to take advantages and different accounts and use you know different tax benefits to work for\nA really good points frankly but what exactly did you recommend they do different than what they were currently doing\nSo they say it's consolidation we sat down and we said hey out of all of these you know Nineteen accounts we can get you down to less than five that's a big thing consolidation you do need to have Fifteen different I always\nLiked interject here the spouses face like lit up when we said look we're going to be able to have one logging\nShow you were all your different accounts are going to consolidate like you sat down to five accounts but she was so stressed about not knowing where things were and here we are able to go to this one place that we can log into and she could see everything and she didn't have to worry about all the different places her husband happen to be you know swirling away money per se and that's\nWhy you know like anything else I think what a lot of you do is you'll put money into different towns with different you know targets in specific reasons for having that money investors specific goals\nBut what really works is to manage your money in concert with every other dollar that you have now there's nothing wrong with having your municipal bonds in your personal account writer having growth stocks in your retirement account but you need a coordinated plant and you need a simple view you know by putting this all on paper it's crystal clear what needs to be done\nBut by having Nineteen different accounts there's no way in the world you can understand what you won't and more importantly while you won't it when you agree for I\nI absolutely agree into Ryan's point also you know having that one portal is nice but it's also nice to kind of have this team\nWhere she has support or we can walk through it God Forbid something happens to her husband but she has a team that she can depend on and that was a big thing for them it was working with someone they can pick up the phone and say you know I Need help I trust you that\nYou know the worst thing to do for your spouse if you handle all the finances and God Forbid something happens to you\nAnd you know maybe it's with lots of different brokers are financial representative you have there's not one central person their spouses comfortable with you know it's going to be able to walk you know him or her through everything if God Forbid something happens to you I mean that's huge in terms of taking stress\nOff of a grieving spouse Oh absolutely adored\nRye I always say financial planning is about love if you love your spouse is planning done because if something happens to him or her and suddenly they have to manage their finances after being in the dark for forty fifty years boys are going to be hell to pay\nAn absolutely absolutely and also you know during that time that's the last thing that should be on your mind is oh now where's the checkbook right that's that's not what should be your your focus\nThe ultimate thing you're now says he is the income went up dramatically they're going to have just because of your repositioning you know an additional three point four percent a year that's a little nervous amount of cash flow that didn't have before\nAbsolutely and using it to their advantage and using it to compound because of what they were really fortunate West is one of the few people in this world Bob who have a pension so not able to you and I have right now for\nBob and Bob [laughter] to get on it long enough but it's a good ...

balance of nature in a conversation with nationally syndicated talk show host Kevin McCullough\nThis is a conversation you don't want to mess as they discuss a variety of important issues related to house I want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nIt is often said that a medical doctors and the in the world of medicine are very suspicious of nutrition and nutritionist him by nature to be somewhat suspicious of medicine\nAnd the truth is there may be need for both in wisdom is knowing the difference between the two\nMy special guest today is none other than the creator and the originator of balance of nature do he'll say he didn't create it and you'll just say he discovered it Dr Douglas Howard Dr Howard it's good to have you here would you say on an average basis that we're under nutritional lives in this country that we don't have the nutrition in our bodies\nThat are that they were originally created with to be able to fight disease on a natural level Oh absolutely in\nFact I started specializing when I came back I I was being a foreign student affairs and Pavlov Medical University in Russia for several years and when I came back I started concentrating more on the geriatric patients at that point in time\nHow many people do you know and even if you're listening how many do know that have bleeding gums ... bruise easily have low energy and losing hair your body like that will\nLast aside well Robyn [laughter] but no but I've almost everybody in my peer group and older than me but I Do I Know people that have the losers sub clinical signs\n... you know we think oh we get out you know I take vitamin C. pill will\nOh those are signs of different disease aspects and those are things we look for the first thing is as cells start to die those are things that are happening\nAnd you know it's interesting as even with bounds of nature I'm not here to tell you that everybody's going to grow a full head of hair back and some people do but that's not what this product is about a but hair loss slows down an even even hereditary hair loss seems to slow and I'll never forget a patient that came in once and\nShe said oh I've got to show you this and my husband I got to show you this I said OK okay you know and and she showed me his head you know take your hat off took his hat off and yeah he was about half bald and she has no you don't understand she showed me the line of hair that had all grown back about two inches of it was coming back and she's I have been shaving his head\nFor Twenty years and I know that head and I know where it was and now he's starting to let me you know want me to grow some of back and then another one game and she says that you've had a command we're we've got to go in another room and I said okay and she said she said the league\nTake your shirt off [laughter] okay [laughter] that I took a ... had this you know chest of hair and I says a nice she has no you don't understand\nThat used to all be gray\nAnd I said well great you know and so and this man happened to have a breathing disorder and because of his meds and some other things and what and he was able to become more active and becoming more active he's able to get some of his meds because he was taking a balance of nature and it's all a big cycle\nBut as that those things happen then that was an unnatural grain and so when the body was able to do with it needed to do those things reverse and so there's a lot of lot of fun things\nFriends if you're interested in in a knowing more about balance of nature there's people standing by right now that want to talk to you and you can call them simply an eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one you're gonna get more information about promo codes and so forth coming up in our next break but to write that number down one eight hundred two four six eight seven fifty one\nDr Howard the reason you and I are talking is because a number of months ago maybe a little more than a year ago now [noise] ah I called you desperately on a weekend and I said Dr Howard I have the worst flu I've ever had I've never I've never felt this way I've never suffered this way\nYou ask some questions about my ... my nutritional background I struggled with chronic bronchitis growing up there were regular chest congestion issues and sinuses and ah allergies and so forth that I was dealing with for a long time\nIn fact when I was a kid um I Would get bronchitis nearly every time the weather changed or if it went from real cold to real warm in a fast a short period of time\nIn fact this spring here in New York we had one of those days and I could tell my body wanted to to go there didn't get there this time but uh you you talk to me about the difference in sparking a flame and the way infection works in the body and you said ... which is easier to put out the big roaring fire or little tiny spark and of course the answers to spark [noise]\nUm but you did I'm impressed you remember the you oh man he made such an impact or in in you you basically did say basically your flu is a big giant roaring fire right now you've gotta you've gotta get that doused but once you do or the balance of nature with the nutrition from the fruits and vegetables can put out those sparks much more quickly\nAnd I found that to be true because then the next year and a half or so since I've been on the product\nI have not had any a serious re occurrence of bronchitis and when I when I feel like something starting to go up the dosage take a few more fruits and vegetables for a few days under the directions you gave me and it has worked every single time including as recently as just a couple of weeks ago\nAnd a Dr Howard or some some of your best success stories are people that

Howard the founder and formulate or a balance of nature in a conversation with nationally syndicated talk show host Kevin ...\nThis is a conversation you don't want to mess as they discuss variety of important issues related to house I want you to ask yourself how can better nutrition improve my life\nIs often said that a medical doctors and the in the world of medicine are very suspicious of nutrition and nutritionist and by nature to be somewhat suspicious of medicine\nAnd the truth is there may be need for both in wisdom is knowing the difference between the two\nMaybe they were trying to pull a short cut on you and they've they've tried to take shortcuts with your process and it's actually sometimes cost you a little time energy and money but you've been ... oh a a passionate about making sure that the process taste pure the product stays pure and that it does what you said an invasion from the beginning talk about\nThat and and when I start time that I'm an invite likes to come on the microphone was sure because there's some experiences that I Want him to to share with us on this [noise]\nIt's interesting as you can imagine through the years we have had company up on company come in and talk with us and I had a dear friend actually come with his dad early on and they saw the possibilities here and\nAnd they came in and they they wanted to invest in to us and so then I sat down and they said so what's your exit strategy how are we going to make money on this and I said\nMy exit strategy is is the epitaph on my on my tombstone is says made a difference in this world and changed lives and quality that literally that is my answer to that sure we just couldn't ever get it together and there's and Lex got the experience of seeing many times for example I'm just going to put it out there but that\nPeople wanted us to do a multi level time after time and companies that wanted us to and then we would sit down 'cause yeah I mean we needed to make money and we need to be running through the bad times\nDidn't start out as a business you started this as a way to help your patients so that isn't the side of it was something you had to get a learning curve on and grow and kind of shepherd from day one this is not something I never thought I'd be doing right I Love\nPractice I Love people and so so as we started doing this do people started you know coming out of the woodwork and it's interesting that people then we would say no there's some there's a ... a major\nThere's a major health food chain that wanted to do something was but when they\nThey wanted us to change it everyone every single time they want us to change it\nEvery single time they wanted us to to cheapen it because it had to be cheaper anyway there was this one multi level that they were doing something and then in some third world countries and helping people when they said you know if they get to these it's better than having to to cap so this is better than nothing and they started to convince me to some things like that and so\nWe started talking with them came down to the line\nWhen they were they had already a multi level business they were doing they just wanted to replace it with a slugging play yeah\nAnd so we found out they were paying how much how much like was it that they were paying her bottle for those vitamins a dime\nA dime and they were selling them for sixty dollars ... and and and so when and that was from the manufacture of other manufacturers are making money too that's right that was their prize they weren't even making themselves\nAnd they were then they they just had a good story they were telling these people that they would become into financially independent and blah blah blah when it came down to it they found out that over half of our costs are actually in the broader [laughter] they were like whoa whoa whoa we can't do that where you got to do this or that and that's when they came you know how about two and a captain\n... obviously we could never make it work\nOne of these guys that that was doing this one's funny just wanted to make something work\nAnd we even fluid flown out with our attorney because we thought something was going to work with this and everything and and and it just and then it got down okay so how are we going to make it cheaper and as I I won't change the product I won't change what we do we won't do that these are the studies I have this is why it works is how it works I won't change it we're about changing lives\nAnd if if you could sit in fact I invite you Kevin come and sit in on one of our our staff meetings and just to hear on the phone is one thing that you should come and sit and see the tears shed by some of our our health coaches when they tell the stories of who they help to this week\nThat is what our staff meetings are about ... they talked about their successes\nAnd we share them and we and\nThat's what we are and so any ways that we actually produce our own product we've tried we have tried to to get it out because we we thought it'd be easier working with government entities and things that that it would be easier to do that way\nTheir quality could not pass our standard right we wouldn't send it out we literally would not send it out I said you know give me those bottles I'll take them home and eat 'em but I'm not going to send those out to people\nThe or the fact that there's such a high standard in the a product that's in your capsule and the content of what's in every bottle a is really\nUnparalleled and so it's one of those things friends where when you get in and Dr Howard says this and the commercials on a regular basis but when you when you when you pop open the plastic live the bottle and then you pull the the sealed foil seal off

G. S. S. dot com and\nIn ...\nAnd welcome back to the program ladies and gentlemen you're listening to Gary Goldberg on money matters as as I indicated ah my next guest is an independent economists a well known individual who you probably have seen on CNBC over the years\nHe was formerly a fund manager at invesco he's a market strategist and my curiosity as to how the markets are going to be reacting going forward as piqued my interest so Fritz Meyer is my guest Brits good day to you by Gary thank you for having me here\nI a as a money manager I'm frequently asked Gary what do you think the market's going to do\nIs the most common question and it's also one of the silliest questions because of I truly new I'd be sipping ... under a palm tree at a visa so let's talk about\nBetween you and me to professionals with a lot of with a lot of experience between us\nLet's talk about what's on people's minds should people be concerned about the market because there's a lot of noise out there about the market is going to run into real headwinds what's your opinion as a market strategist\nWell I'm ... as you said it's a it's a it's a fool's errand to try to predict what the stock market's gonna do in the next twelve months or even twenty four months\nBut what we can do is look at the history of stock market returns and that's so important um in the inside of your longer term expectations are because what we see in common stocks is that ten percent\nCompounded annually in round numbers is the magic number for common stocks and that's over two hundred years of us financially\nThey ... so over two hundred years people have gotten total returns of ten percent now is that on their portfolio or from the stock market portion of their portfolio\nThat's a great point the stock market portion of the portfolio whereas bonds act as an anger to wind word however in the car the environment bonds are going to be very difficult or as a as a a return vehicle so\nIf the bond market is currently let's say paying two and a half to three percent somewhere in that vicinity\nAre and yields are not going to be doing well going forward from what I can see which is why we don't have our clients and bonds are you saying that investors have to make it up by being invested in stocks and staying fully invested\nStaying fully invested in common stocks for the long run is the key to achieving your retirement goal now back to your point on bonds if you can get three percent on a U.S treasury today\nUm that compares to the ten percent long term and common Sox however\nIf bond yields do start to rise which most economists are expecting one of the European Central bank finally\nBacks away from quantitative easing in that environment because of bond arithmetic you could be looking at close to zero returns in bonds or the near term and that makes stocks long term returns just that much more attractive\nSo they become more attractive or the more difficult to achieve I Would think not because with tax cuts and with the opportunity to reinvest that money that is being brought back from Europe and the fact that tax rates are lower for corporations\nAnd these are buying back their own shares so should people not be frightened for the next year or two about a major decline in the market in your personal opinion for its mar\nAh yes I I what you said it was correct at least my personal opinion is that the Federal Reserve in the end will determine when this ah economic expansion comes to a conclusion that's been the history of the fed with\nRatcheting up short term interest rates historically has engineered every single recession post World war two I personally think the fed is a long ways away from wanting to slow this economy materially I think they're going to be very attuned to what their short term rate hikes\nAre have accomplished so far and what they are are are apt to achieve a and the next couple of years as we go to three percent on the fed funds target rate\nAt our from we are big fans of dividend paying stocks we also like variable annuities because of the um sequence of return risk that's taken away from an investment portfolio can you elaborate on those two categories\nThere's a well known guy who's been appearing on TV or who has been trashing annuities I completely disagree with that I think annuities are one of the key ways in which investors can ensure\nA they're a long term or at achieving their long term economic goals\nOne of the most important things is to ensure against a bad sequence I'll retire and so what that means as you are tired today at age sixty five what if the stock market took a twenty five percent hit and that's the first year in which you have to withdraw fifty or Seventy five thousand dollars to live\nThat puts you in a big hole right out of the box in it and uh and I knew it in a variable annuity in particular is a way to ensure against that\nAs far as the evidence over the years that has been a big favorite of ours your opinion on a new a on a dividend paying stocks\nI think the core of any investment portfolios should consist of high quality dividend paying stocks where you've seen growth in the in the devil and pay out and if you look at the long term contribution from dividends to total stock market returns it's absolutely incredible over the last Thirty years evidence have doubled\nThe total returned from the price index alone\nHow much impact will they change mean to the stock market if the Democrats are suddenly take control of of the house\nThat's a great question I excuse me\nI I think uh the midterm elections probably don't have much effect on the economic outlook after all the tax cut was the biggie and uh this is ... those tax cuts aren't going anywhere as long as this administration uh it is here and that's another couple of years the gift that keeps on\nGiving as the tax cuts I think so I agree with you by all means um Fritz I Wish we had more time perhaps on another time you can or a visitor with us again I have just spent about an hour with Fritz Meyer and as a person who majored in economics and college I certainly respect\nA fellow economist of\nBrits Myers quality and um I Hope you found this interesting it was very quick Fritz but that is because a certain time limitations but\nYour knowledge is extremely welcome at our

gaggle bark than actual services now for\nYour free comprehensive review at eight hundred three seven seven five seven five seven today\nHow do you have a thirst for jump to becoming an entrepreneur but you didn't quite know how to pursue that dream like an relate to you because I was that individual\nFor decades ago I started a company with five thousand dollars of my own safety and I achieved real financial success\nThis is the third rate hike of the year um the eighth since the feds started to raise right the late twenty Fifteen that all indications are that will get one more this year likely December\nAnd that the fed themselves projecting between two and four more a hike in twenty Nineteen so you know bottom line is a interest rates are going to continue to go up um and at this point yeah these gradual quarter point baby steps\nIt's the right thing given where we are in terms of the economic fundamentals um yeah the U.S economy is still doing extremely well with the exception of the housing market\nUm doing extremely well um and so you know we don't need those ultra low levels of of interest rates anymore\nBut the cumulative effect of these right axis is starting to come out and yeah I Do think that that's one of the head winds were going to confront a in terms of the stock market so the next twelve months or so in that\n... you know as as those interest rates come up you know this this market that was called by the name Tina there is no alternative now all of a sudden as interest rates come up dusters a start to see that you know what maybe there is an alternative particularly when they get a little bit is a little bit squeamish about risk\nOkay so let's talk about Tina T. I. N. A. there is no alternative there is an alternative and that has been David and paying stocks and a lot of people have made money by not investing in the\nBond market we have avoided the marketed are from the bond market it off from the choose you have it in paying stocks there is potentially a juncture point were bonds become attractive as Greg you have just pointed out\nI personally don't think if that juncture point is reached people will abandon dividend paying stocks which are a cornerstone of growth on a person's portfolio going back to Nineteen hundred so the bond market I don't think we'll ever replace quality dividend paying stocks your opinion\nI agree one hundred percent um and you know I'm invested that way myself personally I I Do think that the ah areas of the market that are going to be most susceptible to a pull back under that scenario are going to be these high octane ultra girls' names that we've seen that ah you know are really trading it nose bleeds valuations\nAnd don't pay those dividends um they'll Devon ... stocks\nOr which show of trail the market here to date um they provide a great question when the market's going the other way or the or the other benefit is you know through thick and thin you know a lot of these companies that have paid dividends for decades they have a track\nOf increasing their dividends or every year even and economic downturns that provides great the inflation protection for investors who are relying on the income that they get from those dividend banks' stocks\nWere a lot of our listeners have never taken in economics course in their life and they hear about the um\nYield curve being inverted lead you and I try to make it as simple as possible you take the lead what is in inverted yield curve and simplistic terms and what is the concern that an investor would have if any\nIn a normal environment short term interest rates would be lower than long\nTerm interest rates because he was a as the economy continues to grow inflation will desire to investors would come in higher returns for tying up their money for longer periods of time relative to shorter\nField let's be specific Greg so if long term rates are currently let's say three percent and short term rates or two percent I'm using this as an example what is a concern that an individual would have if all of a sudden the short term rates and long term rates cross over what would be the impact\nWell they the risk of there is that it's often a harbinger of recession and the reason why is it that yield curve invert save those short term rates move above long term rates\nAnd it puts a cramped in lending a that it becomes more profitable for banks to just invest in short term securities than it is to actually lend money out at those lower long\nTerm interest rates and credit is really the lifeblood of economic\nExpansion so you know that's how the dominoes fall the that signal of inverted yield curve as predicted every recession for the last forty years\nAnd the other thing that's also happened to be over the last you know certainly last couple of recessions a is every time people say well yeah but this time it's different this time it's different and you know it hasn't been different so uh I Would caution people\nThat was the this time is different are the most dangerous words in finance and you know I'm already hearing that phrase being trotted out again\nSo let's be against specific so banks borrow let's say three eight zero percent they landed four four and a half percent on mortgages and order loans and the rest of their spread which is why the financial sector has done well\nHas really line their pockets so if short term rates go up significantly which the fed controls\nThe fed does not control longer term race they control short term rates so short term rates go up significantly you might find banks less apt to make loans to bar was for mortgages and car loans at a lower rate\nAnd that is to be aware that economic risk comes in that's where it becomes a harbinger of future economic downturn because for the economy to grow a ... to continue to expand\nThat pipe line of credit whether it's to consumer borrowers to businesses um two municipalities whoever or that and the credit is really the lifeblood of of of an economic expansion if that lending doesn't happen uh it really ah you know detracts in a big way from economic growth\nSo there is the lesson and economics one oh one because you want to see\nThat banks continue to win because they don't win for new homes yes wide Home Depot doesn't sell as much caterpillar doesn't use the machinery to build a more houses and I can go on and on the ripple effect though the rock in the pond\nWe'd have a deleterious effect to our economy and could cause a recession now to be clear this is not on the horizon but Greg as you pointed out all prior recessions going back forty years has resulted in what we just described\nAnd that's one of the reasons that people uh uh you'll try it out that phrase of this time is different is because that is inverted yield curve\nShould that happen it's a leading indicator of recession that often happens when times are still good\nPeople then dismissed that as a signal and then you get a couple of years down the road and that and the recession happened so to your point is is not something that's on the immediate horizon but should that yield curve invert it sends a dominant signal about where the economy might be Eighteen twenty four thirty six months down the road\nIf anybody wants to learn about interest rates about mortgage rates about wonderful articles relating to the economy go to a bank rate dot com Greg McBride has written any number of articles that I follow and Greg once again thanks for your appearance here on money matters\nIt's always a pleasure thanks so much Carrie you're\nVery welcome Greg thanks so to wrap up my discussion with Greg McBride I just want to give you my own view the fed of course could derail the market but I Believe it's a way off their latest comments a week ago we are not\nConcerned about inflation that means they can just gradually raise interest rates the fed would raise interest rates aggressively to slow down inflation\nThey are not concerned about it you should not be concerned about it I Am not concerned about it uh Gary Goldberg financial services we are not concerned about it if you want to have a discussion with me one eight hundred three seven seven five seven five seven my next
