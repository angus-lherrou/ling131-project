broke out about one forty five this morning in a five story apartment building on first avenue between eleventh and twelfth street\nTwo hundred fifty firefighters responded to the\nFire very intense producing thick black smoke the big concern is the smoke so five buildings have been evacuated and the east side community school it's been ordered closed no word yet on the cost of the fire but firefighters think it may have started in a sushi restaurant on the\nThe story of to kill a mocking bird is a story a small southern town what it was called make coal Mississippi I Believe a black man named Tom Robinson was accused wrongly and falsely by a white woman of raping her\nAnd he didn't do it but the town was up in arms about it because this young white woman said that Tom Robinson a black man had raped her\nSo they put together a trial and everything and they were going to Lynch I'm the one should certainly Democrats looming around outside spool enough rope get ready to Lynch Tom Robinson 'til at is Atticus Finch came along and he wanted to do the right thing and teaches kids a good moral lesson in the process\nAnd he's one of the great heroes American literature Atticus Finch and I'm looking for Atticus Finch and the story because I the way my mother raised me in this society I was raised in\nThere are two kinds of people in the world the kind that see a Lynch mob doesn't want to join it and then there are the kind that see a Lynch mob and want to stop it\nAnd I'd like to be part of the group that wants to stop the Lynch mob because the truth is that if Brett Kavanaugh jumped on Fifteen year old\nChristine Blasey Ford when he was Seventeen and scared the bejesus out of her well that would be a terrible thing\nBut I've got a whole lot of reason to not believe that that happened she said it happened I Believe that she believes that it happened\nI don't know whether she came to this conclusion and repressed memory therapy which seems to me would be one of the first questions that should be asked about where weeks into this now and nobody has gone through the ABCs you know they've investigated in a product of logical sort of way Brett Kavanaugh and his past\nExamining his high school yearbook and Senate committees with idiot\nSenators pointing to doodles\nWhat his booth thing what is I don't know how to pronounce that what is what is Bruce ... at something you apparently doing your office with your staff on a regular basis senator but you know in the in in my high school mind at that time it was a reference to flatulence and this is what they're covering view\nI don't know if it's a book or boost how do you pronounce that I don't know how do you pronounce it senator or you're the booth for in the room you well you go ahead and figure it out yourself but he's part of the Lynch mob that was Sheldon Whitehouse he as dumb as a doorknob that guy\nAnd um and then other money to all this other stuff now and again the the second one we've got this I'm\nJulie sweat Nick whose boyfriend has now come out a former Democrat candidate for Congress\nAnd said that her own father is what next own father said that she's too crazy to we're kind of Democrat house campaign crazy nuts her own father according to her ex boyfriend a democratic candidate for Congress at one point and he told her that she enjoyed\nGroup sex with multiple mad at the same time that's what they told me he said he's got to be believed because he's a Democrat that's why the New York times just didn't cover the story the most insidious power at the news media has the power to ignore\nThe New York times is ignoring the story the Washington Post is ignoring the story NBC ABC CBS CNN MSNBC they're ignoring the story because it doesn't help the party line but it looks pretty darn credible to me and he of course some\nThis this letter the former Democratic candidate to Congress Dennis cat her who was a weatherman for channel seven in Washington DC for many years I remember him being the weatherman on channel seven in Washington DC\nIs no longer but he used to date\nJulie sweat Nick [noise] who explained to him that she enjoyed group sex with lots of man and her now this is the problem I think when she's one of the kids are\nShe shouldn't be kicked to the curb she's a joke you shouldn't pay any attention to hurt all that that she just she was just one of our callers pointed out yesterday while she was doing an interview with will obey or Kate Snow or whoever she was smiling and laughing and batting arise while talking about her own gang rape which doesn't make any sense\nIn any context and certainly not in the context of the last couple of weeks Alan Dershowitz said that have Julie sweat lodge you should be tried for perjury and go to prison I think the church is trying to destroy someone would fall so it's I think it's pretty clear\nAt this point nobody even knows Julie sweating\nShe gave foreign names to NBC News when they did this big blockbuster interview with her which they said they couldn't confirm anything that she said but they went with it anyway because they're on the team\nAnd they're here to take a\nKevin out down there part of the Democrats effort they said that sweating it gave NBC News for names two of them they got a hold of them they didn't get back to NBC News one of them said she'd that they had never heard of joy sweat neck and the fourth was dead which makes it hard to get any confirmation out of that one\nAnd a trip to believe her as a joke so boom kick that would just check that box throw it out the window that's a joke\nAnd then you've got the second one the ah Ramirez woman from ... who says that he ... the New York times looked in it they interviewed at least three dozen people that's thirty six people\nSeveral dozen people they said at least many of whom told the New York times that they had spoken to ms Ramirez in the proceeding week\nBecause you know the New Yorker had been talking to her and they had been shopping the story around to various news outlets that would publisher and only the New Yorker bit because what do they care and what what are they a news organization or something there'll be ridiculous and um the New York times said they talked to a bunch of repels that she had spoken to Justin the day's proceedings\nAnd that she had told her old friends that she couldn't remember who it was ...\nWhen she was a freshman at Yale but then she said what the heck after talking to my lawyer in spending six days thinking about it I'll go ahead and tell the New Yorker that was Kevin Oh so you can forget about her because she has no credibility as a joke just throw these people out there or you don't have to be a lawyer that you're just play one on the radio and it's good enough\nAnd then you're back to of course a doctor Christine\nBlasey Ford than her accusations are allegations\nAnd President Trump a battered her a bit last night with some uh stuff that didn't make\nThe Democrats and by the Democrats on the news media very happy\nPresident Trump let's actually go to President Trump since where here\nAh and President Trump last night or what is what does that start number nine [noise]\nUm he was talking about Kevin Oh this is the big rally or last night President Trump\nWhere a man yelled I Love you and President Trump responded I Love you to you're not really my type of but I Love you\nAnd that was fun a President Trump that the big rally last night\nTalking about why the Democrats hate and that's apparently the right word it it will suffice anyway\nHey Brett Kavanaugh fitness is also part of their crusade which has been ongoing for many years\nTo make all things normal appear abnormal while simultaneously or making making all things abnormal up your normal I mean that's that's their program that's it and to subvert the constitution and of course the will of the people whenever the opportunity presents itself\nDonald Trump last night talking about the Democrats and their relationship with judge Brett Kavanaugh\nFor the Democrats [noise] no I Know they really know how to do is a strong resist the Marlins destroy and delay [noise]\nThey've been dry judge Kavanaugh said\nBecause now you know judge Kavanaugh will follow the constitution as [noise]\nThat they don't want that to happen that can be a big problem for them the constitution that's a quite a nuisance\nTo the left wherever you go big problem President Trump then\nThe news media went after he did point out a few things about Christine Blasey Ford's um memory issues I think it would be fair to say that she has memory issues and since this entire fiasco is based on a test of her memory\nI think it is relevant and valid\nTo suggest that questions about her memory are hurting inch to uh what we're talking about here and a President Trump last night\nThirty six years ago this happened I had one [noise] right I Am [noise]\nWell is it goes you know it was one day I'll do it\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want to go I don't\nKnow [noise]

empty cardboard box of ... next year she bragged about the shirt and a again and again ...\nBut ah Jeffrey Goldberg didn't ask any of those questions because he's a boot lick that's why he didn't ask any of those obvious follow up questions on you tortured women that your husband raped how can you sit here with a straight face in front of a funny journalist like myself\nWho is actually just a ... for for the Democratic party and peddle this stuff you embarrass me huge humiliate Jeffrey Goldberg she literally is humiliating Jeffrey Goldberg by throwing these things out there knowing that he doesn't have the guts\nTo say anything because he's he wants to be invited to Martha's Vineyard 'cause he's a book lick and this is how this works\nHe's sucks up and then they from a few crumbs off the table when he's satisfied Oh thank you sire backs away borrowing and scraping like the\n... to that is and I'm a last caller tore tore throat was busy in the middle of stuff but he's talking about how the Democratic party today as like feudal times medieval times\nAnd they have their lords and they do and they and they believe that they have the powers of deities like rock Obama he can slow the rise of the oceans and that was the moment when the planet began to heal ... you're talking about hubris it's the Caesars never late\nAnd to the things that ... and the swooning crowd including Jeffrey Goldberg and his fellow travelers just ruining\nAnd then of course you go down they start these these they're like profits and they have the powers of profits and this was what was talking about you're going down the line to the Schumer's you're kind of lords of the manner and and the crooked and they'd butcher people instill all their stuff\nAnd that's why you need the magnet credit
