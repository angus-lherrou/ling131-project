person to a Trump hater\nAnd that's worthy of note if you watched NBC News and I watched NBC News last night\nOn the television network news broadcasts at six thirty or whenever it was and they had at least two stories with two different reporters reporting on the incident from from uh Pittsburgh the massacre from Pittsburgh and\nAt no point did NBC News bother to mention although they talked about him that the killer I like to use their names as infrequently as possible\nThey talked about the killer they talked about his social media profile and never once did they mention all of his anti Trump stuff they just left that out they studious laid deliberately after a serious contemplation and discussion presumably in an editorial meetings certainly in an editorial setting\nThey discussed the fact that this guy was a big Trump hater and believe that Trump was controlled by the Jews and the international conspiracy and that he's a globalized and he's not really America First and that's what this psychopath was riding on like\nThe news media has conveniently air brush almost all of that out at NBC News air brushed all of that out I watch MSNBC this morning they were not talking about his anti Trump proclivities because that you know a rains on their narrative their narrative is that this is all President Trump's fall\nForget about that moving the embassy to Jerusalem move forget about

Manhattan real estate development and finance which both of which might be considered to be kind of Jewish rich environments for about forty five years or so President Trump involved with with ... that says business that's why it's called\nBut now they're calling it an anti Semite because a psychopath went into a synagogue and murdered eleven people and shot six more\nSo it must be Trump's fault but you have to keep in mind of course that\nThat hurricanes are Trump's fault that wind speeds or Trump's fault that rainfall Trump's fault that when George Washington university multiplies the number of people killed by two hurricanes and Puerto Rico\nThey multiply it by forty six they take the actual number of people killed they recorded number of people killed\nMultiplied by forty six call it science give it to the news media and um and then say Trump's fault this is what they do and this is honestly the moments the or that the nine eleven call went out on Saturday\nIn America I

for the Democrats costs because this is one of the things they want to bet they want to ban\nSo that they look at everybody looks at this through the prism of politics now and I was discussing this earlier this morning my friend Marty and I are going back and\nForth texting on Saturday talking about how sickening it is that that we now have to go through this vulture process the\nThe the culture of vultures\nAnd we have to pick this tragedy apart\nAnd assigned political blame because there are men terms coming up and that's sick that is a cultural sickness it's a political sickness it's a media sickness it's sick it's it's inhuman it's appalling\nAnd a and I'm disgusted by it and honestly I came in this morning saying I I mean this is not a ... the whole all blamed thing of the older Democrats win this because there's an air Fifteen because he's an anti Semite although he's a\nTrump paid her so the news media just air brushes that out of the reporting they just air brushed that out of the story these are Trump paid her well you say no he's a he's on this right wing website that it's an alternative to something and and he said hateful things on there and\nEdited and people say hateful things on those sites all day long which is why I don't really go to those sites and don't do those things\nOne of the reasons anyway but they look to tag Republicans ... with the guilt of this person and Trump in particular\nWhich they now claim they they now claim President Trump is an anti Semite I I really haven't seen a lot of that in a climbing is an anti Semite with the Jewish

Inquisition\nI'll leave Mel Brooks out of it and the last week of September or various media outlets released a poster depicting Asia hottest\nBlending into a crowd wearing a white T shirt and jeans as concert go as goers face the strange a faceless age rather the jihad or scripts a grenade in his right hand\nWe have prepared for you what we never ... never crossed your mind for our goal is to horrify you and terrorize you and harm you know I don't know why you know this is I think another case of Islamophobia I think that's the Islamophobia that the\nSecretary general of the United nations was referring to there\nAnd by the way it last night in Los Angeles California Riverside California at least seven people in riverside California where shot\nDuring a Halloween party at a nightclub early Monday morning it was late night Sunday night police said the shooting happened just after midnight three am eastern time at\nSub via night club in ... it's not Seville with an e but they have an a on the sub v a night club in riverside during the club's\nFirst purge event based on the two thousand Eighteen film where crime is made legal for twelve hours another Hollywood contribution to our culture\nThe riverside police department said all seven people were hospitalized with non life threatening injuries glasses are bracelet and other items were scattered on the ground outside the riverside nightclub\nAfter the shooting officers arrived and located to victims suffering from gunshot wounds the victims were transported to a local hospital received medical treatment an additional five victims later arrived at local hospitals to receive\nMedical treatment for gunshot injuries suffered during the shooting\nAt the nightclub now they're all apparently going to live and that's good news seven people shouted a nightclub late night after midnight I'm not even a remarkable story at this point and and if their\nPolitics ... was there an hour Fifteen because then the Democrats would be interesting is there something they wanted to ban because you know\nYou know that's you know\nSo we're whereas the audio were starting with Michael which is number four team um odd but we're we're going to do the other things silly pets All right okay if you say so All right we'll go back to mow Yarborough um oh I'm Sorry this is the this okay\nI I Want to touch on the caravan thing we've got a couple of care of things got some caravan\nAh looks like we've got us a convoy mo Yarborough I guess he used to claimed to be a Republican but boy when he let's go let's go he's like had like a total sex change operation when it comes to party I hear things locked off I think to become a Democrat\nJoe Scarborough this morning I'm Talking about the president the president has talked about the caravan and MSNBC wants nothing to do with any of that\nAd in the news of that is cooked up founding caravan story that's promoted by Donald Trump and Fox News\nMay trumped up phony caravan story MSNBC is not covering it right and he's on MSNBC\nUm so they attack the idea that the caravan is even a story President Trump tweeted this morning many gang members and some very bad people are mixed into the caravan heading to our southern border please go back you will not be admitted into the\nOut of the states unless you go through the legal process this is an invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you well that's pretty blunt for stuff from the president\nAnd a and it's the news media is outrage that the president said that there any bad people because the news media knows from aerial photos that are nothing but good people in the Caribbean and that ... brought us with the highest homicide rate on the planet earth\nIn our world\nAll of a murderer stayed at home I Know I saw it on MSNBC well I didn't really see it on him and so they just didn't talk about it so it didn't happen so it's not true and it's a fantasy world\nDo you want to do the Soros we got this ... thing too because now you get a lot of this any mention of George Soros is anti Semitism because George Soros is Jewish\nSo if you mentioned that he's the number one funder of Democrat Party left wing causes then you're an anti Semite this is the new Democratic Party talking point and the news media but I repeat myself\nIf you mentioned Soros and there was a tweet it was Kevin McCarthy the man who may become speaker Kevin McCarthy sent out a tweet and in that tweet Kevin McCarthy the ease that majority leader in the house\nUm he um a maid mentioned before this week at a George Soros\nTom Sawyer and Michael Bloomberg funding left wing causes now left he said aha all three of these people are Jewish therefore this is another example of anti Semitism\nAnd Tom ... father is Jewish but his mother's not Jewish so technically it's not you know legally and the Jewish faith Jewish 'cause his mother's not church\nFurthermore he has raised as a Presbyterian not Jewish as father or I don't know if he's practicing a Jew or not but I think not\nIn any case Tom ... was raised as a a Protestant his mother is um a Protestant or you know as a non Jew and a gentile and uh and his father is Jewish but now he's claiming the Jewish victims\nThings so he can be a victim because the country is made up of two groups of people\nThe victims and the villains and the Democrats in the news media gets to decide who are the victims and who are the villains they're they're all the victims every everybody on their side as a victim there for everybody else as a villain 'cause somebody's got to be victimizing here this is why whites\nIn terms of race has become a pejorative in America because of the Democrats why white man is a double pejorative in America because of the Democrats talk about hate speech it's hey they're attempting to marginalize\nUm you know white males as straight white males if you're gay you're okay but if you're a straight white male then you're a villain and everybody else has your victim because you know beep and beep\nBeep beep beep beep yeah\nAll right so ... this morning he's got this um as I said it's amazing and and the president or a tweeting that there's there's some people out there saying that Soros\nIs funding the caravan now I don't know whether judge throws funds the um Web blows in frontier us I'm guessing it probably does 'cause he finds all this stuff but if he does not is funding the organizers of the care of it I Can't personally speak to whether George shores sends money to\nWeb blows seeing frontier us that's people Without Borders well countries have borders people generally don't have borders but countries do you can respect ours are or not but uh each decision comes with consequences mo Yarborough\nMembers of Congress attaching that\nAh it didn't George Soros him and making it sound like again an anti Semitic pro that a Jew Mika was somehow responsible for buying these people and having them march ... say\nAnti anti immigrant rhetoric or anti refugee rhetoric that same sort of rhetoric used again by the mass murderer\nThe mass murder\nThat's right because that Hitler or this weekend's mass murder because I I could play audio for they talk about the hate speech and so I play all day all day long of these people are calling the president Hitler and and all of that stuff\nRight and then we have the Fox news saying let's let's go to and this is a a drift drift Jenkins who is interviewing over the weekend I think it was Saturday\nHe's a they're in the mix with the caravan coming north they uh the the ... and and he stopped to talk to a guy and he's speaking Spanish so there's a translator\nAs you might imagine and it turns out that this guy used to live in the United states and uh then somehow he I think he left because he was wanted by the police\nFor attempted murder and he fled but now he's walking back in with the Caribbean and CNN support says efforts fully and there with him all the way they want the attempted murder to come back to the United states so that he can shower with your daughter I think is what they're looking for\nAre you willing to break the law\nTo get back to the United states you'll get ... she says he wants to apply for part of the tiny he committed can you ask him exactly what happened\nOn one point that's a thing on the air\nI think at least ... day and my dad [laughter] just minor\nNumber three I like I said I Want to know what number one and number two or does he says number three is that it is it's got like a menu of crimes which ones did you commit a number three number three is attempted murder I I'm I'm On that in the United states for attempted murder\nJobs this would be perfect for them they like to watch\nLike John Gardner I got up Louis
