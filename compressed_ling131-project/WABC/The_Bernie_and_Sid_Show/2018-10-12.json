to evacuate\nPeople were not going to school buses to evacuate the building fact we're going to leave those below water level and let them be destroyed or we're going to stay in party we're going to

the federal government in and she screwed up everything completely botched everything meanwhile helicopter as a coast guard and so on rescuing people all over the place National Guard\nFederal government action and um and then they wanted to blame George Bush for the hurricane they wanna blame George Bush where are the Democrats not evacuating\nThey wanted to blame George Bush for everything that I wanted to call George Bush or racist so so ah cognac came out and he helped with that caused George Bush doesn't care about black people George Bush doesn't care about black people ... that was the uh that was a ... a to point out now we're on eight point nine or something like that\nAnd that's fine but then you may remember last year the hurricane that went through a Puerto Rico and the Democrats decided that they would try to make\nDonald Trump out to be a racist because a hurricane hit Puerto Rico and it worked so well with Katrina in New Orleans that they just try it out that old play and rented against Donald Trump oh you're rich you don't care about brown people and then you may remember what was the number sixty four people were killed in the hurricane\nUntil in Puerto Rico up until George Washington university some thirty two and a bunch of white liberals inside the beltway they've figured out how many people really died in Puerto Rico during hurricane\nAnd it was times what was at times forty six I think right it was whatever the real number was times forty six and a they multiplied and they had almost three thousand I think it was two thousand nine hundred and Seventy five that's from memory\nSo to hold me to it but I think that's what George Washington university came up with nearly three thousand dead when in reality but Puerto Rico so the sixty four that were killed\nAnd um and and and it was just it was just ... it was the playboy covered them well he doesn't care because they're about how dare Heathrow paper towels to people who are yelling throw me those paper towels and there isn't that he was very upset about that they they ... their panties over that that was just the men\nAnd and are very upset and now we've had hurricane Michael go through and I I don't know what that are still formulating the media are the response to all of this is my ... my parents about that\nBut I think they're going to have to find a way as I understand that I'm way now the I think our fish will count the number of people killed\nIn a hurricane Michael is eleven is eleven and I assume that the Democrats will go to George Washington university asked them to multiply by forty six and come up with a new number for that\nExcept here I guess we know how to count ... you know uh and I think the Democrats the soft bigotry of low expectations they think well brown people in Puerto Rico they don't know how to count will count for them what kind of get the honestly they just they hold everyone in such low regard\nThere is
