[laughter] and they definitely for their age and you know kind of where they're at in life we you know we're kind of shocked at how much they hadn't inequities which we see all the time you know how much they have any asking pie or you know in individual stocks you know in their sixties getting ready to potentially fully retire\nThis was kind of shocking though I had given\nCredit so they knew they were taking too much for it yeah right they have all their money and growth stocks which you've done phenomenally well but it was we know at some point the party stops and a portfolio like there is you're getting close to retirement starts to go down rapidly they're going to be in big trouble so they were released cognizant of the fact that they're taking way too much worse\nWhich I appreciate it like hey we know are taking ... just let us know like give us the number is basically I mean give us the whole picture so you know they knew they were taking to address but I think when they finally saw it on paper it was like well like yeah definitely you know a shock to them 'cause they're in their sixties and their Ninety three percent inequities\nYeah and that's what I Love about just that three sixty Porto would put together for them because you know that's where you really can see how the overall allocation is and then we're able to say hey guess watch and here like two thousand and eight this portfolio would have been down like over fifty percent ... who wants to see their networks if you've got two million dollars go to a million dollars\nYou know at any given year that's a buzz kill yeah you know times two or three I don't know it's terrible\nI mean if you want to lose like five hundred to a million dollars I could do something with\nThat [laughter] generally do much better time movie [laughter] and yeah just disappear\nI gotta move soon I could use that money it's like if you're just counting on losing that much any given year like yeah I handed over yes I mean that's a huge thing and not only that but there and all these tech stocks to that just got hit really hard\nFrom this raise him pull back and if you are now pulling from your portfolio and you have these individual tech stocks like your Netflix or Google you know all those things that you can get hit pretty hard and in a downturn like we just saw last week\nYeah we call it the overcrowded trade and that's when we met them before last we [laughter]\nSo now we're going to talk to them after last week's vote the first thing we said was what you've got to reduce this risk and I mean last week his case in point Ryan seen tech stocks because they've gone up so much typical in the market goes down they go down and much more it's the same kind of magnitude on both sides\nYeah and you know they have no protection in there so they have no bonds they've no certainty they have no income that's going to be you know there for sure right and that's why we want to build in some bonds and some protection there and we see those downturns say you're not hit with a million dollar downturn God Forbid\nYeah yeah it just doesn't make sense for that close to retirement I mean you have to start thinking okay you know two thousand eight was ten years ago you were ten years younger you are ten years further away from being in retirement now you might be at the end of your career you might be in retirement now you've got to change the game\nYeah and even like a two thousand right we saw the tech bubble burst like right there I mean it's just\nIt's I don't remember ... [laughter] I figured you might lie because she is that right [laughter] yeah and in\nThat and then along with just planning right so let's say they're retiring now\nYou know there's all these trials as we can do between now and tell Seventy and a half or you have to take out your require distributions and they're in mostly retirement accounts so they have\nYou know Seventy five years our we can plow these distributions out and obviously if they can was ten years ago they been much better shape planting wise but now we can do all these five seven years have all the income tax planning 'cause that's important\nYeah like we sat down and money saved in taxes is just as good as any money can make invested and let's be real at Seventy and a half\nYour deferred your retirement accounts or what we call it taking tax time bomb you're forced to take money out of your IRAs and that can bump up your tax bracket so there's a lot of great planning can do before that to really believe you know that tax burden later and a lot of ways you could do it tax free which is I mean who doesn't like tax preacher id Ryan\nI really do [laughter] I Know you do [laughter] I Know it's hard [laughter]\nIt's crazy even just down you know decreasing the rest are still going to have over fifty thousand inches extra income coming in from a more secure diversified more conservative but so growing portfolio\nAnd that's kind of a magic formula if I use that word is like okay you have the opportunity for growth in your portfolio but let's create reliable stream of income that you know you have coming in every single year because there's no way\nEvery year you know which way the market's going to go and that's a terrible way to plan your retirement around hoping the market's going to go up

as the U.S\nWelcome back to our show we just heard our top success stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in an eight hundred two four six eight seven\nFive wind and an eight hundred two four six eighty seven fifty one next we'll listen to an interview that I had was Dr Douglas Howard the founder and formulate or a balance of nature [noise] this is a conversation you don't want to mess as we discuss a variety of important issues related to health I Want you to ask yourself\nHow can better nutrition improve my life he's a doctor of chiropractic he's also director of Medicine He's a leading researcher and fight on nutrition he's a good friend and he's the man who created\nThe product that has changed my family's life and so many others\nDr Douglas Howard a balance of nature hello Hi it's great to be here again it's wonderful and I'm also so very glad\nTo introduce the very original health coach of balance of nature a a a wonderful title because it's something that's so unique to this company will be getting into that as Well hi Suzy Hi Laura good to be back\nGreat to hear your voice it's become quite familiar to ah people all over the country in terms of uh encouraging people to take their fruits and veggies everyday\nDr Howard this is really revolutionary and yet it seems like the most simple concept in the entire world where did you come up with putting fruits and vegetables into a capsule I'm like\nWell actually years years of study you know it's interesting other companies now are starting to think they can catch a fad\nWe're not a fad where something that for many years of study and research and figuring out how to do this is made it happened and I always it ... me when I hear other companies now they're starting to say oh we have more fruits and veggies in ours and blah blah blah we have fifty instead of thirty one and I'm like\nThey don't get it it's not how many per se it's how they interact with each other and we're not just a business it's trying to get on the shelf and convince people we're about results\nAnd that's why we offer like you said that the health coaching for example that's why we offer that is to help people accelerate the results there's no extra fees there's no extra charge for it infects business management companies have said oh you need to get rid of that department it just costs you money no that is what we are about results\nSo people say to me off and oh I take vitamins um I don't think I Need to take you know balance of nature because I keep I I'm such an advocate now because I've seen and I'm One of those that actually feels the difference when I don't take my balance of nature I Am so sluggish and\nFuzzy and when I take it and this is literally on a daily basis I can literally see on my body pick up at night and my thinking gets clear to me so I'm One of those people and I my parents are as well because they tell me about that fact but when people say to me\nOh no I take vitamins I don't need to take balance of nature I'm telling them you you need tend to eleven servings of fruits and vegetables per day in their most potent nutritious like Ninety nine point nine hundred percent of ... like a raw vegetable almost\nAre you getting that a and B\nThey are not a vitamin and in fact you can is this not true Dr Howard you can forego some of those multi vitamins big companies put out here and just substitute it with nothing but the fruits and vegetables is that correct\nYes in fact I'm going to reverse a little bit you you don't you don't substitute vitamins just they're they're all of its there plus hundreds of thousands of other chemicals that buffer and assist those chemicals to make them work hundred fold and that's what's important about it\nWell the reason people take vitamins is because they know that their diet is substandard\nIf they were sitting down every day and eating more than ten servings and in variety of thirty one different fruits and vegetables do you think they would even think about taking vitamins no I think they would though because that's why I'm already marketed as true well and\nLet me tell you every time you extract a chemical or every time you you consume an isolated chemical there is a side effect it's one of the first things you're you're taught and pharmacology in medical school\nIs there's a side effect every chemical but in a fruit and vegetables and fruit or vegetable then there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals that counteract those negative side effects consistently and there is a side effect fruits and vegetables good help\n[laughter] so part a lot of the so called lifestyle diseases I've I've heard you mentioned before and I've read on your literature that a lot of the life style diseases that we know today can be prevented from the taking of the fruits and veggies\nOn a daily basis how and why is this\nWhat I Want to go back to one of those thing really fast is because sometimes on on the vitamin aspect sometimes there's even a point where we're help coach will be working with somebody and they just aren't getting the progress that they would like to be happening and then they find out the person is taking\nA whole bunch of vitamins on top of it somehow they missed that hopefully not but [noise]\nAnd then we'll talk to them and say you know what let's start taking off some of this other chemistry so that the ... the chemistry from real fruits and vegetables can start doing his job and they start seeing the results that were really wanting to to progress with\nThe reason being is the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables has to go in and counteract some of the chemistry that they're\nUsing the ... the extraction so they have to use some of the chemistry from the fruits and vegetables to counteract some of the effects of those vitamins that aren't necessary in the body so it actually most of the time works better without that now there's not a danger you can continue to take your vitamins if you want\nBut frequently most of the time to get a better result if you drop the multi vitamins and I just asked myself let's see which one smarter guard or a scientist ...\nFor those that are just tuning in I'm Talking with Dr Douglas Howard the formulate or of balance of nature's fruits and veggies and ... and I'm just amazed at what it is doing not only for me personally and my family but for so many others\nBefore we continue we're going to take a short break but before we do that\nLet me make sure I give the phone number so that you can receive a special discount on your very first order of balance of nature the number to call is one eight hundred two four six eight seven\nFive one that's eight hundred two four six eight seven five one or do on line to balance of nature dot com don't go away\nKnow what's beautiful a balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and it's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving of how and why does it work but the beauty of it is\nWe don't have to reinvent it every couple of years and make it special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing added and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce\nIt took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study by electron microscopes\nHow it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman of course okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat the the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies those DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell could receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where it needed and also even studies about the viscous to do the blood or in other words the thickness of the blood how flows\nThe beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels all of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things in the DNA for example how to protect it the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature\nWhen I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable the beautiful benefits of the fruits and veggies and the ... the whole health system\nAnd just so much about what good nutrition means and what\nIt can mean for everyone's like no matter what age it's\nReal pleasure thanks for being on today thank you yeah it's great to be here thank you

we just heard our top success stories of the week and I want to invite anyone listening that also has a success story to share it with us by going online to balance of nature dot com or by calling in an eight hundred\nThe emotional the mental um aspect of life plays a big role in someone's overall health\nWhat it plays a role in is your quality of life\nAnd that's what we're losing in medicine is we're ... we're we're forgetting about quality of life we don't save lives if we don't have quality left in it all of those aspects have to be\nWorked with and and your your good physician does work with that and and and you know if you've been to a physician and you walk out I don't care if they save your life to the surgery but they're rude and mean then you don't really feel real great and you might go home still depressed or whatever it is\nMore depressed or more depressed and more fearful ... yeah that's frequent and more fear that drives me crazy when\nWhen we're taught and medicine to use fear to get people to do it we want no bounds of nature we use education ... means teacher so so that people can make that choice not fear I don't believe in fear factor\nAnd the house Chad is also just magical and ... ... one wonderful thing at the health coach when you're working with people and sometimes they decided they helped ... ad that people can't face you know they're just\nThey've been working on it long enough and they're done they're like I'm given up on the physical and I can't lose weight or I Can't do whatever I'm done I'm not going to work on that anymore and so I that you had to change the health coaches that\nIf you just work on two sides of the triangle the third one comes naturally on its own so we just say okay let's set aside for now and let's look at the other two ... and ... it improves and then as things improve than they get\nMore willing to look at that site that so difficult for them so you have a health coach that takes the customers through the various ways in which the fruits and veggies interact perhaps with other medications or\nHow much you should take what time you should take them what are some of the different roles that health coach fails when they start taking balance of nature well the main goal of a health coach is\nBecause we are results based company is to make sure that our customers are getting results or you know we all there's always results with balance of nature all you have to do is take it and and we teach our health coaches that because that is absolutely true we've done the research we know that we know the results that you're getting\nOn the human ... if you'd just to swallow them but you don't always feel it\nExactly whether you fill it or not the result is their ... and you know I I Hope this person doesn't mind that I use the example of not using names anyways but just just yesterday I had a wonderful experience speaking with a man\nAnd um and in relation to what you're talking about what do we talk about with our health coaches as it's based upon the try out of help and that's what I built after five six years of practice and I started to realize and see this that\nEverybody's health is based on three factors and and a lot of people think oh I've heard this before but not this model of it\nBecause we're based upon a chemical aspect of health that's nutrition that the air we breathe the drugs everything in our body it's a chemical we are a chemical laboratory so everything's based upon the raw materials of ... of of chemistry\nAnd then then there's good and there's bad okay and then there's the physical side of help and that's an aspect we have to we have to address always and then there is at the mental spiritual emotional side of help that's all one that's not three different things\nThat's one side of your health try out\nAnd so we work on goals on all three of those sides to help people really see the greatest benefit\nAnd for example I was with somebody yesterday and ah as I was talking with him he's a good man and so one of his goals you know they'd written down be good to people do kind things for people and those are all important but I just looked at him finally I said\nYou do all those things you are that person you could just see it in him and fill it from him and finally I looked in a you know what you're what you're dealing with is fear\nBecause fear and face cannot coexist you can't have them in the same space one chases the other out and so\nWith tears he finally said you're right I don't trust I Need to change the trust in my life and he left with a new resolve to trust to trust in the process of his body to trust in the process of things to trust in people\nAnd he he will have a whole change in his life because now we're working all three sides we had some other goals of walking and being active and and and obviously was with nutrition we had a several several goals but 'til we found that one you wasn't a change person\nHe will see results now\nWe're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with more from Dr Douglas Howard answers and Howard don't go away balance of nature's fruits and veggies in a

vitamins\nI'm the founder and formulate or a balance\nOf nature Dr Douglas Howard and his wife Susan Howard Dr Howard is a medical doctor had real practical Dr\nResearcher and specialist in fighter nutrients Dr Howard what is new that you can tell us with balance of nature and and truly what do I know you do research continually you're one of those perpetual scientists\nDon't know what you're learning ... even more and more as the results come into the company about what the wonderful people who are taking this product what it's doing for them\nKnow what's beautiful a balance of nature is it's not new is the oldest form of nutrition on the earth and it's exactly what it was made for us you know yes I'm always researching and finding and driving a towel on why does it work but the beauty of it is\nWe don't have to reinvent at every couple of years and make it special a new\nBecause the formula for balance of nature has been here for thousands of years on the earth it's one hundred percent pure fruits and vegetables\nThere's nothing added and nothing taken away from it except for the water it's pure produce it took years of which fruit and which vegetable and and how they would interact with each other and studying that through and then doing studies with with the electron microscopy to different universities so they could study\nMicroscopes how it was affecting the DNA the very best and then some of the studies we were doing was how it would affect the immune system the most you remember the game pacman or okay well you've got white blood cells in there that run around like pacman going you know to to eat up the bad things\nAnd that's what those white blood cells are out there to do so we tested how many of those white blood cells could be out there to eat up the things that shouldn't be in your blood\nAnd how quickly they could respond those immune studies\nThose DNA studies and studies about how the red blood cell good receive the nutrition and receive oxygen so get out to where it needed and all too human studies about the costs to be the blood or in other words\nThe thickness of the blood how flows through the beans and can get to the smallest possible vessels all of that put together then I studied which fruits and vegetables and combining those until we had sixteen different fruits and Fifteen different vegetables\nThat made the greatest impact on those things and in the DNA for example how could protected the most and how quickly the DNA could repair itself wind damage to those are all things that help prevent aging diseases\nIt's always such a great pleasure to speak with you Dr Howard and Susan Howard from balance of nature\nWhen I find remarkable is how easy balance of nature has made it for me to get more than ten real whole servings of fruits and vegetables every day it really is remarkable beautiful benefits of ... from the fiber inside the whole health system\nAnd just so much about what's good nutrition means and what it can mean for everyone like no matter what age it's a real pleasure thanks for being on today\nThank you it's great to be here thank you lie\nDiet dot

believe the Saudi explanation\nTo your monthly payment\nMay not sound like a lot twenty four hundred dollars for a lot of people it is but to the bank it really maybe a lot because they have their criteria can you afford a three hundred thousand dollar loan based upon what you're earning if you're now going to have an extra two hundred dollars a month in payments so the ripple effect\nOf potentially a slowdown in housing a declaration of housing prices which I forecasts over a year ago if you see a Declan nation a decline in the price\nOf homes if you see less construction going on\nWhile the ripple effect of that is potentially a problem housing is the rock and the pond it employs people it employs contractors painters plumbers air conditioning people it also initiates activity and banks it also initiates business at\nThe furniture stores the Home Depot and Lowe's stores et cetera et cetera so when you see potentially a slowdown\nIn housing that is something the fed will pay attention to as a potential for a recession we are not there there is no forecast of a recession\nQuality money management firm looks into the windshield and says okay what do we have to pay attention to so one thing we are not buyers of bonds and if you are going to buy bonds by shorter term bonds\nLet them roll over I like giving in stocks if you're a listener to money matters we have the dividend buster program which raises their dividends historically no guarantee for years and years they've raised their dividends every year it's currently yielding about four percent\nAnd their

S. dot com [noise]\nAlways enjoy my conversations with an analyst like Sam Stovall economic background I uh I like to a size four of my background is\nWell we can have conversations that I think are easy to understand and yet very informative and one of the things I did not have a chance to talk to Sam about was what sectors of the market could really participate well going forward and I'm sure you want to hear\nWhat might do well no matter what the market does\nMy opinion if you're looking for growth you must be in technology if you own a large cap growth fund you are in technology whether you know whether or not Amazon Apple Google net net flicks Facebook they're all in there so it's technology something that you should be frightened about\nAs anything fundamentally changed for technology even if there was a sell off for a moment\nAs a result of the year I don't think so\nI Do not think this is the top for technology stocks\nYou need to talk to your own advisor to see if they agree if you're going to talk with me you're hearing my opinion the dynamic of technology could play out\nFor the next number of years\nAnd don't be surprised to see stocks in that sector it new highs this week we saw a recovery in an Amazon we saw a terrific earnings from Netflix we are seeing a lot of volatility in that sector\nAnd if you are a money manager and if you've identified certain sectors you want to participate in and they've gotten ahead of themselves well\nYou look at the sell off as a buying opportunity a way to get some of the hot technology stocks at a cheaper price now we are not talking about the technology stocks of two thousand the bubbles stocks\nDot com stocks no thank you I never touched them never would we're talking about the fundamentally sound companies that are driving the economy not the speculative ones they can get speculative if they get ahead of themselves so what'd you do is you wait for some opportunities to buy and then you invest accordingly\nSo valuations and technology are often criticized I don't think\nThey're unreasonable a year after the tech bubble back in two thousand though technology stock traded about two hundred percent\nOver the market right now they're trading at about thirty percent premium over the market even the fang stocks Facebook apple Amazon Netflix and Google orange that expensive relatively speaking in terms of their dollar price Netflix and Amazon are very expensive but they also have the most growth\nSo you looked at them individually you sit down with an adviser and you say okay this money is oriented towards growth this is for income is for legacy and if you are not able to withstand\nSome of the volatility well don't be in the market\nIf you have short term money don't be in the market\nBut if you are willing to buy quality\nYou can buy them at track their prices when they come down\nAnd the problems in the economy are not necessarily going to affect the technology stocks as much as some of the other sectors of the more of the market we have learned that China has inserted some spy chips into some of the servers\nThat were used by apple and Amazon and some of the others and the companies have denied the allegations but it certainly raises concerns for companies that rely on China for their manufacturing and if a apple and his other fang stock who\nAre withstand China intervention or start to do their own investment in security for themselves that could affect some of the profits but ultimately that will help that's the way you look at market volatility you don't get spooked you look at it as potential opportunities you buy when things are on sale\nAnd you sell when they're over priced ideally you can do it ideally a good money management firm can help give us a call one eight hundred three seven seven fifty seven fifty seven find out how we have manage money for over forty years on Gary Goldberg\nWe will be back with William Donald send the former head of the SEC former chairman of adding a\nFormer founder of the O.
