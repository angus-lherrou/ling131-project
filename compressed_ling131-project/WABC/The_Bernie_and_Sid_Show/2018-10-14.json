constantly scouring the globe searching for natural remedies you may have seen Christ and the doctor on a show or\nMaybe on PBS CBS and also on Fox News where he does a health segment he's been featured in New York Times and also on ABC's twenty twenty any which is joining us today to discuss not one\nBut three of the hottest nutritional ingredients out\nThere on the market today even better he's teamed up with purity today to give away a complementary bottle to everyone out there in the listening audience ... do not\nI repeat do not changed that dial\nFirst a quick introduction ... an author an educator he's fourteen books he's conducted research in over thirty countries again he's been on was Oprah and friends and Dr oz Chris welcome back to the show\nThank you so much pat it's always a pleasure to have a great conversation with you\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly it can be daunting and it was all the different supplements out there now Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different\nNatural remedies so you really know which ... greetings to look for so tell me this besides a good multi vitamin insufficient will maybe a few other things go into the street super high nutrients you've been so jazzed about leaving\nWell I'm happy to do that pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called ... they're a troll and apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigated they use in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor Rick I've been deeply involved with ... researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza ... I've worked with scientists\nIn Europe and also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientist than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit\nAnd ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nYeah Christmas is talking about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human human spiritual why did you want to combine to read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other works you caught a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all in\nSeparate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in\nGroups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually\nRetired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting reservoir or trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press and you told me the nutrition research journal in July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity\nIn whole blood get assigned to recap some of these headlines of chill me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume that don't actually\nWind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to\nExposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in the ... right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the\nRight antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue the thigh on\nSo you're taking the green tea extract you build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue the thigh on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nRight let's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on you by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula\nWould be offering free bought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human what'd you smelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most powerful super feeds on the planet\nYou can positively influence our D. N. A. maintain joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible\nHeadlines on human and tell us why you use this and we talked about this on fear a few minutes ago just patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of Kirk human with seven times greater in shorts\nOK well first of all I think while people might not know the term Kirk him and they may well note tumor rec room which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of the five thousand\nYear old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying ... and its derivative Kirk humans since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied as there's\nA couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidant we know that it\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined health so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective it helps\nProtect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that\nYou can get in a capsule and a good liquid soft gelatin capsule what you'd otherwise half to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine hundred now in this new green T. C. R. formula purity it's really about the research share with them some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to you know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brand new\nWell I especially like the liver protective heart protective\nAnd joint modifying properties of the stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact\nBlood studies show the newborn babies contain two hundred industrial pollutants in their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning super healthy very strong liver we might not think about our livers that much but we need that ... and we know that Kirk human\nProtects the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps it strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint we have in numerous ... studies showing overall improvement in joined health and relief\nAnd stable inflammatory activity better joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk him and\nI like the brain protective studies as well you know I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind and Kirk human deliver resolve this so I regarded as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware pat but most people are not going to eat enough rock tumor Rick route\nTo get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated Kirk human extract\nI didn't want to remind people to do ... to get started with a free bottle green tea she aren't purity products their unique green tea formula would see Kirk human endeavor spiritual\nFree bottle today just before Ninety five for shipping coal now breeders are standing by one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five again one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero right next to this you know Christians don't want to get to technical here but these ... accidents green tea or classified as wholly females\nAnd they really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists but didn't use green T. C. R.\nFormula there's more green tea ... human the spiritual retard plush grape seed extract ... bio flab annoyed vitamin C. you talk to me about this array of really super anti accidents poli females for this one\nWell yeah I won't say that we kind of went overkill but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here\nGrape seed extract and pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds\nThat not only do much of what I've already described but also enhanced the physical integrity of tissue\nIn the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for extra boost in antioxidant activity but also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the curriculum in in the ... the bio flab annoyed and hence\nThe overall activity of vitamin C.\nAnd vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen if we put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C.\nWe realize that we would have an utterly superior formula and just to reiterate pat I Want people to experience dynamic health I Want people to feel great this formula the green tea the our will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nNot Christian I loved this green tea see aren't combination formula and remembered GR stands for human inner spiritual loved that was his complimentary bottle today our listeners you get started for free that's great value what people expect to pay if they bought all these separate used or\nWell I think if they bought high quality products that contain these ingredients they'd be into it for about Seventy five bucks or so possibly even eighty\nSo they wind up spending appreciably more than they're going to spend on the green tea see our formula and they still wouldn't get the grape seed extract they still wouldn't get the pine bark extract the ... of the vitamin C.\nAnd Chris what kind of results people expect to see what can they expect to see a once they start taking this morning\nI think that people will feel greater joint mobility and comfort\nI think they'll feel more energy because these ingredients also help to stabilize and maintain natural healthy blood sugar control\nI think they'll have more sustained energy throughout the day and I would just suspect that people will have an experience of greater vitality when you detoxify the body when you have a more highly functional immune system\nYou just feel more energy and better overall it's kind of you know like those days when you get up and go wow I feel great this is a while I feel great formula\nNow Chris the green tea see on the street provides about\n... words the green tea in each to jump some serving plus you get the anti out to do with one of several servings of fruits and vegetables plus you get the ... one of several servings of red wine and the joint comfort\nIn brain function benefits to the human I mean the only one formula in the last two minutes to talk to me about this short cut to better health\nAnd why you want everyone listening to this program to call now\nThat complimentary bottle green tea CNN\nOkay fortunately\nThere's and the man's body of science that has been growing steadily for the past Twenty years and it's really rich science now we know that of the various plant derived substances that exist\nGreen tea extract Kirk human extract and resveratrol extract or at the absolute top of the list of protective vitality and Hansing overall health promoting compounds there just isn't anything like these\nThere in the green tea CRC our standing for Kirk human and resveratrol product in meaningful amounts people will take this product it will be rapidly broken ...\nAnd then the system very well absorbed they're going to\nFeel the difference you're going to feel energy you're going to feel more vitality or just plain going to feel better kind of more fluid and in that flow of good health so I Want people to experience that and\nGiven that they can get a free bottle I'm also not saying that put yourself at great risk and spend a lot of money has no try it free let the product speak for itself\nChris Gillum is always fascinating information we appreciate your insight thanks so much\nThank you pat it's always a pleasure to speak with you\nThere's an incredible free bottle offered today I'm sure these amazing new green tea CPR she performs well here's the deal\nPurity products right now be one of the first thousand polish today just four Ninety five for shipping which is one hundred percent refundable if you're going to rush ... complimentary bottle of green T.
