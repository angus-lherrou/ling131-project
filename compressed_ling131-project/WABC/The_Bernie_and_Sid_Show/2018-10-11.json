Kennedy or the man that shot him and they had the communist that shot him in the head Lee Harvey Oswald communists who shot John F. Kennedy and they had [noise]\nI I I think this is worth discussing it should be discussed in a political science classes and and uh there should be\nScholarly papers done on whether today's Democratic Party rock Obama Eric Holder a John Brennan\nA Bernie Sanders whether they're closer on the political spectrum to John F. Kennedy than they are totally Harvey Oswald I suspect perhaps the latter\nEvery day a new low\nEvery day a new low I mean this is what we're saying but the child rape and the quiet loads and may exposing himself a federal judge stuff to Larry go low we kick them\nThere'll be no civility until we were in power\nAnd honestly every day a new low you guys are awful I don't know if you know how awful you are you're terrible people your families don't like you know buddy lecture\nAnd Eric Holder you know they got they got they buy their lake house in their ocean house with the ill gotten gains of the abortion industry which his wife and his wife's sister\nA run in Atlanta or because they're too many black people in Atlanta so the whole family is doing what they can to reduce the black population by way of snow filling out their lives you know they got awards\nFor this thing about ... blocks for this stuff\nAnd honestly they the rhetoric that we're getting from the Democrats [noise] Twenty years ago would have been considered so extreme and show fringe and so radical\nThat nobody in the mainstream of the Democratic party would have been saying things like this and the news media would have bristled at the idea that Democrats senior government officials chief law enforcement officer\nThe head of the CIA the loser Hillary Clinton for pro repeated Democratic Party loser for president with this rhetoric this stuff would have been completely insane just Twenty years ago\nNow apparently the more than a hundred and fifty five thousand Democrats have signed an online petition pretty easy to him peach Brett Kavanaugh\nNow they still think O.
