and all that the action is out there for you Steve Perry of course a lead singer of the band joining a Tony Powell and the guy from fireside chats don't forget coming up this Sunday we five of synch porch Sunday we'll talk to you know kind of his new book is out spell check the great interview Kevin shot and card\nOh come on you can't believe that Kavanaugh's innocent no actually I Can't believe that Kevin O's and us and I I Do believe that Kavanaugh is innocent I don't believe that cabin I was at a party of Nineteen eighty something where he\nUm did the gator on top of young Christie F a blast the at the time um I I Know I don't believe that there is a I have not been convinced that as a Seventeen year old\nYoung Brett Kavanaugh jumped on a woman or girl a Fifteen year old girl and frightened her now I have not been convinced of that and it's not the mere fact that someone set it or that should convince you\nA woman who was a I think in many ways teetering\nChristine Blasey Ford has made a claim\nThat's the point at which you seek to substantiate the claim judge Kevin odd judge Kavanaugh has denied the claim quite clearly an unambiguous slick\nTherefore we have a he said she said then you go to the evidence the evidence does not support Christine Blasey Ford to the extent that there is evidence the evidence supports Brett Kavanaugh's denial out an out denial\nNot you can't prove or disprove which is why the Democrats love this kind of scenario\nWhether what he said is true or whether what she said is true\nSo once you go to the evidence then you go to your your faculties and you decide you hopefully internalized the information you intellectual lies you go through a rational process a process of thinking through the available information\nAnd you come to a conclusion and if as a juror which you have affected bleed been called upon to become in this situation if have a as a juror\nYou find him guilty and find that he should be punished based on Christine Ford's testimony lengthy testimony and her claims to the Washington Post now I mean look most of the Democrats on Capitol Hill read the a few sentences and the Washington Post and said I Believe her\nHe can't go to the court and uh that I think ought to shatter whatever credibility they senators might have had at some point early in their lives earlier in their careers\nWhen the world was young and cars were new and uh you know it's it's um it's appalling that people would ... senators who are supposed to be revered we're supposed to be respected we're supposed to be responsible adults in positions of responsibility\nSenators would read the Washington Post never meet the woman never talk to her never see a picture of her and people like Campbell I Harris say well I Believe her and she was a big smile well and that's because you're an idiot I guess you're dishonest you you can't be trusted with the position\nWith which you have been entrusted and uh and if you make decisions like that based on that then you're not a serious person and I have no respect for your whatsoever\nYou'd be willing to destroy a man's life he carefully built a career as a lawyer and a judge over the course of many decades\nAnd and you'd be destroyed because senators like Camelot Harris come out and say I believe her\nBecause I read a couple of sentences and the Washington Post today what a disgrace she shouldn't be allowed to serve on jury duty much less the Senate Judiciary committee how embarrassing for all of us that we have senators\nWith sexual reprehensible a low standards\nAnd then you have the the weeny wagging up a Ramirez woman from Yale University Yale College when I was a freshman and I think I even printed it out again today the New York times when I was a freshman Brett Kavanaugh wagged as we near my face\nYou know like Bill Clinton did with Paula Jones which Bill Clinton did with Paula Jones and uh and told her to kiss kiss it and they all love Bill Clinton they you know they had a while I'll just leave it at that\nThe New York times destroyed her credibility by investigating her claims\nAnd discovering when they called all of her friends they talked to they said more than thirty six people tried to get to the bottom of ms Ramirez claims that Brett Kavanaugh wagged as we needed her\nAnd they said that a bunch of her friends were contacted by her by Ramirez in the week proceeding the New York times contact\nAnd and and and that Ramirez told her friends I don't remember who it was then a week later after talking to her lawyer she went to the New Yorker and Ronan Farrow and that other awful person and said yeah it was Brett Kavanaugh and they were when they published it\nBut if it didn't make the threat hawks threshold for the New York times which has remarkably low standards when it comes to reporting on Republicans on on Donald Trump and on Brett Kavanaugh incredibly low standards very low\nYou know they should have sent alley Watkins out there to sleep with a bunch of guys and try to get some information because that's how the New York times gets a lot of groups you know\nHanding out sexual favors in exchange for scoops alley Watkins is her name she's a reporter at the New York times she got a promotion moved her to New York when they found out she was sleeping around for scoops it's a good deal no problem of journalism today she is she going to lose sight block\nShaped like a\nShaped like a [laughter] LA rockets and then we have the the third one come along good old what's her name with the claims of gang rape yes right Julie sweating it Julie sweating it comes out with the creepy porn lawyer and she has this affidavit for which she should be sentenced to decades in prison\nBecause she confessed to a series of felonies being of the age of majority as she was at the time when she was watching Fifteen year old's drug getting little girls and gang raping them and she didn't do anything about it those are felonies that she admitted to him that creepy foreign lawyer\nThing and then when she was interviewed about it she said well what I can really say is that I saw Brett Kavanaugh handing out red solo cups at a party\nAnd then they were standing around talking to each other that's what it boils down to when she was on camera critically porn lawyer should be disbarred and maybe I'll go to jail and then he can run for president as a Democrat from prison they can share with Anthony wiener I'm sure they have a lot in common\nAnd this is what everybody's resting their coup fees on here their their uh this is the this is the ... always a sexual predator oh don't forget he threw a cup of ice on somebody during a scuffle in a bar at Yale and Connecticut and sometime in the Nineteen eighties and they don't really have much on that\nAnd that's what they have that's what they did that so the Democrats doesn't it as a kind of um you know unstable woman from California\nWho is naturally a college professor what else what you do who who I don't know I'm afraid to fly accept what I'm not and all of the information that's come out from ex boyfriends and people that know these people that have\nUndermined their their stories or rather than bolstering their stories even people that they they refer to the news media to these people these people will corroborate my stories there for the government to these people these people were corroborate my stories and then they don't\nCorroborate their stories and so if you're buying into this you're too easily fooled you're too easily deceived and now comes the vote in fact in\nJust a short time they vote begins about Fifteen minutes Thirteen minutes they vote is supposed to begin on the floor of the United States Senate now this is not the confirmation vote this is a procedural vote that will move the process forward\nOr has to do with the ending debates on the subject of confirming Brett Kavanaugh\nAllowing for a certain number of hours and blah blah blah then it's over it's an arcane procedural vote were expecting that to begin at ten thirty I can expect the Democrats will seek to disrupt that's to deter railed backs to derail democracy and our democratic process sees\nThe Democrats are going to be bought her rent all of this has said and done\nTheir uh their faithful fanatics\nAre going to be dispirited their back we'll be broken their spirit will be crushed and when that happens President Trump should come out and uses he'll to grind them into the ground and to squirt lighter fluid all over them and set them on fire metaphorically of course\nWe should uh when this was over and it's not over it I don't want to count my chickens\nTo ah to gleefully before it's all over because the Democrats they got tricks up their slaves and they got a corrupt media working for him and they're still what were they pull it out today well does Dianne Feinstein pulling out today and the Washington Post that uh\nSome fake uh they've got they've got new fake ones but there are grasping at straws you know that he had an overdue book at the library or something we cannot have some on\nA library as a symbol of western civilization on ... and you have over do book fees is not this is not someone we allowed to serve on the Supreme Court this is a lifetime appointment they'll keep saying and ah and yeah it says it come down it's an overdue book fun OK and\nYeah he threw a cup of ice on somebody in Nineteen eighty four get over it that's okay [noise]\nUh I you know how many people I Know that are not qualified\nBased on in this criteria ... you know we had somebody calling it earlier I asked uh what are the lessons learned here and somebody called in was hanging on the line I don't think he's on

strict party line vote it was not a strict party line vote to senators crossed over\nWhat happened you might want to know Susan Collins voted yes no this was a procedural vote that ends debates on the ... cabinet nominations and starts the clock ticking thirty hours now most transpire before a vote can be taken and on the confirmation of the final confirmation so that brings us to tomorrow afternoon\nAnd a one senator is going to have to get back here from Montana or from his daughter's wedding but in the vote that just went by\nSusan Collins voted yes to move the process forward Jeff Flake voted yes to move the process forward however Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska voted no she voted against moving forward\nHide you have a democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia voted yes to move the process forward now it's not the final yes vote or no vote but it looks like you're a\nRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski who was a note today that she would likely also be a note tomorrow it would make very much sense to vote no when you're asked whether we should move it forward and then vote yes when you have a final vote so I'm going to go ahead and put on the board that Lisa Murkowski was a no\n[noise] that brings the Republican vote down to fifty because they only have fifty one vote that brings them down to fifty as long as Susan Collins wrote us from Jeff Flake votes yes\nThen ... driving all becomes a the associate justice of the Supreme Court because the vice president United States ... parents can come in and break the tie in the United States Senate because as any school child can tell you\nThe vice president of United States is the president of the sudden it kind of a strange thing\nBut that's what they call them and uh so that would bring it across the finish line even without Lisa Murkowski there is a bit of a wild card when it comes to Joe marriage he voted yes to move it forward as a Democrat but that doesn't mean he's going to be a U.S tomorrow afternoon\nBecause the Democrats are going to threaten them ... you're going to threaten the murder of his family are going to threaten the burned his house down your retina ruined his political career Joe Manchin has a pretty tough guy the drugs that are just are care if you come in and threaten them like that [noise] so that's a a a big big step\nAnd I'm a Chicago police great great place for us but I Want to see the U.S Capitol please get a little Chicago on us get a little uh you know take a little wack wack to some of these protesters were the night six Amy Schumer looking a little flushed year than the last time I saw it goes and and ... and she didn't she looked ill temps didn't she she looks like she\nShe hasn't had access to facilities for quite awhile shampoos showers things like that they're they're not the they're not really they don't they don't concern themselves so that sort of stuff too that it looked like she had this kind of a sanitation department shirt on kind of a\nKind of like that the police are nice polite US Capitol police officer came up there up there are a great police department they have their own police department police force\nAnd it's a great it's a big you know they had to sort of pick of the litter good a police department and the uh the Capitol police officer walk up to him he sure probably knowing that Senator Schumer is a smelly nice and uh so do you want to be arrested and she's like Oh yes I Want to be arrested [noise]\nDo you want to be arrested yeah yeah and all the screaming moons demolished and the ... it's like a North Korean rally\nMeow meow meow name you know there are chanting like lunatics back they're crazy people they are\n[noise] yes they are crazy\nI have many audio soundbites that I Would like to acquire they're all kinds of funds stories are going on there that are all good oh Amy Amy Schumer was holding aside when she was arrested that says I Believe Anita Hill\nThey really don't know what century they're living and do they they they they just they don't they're lost there are so lost their uh she wants to be arrested\nI Want to be arrested\nLet's go to Bob Menendez he should be in prison and he's a crooked Democrat Senator from New Jersey but there are a lot of crooked politicians and and Bob and under so they had this a phoney baloney investigation all his corruption as Dr friend in the Dominican Republic they're all big on the Dominican Republic aren't they wonder why\nAnd uh and he cursed randomly POTUS cursing he didn't like the FBI investigation he thinks it's BS lessons\nThe best in investigations of the reality is that that that is not a full a thorough investigation\nThat's just it's not full and it didn't take long enough it didn't bring us pass the mid term so that's the problem where the Senator Orrin hatch was accosted by lunatic left these who are completely insane and they tried to corner him in an elevator yeah two police officers within the U.S Capitol police officers\nAnd are these crazy shrieking nut case women\nWere were yelling at him and are waving their hands on them and stuff and a Senator Hatch getting on the elevator kind of held up his hand and went like jobs like where does enter\nOne of them and they're screaming and they're angry because that's how they do police officer and then these women are trying to get on the elevator like Jeff Flake Jeff Flake stood there and took it\nAnd I I don't think any place where the not the time and and these women are jumping their hands in the elevator doors keeping the doors open and police officer said to one of the women you're about to be arrested I'm going to arrest you are right and then she backed off a but a little little slice of what's going on on Capitol Hill with the left wing loans\nWho want to take away your Second Amendment rights you're first memorize your Fourth Amendment rights are and of course slaughter every unborn child

freaking like these mental cases and jamming their hands in the elevator door and yelling you F ing piece of that and all that stuff\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSure that's it that's a that's the new civility they do that at restaurants they got an airport they do it they do it this is the Democratic party vote for them if you want a civil war or put them in power Orrin Hatch was great yesterday actually not just in the elevator where he gave him a little bit of what for back\nBut they held a press conference the Republican leadership and uh the snap or was there and a lot of them were there or natural great though he was out as a fire I started writing stuff down as soon as he showed up\nLike I'm disappointed by democratic colleagues for what they're doing excuse for a but they're doing it\n'cause I'm I'm disappointed this this was like the old rules of the Senate of politeness and civility which are not observed by the Democrats and never have been ... modern times I'm disappointed and my democratic colleagues are that they're doing this but they're doing a\nSenator Hatch you know you got anything that disqualifies a federal judge from moving up the Supreme Court\nNone of us who said that if a judge Kavanaugh did what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people some outside people should be disqualified but after an investigation for both the committee\nAnd the FBI and the media we have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate decorations against him\nAnd we need to confirm him right away\nAnd we need to come from him right away it takes a while about the role of the Democrats and this\nThis confirmation will be a victory for the Senate as an institution the reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\nYeah well it's got a place there Schumer is office that's the place that it has there\nA Senator Hatch on I'm a I'm\nKevin ... and this is entirely appropriate the Senate should apologize to Brett Kavanaugh for this horrible slander\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate [noise]\nThat's how I judge to him for the way he's been treated\nWhich is entirely appropriate they should have an official apology from Schumer and the slime crew\nThat pulled this job off which is what it is\nCentered Chuck Grassley who will say you know I got that he's he showed up man he showed up there he uh he's he seems like an old ... ... with a long have seeds sticking out of his mouth or something but uh he made it happen and he's taken from

everything\nDuring our last hearing they said we we we ought to be having the FBI look at one person only one person ended up looking at about twelve people but they need to look at this guy and his last name is ... ... they went way beyond that they aren't satisfied they're always moving the goalposts\nAlways moving the goalposts those rascal laid Democrats and they say you remember when we first named Kevin ... the Democrat leader came out and said by hook or by crook by any means necessary we will pull out all the stops to prevent Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the Supreme Court\nI
