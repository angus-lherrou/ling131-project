is very distinguished man he's sixty four years old is Thirteen children and two young children and has been in America for quite some time you served in\nThe American armed forces even though I went to University in UK Oxford\nAnd eight years ago I had prostate cancer he approaches PSA was six thousand to administer the cancer normal PSA is four point zero for his was six thousand which is about Fifteen hundred times I\nHe's been going to some of the big hospitals in New York has been getting chemo and hormone therapy and well it hasn't worked and he's come here with pain and suffering they showed me a letter from his doctors at this facility and they said you're at the end of the road it's time to consider hospice terminal care\nFor yourself [noise] and I met with him it was pretty surprised man he had painted pain from cancer growing through the bones but I Believe he has many years to go even though they never said\nSome over to the doctor Lederman to get rid of that pain and suffering and we talk about it a lot why do we talk about a lot because it's terrible to be unpaid this terrible living cancer pain for the cats are keeps on growing and gets worse and worse [noise] every day\nAnd so actually another PHD physicists one of the\nProminent PHD physicists in New York City\nSet this man who she knows the other PHD physicist here brought them in personally on Monday\nFor evaluation and treatment of his met a static prostate cancer and our goal is to get them out of pain to kill the cancer all non invasive leave without chemo without hormones without cutting without bleeding hospital stay all our work is\nOut patient and I met with them and in fact I did we see him and have consultation and examined him get his records but as well we started treatment immediately\nBecause we try to practice what we preach which is to get our patients out of paying\nA as a pie that's what we do whether it's a PHD physicist from Oxford or someone else whoever it is we work to take care of the patient\nAnd we're talking about a woman who is Seventy years old with a uterine cancers shifts serious cancer of her uterus\nShe had her uterus removed she came with her friend shed vegetable bleeding for years you've seen but I got to college is\nAgain bleeding is often a worrisome sign weather's coughing up blood vomiting blood blood in your story for China\nTo somebody that vegetable bleeding she'll see if I got to college this year the biopsy shut her uterus removed and shit sampling of the old men temperature the dishes around the intestines lymph nodes\nAt a very big hospital in New York\nOr what is a hundred and fifty pounds she's five foot two ... exam as normal she has an do meet trio cancer serious cancer and we're re staging here to see exactly where the cancer is and how we can help or help to eliminate the cancer from growing back\nAnd that's what we do that's what we ought to do here at Thirteen Eddie for Broadway Broadway thirtieth street in the heart of New York city by the gentleman who was sixty five years old born in the Caribbean island called carousel\nHis prostate cancer's been seen that one of the biggest hospitals in New York is sixty five is a black man and I say that because the\nProstate cancer rate is one in six of the black community one and twenty three men will die of prostate cancer in the black community so it's higher than in other communities we take care of men and women and children of every community and every race every religion\nWhy do we talk about this because the instance is so high and the death rate is so high\nThat we're trying to talk about it to give people warning to come in and get checked up if you have a cancerous find that when it's early and was most curable says lots of reasons to come to Thirteen eighty four Broadway Broadway thirty eight street where we accept most insurance is Medicare Medicaid\nThis band was diagnosed seven years ago with prostate cancer is I've just said oh you could just watch it away to the\nThat was during the last administration when they said women don't age mammograms so much and mental need prostate cancer treatment even though forty thousand men a year die of prostate cancer forty thousand men a year die of prostate cancer\nThis fantasy and one of the biggest hospitals or watch and watch and watch watch watch and now they're watching this past say go up\nAnd I examined ... lost thirty pounds is cross stitch and large and he's tired of just watching the cancer grow\nAnd he came here because he wants to the most effective treatment this is the work we do as a PSA of eleven Gleason sex so PSA more than ten or Gleason more than six is considered a higher risk\nSo he's at higher risk because of his PSA being more than ten and he understands she started out at low risk and now he's an intermediate risk while they're watching him so while they're watching it but he's only sixty five years old so sixty five year old man should live at least another Twenty years\nAnd they're just watching um he does not want to die of prostate cancer he wants a treatment\nThat is highly effective that's non invasive no removal the prostate no radical surgery no hospital stay you know cutting no bleeding\nThis is the work we do and if you went to that super poop or hospital and had surgery\nFor a PSA eleven or if he had standard radiation the success rate would be about sixty percent with us the success rate is Ninety percent that's fifty percent better to go from sixty percent success rate to Ninety percent is a fifty percent improvement in outcome\nAnd that's why so many men come to us because they do that if they have radical surgery robotic surgery or most likely they'll lose their sexual life and your life\nMen who come here what to keep their sexual life Keith through your life and keep their life\nAnd that's why this man was our treatment seven years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer he's tired of watching the cancer grow he wants to be treated he wants his PSA to go to zero he wants to be cured\nAnd that's what we'll fight for that's what we do every day here at Thirteen

Lederman or back\nIf Dr Lederman with Kurdish we were talking about prostate cancer and he's the man who's lived the life\nOf not only live the life but didn't take my own advice when I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion from Dr Gilead him in because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear fried\nAnd hysteria shed and they said oh you got to get that planned out of control so much of what a man does in his life robotic surgery as your ... and I've been kicking myself in that took his ever since maybe the\nDome is decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow you've been shot up with hollow show bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat five times with ... someone was trying to kill you oh yeah and they almost succeeded but when you had that robotic surgery you said\nOh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of depends with my body\nLiquids and I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trials is I feel like a little infant who can't leave the crib and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt like wow what an idiot I was not to go to you Dr Gilead them\nIn and get that second opinion now you were shot up ... show bullets but the complications\nWhat was worse actually the removal of that prostate gland that control so much of what Amanda's in his life from simply going to the bathroom and urinating it was five times impossible to stop and other times it was impossible your day and then\nTo try to have the urge to emerge forget about it it was Michael might as well as being a unit was input tent and naturally that plays a head game on you and that you don't even\nFeel like you're a man any longer it was just a bad decision and I didn't have the guidance and I should've come right to you for that second opinion because you would have stayed me away from that because obviously it wouldn't have been surgery\nAnd I would have been able to maintain all my manually abilities and been able to go to and from\nThe porcelain palaces and we leave myself when necessary\nYou seem very angry about having that robotic surgery\nExtraordinarily angry because it's been years since she was twenty twelve and I'm Still play ... with all the problems that have resulted from that and I know they'll never get better and in fact as I age they'll probably get worse\nWere ever warn you have all these urine or problems and structural problems after robotic surgery\nNo in fact I was told surgery surgery surgery is the answer to get the Klan cut out and you'll never have to worry about cancer coming back again and then the very first thing they did just a month after my recovery was to say you got to take a PSA test I said what are you talking about we got to see if you have cats I took my prostate out they said you never\nKnow [laughter] you never know I said how come you didn't tell me that before you took my prostate out and then it just a series of situations that unfolded from being incontinent urinating too much not being able to have sex and none of it you know ... about that in advance\nYou're a man who communicate so obviously if they talked about it you would have heard of it\nNot only heard it I Would have been in in ... I Would have been asking a wide random range of questions that would have made me a doubting Thomas but they were so sure of themselves they were high fiving one another\nYou know I get to meet the anesthesiologist the rest of the team they talk about how this is safe it's antiseptic it's a robot doing it so there's no human era I mean they made it seem like I was going to be an astronaut launched into space and that nothing can go\nWrong it was more like a Powell Thirteen\nApollo Thirteen except when you recover you realize oh my God\nAs you look at the ivy the strong too and you realize you're never going to be able to go to the bathroom in the same way you did from the day you adjust a little toddler in fact now all of a sudden you're wearing a pad\nAnd sometimes it's depends and you're saying hey I understand if I was in my nineties maybe that's the result of just aging but I'm In my fifties and this is happening\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease and stroke you're in good shape and still have all these complications\nOh there's no doubt and not only would say in good shape I wasn't heavy I wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that begin to creep up on you when you start the aging process and then all of a sudden I ended up with problems as a result of prostate remove all surgery\nBecause now when your basic functions when you can't you were in eight when you can have sex when all of those things go a right not only does it affect you mentally and you'd get depressed\nBut you never know when you're going to go here in the middle of a meeting and then all of a sudden you look down at your trousers and you've had an accident and now what do you do\nRabbits sweater and wrap it around yourself and went off to the new rich bathroom and then you always carrying around it depends with you and you're saying\nWhy did I Do this to myself and my ... and he said no I'm not I'm asking is I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery is something fantastic don't\nThe hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those issues ... because you're not part of the old boy's club your independent autonomous and you've taken a route in which you're providing you'll patients\nPainless message of recovery fully remaining able to function\nAnd as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate cancer\nAnd there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing robotic how do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars have I worked on in the auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota and you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow I may be scarring these people I may be turning\nThem into a person who can no longer physically function why am I doing this when there are other remedies and why are they doing it because this is their business the U.S surge and all they know how to do is cut out your prostate that claimed that controls so much of what a man does and I would suggest to everyone out there a void that", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "New York", "day": "27"}
