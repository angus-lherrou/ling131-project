the images of the prostate looked so ugly\nSo now the man has a PSA twenty five Gleason six cancer finally after more than a decade of biopsies and tests and there's lots of questions there there's lots of questions number one of which is\nIf the PSA keeps on going up and the biopsies don't show the cancer after years and years why wasn't an MRI done years ago\nWhile I was in the number I done the super duper pooper place I'm sure that all I'm going to such a famous place they must they must be right he thought well now you understand so you went to the super duper place and some of these big doctors in a white coat the stethoscope wrapped around a fancy Erekat\nEverything was fancy except maybe the thinking process for this patient because of the PSA keeps on going up and there's no explanation then something else has to be done at the doctor's doing the same tests for ten years and the patients not getting the answers\nWell then it's time to visit Dr leader mind that Thirteen

super duper ... getting random biopsies and the essays and nothing more no one ever suggested getting an MRI or better screening or getting a directed biopsy they never did took a decade\nAnd meanwhile the PSA the PSA was as low as five before and now it's twenty five so it's five hundred percent more\nAnd that means there's more cancer than ever before because the diagnosis was never made\nAnd then yes in some cases for men it's difficult to make a diagnosis that's why so many men come here where we have an expertise to help make the diagnosis of pancreas cancer and so many other cancers this is the work\nThat we too so this man and his girlfriend from they understand the differences now centers stand that PSA twenty five is a high risk situation I showed them the data and you

only live the life but didn't take my own advice when I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion from Dr Gilead I'm In because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear fright\nAnd hysteria shed and they said oh you got to get that planned out the control so much of what a man does in his life robotic surgery as your answer and I've been kicking myself and it took his ever since maybe the\nDome is decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow you've been shot up with hollow show bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat five times with ... someone was trying to kill you\nOh yeah and they almost succeeded but when you had that robotic surgery you said oh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of depends with my body liquids\nAnd I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trials is I feel like a little infant who can't leave the quit and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt like wow what an idiot I was not to go to you Dr Gilead them in and get that second opinion\nNow you were shot up ... show bullets but the complications what was worse actually the removal of that prostate gland that control so much of what Amanda's in his life from simply going to the bathroom\nAnd urinating it was at times impossible to stop and other times it was impossible your day and then\nTo try to have the urge to emerge forget about it it was Mike I might as well a very unique I Wish him put ten and naturally that plays a head game on you so now you don't even\nFeel like you're a man any longer it was just a bad decision and I didn't have the guidance and I should've come right to you for that second opinion because you would have stayed me away from that because obviously it wouldn't have been surgery and I would have\nBeen able to maintain all my manly abilities and been able to go to and from the porcelain palaces and we leave myself when necessary\nYou seem very angry about having that robotic surgery\nExtraordinarily angry because it's been years since it was twenty twelve and I'm Still play ... with all the problems that have resulted from that and I know they'll never get better and in fact as I age they'll probably get worse\nWere ever war you'd have all these urine or problems and structural problems after robotic surgery\nNo in fact I was told surgery surgery surgery is the answer to get the Klan cut out and you'll never have to worry about cancer coming back again and then the very\nFirst thing they did just a month after my recovery was to say you got to take a PSA test I said what are you talking about we got to see if you have cats I see you took my prostate out they said you never\nKnow [laughter] you never know I said how come you didn't tell me that before you took my prostate out and then it just a series of situations that unfolded from being incontinent urinating too much not being able to have sex and none of it you know ... about that in advance\nYou're a man who communicate so obviously if they talked about it you would have heard of it\nNot only heard it I would've been in in ... I Would have been asking a wide random range of questions that would have made me a doubting Thomas but they were so sure of themselves they were high fiving one another you know\nI get to meet the anesthesiologist the rest of the team they talk about how this is safe it's antiseptic it's a robot doing it so there's no human era I mean they made it seem like I was going to be an astronaut launched into space and that nothing can go wrong\nIt was more like a Powell Thirteen\nApollo Thirteen except when you recover you realize oh my God as you look at the ivy that you'd shrunk to and you realize you're never going to be able to go to the bathroom the same way you did from the day you adjust a little toddler in\nFact now all of a sudden you're wearing a pad and sometimes it depends and you're saying hey I understand if I was in my nineties maybe that's the result of just aging but I'm In my fifties and this is happening\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease stroke you're in good shape and still have all these complications\nOh there's no doubt and not only was he in good shape I was in heavy I wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that begin to creep up on you when you start the aging process and then all of a sudden I ended up with problems as a result of prostate remove all surgery\nBecause now when your basic functions when you can't you are in a when you can have sex when all of those things go a right not only does it affect\nYou mentally and you get depressed but you never know when you're going to go here in the middle of a meeting and then all of a sudden you look down at your trousers and you had an accident\nAnd now what do you do grab a sweater and wrap it around yourself and went off to the bathroom and then you always carrying around it depends with you and you say why did I Do this to myself and my ... and you said no I'm not a ... I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery is something fantastic don't\nBelieve the hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those is you talked to lead them in because you're not part of the old boy's club you are independent autonomous and you've taken a route in which you're providing you'll pay\nChange pain which methods of recovery fully remaining able to function as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate cancer\nAnd there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing robotic how do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars that I worked on any auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota and you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow I may be scarring these people I may be\nTurning them into a person who can no longer physically", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "New York", "day": "06"}
