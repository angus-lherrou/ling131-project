finding radio surgery you can also call Dr Lieberman at two and two choices for free informative booklet and DVD hey Dr Lederman we're back\nIt's Dr Lederman with Kurdish so we were talking about prostate cancer and he's the man who's lived the life\nOf not only live the life but didn't take my own advice when I'm constantly telling our listeners get a second opinion from Dr Gilead him in because I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then fear flight\nAnd hysteria set in they said oh you got to get that planned out of control so much of what a man does in his life robotic surgery is your ... and I've been kicking myself in that took his ever since maybe the dome is decision that I've ever made in my life\nNow you've been shot up with ... show bullets in Nineteen Ninety two in the back of a cat\nFive times with ... someone was trying to kill you oh yeah and they almost succeeded but when you had that robotic surgery you said oh the pain was as grade and recovery was even more difficult I'm filling up bags and bags of depends with my body liquids\nAnd I'm saying to myself I Can't even go outside I'm standing my trousers I feel like a little infant who can't leave the quit and none of this was conveyed to me before and I just felt like wow what an idiot I was not to go to you Dr Gilead him\nIn and get that second opinion now you were shot up hollow shell bullets but the complications what was worse actually the removal of the prostate gland that control so much of what Amanda's and it's like from simply going to the bathroom\nAnd urinating it was five times\nImpossible to stop and other times it was impossible your day and then to try to have the urge to merge forget about it it was Mike I might as well as any unit was input tent and naturally that plays a head game on your show now you don't even feel like you're a man any long ago it was just a bad decision and I\nDidn't have all the guidance and I should've come right to you for that second opinion because you would have stayed me away from that because obviously it wouldn't have been surgery\nAnd I would have been able to maintain all my manly abilities and been able to go to and from the porcelain palaces and relieve myself when necessary\nYou seem very angry about having that robotic surgery\nExtraordinarily angry because it's been years since she was twenty twelve and I'm Still play ... with all the problems that have resulted from that and I know they'll never get better and in fact as I age they'll probably get worse\nWere ever warmed you'd have all these urine or problems and structural problems after robotic surgery\nNo in fact I was told surgery surgery surgery is the answer to get the Klan cut out and you'll never have to worry about cancer coming back again and then the very first thing they did just a month after my recovery was to say you got to take a PSA test I said what are you talking about we got to see if you have cats I took my prostate out they said you never\nKnow you never know I said how come you didn't tell me that before you took my prostate out and then it just a series of situations that unfolded from being a continent urinating too much not being able to have sex and none of it you know in ... about that\nIn advance you're a man who communicate so obviously if they talked about it you would have heard of it\nNot only heard it I Would have been in in which it or I Would have been asking a wide random range of questions that would have made me a doubting Thomas but they were so sure of themselves they were high fiving one another you know\nI get to meet the anesthesiologist the rest of the team they talk about how this is safe it's antiseptic it's a robot doing it so there's no human era I mean they made it seem like I was going to be an astronaut launched into space and that nothing can go\nWrong it was more like Apollo Thirteen Apollo Thirteen except when you recover you realize\nOh my God as you look at the ivy that you'd shrunk to and you realize you're never going to be able to go to the bathroom in the same way you did from the day you adjust a little toddler in fact now all of a sudden you're wearing a pad\nAnd sometimes it's depends and you're saying hey I understand if I was in my nineties maybe that's the result of just aging but I'm In my fifties and this is happening\nAnd you were in good shape it wasn't like you had heart disease and stroke you're in good shape and still have all these complications\nOh there's no doubt and not only would say in good shape I wasn't heavy\nI wasn't suffering from diabetes heart problems any of the other normal kind of problems that begin to creep up on you when you start the aging process and then all of a sudden I ended up with problems as a result of prostate remove all surgery because now when your basic functions when you can't you are in a\nWhen you can have sex when all of those things go a right not only does it affect\nYou mentally and you get depressed but you never\nKnow when you're going to go you're in the middle of a meeting and then all of a sudden you look\nDown at your trousers and you've had an accident and now what do you do wherever sweater and wrap it around yourself and run off to the new rich bathroom and then you always carrying around that depends with you and you're saying why did I Do this to myself and my ... and he said no I'm not a mask is I just didn't have good guidance\nAnd what would you tell all those men who today think that robotic surgery or something fantastic don't\nBelieve the hype please just because it's modern technology it doesn't mean it's the best there are so many other remedies and the person who can expose somebody to those is your doctor Gilead I mean because you're not part of the old boy's club your independent autonomous and you've taken a route\nIn which you're providing your patients painless methods of recovery fully\nRemaining able to function as a management functioning at a time when they weren't diagnosed with prostate cancer\nYou know there's lots of surgeons out there doing robotic and still to this day they're out there doing robotic how do you think they live with themselves when they see the man after surgery suffering so much and then they go see another patient and recommend robotic surgery again how do they live with themselves\nI think the impervious to human sentimentality they're looking at the bottom line it's almost like how many cars have I worked on in the auto body shop this month you know it's like having a quota\nAnd you're no longer a human being you no longer a person that they look at like wow I may be scarring these people I may be turning them into a person who can no longer physically function why am I doing this when there are\nOther remedies and why are they doing it\nBecause this is their business the U.S surge and all they know how to do is cut out your prostate that claimed that controls so much of what a man does and I would suggest to everyone out there a void that at all costs don't be still not don't be a dummy like I was\nGet that valued second opinion from Dr Gilead them in because he will not abandon you he will get you back on track and you will feel fully functional again thank you so much my place\nAnd it was about Seventy seven year old woman she's married with children she came with
