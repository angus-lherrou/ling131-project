let me ask you Michel please and we have some plenty of calls and we'll get to them but a out of the\nPlenty of calls and we'll get to them but a out of the violations that you're forced to investigate what is the biggest surprise to that person who says what do you what are you after me for what I Do wrong\nThe biggest surprise for most people are license violations I mean people that are\nYou know hunting illegal usually know that other than they'll go to store go on line they'll buy a license and they won't get the proper license now Georgia has made the effort don't correct in that than the last year they've simplified done away with some license and combine things together to help out\nBut like I said the biggest thing people get in trouble about that they're not aware of is buying the wrong license\nOkay well that's not bad that's not bad or good but it's not necessarily bad did not ... they don't have it come up on somebody was eight or ten they're in the truck\n[noise] that's right so I mean and we try to help out in that situation if we have service we can help him purchase a license and our truck I'm generally speaking we would lot more for the um by licenses and we would ride them a ticket in that situation\nUh so we we try to be helpful there because most people that have gone and taking the effort to buy something or at least trying to do the right guy\nAnd you're not [laughter] [noise] and you're not throwing rocks at them because of that\nNo as long as I Try and we will work with um I'm an old case [laughter]\nHe thought was OK Now let's go to some of the callers if you will let's uh let's go back [laughter] skews the gas I just go back and talk to mark calling again from Camden county and let's put it back on their good morning mark\nOr you have a question mark I Believe\nYes I'm trying to find out what the legal distance deal that hard work and put bite your property law okay Mitchell\nRight the legal distance for deer there's not a specified distance this time they they tried to mirror the law for home which is fifty yards from a property land but there were some deal with the law was written and it was left out what you'll probably see in the next year so it'll change to that also\nBe the fifty yards but at the moment there's no specified distance own deer\nAnd fifty yards on home okay that answer your question mark\nYeah 'cause I was actually giving air written warning for well inscribed in several different resource officers and say education issue between resource officers are not guessing falls into the hog hunting issue\nYeah it is a it deals with that because it is very specific and the whole gunning those fifty yards\nWell they are so my question okay thanks for calling mark thank you all now you may\nSee you later now there you go [laughter] excuse me every one I'm Sorry that uh uh I have a\nUh being ill a little bit over the last couple of weeks or a not a little bit I've been sick

probably Thirty years you can't get them on a ... um and I stay up probably Seventy hours a night ... ...\nAnd so on and on next to a general I Am and uh some new guys apparently at Boise State and of course I've got\nVideos of them coming home to ... going to stay in any oil or something and um [noise] lasers down my land their access for ... a scam and uh-huh and uh also\nMy biggest question they have less than ... a lot on the line like I mean seven yards in front of us than I Would I actually lay the bottom of the jury\nIs what I'm saying is that legal or not that close was why\n... why don't you come in hold on Mitchell you comment place\nThere's no legal sent back for a stand on the on the line so they can actually be on the line tree now they cannot shoot into your hunting club but uh they can actually\nPut to stand on the line if necessary or if they wish I know it's not courteous and we ask people not to but there's no law against it\nWell you've got some rascals next to you there Brian down\nAnd you you can't really say on there or I mean they have to cut ... got a lawyer solved way for\nYears known up so I Can't say that on a Saturday safer to get on the outside my race but I I Would\nWant to make sure that I mean this is up say that because I've been staying for an adult one voting class about one third as well as I got\nSome nice ... so this way and I don't want to have because so many people just give us some in the mail and stuff I mean but I may not have a little ... Michel comment\nWell I I Wish everybody was courteous but they're usually not now if they are coming home to your land physically and interrupt in your hunt\nI mean you're in the stand they drive by you there are some laws that can deal with that um and if you want to contact your local ranger or local game warden and they can give you the type workout landowner affidavit\nWhich means is asking that the state prosecuted anybody that\nDoes you wrong and this guy I'm now like I said there's no legal setback for them putting staying there but it's like a socket\nHook staying right next to there's a lotta work them in the ...\nYou could I'm not gonna here but\nA nicer sale\nBut you know this\nActually try to avoid conflict with them but like I say if you if you run into ... run into problems I should contact your local guy more than a they'll come out to look at it help you with the landowner affidavit process and if they should shoot a deer on your property then they have crossed the line\nAnd um they can be prosecuted that point\nWhere they are at an early age I'll tell you may see our I haven't I say you bet\nThank you good luck this season\nYou know something else that helps out in those circumstances is just communication just talk with your diapers you're not always just may not always gets you somewhere but sometimes you know if people realize that they're impacting somebody else it sometimes it can it can work out then you you can form a relationship with your neighbors\nWe always encourage people to form cooperatives and\nUh you know ... you know people that want to protect younger bucks maybe quality deer manage we we really encourage the formation of multiple property cooperative so you know building up that communication can bridge a lot of those gaps and and uh won't work Everytime ah but you know sometimes it helps just to go to\nMaybe they don't or maybe they don't know that you're there a way to say let's say he's up next Jeff is calling from social circle good morning Geoff\nGood morning Neal how are you lovely Rick ... your ...\nUh yeah let me introduce a this fellow a Jeff and I have been fishing and hunting buddies not recently but when we what Jeff Thirteen Years old\nHere back in the late fifties sixties\nYeah yeah uh he we went to a different high\nSchool played sports against each other but we all we spent the summer fishing and uh and doing a lot of deer hunting any just walking in the woods right\n[laughter] that's right and I never will forget time since we're talking about the early this morning about a good friend of mine named Leo about Eighteen dollar mouser rifle\nYes I Do know I don't think he was Eighteen dollars I think it was about nine or ten dollars but go ahead\nWell no one knew it probably\nIt was about nine or ten dollars but go ahead\nWell no one knew it probably was cheaper but anyway uh going into the woods and they've never shot the gun and the biggest theater in Georgia comes running down the hill and stuff right in front of you\nAnd I will forget it you're shot I don't know how many times and I was listening to distance and must stand in for said boy he must have had heard\nOf them come on I miss him every time you'd miss him and I think you're wrapped the gun around a tree [laughter]\nAnd I often I don't like it that's for sure yeah all that I bought that ... it was a ... a a mouser right open site and uh it was anywhere near close to being cited in\n[laughter] no I Will forget that lets you know or appreciate the copy book you sent me but the next book you do I need to edit some of it with you\nOh I understand [laughter] I understand I I can assure you I Will not give you that opportunity well okay I see that oil the book that Jeff is referring to is O'Neill outside people and places along the way and Jeff is part of some of those stories\nAre that the ...

year\nAnd I'm sure sects and Sam would be able to tell us Patty how much does it cost to maintain those trees per year\nWell a cautious estimate would be forty thousand dollars so that is for soil remediation cable ... for a lightning pruning or so we've those are all really important things and\nIt it's just it's exciting because we want those trees to be here for generations to\nCome I don't remember too was several years ago there was a tornado big story out on a bunch of tree out Oakland they came down that only was he did you lose the trees with many times ... uprooted the barrel plots
