I'm a tree and or the and the ...\nOr ... river a faggot regret I Can't even say it and I tutor battery unfair um\nIs so that you have a narrow it down to the ... the some of the squares of the two opposite side equals the summer the square\nOf the ... yeah or somebody like sales\nSo it it applies to a rice triangle and it's a it's as you said there's some of the squares of the two legs has the equal the square of the high pot and right\nThere you are and so hey listen Rick it's been a long long time\n[laughter] so so anyway you got to write try and go with the tip of your raw a fishing rod coming down to the water and then going out to the fish and then your line foreign ... news and you can do all kinds\nAnd then your line foreign ... news and you can do all kinds of a mathematical calculations based on that right triangle um so that's the scenario with calculus for physics it's a hunting scenario suppose at your target is like\nOh I don't know three hundred yards away although Isaac's we used as a metric we'd say three hundred meters away right and I'm\nSupposed to cure you're fired your weapon on a in a level level with the ground\nAnd um suppose that um\nHow do you have to aim above your target if you know your muscle velocity of the a rifle how far above your target do you have to aims so that when the bullet arrives it hits where you wanted to hit\nOkay that's a ... and you use ah Newton's I'm\nA traditional um equations of of motion to solve that is a fairly simple problem to do foreign let me ask\nYou a question of question Rick [noise] if you fired a bullet and perfectly level and you fired a bullet in it weighed a hundred grams\nAlright okay\nAnd you win that bullet exited the barrel and the the the ground in front of you is perfectly flat when that bullet exits the barrel if you dropped a bullet\nFrom that position it exactly the same time both bonus will hit the ground at the same time\nYou've had some physics how 'bout that\nYou've had some physics training because that's one of the things that they teach you in physics is that exactly what you said\nWell I'm impressed with myself yeah\nI'm impressed with you too that I Am not a lot of people know that\nYou have velocity does it change gravity\nRight gravity that that that the two of force vectors if you will are independent of each other\nYou've got to the vector of\nOf its horizontal velocity and you have the vector\nOf it's a vertical velocity which initially is zero coming out of the barrel but then gravity starts acting on it as soon as that exits the barrel ... and it starts coming down and gravity doesn't care whether the bullets moving or not if you know it's going to act on the bullet a regardless and so it's just\nAs you said ...\n... here's the question that got though or I Know\nThat physics question does that was ...\nI wanted to ask you a question do you happen to know what the muzzle velocity of your muscle loader is\nNot offhand because it would change according to the power they saw it was early in the barrel yeah\nYeah that makes sense\nBecause you can use anywhere from ... grains to a hundred and fifty grains whether it's a maximum\nI'm a Muslim older they can handle a maximum load\nSo you have the ability to change how much powder is that is is behind the bullet\nYes in a Muslim over you do yes and the ... changes in your garden and how much power when you get in it partly say again Rick I'm Sorry\nAh how do you just how do you make the decision as to how much a powder to put in it\nWellness the size of the animal the anticipated distance of the shot\nOr and what you're used to and all that is solved on the range\nAnd you do this on the fly is your as your hunting\nNo you do that prior okay no one\nOf our lives equal within

lot of fruits and things and I says you might see in other parts of the world's you don't see in Atlanta and I don't know why I said that because I wanted to segue into the poor folks is southwest Georgia\nWho are growing things that go very nicely down there except when hurricanes come through\nI Am just heartbroken\nHeartbroken for the families in the farmers in southwest Georgia who were just not on their heels by the hurricane that came through earlier this week have not seen some of the\nPictures they will read your heart because the the huge huge before it after pictures of cotton field who just white was caught ... acres and acres twenty thirty forty fifty acres of cotton side of the highway quite the day before the hurricane came\nThe winds came the rank came feels are totally browned smashed down the cotton bowls down in the mud in the in the soil\nThey're not going to hire as hardly anything for that feels ... that was their income for the years to harvest they get from the cotton field with the Congo that have a friend who used to be an extension Asia Wesley who's retired who lives in South Georgia\nI wrote in total email lists are half a retirees and said we have this long have not pay a sand road out here in southwest Georgia that uh\nIs covered and knock down pine tree says there's probably fifty or a hundred knocked down pine trees when my house and the highway and it's only I think a couple of hundred yards from his house or the highway\nBut all these countries are not down but he says some hot clamber over the trees in order to get to my pick Cohn growth because he really has been working on his Congo for at least the last twenty five or Thirty years\nEvery year against the great crop of pecan harvest them and sell so of course the folks and makes a living going because\nWhen he got to the Congo he said I just couldn't believe what I was seeing it looks like\nThe day after you harvest and they were not hardly ethnic con own a tree their middle bless this race have been knocked over or leaning my pecan trees were leaning to the ground is littered with green not not many of which can I can harvest and be you know edible silos to them and so he's in lots of conned\nIncome for the year is just about completely wiped out\nNow Roy being a retiree has a little bit of income coming in from his pension for things like that but for farmers who base their whole year's\nCycle of planning and harvesting whether it be caught and pecans or corn or soy beans or peanuts all those things are so so did they were just scoured from the earth by the wind and the rain or the hurricane\nI don't know what organized a efforts were going to do here in Atlanta to release on and I know the department of agriculture here in black and the federal egg folks are going down there and just trying to do their best to find out what is the damage why do we have to do to help the farmers\nTo get through this with chicken folks oh my gosh you don't think of southwest Georgia as being a chicken farm area but it is covered in chicken houses down there two million chickens gone\nWhere are you going to do is two million chickens you're going to bury 'em you're going to get a big bulldozer digger great big trench and shove your entire chicken house and the chickens in it\nInto the trench now what have you got clear land no chicken house no chickens and hardly any money to buy new chickens or rebuild your houses down there to rebuild your your feed them to rebuild the the irrigation and they the watering system as you had in the second house so what are you gonna do\nSadly a lot of the farmers in South Georgia go to look at themselves and their families I man do we really want to\nAnd so and their families I man\nDo we really want to keep doing this one in a place where we don't get even good Internet service\nWhere we don't get good rose we don't have a hospital to serve our family we have to go thirty forty miles just to just have a doctor lookouts who feel sick\nWhat are we going to do just pack up\nThe soil ... land let's go somewhere else who has a little more economic future for our children because that just doesn't seem to be a lot going on in South Georgia and that is one of the reasons why this new elections coming up\nWe're governor George is so critical that we try to find somebody who has a viable plan for reviving southwest Georgia\nBecause we need them they are the farmers that create three billion dollars worth of business is agriculture is the biggest business is Georgia\nNot the airport\nNot manufacturing Atlanta not tourists who knows ... is agriculture south Georgia that drives the of the income is the state of Georgia gets the taxes they live shorter guests as well if we don't have that agriculture that we have\nNot a lot\nWe've got to do so you to make sure the farmers are the people that live and served to farmers is ... are taking care of somehow and I hope\nThat one of our candidates for governor as a viable plan or taking care of them\nWell now you know what I failed to people for bugs and so what do I have a lot of it with him I was going on a farm and worked with
