B.\nOur [noise]\nWalking back to the Monica ... show happy Sunday to use faith I politics taking your calls this morning there were four eight seven to zero seven fifty one eight hundred ws be talk we're talking about the greatest thing that have happened to us in the past ever\nAt least with this president that can seemingly never do anything right according to the left so take your calls just chime in on the conversation what your thoughts where do you think we're going from here if you were not going to vote are you gonna vote now\nLike how has it altered the landscape of your political life and I you know Jamie free WFDD Washington correspondent had plenty to say about getting beyond the president's pick on the Supreme Court and what it means going forward\nUh getting beyond the president's pick on the Supreme Court and what it means going forward for the midterm election\nGood morning I don't think we should underestimate the importance of this Supreme Court victory for President Trump's\nFirst it was a very controversial and very difficult confirmation process and one which could have easily gone down to defeat so in that sense this is a big plus for the White House GOP leaders and the president\nNow looking forward is not so clear as to how this going to impact the November elections\nYes it certainly seems to have energized Republican voters but does that last through the elections and does that off said what seems to be an edge for Democrats we just don't know the answer to that question right now\nI guess if I had to go to a betting window at this point it would make the most sense to put five bucks on the Democrats to win the house in five bucks on the Republican stinky the Senate but honestly I think anything is possible with just over four weeks to go\nIn that for sure but if it's one thing I Know about my conservative we're not gonna give this up there is no way we've come too far\nAnd in speaking with my buddies around the state who were in a in positions of leadership but then as you have the um it seems as though this has actually rallied us and and and really you know as ... as the entire ah ... in a minute ago moment was [laughter]\nThat\nFor special church people who not address yet I forgot about adding McConnell going\nInto these redshirts competitive races and ah we're pretty excited were that they managed to deliver the only thing we adopted able to figure out how to do which was to get our folks are\nExactly because it takes it takes a minute to get a you know why\nBecause we're fat prosperous unhappy in this country and we think we for those\nOf us who don't think like the last eight is it is really hard\nFor us to wrap our mind around the fact that there are fellow humans and country men in this nation\nWho think feel and behave the way they do is I'm going to give you that\nIt is hard for us which is why we look at it and go what the\nHeck like there's no way you can even be really cool\nBut it is and what's even more real is it if you don't hold the hill that we've\nJust charged and captured and you run back down the other side are you let them run away with it or you're going to be sorry for it right here at the midterms I'm telling you and beyond it is going to be a coup show is not something that we need to give up\nTo mention you know don't we owe it to this man who just sat not\nNot only our military and boys and girls and men and women across the age of two of whom bled and died and sacrifice for our nation and the man who just sat through a fiery furnace with their kids and his wife and didn't back down give it a shot for zero for eight seven zero seven fifty Monica ... from politics on W. asked me [noise]\nSo\nI recently got an email from a homeowner who

hysteria in her ability to weigh a matter with balanced scales to me she represented Deborah from the Old Testament\nAnd for those who don't who never was she was the sole female judge and the Old Testament you don't hear a lot about her but she was a bad ass and she was a warrior she led battle\nAt S. and she was a warrior she led battle she led God's men into battle she didn't back down and she was called to the battlefield to lead the charge and did\nAnd so I respect women like that because we really are in a battle and not with one another you know this is this show is on faith life in politics if you've never tuned in to me I'm On every Sunday from eight to nine AM normally today I'm On for two hours and we're taking your calls live\nFor zero for eight seven to zero seven fifty we have a lot of other things to talk about but this is this is prominent for us because of the the the culture in which we live if your Lynn's\nOf seeing things about life is limited to fellow humans and our innate ability to be the most deprived creatures on the planet at times you will live a very hopeless existence\nRight I mean how could you ever live with hope enjoying your heart if that's your limited scope of vision with regard to our fellow countrymen and and if you don't think for two seconds that if Egypt fixing\nTwelve is not warring in in in in raging right now in this nation that there's a real battle\nIn and yes it does go back to life\nI don't know that we'll ever overturn roe versus Wade I pray we do but that wasn't um my personal focal point on on this on this Supreme Court justice it was a big one because I Am a proponent of life clearly I Am pro life make no mistake about that\nBut again as a pragmatic woman I saw there were other things in the balance\nAnd and maybe someone else would take up the mantle of life maybe that wasn't Brett Kavanaugh's\nCharge just because the he's you know we can't look to him to first of all let me just back up [noise] I I Want to say this opportunity on the airwaves to just say thank you to God\nRight because President Trump as kooky as he can be sometimes [laughter] with what he says you know if if you can't see the abject irony of God's hand in this whole\nThing and that he can do anything and use anyone but that he actually answered our prayers he is now taking us into battle to take our country back to take our promised land back\nIn all some of us can do is retreat oh some of us can do is continue to accuse and assault with our words we don't know what's going on because we don't have a safety thousands of you all we have is historical reference and you don't mind you our nation's not that old\nAnd God is always on the move he's always doing new things we don't\nHave to become we don't have our end does it have to be like other nations ends\nWhich will look into that like we are hoping for it like we deserve it\nRight it's like\nWe're all little mini Brett Kavanaugh's running around with these accusations that are in our heads from other people other parties\nUm our historical Sims of our beginnings in this nation with regard to slavery some people will never let us forget our past I just talked about this last week and I got more response from you guys about last week's broadcast that I have in a very long time\nBecause I could hear your desperation and your\nGratitude that someone actually called what it was ditch the accusation is always going to follow you about your past it doesn't want to let you move forward and there's a real movement in this nation not to let us move forward\nAnd the focus is on Trump but it's not just Trump it's all of the injustices that people feel like will never be accounted for they will never be remedied they will never be redeemed\nPeople feel broken inside they don't have their own identity so they look to their voting card or to their skin color or to their genitalia or to their a religious sect whatever it is outside of their original identity first in freedom it's that simple\nTrue religion as this guy's take care of the widow does it the widow take care of the orphan keep yourself on spotted from the world simple\nSo I don't tell people I'm not married I'm spiritual like no I'm religious because that's true religion under filed all this other crap we practice\nIs exactly that is a stitch\nAnd that's what we've been practicing politically we've taught our suits we smell good we look good we said the right things we've got the we hire campaign you know people speech writers who can help us full the masses\nAre either you know at least express our hearts when we started out on the right page that we get into the process and we realize that you know we are jumping the flow of Islam\nOr we're not going to survive and\nThe flow of Islam or we're not going to survive and President Trump is the first person ever to come along and say I don't view and I don't know you and you don't own may\nAnd this is how I see it and I love my country and this is what I'm going to do you don't have to agree with me but I'm moving forward and we're moving forward without ... realized that he could have left Brett Kavanaugh sitting there by himself and do you know how many other leaders would have\nHow many of your pastors when you've gone to them because you're going through a divorce or your son or daughter struggling with homosexuality or you've got yourself caught up in a fair or I'm In an affair or your finances just are crazy your whole life is nuts you're struggling with divorce and what are you here\nWhere are they crickets where's your church where's your church\nWhenever you need them I commend the president for not backing down and Brett Kavanaugh the conversation you can be having with your children right now is is what it looks like to stand up\nBecause your history books will probably not reflect that in government schools right but you're not subjected to only government schools and neither is our future generations if we are so tired of academia and then uh basically kidnapping\nYou know the mental attitude and and the rally the moral aptitude of our children\nWhy are we complaining about that where you have\nHeard enough of that complaining I did it sacrifice give up the boat give up the Rosemary beach vacation for a couple of years home school your kids if you're that set up about it\nOr sit down and have a family\nConsole about what we all just witness in this nation take the conversation back from the hysterical women in the nation who don't know who and who's they are that is your mandate\nI lost what I call her so I was looking forward to going down but how much time do have much to me don't don't have time to go to land you're All right let's go to Lynn and in Kennesaw Lynn welcome to the modern ...\nThank you so much and I appreciate your your sharing your perspective I'm just having gone through and watch this whole horrible mess with a\nJudge Kavanaugh it just reminded me of something I heard on the radio and Dallas Thirty years ago everyone is familiar with Edmund Burke she a phrase or a dash that um when\nIt will evil trying ... didn't do nothing but an apt corollary to that was this when good men do nothing they cease to be good\nAnd so if people are sitting at home and they're not voting or they're not standing up against what I view as evil like uh the president and judge Kavanaugh did then they really have to question whether or not they're good people\nRight I agree when I you know what I Want to I Want to ask you something that's going to go a little bit deeper but I've got to go to a break right now and so do you mind holding because because you just hit on something that I think is really important to the conversation do you mind holding for me of course I think right hold on just like\nOur guys we'll be right back with when I have a deeper thought on this and that's a great place to start a you're
