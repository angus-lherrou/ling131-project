on you\nI mean these are your kids but rounding people up who are out on probation for heinous sins has I'm certainly not advocating on behalf of child molesters but I Will say this we do have a penal system for a reason\nAnd we had injustice and we have order and I'm not going to get tangled up with another hashtags movement of round up the molesters for Halloween I mean that's just wrong I don't

find that odd but that's how I Am so in other news have you guys had a chance to go through the new revised scheme called the seven hundred pages of the Gulf proposal well someone has\nAnd I had to bring him on his way to tell us exactly what's in the new scheme Julian been a former board member and invest it landed now leading the charge with red light the Gulch\nIf you can here's what I

help me\nMake this more cohesive for my listeners how can you tae Bo around all of those individual concerns to say this is why this deal needs to be read lighted\n[noise] this is a great question and and I've had I've had a reporter said I mean we haven't seen for many many years\nAs much of a coming to gather in protest against a deal this one\nAt least that for ... and and I think it's I think that people will come at it with different intuitions\nAll the I'm a business guy I'm an analyst on the number's gone right but ... motives\nI mean let's be very clear is that I Do believe that our tax revenue should\nBe going to support public services and let's go to schools right that we are in a city with a wide disparity of income and ability to pay and that you know those of us who are better off\nI'm a progressive Monaco I'm you know and I ... that's that's who I Am I Believe you know\nIt is our obligation to look after the folks particularly children you know who are in West ... certain sensitive and that's why we're paying a property taxes and that so far as I'm so\nIt infuriates me when you get this massive diverse through something that ah nobody cares about except that a lot of progress you know I mean yeah they keep talking about old immigrant we all in the ground\nAs I Know you're just\nGoing to ... you know let's let's filled with a little holes in the streets\nWere ... that'd be great [laughter] [laughter] that's a great idea and all of that\nSo it's all I think it's a common and gather of folks to realize that you know your caller and spend the same dollar twice we all ... and ... and if you\nThe dollar twice we all stunned and if you spend it on a billionaire boom box for billionaires that there are no votes for the ordinary folks right and it means probably higher taxes almost should be higher taxes for\nThose of us have the means I absolutely love ... and it\nMeans lowest services for every now and it means level for middle class or teachers and firefighters and you know city and county workers but\nIt's you know there is a reason that we are the most on the city in America but a couple of measures and I'm sure there is I mean with the vote measure them you know I'm not saying we're necessarily a whole lot worse than the other but\nThe fact of the matter is if we keep on prioritizing billionaire developed or interest if we keep her hurling them money and through your fancy stadiums uh to replace that in ...\nI'm ... and all that sort of think well what do you think I mean why would you not expect\nPoverty levels to continue to be bad and and your teachers and cops to be fully underpaid well why would you expect any different result right it's like to join drew together and I think people are beginning to go\nThrough a day are saying they are Julian and thanks to people like you who has a vast understanding and you're no longer and covered by your position on the board coupled with all of your experience on the board you can now bring all of that progressive ism which I enjoy listening to you and your heart really says to me that you have a heart for your\nFor your fellow citizen then and I and I agree with you and that we do have an obligation as a Christian I Believe that\nTo help and to make sure that people are not disenfranchised and that everyone has an equal opportunity to at the
