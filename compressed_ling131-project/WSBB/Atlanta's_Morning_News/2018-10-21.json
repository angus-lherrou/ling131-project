son's birthday and this was for deportation than we were told that we were being arrested because we were in a threat to national security\nAnd within a very short time [noise]\nAh it became clear to us with this was unusual we weren't allowed to see a consular official and we were kept my wife and I for Thirteen Days with all contact with the outside\nAnd it just kept experiment ... [noise] so uh we we were really shocked because we've spent twenty for years are telling people to turkey where does this very openly and I've never had a problem\nWhen people go to turkey where does this very openly and I've never had a problem\nWith the ... and just for the record did you ever\nEngaged in any kind of spying held terrorists in any way\nOr no our purpose in going to turkey was to tell people about Jesus Christ\nOr we did that very openly and we were not involved in anything political [noise]\nCame in for some rough treatment [noise]\nWell uh just being a present those it was pretty rough or at the beginning I was held in solitary confinement for a number of days and that was very difficult in the way I Survived that was by just spending hours or in prayer just to keep from getting my sanity and then I was kept in a\nSelf or eight people but there were over twenty of us there so it was very crowded very ah was are isolated both by language and buy a culture nationality and also by religion [noise]\nThere was a all the people I was with her very strong lessons there were all arrested as Muslim terrorists part of the UN is a movement parents so it was like living in a mosque in many ways did you ever feel like you were in physical danger [noise]\nUh not not at the beginning I think that as things were added on ah for example saying that I was a supporting the PKK which was a Kurdish terrorist movement or then of course many Turks would become more angry at this point I'm One of the most\nAh hated men in Turkey probably because I was accused of spying as well as being part of the offense to overthrow the government\nAnd supporting a Kurdish terrorist or\nAnd then of course when they started to have economic problems after President Trump's impose sanctions than I was going for the change in the economy\nI hated in Turkey but Christians here took up\nHere cause did you feel that movement well\nThis is one of the very surreal things a bit\nWe're not known people were not very important people we've been working on turkey in obscurity on concern for a number of years but then around the world are I think millions of people in many countries were praying for us and\nEven though a this causes a lot of hurt I think that God is using this was planning to use this to bring blessing to turkey now there are millions of people who played for turkey used to love turkey\nWe do know say that's evidence of like heart filled with Christ because I don't think you can come out of that without some semblance of you know humility and um I mean you don't survive any other way other than being connected to the lord like that\nAnd and honestly truth be told none of us are going to either\nSo all the things that keep us busy and satisfied I'm you know and twist it up and turned inside out um they're not serving us\nAnd so you know how many of you found yourself sick or without a job or someone left you or something something has happened in your only way through it is to spend time in the presence of the lord to bring you out because nothing else is working\nAnd nothing else to satisfy that you know that need for connection that need for approval that need for love and acceptance um yeah I can totally relate to that so\n[noise] you know it's funny because he said you know that and I I took a note that you know Jesus Jesus is a threat to our nation's security that is not founded upon liberty that is not founded upon genius\nAll politics or spiritual and most of spirituality as tall as political because it all begins and the spirit\nSo everything that we deal with your on this earth is really began first in the ... like this is one giant family feud that we all are part of\nA yeah we know how it ends but where are we in the midst of the winning like Jesus already won but we're we\nIf you have to understand what's really at play here whenever he says you know we weren't involved in politics I'm like Mm yeah on an earthly level you weren't that you got to understand the only thing driving their politics and turkey is religion\nThat's what drives Middle East and I know we've had the gentleman on a professor from Emory to weed out the door\n... yeah and I said do you do you think that this is a a religious thing and and he will disagree with me and said\nNo it's not it is political but in a geopolitical\nOkay but if you understand the spiritual realm and I don't I'm assuming professor science probably Jewish I I don't know um but if you understand the spiritual principalities and the realms of things that you understand that there are millions over particular\nDo you understand that there are demands over particular regions in areas of the world and\nChrist that's about all of that but in the meantime all of this is still going on down here member crisis and come back yet so you have to understand\nYou know the level the darkest you're dealing with what I was going to say about chief Cochran\nIs that you know in the very beginning I said listen before all the facts came out and I'm and I'm going to close the show with this because this is something that was sent to me yesterday about this little kid at the ... county cop in the mall whatever and stuff was going on\nAnd I said I'm not going to rush to judgment about this because I've only seen like two minutes of video that really makes the ant look like she's crazy so and the cops just kind of peaceful alright but when we're so quick to rush to judgment and I try really hard not to do that\nAnd so a chief Cochran I thought OK finding the fella Christian that's awesome but here's the thing if he did show up\nAt his job to proselytize and it was and it was on it was in his book is code of conduct for the job that you don't do that at your job I Would tell you Christians don't do that at your job\nI mean that simple\nIf if you want to proselytize go get your contracts and sand out on the street corner and hand them out to people randomly out in public but just be Christ like at work you don't have to quote scriptures and versus and you know the Bible says that gays and you know what it says about this and you know you don't have\nTo do you don't have to be that we're\nChristian and sure you're that you're killing people with the truth you're using the word as a weapon instead of a staff\nAnd the word came to serve us not to kill us\nAnd yes we are called to die to ourselves but we're we're so busy running around with our sort of the spirit just\nThat just cutting the heads off of other people they don't even have time to receive\nJesus as a thousand of they don't even want it\nBecause it's exhausting to them because we looked so hypocritical and crazy\nBut that wasn't what he did he didn't proselytize at work people\nOut side of the job our [noise] he was consistent with them\nWhich is the exact opposite of hypocrisy they say you're listening Matthew my politics on WSBIU
