possible for both of them in the same place there for seasonal\nYeah ... yeah\nTry to see Joel less out you'd be the beta tests\nFor those who are like experiment to see me chickweed as you know grows bigger certainly in the wintertime nicer green banks that stuff unless the diseases pretty hardy and comes back in the summertime spring summer fall controversies as old as you say I don't see why not I don't\nThink my biggest concern is the chickweed ... when it dies off it gets mad at down will that even if you're with the less but these are coming up the next year\nOr whatever you want to have lower at one time Joel just from the chickweed is just getting his biggest highest maturity and you take ... to go across at one time just so to chop it up and get out of the way the less the diesel Suze ... through it\nMaybe that would work was run some um when you when I tell you a question on the screen here Joel I thought too about creeping Charlie goes creeping Charlie again mostly does growth in the summertime but it's green for nine or ten months of the year and looking at a good when you step on it and\nYou know kind of take it a little bit of traffic to so creepy Charlie is a possibility as well\nOkay I also have a question about the most I've got a place where I'm thinking of putting them on most of the tree and everybody I talked to says don't do it because\nI have read emotions can get now there'll be prolific with the seeds and I'm Wondering this if I put it in a pot and very the pot in the soil well that retard the gross so I could keep it low enough so that they won the seat thoughts come out in the late summer I can put losses from away\nAgain Joel ... maybe the beta tests or to figure out of his works and I are theoretically yeah and how to\nSay that I'm not as much of the most the haters some people are it's not that\nTo the among most of ... some people are it's not that unattractive during parts of the year with little fluffy pink flowers come out of that is nice then\nUh people don't like it because as you intimated those routes to see things come up all over everywhere in your landscape but they're not hard to spot you can you know knock them down to kick them down and not have to do much to control them\nSo I Try to see if he you know with a positive light types of ... off of or at least let drop the seat and you have a reasonably nice looking through the blues and looks pretty nice robe or three weeks in the summertime\nBut is there some sort of formula for how big of a pot in order to restrict the height of the tree I'd I'd like it's not grow told than eight feet\nHe's even then you're going to need a pretty big pot to give it moisture during the summertime cause you think about it ... it can dry out didn't want to dry out during the do last June writing it risque or even a thought it was nice to be a ... to twenty four inches for probably shading toward the bigger damage to the smaller ones so you might even want to

man\nGave me a law by the way our phone number for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty you have a question you want to mention there and ask questions this morning for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty ... here in Atlanta Georgia is I get really good morning\nHey good morning I'm not I have a very large branch from a maple trade that is ...\nI guess like a a fracture in lake yeah um I guess you'd have to wait as the rest of that French and I'm so set the grass they branch its allies and shit I like Bill to support or is there like a bandage or\nSomething that I can get about ... cents at like ...\nWell that's going to be tough gave ... given the maples are pretty tough trees and can sometimes recover from weird damage with just scars and blow some bumps just like humans can do the same [noise] um\nMy inclination to say it is to say ... vice would be to cut it off and let the rest of the tree grow and maybe shake the rest of the tree to hide where the scar where you're where you're branch came off but if you have some scheme in your head Gabrielle of figure out how to support the branch and\nNot let it completely break off you never know it may may last several more years I mean I'm not there looking at a picture of it so it was hard for me to the the rise of what you could do but possibly let's put it that way possibly could prompt the branch off or somehow make it so it does continue to break\nAnd also um how would I Know that my maple tree roots are in a sewer line ... actually harm train\nProbably not why do you think they're in the civil and what makes you ask the question\nAlex ... rich are all over and and my training stone drained area well\nMm Mm well [laughter] if they get ...\nMm Mm well [laughter] if they get slower slower slower and then don't train at all yeah you have roots the sewer line on the other hand ... how old is your house Gabriel\nI'm Nineteen forty\n... that may or may not be a good a good thing because older sewer pipes live either cast iron or there was one there was a composite materials was easy for is to get through the cracks and the cats aren't joints or the composite stuff\nAnd uh the Orangeburg pipe and they would be more than likely\nHave roots in them to get ... on the other hand we have plastic pot which is the common thing people use now it's completely sealed completely impervious to roots that's not a not a bad thing you know and however maple tree go right on top of plastic pipe and the roof simply can't get through the plastic\nIt's so it depends on what you have for your sewer line outside if it's cast iron possibly does this have to wait and see if you want to wait and see their or some plumbing companies that have cameras like put a camera down here ... whether you have roots are not\nA drain on down the line probably will not hurt the maple tree\nMuch but it probably won't hear clear all the root of the line either\nOkay All right thank you that's all I got [laughter] reality type comedy\nWould say the six forty two of his Saturday morning that was an interesting question if you have an interesting question for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty shades upcoming Georgia I sang good morning\nWalker um I Am headed out to my crying again this morning or make them stuff fly and but I you know while I'm making these drives back and forth to job sites I wandered about blueberry\nBushes yeah sure I'm I'm\nPlanning to pick up about two dozen guy and well\nThat's what's making more like a ... as long as I don't want to have that many ... um\nWatch the uh what's the best time of year to grab them or the best I mean the plant them and what do I need to do to ensure some you know ...\nUh uh as this is the first two questions when to buy when to plant now and now\nWe are now I'd I'd like to be done sooner rather than later because this phone is still pretty warm right now so the blueberry I can grow pretty quickly between now and December sometime when it cools off even further\nUm most of the things you do have prepared the saw before you plant the blueberries that Shane is gonna make you love having blueberries and picking gallons and gallons of or it'll make you think I'm going to want to spend all that money on these blueberries and only get five or ten fruit per per ... what's going on\nNow and I'm not very unfair to look at me and go oh my God you are a green thumb God\nYeah right on a green thumb God here we got to say you gotta make or ... woman really impressed [laughter] I have to have a ... big dig\nThis all you have to make us all

girl\nWho has some a little bit she rubber do shoulders at night make the sauce at all if you have some peat moss and helps a little more because peat moss is a set of the soil\nAnd for every Trump is

[noise] I'm tear out my common for me to my front yard I've had some pretty hard clay I have access to a tractor and an author and all the top soil I Need a top dress those are the lawn\nHow deep in an ideal situation\nFor me to offer down into the ... with the top so convenient roots go [laughter]\nUm [noise]\nWhen you say ... we're talking at Taylor here so being able to fill that soil up\nUm well I've got a tractor actually so I'm Glad I have to all go down and hauled in to the soil and backfill with top\nSo why why would you making wholes why would you not till the whole area uh yeah it's\nSo hard I don't think until I was going to be able to do much yeah but I\nJust ... individual holes NGOs it much either the zenith my roots their chagrin I'm guessing but in the hard parts of the soul between how old is he went with an ogre\nAnd the hard parts of this all the way in the hold his he went with longer than what is the law as you go into doing those laws [noise]\nJust hoping the top so rich compost begin to break down the soil well let's let's let's just\nGo back in in for free a free answering your questions that ... thing is is is a new and I started out with Walter on this one is that they would be much better uniformity to to actually\nTell the whole thing as opposed to trying to order holding throughout so I I'd rather see until it say three to four inches deep in four inches is better than three um\nAnd the turf we tend to think of our roots on the upper four inches us where the majority the roots are going to do that doesn't mean that Xie ... grass roots won't go much deeper that and I've certainly seen them said doubt as much as twelve to Eighteen Inches so they can get down looking for nutrients in water and in an air\nUm but the majority that route system's going to be in the upper four inches so is your coming in telling up and then adding your your top sold back over the top of it if you can make a nice planting bed to say three to four inches deep\nThat has sustained most of of that uh that grass\nIs always the backfill or three or four inches of soil would that be enough to kill the Bermuda all night and I have to go ahead and fly the uh the round up a couple of times and then put the ... I I still\nDo what I can to set that ... Berea grass is a very hearty plant the Newberry at three to four inches eventually you'll get a a Springer Bermuda grass will will find its way to the top it's it's a a a very hardy species that's well adapted to to our environment and climate to end or does does a good job of what it's supposed to do\nWhich is great well I can get in places you don't want it to be\nYou know folks talk about his basis bases in [laughter] but but we won't Bermuda grass to be a vase we feed cows goats and horses are Bermuda all the time so we want it to grow and be a little invasive for for livestock purposes and same thing in turf is we want to recover for athletic fields and lawns and in ... we're we're putting wearing traffic on it so\nWe want a little bit of that characteristic with it\nI Wonder Scott if you could find an attachment on their tractors that somehow it would help you to kill\nThose again the ... and granted us but the telling might be what you need to do if you can find a filler attachment to rent or something like that and just fill it I think it's just right you got to have three at least for maybe inches we better get those always rooted route down and we looked pretty for you\nAnd you don't want to bear that is always grass when your planet and you'd bought a planet sometime next to April or may um and and you don't want to bury it did it doesn't need to be more than an eight maybe a quarter inch deep may times just pressing it into the soil surface is suitable so you want to prepare nice seed bed\nScattered across the top distribute your seat evenly across the top and then just precedent altered\nClinton thank you for your health this morning when I was I was always got a number four oh for eight seven to zero so and such again if you have a lawn or grass question Clinton walls University of Georgia is here to be or a servant Jeff coming with the question of Vermillion raw hey Jeff\nHey good morning hey good morning Jeff and Jeff\nI was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about annual ... a ... a little early because of the weather currently and I'm I'm just ... done part of my yard and all the dumps an annual rug rats until the spring and then seed a\nAnd most of his seat and seeds\nIn Bermuda and the spring and want to know a little bit about\nWell you've got a perfect plan right there uh Bermuda grass is warm seasons bases so it's it's going to do all of its work in in a spring and summer and early fall succeeding at right now you might would get German nation but then you get a good frost and you ... all those little Bermuda grass a seedlings that would come up so\nSeating with annual aunt or perennial rag ras this time of year just to stabilize your soil and preventing soil loss and erosion I'm as a temporary ground cover um is is an excellent idea a dish me what I like about that is if you do your site prep till you're saw seat it down\nAnd then spray ... say in March early April\nAnd then you can actually see it in to that rug rats and that ... will help hold that Bermuda grass seed in place such that if you do get some rain it doesn't move very far and you get a uniform standards that Bermuda grass comes up so that rock grass double can actually help you in the spring with your seeding as well\nUm with it but the the key will be is is doing your site prepped now in seeding into it such that you still have a a really nice seed bed but that I Would think about seeding Bermuda grass until\nTypically we say wouldn't saw temperatures are sixty five degrees and rising which maybe mid to late ... early may\n[noise] but what I was planning on doing as far as I have a lot of soul at the\nEnd of an annual are perennial perennial has a prettier color darker green color by relief textured um and and it has more of a similar growth habit to it a a consistent growth habit too it's\nGross habit to it a a a consistent growth habit to it so it may actually perennial regrets may give you a better look to your lawn while waiting whereas in Iraq grass we lie to green darker court or course relief texture in an ... inch insisting growth habit to it and um\nThe printing regrets maybe you're pretty or to look to it during the summer or during the wintertime so\nConsider that on this but you use it that helped me out you'd use either one of them they could work done great deal less because yeah the seven forty seven a new so WSBIU we'll be back after this\n[noise]\nSome forty seven and the glory carrier WIP twenty four hour traffic center that earlier crashed too many by south down ...
