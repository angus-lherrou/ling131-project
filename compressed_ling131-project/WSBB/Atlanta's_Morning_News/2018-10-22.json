Republican candidate for governor straight to have you on a plane as morning news case folks to show any [noise]\nLet's let's dig into what has become a national campaign issue Mr Secretary your opponent is telling you the architect of voter suppression or you suppressing devote\nAbsolutely not and I didn't uh suppress it in two thousand and sixteen before the presidential election when\nThese same radical people were saying that and certainly didn't in two thousand and fourteen when Stacey Abrams New Georgia project accused me of the exact same thing this is a completely fabricated story if you look at my record as secretary of state we have\nMore than one million people more on our voter rolls than when I took office we set a record this year by the way um it was very coincidental I think that they filed a several of these lawsuits right after we set the record so you know this narrative of me being a voter suppressor has been going on they've been\nYou know say in it and finally did something about it and get a you know national\nHeadline but the truth just doesn't play that out we have a record number of people on the rolls now minority participation in Georgia is a twenty three percent\nAnd under my tenure we created and push through the legislature own line voter registration were people literally if they have a Georgia driver's license or a state issued Georgia ID card\nThey can register to vote twenty four hours a day seven days a week my opponent voted against that legislation we have an electronic ballot delivery now where we can send military overseas voters\nTheir ballot by email cutting the time in half to absentee vote if you're an overseas vote or\nOr or a number of zahra armed services so that this is an outrageous claimed this whole fifty three thousand people ceased talking about um\nSeventy five percent of those people failed the federal match it's not the state match is the federal match because their last board their Social Security number did not match the individual on that that is something that was pre cleared\nUnder President Obama by the Obama Justice department you know Eric Holder in that crowd that was over there they pre cleared that because it's a federal law that we check that verification\nOr we got it approved the federal process so this whole thing is fabricated and outrageous several of the several thousand of the people that are on that pending list\nOr double their listed twice you know so we're not going to put that same person in there twice some of them are deceased voters that are going to be removed and once they're verified this is a way of keeping the voter rolls secure\nThe the first part of having secure accessible fair elections in Georgia's they got to be secure and you've got to keep the voter rolls up to date we are following the law Stacey Abrams\nIs accusing me of following the law she's fabricated this story\nAnd look there's I think fourteen Fifteen Percent of the people that are on this list Scott they're held over from two thousand and fourteen from the New Georgia project two thousand and fourteen that just think about that\nThey didn't vote and fourteen they didn't vote and sixteen and they haven't yet it voted in Eighteen and she's blaming me for them not being you know they're on the rolls there does have a a verification problem that they haven't\nUh gotten to yet and all these folks have to do is just like you and I go to the polling location showed their photo ID showed their state id and they can vote in this election so this is a completely fabricated story so the bottom line is you're following the law [noise]\nOh absolutely I'm following the law and if you look at my record is well this is what so you know really just hilarious about this whole narrative are in really quite frustrating to the press is not written the truth about this\nUm story but you look back they said the same exact thing into thousands sixteen before the presidential race we had a record number of votes and record turnout for that election in two thousand sixteen if you look back at Google you can see they did the same exact thing column in voter suppressor\nThey did the same thing at fourteen and they're doing the same thing now\nAnd then uh we're we're also going to continue\nTo make sure that we're we have local control you know I Believe that folks in local communities\nThe folks in local communities know best how to take care of their kids and it is a very different than than my opponent she wants to you know she wants government run schools for everybody she doesn't support school choice like I Do when it comes to things like\nThings like private childcare facilities in early learning programs in pre K.\nOr she wants to give the hub scholarship to those that are here illegally which are literally bankrupt the system that is not going to be good for our state and I can assure you that's not something\nThat I Believe that Zell Miller would support so there's a lot of big issues on education but we're very excited about the plane and went on to pay for the next what you know I'm not I'm not being honest and raise you know ... and unlike unlike my opponent I'm not promising the same pot of money to a bunch of different groups or every government program that she wants to have\nWe been methodically gone through and looked at the additional revenues that we have coming into the state as well as my plan\nTo implementing a spending cap so that's why the population and inflation so we can continue to grow roses state but we don't grow too much we spend our money wisely and we budget conservatively but we can properly funded things that we need to do\nIn public education health care transportation infrastructure\nIn uh in public safety and that's why I Know that the six hundred million dollars for the five thousand dollar pay raise we can absolutely do that and then we're gonna do it\nWe have forty four percent of our teacher Scott they leave the profession within the first five years that's one of the biggest issues that I've heard from every one\nThat's um in in the school environment
