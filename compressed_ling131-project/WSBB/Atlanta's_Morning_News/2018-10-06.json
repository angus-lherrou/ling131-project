H is that\nA tag when I first ...\nCannot have reliable good teachers without spraying\nOkay so far as I Do get a spray or get a little bit of gallons for you know\nSecond thing the most important for you do is not when the insects are noticeably Abbott when the ... free blooming blooming you get a disease called brown right and they can take the flowers\nAnd if you protect the flowers from getting the brown Ron then you're way ahead of the game with getting diseases and the teachers but you don't want to kill the beef is obese or they have to win the bees are around palm letting the flowers so you can't use anything but a bunch of side like um what\nIs anything but a bunch of side like um what kept ten ... a couple of find yourself ... ... am one of those are fine but just spray the trade when the blooms where most of open and then one more time when the ... most of them falling off\nSo that's the timing of the fungicides asking the blues are gone these are gone obviously and so you can then start spraying was this a mixture of despite carry it makes you have a home mortgage for yourself\nOr did you try to find yourself in the insect\nOkay so you get the orchards ... spray that whenever says on the label writing like\nThere's a little charred on the back and it says for patriots and it tells you when did ...
