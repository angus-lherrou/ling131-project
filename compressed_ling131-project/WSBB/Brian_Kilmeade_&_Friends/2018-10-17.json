one leaving a some judges were confirmed to so they can get out of there but Katharine Glenn Simpson arrived I understand on Capitol Hill\nGoing Simpson president the head of fusion GPS is there any doubt in your mind he's going to show up and take the fifth\nWell he already indicated through his attorneys are that he was going to take that to questions about that dot CA\nHas he got it to the FBI in the spring and fall at twenty sixteen\nAnd then after the election using a Justice Department official and what role it\nPlayed in securing the surveillance warrants for Trump campaign aide Carter Page when Simpson had hoped\nTo avoid today's testimony on the basis that he would take effect but the committee insisted on having him appear under subpoena and he's now going through that very laborious process at going question by question\nAnd then taking other steps so they have a an under oath paper trail of symptoms are refusing to answer these questions\nSo where is the contradiction from his original testimony who's ramping up\nOkay go bruised or is it just department official and he was used by Simpson and former British spy Christopher Steele as a back channel to get the ... to the FBI after the election November twenty sixteen and you can see and bruised\nOr the emails and know that there was contact the Simpson\nAs early as August twenty sixteen but Glenn Simpson told another house panel that he didn't get involved with or until well after the election so that's\nA big disconnect but Glenn Simpsons problems are much deeper than just the disconnect with Bruce or what we've been able to see in our reporting is that more than a half dozen sources connected to fusion GPS or the law firm that was working on behalf of the DNC and Clinton campaign and\nOthers for shopping dot CA to the FBI almost creating what critics call an echo chamber so every time it came to the FBI\nTo another source it would lend more credibility credibility pardon me to what was opposition research by\nWow um and of course a James combing basically said didn't really think the dossier played much of a role\nModel it ... that may be his condition but at least when you look at the surveillance applications that have been declassified you\nCan see that the ... was one of the top line item in the application and that it was not the only item\nBut it was certainly a significant item that was\nOnly item but it was certainly a significant item that was used to secure the original surveillance warrants in October of twenty sixteen and on the way into the session today\nI showed a series of questions to Glenn Simpson including why was he taking the fifth but also more specifically whether any parts of the da da ... ever been verified and he did not answer that question nor the final question which was as someone who worked in a ... as a journalist in the past\nHow was refusing our question today really consistent with his own experience\nNo but it doesn't budge on this but I guess he's hoping the Democrats give the house who ... stops right\n[noise] well this is certainly the view of Republicans they've said very uh locally that they think the goal has been to run out the clock with the hope that the Democrats take control and that's the end of the um investigation\nOr the other issue that's really up against the clock is whether that same committee will issue\nA subpoena for the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to secure his testimony over these allegations he discussed recording the president or removing him from office\nIn twenty Seventeen that someday Rosenstein denies but even even more importantly what he knew about the dossier and other intelligence when he signed off on one of the surveillance weren't renewal a in October twenty Seventeen so it's not just\nUm what he said about the president but it's also his role or in the surveillance of a Trump campaign member\nOr a couple of things now I understand that any McCabe is being looked at a because he might have a he might have leaked information out about Michael Flynn's not telling a not telling the truth about whether we talked to Kislyak or not where's this story going [noise] well\nNew records or have been released and what's been happening in the background that there's been\nAn inspector general's investigation that's been ongoing at the Justice Department we had\nThe review about the Clinton email earlier this year but the inspector General Michael Horowitz told reporters at that time that he was also looking I'm at political bias in text messages he was also looking at whether there were a regularity and securing the surveillance warrants\nDuring the presidential campaign and then also specifically the leaking of classified information and based on the record that were made public even then you could see that there were multiple strands to the ... going to a very senior people within the FBI so McCabe really has a lot of\nLegal jeopardy right now it appears with the leak investigation but she's also a in front of the grand jury here in Washington DC\nFor lying to federal investigators about a week the wall Street Journal that dealt with the Clinton Clinton Foundation\nBut yet he's still releasing a book so I don't know if that's going to help his cause or not\nThat well that's been that's been a delayed the review by by the FBI um but what I Would say not as as offensive medicate but a contacts on one of the takeaways I have from the last\nSix months or looking at this issue is that\nIt's not the only one who may have been using leaks for Strategic reasons I mean director Comey\nTestified publicly up and he specifically to mellow out\nTo the Columbia University professor to kick start a special counsel on the Russia probe and what we know from our reporting is that it leads to wind up those memos contain classified information so the question is whether director call me will be found guilty of mishandling classified information\nAnd by the way we used to stroke in Lisa Page in a Peter drug also going back and forth about how they put stories into the press and celebrating it\nAnd get to the bottom of the general Mattis situation these are some of the assignments I'll give you what else do you do or so you don't forget\nAll effects so large that great advice the brunt of it just about ... [laughter] skill made against ... thank you so much so you'll do great that sort of [noise]\nI got one eight six six eight seven six six on we're talking about three things really oh we're talking about what Katherine Harris\nJust leapt off where Glenn Simpson is out behind closed doors taking the theft on every question answered by this uh by this Republican committee\nKeep in mind this investigation stops if they lose the house and if you're smart you do these two things we talked to John McLaughlin was opposed over Donald Trump and by far the best thing Republicans could run on is something they're not and that is\nWhat will happen when Nancy Pelosi is your speaker her approval rating for this country thirty percent\nIt was less than that when she was actually speaker run through what she did last time how we'd affective she was in polarizing she remains and then you say what is not going to get done if she's there one of which is to find out what the FBI was doing it is higher levels to stop the president\nBeing from winning election and then once he got the election and now we\nIs it in being from winning election and then once he got the election and now we find out what McCabe gun combing gun a Baker gun struck gun page gun who's left Bruce or suspended or excuse me demoted\nYou're getting closer and closer to the answer and what I Will be running ads on what's been revealed already and what stops in its tracks and who's going to stop\nSome rogue agents next time and the FBI if they have a political agenda and they want to stop your Kennedy and I'm telling you I Will be justice teed off it would I found out that after Hillary Clinton won the election they're working behind the scenes to set her up for some type of scandal\nThat's what they do and President Trump\nThere's got to ... with Russian next thing we got a special pro we're starting to understand how the heck we ended up with Robert Mueller we still do not know\nSo that all stops\nQuarter page is one that they fired got ... or I kept getting a renewed and they were following him because they thought he was a Russian agent even though he'd work with the FBI because he had taught in ... spoke in Russia and he had some contacts there\nBut Carter Page is suing keep him on the ... weren't or quarter page keep in mind they kept renewing and they have no charges\nIn a probe that puts an ankle bracelet on Rick Gates put a put a Paul Manafort in jail a ruins the career of Michael Flynn or put fat but apple is in jail for a day but destroyed decide for the last year and a half of the top of my head\nAnd I told the Russians were never going to show up until they were diamond Carter Page was followed surveilled by the highest ranking people and they got nothing ... thirty five\nYou know it goes beyond any damage as or any you know financial aspects I mean there is just been so many lives as you're alluding to and\nYou look at the damage to our democratic systems and you know our institutions of government\nAre back in twenty sixteen I'm just\nTrying to get some justice in terms of getting some disclosure [noise] if you look at some of the prior dodging dot CA cases like Mr who bar as\nHe's the one that actually got some of the biggest uh information out there that you know senator Judiciary Committee and house intelligence committee had been basing a lot a lot of things on Internet ...\n[noise] so keep in mind to ah George Papadopoulos on Twitter finds out this whole thing started when ... decides he's going to come out and blast a blast prime minister Cameron for blasting Donald Trump\nSo Papadopoulos says is on the foreign policy committee for the Trump and he's twenty eight years old and he decides because he's got some power he's got a blast back a camera and on behalf of Donald Trump they don't like that Britain say started looking into it and it seems as though perhaps you could put these two and two together they set him up\nAnd they give them some information for professor ... who is meeting with that professor ... we thought it was a multiple passers teach you got to London University now defunct and then at that time he says you know this whole record in email thing is getting big the Russians got a whole bunch emails already to drop it\nNow Papadopoulos gets his information and invested or downer of Australian 'cause to them they started talking about a few drinks and he says what do you know about this Hillary Clinton email it goes I hear that's going to be big things coming out of Russia\nNow down or keep that information says you told them Papadopoulos now who took ... now miss it why would he carries a multiple fester teaching in London both turns out not really turns out mixed it is that a Russian agent doesn't that Russian contacts he works for Britain\nSo if you give Papadopoulos information and then send somebody up to ask him for that information it looked as always looking intelligence with Russia right combining to find out that Russia's got Hillary's emails and they're about to drop\nDown to earth there's given millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation missed it works for Britain who is being ally against Donald Trump we know the government is which is now the pose and Theresa May probably hates them just as much but that's a side for them so they asked was do you ever give up information about Russia to uh to another agent\nSays now to go got you know why because ... down and says you did\nIn retrospect you say yeah I made a mistake you got one day in jail now he's realizing how he was set up he's going to be coming in and I hope to drag 'em up the radio on the twenty six after he testifies and he's going to expose what's been exposed to him so far but if you look at all these things that took place in all the people that are around\nYou wonder why the mullah ... was even among the pro and now it's gotten totally out of control\nAnd have the Australians work with the Brits to set up Americans who actually work for Donald Trump why the president and got word for Britain not to unveil the ways that the the information that led to this investigation they said it would jeopardize your relationship with our good allies\nAustralian Britain ... how would they showing to be well the the will to us time with the listening on FM news talk Ninety seven one hate them\nYou're listening on FM news talk Ninety seven one eight to\nShare that this is talk of slack off\nA dossier of a search it see on the bed what is your clock I'm like money spent on this I'm like oh\nI think he's ... maybe Fifteen million\nLives ruined over let's just see [noise] you're telling\nMe you um I listen to the Russians were trying to mental they say no to Facebook ads but the whole premise of Donald Trump being illegitimate because of Russia I Hope we understand that that is not legitimate my senses you getting to see the president you know what the president never going to like the president is fine\nBut for those who are waiting for him to be productive and change its tone you seeing it\nHe's not perfect he's Donald Trump but without the Russia probe hangovers hitting the luge intimacy being questioned every day by a by dozens of members of the press maybe a hundred\nHe's able to function campaign and do his best he can to defy the odds and keep the party in power in power for the next two years of his presidency\nIs pretty impressive because they're both in play considering all the things that they said that Donald Trump is done that would destroy his presidency and his party it's pretty amazing that they basically locked up the house spirited and picked up some seats excuse me ... and they got a shot at the house\nI'll come back and take your
