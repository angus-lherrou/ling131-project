Fifteen thirty is your\nLiability alright then you've got your own medical or that the uninsured motorist pays that you have a comprehensive Paula stuff\nThat's out for them out\nSo far I got it All right and so All right All right watch\nOkay far enough to get Fifteen thousand dollars of medical insurance company will pay and ah they're they're willing to pay the Fifteen thousand\n[laughter] read for injury you know that okay\nAll right when I got it All right so one inch alright good enough for a Fifteen thousand dollars okay now I understand All right so what's your question\nOr not wanting to pay more for the time I had to move money\nAround and they're not willing to pay any more than the Fifteen thousand is that correct\nNo they haven't offered that they're not allowing a\nClue or aren't so what do you mean they're not allowing you you're never going to allow you to do what\nThey had insurance like for the other\nYou know I understand the insurance companies they know they're not willing to pay though what you're claiming that you do your road\nGet it so what's your question insurance companies just says no we're not going to pay that amount of money we're going to give you this that they offer you any money yet at all\nThey have not and it's been a year and a half ago yeah but you're but you're still treating correct\nYes that otherwise I have to pay for treatment and now at a gym that I Would have to pay on my\nUh alright but there wasn't any more than what they're not going to pay beyond the Fifteen thousand\nRight they have not paid that are offered that amount\nAll right then you then what you end up is you end up suing your own insurance company under the uninsured motors policy\nWhile I was going to the person that hit\nAnd I know but what good is that do\nWell he would have been I should write\nFor exactly so where do you think you're going to get money from ... how much money you think you're going to pay you\nUninsured no license\nI don't know but my question [laughter] one I had no doubt and I was going to let that when I met with a ticket and said they had their bat so I planned on file in at night tend to have information\nOh God what why you don't need any of that you have if you're already in touch with the insurance company insurance company is already\nThat touch with the insurance company insurance company is already accept the fact you're not liable is that correct\nAll right so now you're only ... only talking yeah the damages and your insurance company doesn't want to pay Fifteen thousand bucks okay so you're turning around assumed that now you can sue the other driver\nOr who will of course not answer or you'll get a judgment and ah then when you don't collect your judgment venue to your own insurance company three years down the road to just go to your own insurance company and say here\nAt this point we forget the other driver your insurance company will go after the other driver under a subordinate Asian claws\n[laughter] what I found out and found\nNo matter at this point yeah I Know I Know but almost never artists are ah one's filed and by the way for people that don't know which are ones that you have to file there's more than five hundred dollars for the damages both sides have to firewood and with the DMV and who cares\nA war with the state of California I don't even know what agency file it doesn't matter so let's get away from the U.S are one cause that changes nothing\nRight what you have is you have a driver who was uninsured you're uninsured

trained\nHe uses them yeah you show them what did I think what what what did you hear me say\nThat's correct that's it\nUh-huh oh okay excellent thanks for listening you're a wonderful human being happens all the time shortcomings say no\nWe're not getting that much I Want five thousand I'll give you a thousand but but what do I do you still don't know I\nBelieve me insurance companies fight

I didn't know it fell so how do you know how do you know those stolen than\nWhat they got the ticket that whenever I get well and they have to do it they\nMay have been ... it may have been stolen how about you just didn't put the sticker on\n[noise] [noise] no I I think are on my car\nOkay so uh so when you got a ticket for not having your sticker on the license plate or they ticketed you for not having your sticker on your license plate even though you put it on you say\nYes I just don't like I wasn't aware\nOf what was stolen I don't understand that\nThe sticker was stolen from whom by whom\nDo it from the license plate\nOh I I weigh one took the sticker off your license plate\nOr I don't play yeah\nOkay got it and that was confusing as hell thank our cleaning that one out for me oh God limit the time ... time okay and the court just didn't believe it because you didn't put a police report right\nOkay with it of course I didn't I wasn't I didn't do it All right and now what what's your question\nAlso also and different to their response was that they took a picture of the like a play on a ... well they said that while she would have taken out a final cut it back All right when you're so what's your question like question is should forget\nAbout yeah yeah I mean what how much is a ticket I don't have an older couple of dollars are going to be a lot when I hear you you go to court I Would just pay it but\n... you may have an argument and you go in front of a judge Ito your honor here's what happened\nA B C and D and die they said we should have filed a police report who helped ... police report over a stolen sticker on a license plate because once I put the sticker on a license plate like every other human being in the world who pays attention anymore\nWithout that microsecond everyday\nYeah exactly I think it does I think paying it's a decent decent defence a shirt tell her to a judge 'cause the worst of happened you'd have to pay for the chicken anyway or\nI mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most insane defenses you've ever seen and and the fun one where ah the people come up and they say guilty with an explanation\nAs if the judge chairs you're they're guilty or you're not so whenever you see someone guilty when the next when they are depending on the judge or if the judge allows the person to explain just to get it off his or her chest\nBecause our our attorney they bought a new home and they they read anything they\nSaid okay I'm Laurie ... All right fair enough and how much money or does the power of attorney person have control over\nAll of it probably at least five hundred for seven hundred thousand\nAnd a lot of it may be gone so ah what ... yeah so I if first of all I tried to police\nAnd if not that a a lawsuit a that's a where of\nCourse there'll be a judgment you get that person and hopefully the police will get involved because it's simple fact\nThat's what this is this is stealing money uh this is a and the argument is fraud became power of attorney under false pretenses if you can get the da and balls if you can get the cops and ball that's going to help you a lot otherwise you go to a trust in the state attorney and try to get what you can first of all the account has to be frozen completely\nThat's the first thing is how do we\nGet all ... yeah yeah yeah you know I get a lawyer this is this is one where it's a above your pay grade\nYeah you're going to need even in need of trust in a state lawyers figure this one out instantly and you want to get one like tomorrow kind of thing and make a motion to freeze everything pending and this is where you go into court or with an emergency order and uh that\nThe U.S court to freeze which which the court will do and then you start trying to figure out how much money this person has stolen\nA from your loved one yeah it's no fun when that happens ...
