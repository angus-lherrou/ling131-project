him saying that they should come in legally they stand in line but now they changed their to\nThis is what I say America First just like President Trump said you know what when there is no homeless shelters here in America and there's no starving people here you see what's going on in the streets or California sleeping in these tent cities\nWhen we take care of America First then we can worry about other people if not we're not going to have a country without any border\nSo get a Michael John W. P. T. F. in Raleigh North Carolina hey John\nThank you sir I I figure it out the reason why the Democrats do not want to stop the quote migration our invasion from the south and it goes back to after the civil war\nThey suppressed black voting but they still count it all the black people in the south for representation in Congress so non voters kept the Democrats in control of Congress all to the Trump Korea\nNow they're attempting to go back to their roots as it were by bringing in an invasion from the south of non voting Hispanics who will be counted in the two thousand twenty cents is ... and therefore being real portion giving the Democrats more seats in Congress from non voting people\nPossibly I don't even have to figure that grand of a plan Richard listening in Montreal Richard\nHi Brian I just want to talk about the media and the Democrats are blaming President Trump for what happened in Pittsburgh\nAs a Jew I'll tell you there's been no president more pro Jewish or more more pro Israel to this president and that's one of the people of Israel Jews in Israel love him and in the ... congressional district in Minnesota who's running for the Democrats yuan Omar who's\nCalled Israel evil and where is Chuck Schumer and ship heard George Jewish and CNN and MSNBC all\nCovering that up that's a disgrace and they're they have the nerve to accused Republicans of being anti Semite when they put a candidate like that that will cause Israel evil or were you her tweet Israel has hypnotized the world and they all week and the people and help them see the evil doings with Israel could you imagine if a Republican and we'd have better\nHow about this can you imagine is a former Republican president was on stage with Farrakhan minister anti Semite anti termite he hate you'd be literally he lives in breeds hate Jewish people and there was President Clinton sitting there and read the Franklin's funeral day\nAnd you give me a agree blueprint to have this would be because what happens is is president who's so unorthodox in many ways an atypical in many ways also is an international business person so when he is Saudi Arabia goes to rent a four in Trump Tower years ago he's not even running for ...\nThe poor in Trump Tower years ago he's not even running for president\nSo that and that is why if maybe maybe an examination of this completely exonerate salmon it's fine he doesn't have current ongoing financial interests with them but if he does that's a real issue\nI and I think people should know that that that's all I'm saying ah you know if if the Trump Organization through through Eric and John junior continues to do business um that has had ties and may have current ties and we're not entirely\nCertain um but all those monuments cases you know the people are bringing as the president ... those have them all listed you can go to cruise website you know but that's a that's a concern that they never separated from interests with aren't connected to foreign governments\nAnd that foreign governments obviously Brian would be interested in trying to buy influence from the Trump family I mean that that's goal number one\nRight yeah but there's also was a big worry about anybody that ever does business who wants to run for the White House when you think\nWell you know what they'd better you know what cut ties before you take that job that's I'm Sorry those are two separate those are two\nSeparate leaving you why did cut ties with the Trump Organization still exists\nPresident Trump has not severed his ... his uh his connection to the Trump Organization it continues to profit from that business\nHe continues to be connected to that he never officially separated from it who's really running that in a blind trust\nAnd you know what I can tell you that it is serious question first skeptics of what's going on with this coziness with Saudi Arabia\nThat the Trump family whether it's papa or sons continue to have interests\nThat are connected to Saudi Arabia I'm not the only one asking this question I I think that the next time someone wants to run for president after President Trump if they'd been in business they better go bend over backwards to divest\nAnd just connect and disengage so that we can rebuild the trust of the American people who for decades before President Trump took office have always believed and you know prime they come up to you on the street and tell you this\nAnd me that it's all about money that no matter which which person which parties running the government\nSomehow there on the cake\nAnd we have to build back this trust and we can't be doing business foreign governments while we're conducting national security\nAlso see I don't know what they are but the house Democrats who said issue fifty two subpoenas that were blocked by the Republicans is there a theme to the subpoenas or they just all over the place\n[noise] [noise] oh no they're all they're all or they have everything to do with a ... it's everything it's like health care and and all these different policy issues along with it sort of the ethical um the the you know the group of ethical questions that range as we've just you and I have discussed\nBefore throughout the cabinet it's not just President Trump but it's what people are allowed to do at the cabinet level\nAs well so um as I think you and I talk on our last conversation they're going to jump on Ryan's again Wilbur Ross ah an interior and commerce shore and um but but the the fifty two subpoenas are on oh my God environment you know on a million policy questions\nAlong with ethical conduct right\nUm so you have do you see a Ryan Zinke he used to live and different investigations into him Wilbur Ross will have explained to do that if Democrats win the majority not only about a potential insider trading and conflicts of interest with testimony to Congress they may not have been truthful about those discussions\nRight there is an ongoing um there's a debate about whether or not it when he testified to Congress and was asked about this uh censorship sorry the I'm a citizen question on the census\nWhether or not he was forthcoming and he later said that he then recalled a conversation with Steve Bannon about creating a citizenship test I mean a question on the on the census and not um\nThat he basically his spokesman as explaining that he didn't really understand what he was being asked when he was being asked that but that will I just I'm telling you that will be a hearing\nRight immediately because that's a you know the census is ... is a huge political issue um along with citizenship and you know the the whole fight over immigration sort of writ large\nEnough to go going after Kavanaugh would not be wise more than likely right\nJust think it's I think it's really hard to prove they were these misconduct complaints that were forwarded from the up from a a judge on the on the district a court of appeals ... the story broke an hour before the Senate votes maybe two thirty on that Saturday and the vote was at\nFour o'clock sharp um that he had sent these complaints to ah the um chief justice John Roberts the Supreme Court that having nothing to do with Dr Ford but concerns\nThat a he can to his conduct in his compartment in those hearings were not worthy of a justice of the Supreme Court same complaint that retired Justice John Paul Stevens made about cabinet that he's too partisan\nAnd that he uh you know he he was um\nAnd that he uh you know he he was um you know not measure not judicious not impartial um in in his in his testimony that day but also this other complaint was that he may have perjured himself before the committee on his first set of hearings when will be for Dr Ford ... about his service in the Bush administration\nPerjury is very hard to prove and if they want to poke around and they really think a good standing for for for that um you know maybe there needs to be a new process when we you know go through confirmation hearings for the next stress the\nSupreme Court no matter which party is controlling the Senate but I Do believe that trying to take a ... a justice off of the Supreme Court um who obviously as qualified may have done the wrong thing in his confirmation hearings\nAnd will always be stained by that but to remove him I just think it's incredibly divisive and destructive and I think it's it's it's not the right\nThing to a new list and I think it's really handy to list for both sides for Democrats or Republicans to read your column\nBecause given idea of if if the Democrats have it for at least two years what they should be in ... with the more than likely will be investigating what they're able to investigate with this type of the ledger will be there any positive worked it could be done\nWell see I Do think it's positive if there's some needed oversight on on um on conduct because I think the president is running a swamp we discuss this before I think it's been\nJust unbelievable what's gone on the blurring of the lines the trampling I'm of the rules and I think the oversight of that is very important I I I I make the point in the column that I think that ... going into an impeachment drive 'em before a special counsel tells us\nThat he actually obstruction of justice for you know we did anything um that would merit impeachment I think is just is is it that enormous overstep that will cost them the presidency and twenty twenty and just you know further degrade our discourse and and our political situation I Do think that turning up\nI mean it is the job of the legislative branch no matter which party is running it to hold the executive branch accountable it is a separate and co equal branch because we're not a third world dictatorship and\nPresident we run this country and you would be a die without overstepping is really helpful\nBut do you think that if they want to get the Senate and give the president said they got to show they can not only investigate the legislature and what about infrastructure what about immigration reform where do I have a combined deficit program where in Twenty years were were knocking down instead of building it up and a buddy handling a higher\nAlways obviously hopeful about the ways that the parties can work together and they're not always you know sharing our priorities but I Do believe the areas that are potentially um you know write for compromise are a prescription drug pricing and I and I think infrastructure and I really hope that they you know\nThey don't have huge budget fights that lead to a government shutdowns\nI don't see any kind of agreement on immigration coming because the ... the Democrats aren't going to get the Senate they're going to get the house by four seats if they get it [noise] um I think if the Republicans hold on it'll be by you know for seven seats to I think it's going to be incredibly I'm slim a week old\nSon and already we called for either party and not can create opportunities for consensus or it can just be a disaster but I think I Hope immigration and some prescription drug work as possible immigration is just a fight that both part the Democrats are leaning far too heavily on immigrant rights\nPresident Trump is fleeting far too heavily on the fight he was his his bill in the Senate Brian got fewer votes from Republicans and Democrats combined than any of the proposals he took for positions on the grid lock down the house he made it clear to ... he didn't want the DACA deal he doesn't want to do it wants to fight for twenty twenty I see no hoping that issue in the next two\nYears yeah I'm going to be I'm going to just give you a scenario you ready yet he won two years didn't do anything because he feels as though I had the house I have the Senate if I give and I'll look weak whatever you did whatever calculus he thought he didn't go for it but if you lose the house\nAnd see he gets an offer that deal again from democratic leadership above hey I'll give you the wall or you get ten year a ten year a path on DACA\nMaybe takes it and he goes gosh this is what

president's whole modus operandi or is to divide us uh he gets up in the morning when they went inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year he's saying things to bring us a a into conflict with each other\nRight and Adam ship is really done a great job rallying the nation around the president has he with his nonstop Russia innuendos and make the president looked\nIllegitimate please don't tell me by age the California congressmen who with a tradition holds in history has something to learn from a will be chairman of oversight or will say\nOh let's go out to Scott listening in Florida he's got\nA Brian Scott I'm I'm I'm the guy that call friday on the black that yeah that was a stolen\nThe problem I have there's three things I have problems with first is politically correctness yup it ... and his allies the politically correctness that's in this nation of laws that prevent people from Delaware to\nWe all know block Obama is why we all know that it will go walk a Baltimore that set the nation against credit\nThat Democrats have everything that President Trump is doing because he's heard of it as a regular guy and he showed a nation that you can do this job if you're not being paid for by where\nBut it also made us assumes certain kinds of burdens and allowed others to shift burdens to us that now Donald Trump is saying\nThis is not this is that where America what is going to be on my watch and this is not where America needs to be a globally we have so many our allies and partners who could shoulder more bird like NATO you have so many world hotspots in which the United states\nDoesn't have to send troops are put boots on the ground in order to deal with an hour to limit the the the destruction and the instability that results from took this new paradigm from the last hundred\nYears so Newt Gingrich had a different take not necessarily against us but he was ... marked within a last night on life liberty and lived in cars forty seven\nAnd so from because he was on his Republican and because he he he has no hostility to conservatism is just as we think about a much\nAnd here's an enormous hostility to political correctness and liberalism because it just doesn't fit how he thinks the world works uh and so I think we ended up with somebody who I I compare frankly there Andrew Jackson has one of the most disruptive presidents we've ever had because because\nAs one of the most disruptive presidents we've ever had because because he's not afraid to take on the establishment every single morning\nHey I don't disagree with that and the dimension of Andrew Jackson resonates with you obviously a and it resonates so I think with a lot of Americans who recognize that Jackson was he was kind of our our first real populist president who understood the relationship between American power\nAnd where America needed to be as a society and whereas directions and he gets a lot of bad press because of trail of tears and ... and I've written about the fact that Jackson is not the person should take the blame for\nWhat happened with all that but the point is is that if you if you compare Theodore Roosevelt view of America's role in the world in Donald Trump's\nOr they are I Would say if not identical certainly parallel in ways that I think Americans right now I began to realize we actually gained a great deal by this new approach to America's role in the world\nAnd the way you view that Teddy Roosevelt to in the beginning they thought this guy was to robots almost comical and the way he handled himself he was vice president thrown on the last minute to unify ticket I guess you have your tribe or a police chiefs I run riders up friar guy so and he was self promoting in many ways\nSo only help it and you know what ... and ... that that that that tweet Twitter is Trump's bully part puppet and it's a way in which he's been able to change the political dialogue in this country in extraordinary ways that we haven't really seen the end of the\nPeople who set them they didn't accept a Roosevelt in and he took on business by the way but it it didn't accept them really in Washington they never accepted Donald Trump he took his case of the people Teddy Roosevelt took his case of the people and they seem oblivious to criticism\nTotally and he is also the mistake that Roosevelt made was Nineteen twelve you split the Republican ticket\nAnd let Woodrow Wilson into the White House by running a against his own hand picked successor William Howard Taft because he didn't like some of task more conservative policies\nAnd that hurt him both as a figure within the Republican Party but it also open the door to someone like Woodrow Wilson and a progressive agenda both internationally and nationally that we are still trying to sort out and still trying to clear out today\nIs that Roosevelt gets his you know we'll McKinley gets killed yep right so he becomes president he finishes at McKinley term than wins reelection and then says he's done and then says he's finished in ... become handed over to ... in this country which was that in in anything if anything\nIt was in many ways a reversing some of Roosevelt overreach and the progress by especially in domestic politics but Roosevelt also keep in mind too he was our first real colorblind president you know he invited Booker T washing to come to the White House he was a firm believer also in the idea of what we call the melting pot\nRight not the end of hyphenated Americans he would look at the situation with the illegal immigration and sort of saying well we need immigrants who become Americans we don't need America as a haven where people come\nIn order to preserve and to maintain a political or cultural identity which has anesthetic all too what America represents where America needs to go so you know the\nPresidents are shortcomings you know his successors he's anything but traditional and he's he gets up every day he's a unorthodox to say the least but us somebody's historian\nAnd like David a of a David Hanson Victor Davis Hanson and others\nAre open and you know the general Keane just say okay I Know how things the only one but I'm open to see if this is going to work\nSo I'm just stunned to see the anti Semitism or the anti Semitic gunman walk into a synagogue kill a loving people in cold blood and people are drawn back to Donald Trump listening to Jonathan Weissman he's in New York Times jeopardy editor listen to this guy cut nine\nIs not over what is her and President Trump line we're not calling him a rapist we're not calling Lynn you sound like we don't know what I'm saying is the president has shown a reluctant time and time again\nTo his supporters and hit the order as Illinois that I'm not calling you a writer I'm just saying they think you're right that's right in that case where I felt like he is on their side and he got pushed back hard enough to say so what\nThis guy is hates Trump there so that yeah he hated Trump ... Israel Trump this Trump is eighty he's gets criticized because he's too tight with Israel\nIs a it's a guilt by association but it's so typical of the media's response to drop you know what they're\n... they live on Trump Trump has made them possible to maintain ratings to keep themselves in the public eye\nAnd the only way which they can deal with this is and they're declining ... relevance and declining influence that Trump presidency represents is to get more and more extreme or and become more and more unqualified and their attacks on him and in some ways you know I watch this with people that I Know\nAnd their attacks on him and in some ways you know I watch this with people that I Know who are never Trump hers and I've watched sort of ... if I'm going to use this expression washed their character deform as a result of this is a is there anger feeds on itself towards Trump\nAnd this has happened in our mainstream media look what's happened to the New York times and the Washington Post\nAh the decline of intellectual credibility which was never very high to begin with right on his\nUh end with the with the mainstream media and it's infuriating Brian to watch and I'm no I Know that you you see this happening to those who call themselves your peers but it's also tragic and I mean look at it already has nothing to do with\nWith Donald Trump it has to do with their own growing importance to shape the national dialogue and that drives me crazy\nA also they were wrong also kind of Donald Trump will never nomination Donald Trump will never win and he did all those things that I have\nAnd I had people who were ... hours in the summer who'd come to me at my office and sort of say do you think do you really think Donald Trump is going on and said yes I Do I think that the media is wrong I think the polls are off the mark here and I said\nAlso I said not only is he going to win I think would be a very good president he's actually exceeded my expectations from the point of view of what he's been able to accomplish and what he's been able to do\nHere and he okay he's a bowling a China shop but the American people said you know what it's time to break some Crocker and we need someone who's willing to do that and they sent down Trump them\nSo you are Michael Gerson speech writer for George Bush hates them rights everyday Abadi is you have George Will despise them doesn't want to be a Republican anymore you a Bill Kristol a someone whose dad really was one of the founders of conservatism and I know very well yeah and now Bill Kristol hates everything he does he can't do anything right by him\nGuys like Frank Luntz who were wrong so listen I was wrong\nYou know guys like Erick Erickson so you know I become I was in trouble but now I'm seeing what's going on and seeing how unfairly has been treated 'em\nBack in yeah so I give people credit you can be wrong but why you keep doubling and tripling down he's not going to get impeach he's got to finish for years he's already got a plan in place it's going to be easier to get another four there was his first for\nI think it will be and and also to there's going to be a deep bench of young conservatives including people like uh like John James the candidate Michigan who I think it's terrific and we were wasting President Trump and I don't know I think it'd be great go up there with ...\nYou know go go up to Detroit and doing event therefore for James but you got a deep bench of very able people men and women um who are going to be able to step into and who will\nFunction it that the level that Trump has in terms of the new paradigm of how politics works and what the idiot logical divisions are in this country any more\nI don't want to make the last statement to shore which have been going to own with so I Want to give us some like I Want to talk about the midterms\nAre there is some speculation that the president's given up on the house Jonathan wanted does a great job and ... said if you look at where the presidents traveling he's given up on the house I have a different view I Want to get Arthur Herman's view\nAnd the second also find out what book he's working on now there's and by the way his book is now at a paperback it is called Nineteen Seventeen letting Wilson and the birth of a new world disorder back in ...

I'm very happy with papal\nA that is for the United states ... about the fed and he says you know as our economy there's good and forecasters do well they raise rates and its robbing us or the momentum and nodding along is the co author of jumping on the inside of the America First plan to revive\nThis is the co author of inside the America First plan to revive our economy Stephen Moore Steven you think he was a lot of people are sitting on the president should not comment on this how do you feel\nLike I think he's right on the substance and I don't see anything inappropriate about the president who is basically the c._e._o. of our economy speaking out now that's not to say that that shouldn't be independent you just heard Donald Trump said he believes the fed should be independent but look\nThe economy is booming right now we were in the biggest boom in Thirty years we have seven million more workers than we have I mean jobs and we have workers and that's an amazing statistic\nSo the economy is booming and Trump is basically saying look there's no inflation why is the fed taking you know the old metaphor wise the job of taking the punch bowl away from the party just when it's getting going\nAnd I happen to agree with him on that look I don't want to see a return of inflation I Lived through the seventies I Lived through you know Fifteen sixteen percent inflation rights\nBut this idea that somehow this is a bogeyman inflation right now and food prices are not rising\nAnd there's too many people the fed who believe that growth and the economy and higher wages are inflationary now ... here Brian I nobody would tell you you say if the economy produces more apples the price of Apple's falls it doesn't rise growth causes lower inflation not hire and play so\nA white now you're looking at uh the market last week and a lot of people an upset stomach that's for sure of your points up three points down ... points down what's going on\nA I think there's a lot of profit taking at the beginning I thought there was a lot of nervousness about what the fed was doing look when interest rates rise than bonds are more attractive and sucks right I mean that's just simple a finance\nAh look I'm not a great stock picker or anything like that but I Will tell people this one great piece of advice ready for this ... ready\nBy low shell high fidelity people tend to do the opposite right they tend to you know when the markets crashing this is a good time to buy stocks they're cheap earnings are good or not and you're good now\nSo Stephen Moore Sherry's talking about his book Trump atomic now will the president's got his economy roaring he's got the revenue coming in the deficits or something else he's gotta tackle but a GDP is it three point five last time was four point to feel good about it but guess what somebody else is taking credit\nWhen you're about this economic\nRecord on on the job numbers come out moderate job numbers suddenly Republicans are saying some air\nThem actually those numbers are the same as there were two thousand Fifteen improve our sixteen\nReaction Stevens well about my luck liberals have a hard time explaining what's going on with US Economy because you should also play I Know you probably have the sitting your catalog\nWhen Brock Obama set a few weeks before the election how is Donald Trump's going to get us to four percent growth how is he going to revive manufacturing does he have a magic wand well maybe this president does have a magic wand 'cause we have revived manufacturing we have revised the mining industry and we have four percent growth and now they're trying to explain why this is happening now here\nRight and then they became lifelong friends so that that kind of forcing effective getting people from all different aspects\nOf our society is missing something I Want to get back\nTo not just nationwide but in our politics as well\nAnd they do indeed have a major role to play as\nFar as [noise] as far as every [noise]\nAnd\nWe all say this and also to Saturday but\nThe media's constant unfair coverage [noise] ...\nAnd negative attacks you know the [noise] only served to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate\nSo he took the argument at him and I thought it was very fair go you got the media's got to see a role here\nIf you watch CNN MSNBC if something happens good with the economy they don't talk about right if something's happened with ice has been decimated it doesn't doesn't wear reached the radar ... if something happens with the Mueller probe it leads are they lying no\nBut they're putting you in ordinance emphasis on things that they think is going to get them ratings that food drives him nuts\nSo that's right and and the bias in the media I tell people all the time isn't necessarily what they coverage what they don't cover what they ... how many people recognize him realize the president just signed a clean up our oceans ... to get plastic out of the oceans some of the biggest offenders are in Asia how many people realize that he signed\nSex trafficking legislation to do is to stop sex trafficking in its tracks that law enforcement\nHas been pressing for for years the veterans accountability act the veteran's choice ... all of these things people are getting done Brian I'm knocking hundreds of thousands of doors over the course of the last year year and people want results\nThey recognize the results that are happening in their everyday lives there looking past the rhetoric and that's just what we have to keep talking\nAbout the opioid to uh just passed on a bipartisan level of money to opioid abuse and treatment\nThat is right or not and not only more broadly but with our veterans a community as well many of them running around with Ninety pounds of gear on for decades are all over the world are living with chronic pain and they're getting addicted to opioids so not only are we going to a deal with it more broadly but we need to deal with it within the VA saying what they're getting done\nA colonel on top of that the one thing is and I've always said that is\nThe health care is did and you don't even hear about Republicans and Democrats when it comes to health care it's all personal that what kind of play do you have a and when you go to a hospital we go to a doctor what kind of care do you get how much comes out of your pocket he wouldn't matter what class you are it hits you so I I think Republicans kinda dropped the ball here\nBrian I'm a business owner and for the for the last six years I've had to look at my employees dealing with double digit premium increases year after year after year under Obamacare\nThese are people making maybe fifty sixty thousand dollars if you've got an eight to ten thousand dollar to ... you have to come out of pocket ten grand before your plan even kick then that's\nNot a plan that's a joke so so I proposed and talked about we have to get out the cost of care that the flow with Obamacare is and what not\nThat the flow with Obama cares and went after universal coverage and that's what Andrew Gillum and so many others free free free and nothing's free or if we're going after the cost tort reform portability of insurance selling across the state line prices which the president drug prices getting serious about Medicaid fraud and Medicare fraud that blowing up\nThe system that not only helps businesses like mind that helps individuals that helps it's the fastest growing part of our defense budget that's not aircraft carriers and planes it's health care costs and it helps our national data will what are you getting after the cost of care\nAnd when people say that the president has made moves to stop covering preexisting conditions what's the truth\n[noise] so what the Democrats are running on nationwide\nIs is a portion an amendment when they went after trying to fix Obamacare that basically said if you have a pre existing condition you were put into a high risk pool\nThe government and helps those individuals because obviously there are costs are much higher but for every one else it'll actually drive premiums down and drive their deductibles down\nIt section and a half years ... found the right here at high risk over here the government absolutely should help those I Am ... I Am absolutely for helping people with preexisting conditions we should there's two pieces of Obamacare that we're okay\nOne was that miners can stay on their parents' plan there was one one eighty six and two was that we have to take care of folks from pre existing conditions and the Democrats are essentially trying to scare seniors by telling them otherwise hair and a all Americans by telling them otherwise\nTo things on the twenty six year old because I'm seeing now my son's twenty two got a job offer them insurance and a guy that's rare and one of the reasons is when you're a company you have to hire twenty two year old if you have to give them insurance that too sometimes can be a deterrent to do I want to do that to an unproven person wouldn't take that risk\nBut would you do is if you take the pressure off the company and say that you know that person get stay on their parents' insurance that might for young business be aware score at Fox we could afford to absorb you make a mistake maybe the small business you can\nWell that's that's absolutely right it helps businesses like mind trying to grow a lot of these kids are going to start ups that are just trying to get off the ground and the most expensive part of their overhead\nIs exploding cost of India and so again we have to get at the affordability of care and that doesn't mean having the government take it over which is only going to balloon their costs look fry and for anybody who is telling you government run health care is the solution look at the VA twelve hundred hospitals and clinics\nThree hundred and sixty thousand employees their budget has doubled from thirty billion to sixty billion and yet veterans still are not getting the care that they need cook reporting\nLarry ... both say your seat is likely Republican Nate Silver at five thirty eight I'm a slip to twenty five percent the Democrats when you're about it's about a one or two point race who it's going to be who's got the indoor and it's a lot of people who've been in the Green Bay in that case so what are you ... issues that I think matters lots of people Florida but you know best healthcare matters\nNot take it away it's a fixed income security that matters\nAnd also this just in you might not know this according to Lucas Tom Watson who's who's respected by the Pentagon one of our reporters\nRoughly five thousand us troops us troops will be deploying to our southern border as early as Tuesday the reinforcements headed to the southern border will remain as support troops not combat troops\nCan you believe that we have to ... we actually for the first time maybe since Eighteen thirty six or into the Mexican war we have to put troops on the border to stop five to seven thousand people from storming in\nLess than mine two things one border security is absolutely national security\nAnd there are instances of Hezbollah working with Mexican drug gangs to infiltrate they're using tunnels they're using smugglers you know a smuggler who can move an immigrant or drugs can move WMD can move\nCan move terrorists can move all kinds of bad stuff\nBut you know on the on the legal side we have to reform that as well you know I sponsored an Afghan soldier who put his life on the line to fight with us he waited over five years he now has his family here started his own business\nI went to I was able to swear him in as a U.S citizen he was in tears but it should not taking fire here that's right it shouldn't have taken five years but you want to find someone who's angry about getting skipped in line by people coming across it illegally I talked to a veteran\nOr just the other day who is barely above the poverty line who's trying to get all the help that he can that he owed by all of us that he helped defend and he's like are you kidding me these people are going to come and be attacks\nOn our schools on our hospitals in our infrastructure we have a legal immigration system it needs to be fixed but people have to play by the rules we are a nation of immigrants absolutely but yeah we have to fix it\nAh when we come back with President Obama said about what a Michael Waltz is concerned about other will tend to girls going to be here he's running the sixth district in Florida we got stations all across Florida so if you have a question go ahead and pick up the phone one eight six six for all eight seven six six on this is the ...\nAre all eight seven six six on this is the bright kill me ...
