not news Ninety six five hey Richard\nMy issue is that there should try a thing as a state that version with in in ... in a port in the election looming the Democrats are managed to divert all the oxygen and the ... the cabin or hearing\nExperience is the fact unless you're Michael Jordan you're going to get cut from something you've got to be benched in something you have to deal with the

called competitive I more than a baseball town\nThere in a soccer town\nWork harder come back stronger don't tell me I'm usually better than those players in club soccer that's ... that's part of this suit and they have a letter saying he's better not not coaches eyes\nBut I Know Stewart Bernie how many people on your staff feel as though you treat them as their favorite and others feel as though they're being under appreciated I'm going to go and do some investigative work I'm not sure that now the what I feel underappreciated what did you sue you because they feel\nTheir head or stop already don't\nLet people on the panel that you like better than other people that they'll get to your favorites and then they have the authors sue you because they're being treated unfairly welcome to life

right and feel better now a Joe is let's say Los Angeles age oh got some brand new stations out there will tell you mine\nWell some great stuff just I mean this this trade agreement as revolution it's on the media is not even talking about two\nThings one the Chinese can no longer import cars into Canada quarter both on it and say it's a Canadian car\nThose cars have to be Seventy five percent in North America and that's it\nOne that's quite all of those American workers to now the Carter ... less than half of the living wage or sixteen dollars on those carts forty four percent of the products have to be made and ... people have to be just a a living wage of sixteen dollars anywhere in the Americas anywhere in North\nAmerica to know this was almost like a ... from Bernie Sanders was quick to the living wage for the last question for them to leave Mexico now why hasn't\nThe media wasn't the media creating this big labor coming out and praising Donald Trump who you know why it was her hip hop obvious that cares more about the Mexicans than the previous governments have\nGot the first deal with Mexico it shows you that biased but people don't want to emphasize that they show the wall has nothing to do with Hispanics that's everything to do with a secure border north is better off in the south it's not Hispanics\nOr we don't want to keep Hispanics out we just want to keep all eagles out because we have a legal process you and I get that because we're saying other people just want to marginalizing vilify but\nDonald Trump ... balance this when we start looking at this I Can't imagine any Democrat fighting this because do you know that in Mexico he basically fortified Mexican workers unions\nDo you know that he is going to help every ... lower middle class person get to middle class status because the wages will go up now we might pay a little extra for cars but the average American be willing to do that knowing that we're bringing some\nControl back to auto manufacturing and some plants back here or at least made it close but what about the dairy farmers to put this president in office they now or getting access to the Canadian market\nAnd not having the ridiculous tariffs and the only thing that Katie it's got that I could tell it sounds like you know more details than I Do is it this uh this the outside court to do to solve trade dispute is still\nIt's still a factor the Canadians wanted that we didn't we gave in there But Justin Trudeau gave in at the eleventh hour\nSo those people who say the president's just fighting with the world are not noticing that the world is coming to agreement and with the president said yesterday about Justin Trudeau is true you know he was tough negotiator uh we were going at it for a while but there's no hard feelings\nSo here's what the president said about uh Justin Trudeau and the NAFTA thing because I should give it a I should give it proper us dead um\nHe's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions that it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal to brand new deal it's not NAFTA re done it's a brand new deal I just spoke with him we have a great relationship but we're going to work as a partner\nAnd was keeping the steel and aluminum tariffs then I'm not sure why we're doing that when I asked a when I asked a Peter Navarro why you're leaving that end he says it's apples and oranges I don't get it I thought we did that to bring them to the table so about this deal and thanks so much for the call Peter Morici was on Fox and friends search this morning around four Fifteen that quickly or emailed\nA Eric to see if we could pull this off this is a bigger message to bigger message beyond North America cut forty\nHitter the Europeans said and this is important that you know the Mexicans agreeing was one thing but I don't think we're going to roll over like the Mexicans 'cause you know you you've got a lot of leverage their Canada\nWhich is really squarely in the European camps got a free trade agreements with Europe and Britain won't have this is a clear message to China\nAnd Europe that this president is serious about not putting America above all other countries are really America First but by putting America on an equal footing and giving American workers a fair and decent chance at competing in the world\nYeah so it was a mess because we are dealing with them on on some level by the way this just in march judge good friend of Brett Kavanaugh when he was in high school has a had an interview yesterday it wasn't done it's finished\nSo mark judge would definitely be on the on the hit list you have or the woman friend of a doctor for it\nUh the woman friend of a doctor Ford she's on the hit list Dr Ford might be I'm not sure they have hours of testimony with her and might not be necessary\nA stage with might uh with the one we saw yesterday I don't think she should be I think she's an absolute travesty of justice and if I'm a Democrat\nI tell them ... and his client you muddy the waters on the farcical claims from Brett Kavanaugh and you try it almost de legitimize is the other two the Debbie were mirrors the students and that's why\nAlan Dershowitz at one of the FBI investigation and I would have started with Julie not with the doctor for\nA NATO why because it's such a joke or Steve listening in Indiana Hey Steve\nHow're you doing great will tell you mine well I listen to your diatribe regarding the soccer kid that his mom is now suing because he didn't make JV was thrown out and I\nYeah I'm listening to the on the radio so I didn't see what was going on but I just wanted to point out I agree with you a hundred percent unless I find out you through ice\nThrough I I'm Sorry I I'm leaving on your own\nHey Steve I might have done worse in ... in high school I think I might have done something I Would regret in high school and college do you think anyone listening right now has done things in high school and college they regret\nI I couldn't be perfectly honest with you that I Walk the fence mostly through high school and college and I was fortunate enough to fall on the good side I turned out to be a pretty good guy a but I'll tell you I had some close calls\nYeah and a lot of people that say no no I'm not as if people say well what about sexual okay it's an accusation\nThat Brett Kavanaugh vehemently denies and he has a thirty year plus professional record which is the envy of almost every professional who is often the justice system on any level legal system on any level that I Know of\nSo you have to get him by going back to Nineteen eighty five while acknowledging from Nineteen eighty five to president which is a lotta years\nNothing went wrong so\nShe was assaulted at a party that she doesn't remember where she was how she got there how she left and who invited her\nAnd he doesn't remember her and mark judge doesn't recall any of this and our best friend doesn't remember anything why should we ruin somebody's life because Debbie were mirrors drink so much as a freshman she blacked out and has claims\nThat did that a judge Kavanaugh now did something exposing himself to her\nAnd now she has ten witnesses to it even though at the New Yorker magazine ruining fatter oh couldn't find these ten witnesses the New York times couldn't find any witnesses now you've got ten\nIt's amazing what could happen if the whole Democratic Party comes out in force for you [noise] Thanks Steve please I Hope you don't undercover an ice scandal in my ... and my background or next to let's go out to Thomas listened W. P. E. T. F. Thomas\nMorris or are you today great I've got a\nQuestion that nobody has asked this man has been on a quarter of of the ... years while I was just stuff not brought out twelve years ago while now\nI don't know I don't get it now because well if you believe her story she was with her beach friends in June so break Kevin on the shortlist and wonder if she should have come forward her beach friends couldn't give her good advice so she put it on the shelf for then since the ph D who has a speech friends decides to contact\nA congresswoman who contact say senator and they really are stupidly keep this", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "03"}
