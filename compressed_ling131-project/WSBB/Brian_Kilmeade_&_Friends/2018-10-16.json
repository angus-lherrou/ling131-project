[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n...\nWe've got the house with the Democrats\nGetting over the two hundred and Eighteen seats that they would need to take it if the election were today right now we've got the two hundred and twenty six seats in our model that number has been creeping up slowly over the course of the summer as long as we've been doing these battleground trackers but\nIt's still very heavily dependent on at least do things for the Democrats I just I Can't emphasize this enough its dependence on turnout among people who don't typically about in terms and it's dependent on a few meaningful crossover voters coming from having voting for Donald Trump to voting Democrat now\nCall right at the ... really good ... and just saying this is the way it stands right now however on the Senate side where Labor Day the Senate looked in jeopardy for upper Republicans now they're saying oh we got the Senate\nBut can we get the house and bought tradition and uh and history with me in Studio is John Sununu and Christian new new they're both very ah they're both very young looking men and ah they're both very suggest what politicians in their own right first off\nThat analysis what do you think a governor singing or ... John\n... listen to what his assumptions were people that don't usually vote in in off year off president you your elections have to come out for the Democrats are they they have been in my opinion confusing noise with enthusiasm and and the noise is on the fringe\nI'm not sure the noises all the way across I've been saying all along the Republicans will hold the house by a handful of seats\nThat would be as big a governor the Senate and the current governor ... ... I guess from winning because you understand that tradition you this is only happened two or three times a hundred and fifty years\nOld I mean is that it would be absolutely huge and again when you when you see strong candidates come out\nOf all across the country I mean even in in New Hampshire we ever or two seats up there we have a Eddie Edwards have very strong candidate with a military background or running and CD one Steve Negron CD doo sheets that boat traditionally I think people would say oh well they they can't win absolutely they can win in the poll numbers show at the enthusiasm is out there\nSo um I mean I I think across the country are you going to see a lot of races that just shocked people for the Republican and you just you and for me every two years you have to run for re every two years I have to run greater greater accountability I thought it was a great idea until it became governor and I really liked it stunk [laughter]\nTo raise money I got to ask people for help but a ... year die I mean that's really what it's about that live free or die spirit New Hampshire\nAnd I I'm for that except for the money part and the way you guys always have to raise money to the house members of the raise money I Know that's what he wanted to do they have to raise money if they want to stay in their job and after a while it's exhausting but am I doing their job and guess\nWhat if I give you money I have I have an ear towards the issue and you should listen to me and then you wonder about how do I ... at the same time be true to my donor\nRaising money stinks it's really hard I mean again I grew up you know we you didn't really ask people for help kind of took care of yourself but you have to remember when you ask someone to make an investment and that's what it is yes or a business\nLeader our family to make an investment they're making an investment in themselves because they want that change they want to a more into bloody for themselves more flexibility for their business whatever it might be so that's an investment for them to make an end when you walk through it it's it's wonderful to see people come out in in support you they're knocking on doors they're putting up signs all that when we do politics amount or\nJust new I Know you saw the bushes lately forty one and forty three uh I Know the Kavanaugh was something that brought the Trump the Bush family together because on an issue but not shoulder to shoulder do you see these two getting together anytime the Bush family the Trump family getting together anytime soon\nWhile I was so pleased that the but the George W. Bush work are hard to get the president's selection of Kevin ... across the won't count all over three times he\n... it many times and and and he\nCalled lots of other senators so I Hope that that does catalyze ah a return of a relationship between the\nUm but that's started to fall apart here a little bit toward the end I think Republicans have been energized in Arizona as in other places by Kavanaugh but this goes back to think back to the primary\nThe Republican primary how happy are Republicans right now I think that they nominated Martha McSally not Kelly Ward because ... to your point Marc mix Sally is she's she's cutting these ads about her service um she's being sort of a you know very I'm Down in the middle on on the issues\nAnd she's not I don't think she's able to be demonized and the same way that Kelly Ward would have been attacked by by Christmas in a couple of things\nAct um by by Christmas in a\nCouple of things I think I'm fascinated by this there were really cutting on gender lines because it's clear according to at least the ABC poll and then things that you hear\nThat on gender lines or the female vote seems to be going predominantly with Democrats and the male boat predominantly with by smaller margin with Republicans is this something can be done in the next three and a half weeks to change that if you're a Republican or Democrat [noise]\nNo probably not I mean we certainly that has been one of the defining features of this election right women were the gender gap as is at historic highs we've never seen it this high it's\nIn some polls it's it's thirty points or you know women are breaking for Democrats and the twenty to twenty five percent range men are breaking for Republicans in the five to ten percent range so it is it is to store but\nThat I think is is a little bit too simplistic it because women are not a monolithic voting block I mean those are carried women\nRight no I don't know how I'd never I haven't met two women that are alive\n[laughter] right so so it's it's particular groups of women that are breaking heart minority women single women breaking very hard for Democrats are married women and women without college degrees are much more in favor of Republican so you got to take a look at the state you got to take a look in a district\nOnly just tell you the NBC poll that just came out or the Democrats have forty three percent of the men boat and fifty percent of the women vote or they're Republicans a fifty percent of the mental thirty eight percent of the women vote that's how it breaks down the other thing I think is interesting is the president says you're voting for me\nHe saying would Brock Obama didn't say or tried to say and fell on his face but Bill Clinton was told to get off the stumping stopped campaigning actually hurting candidates on his Mitt terms uh I'm I don't really remember what Bush did on his but right now the president being a factor\nThirty five percent of voters said yes and and that's why I'm supporting him those who oppose him thirty eight percent yeah um boating just to oppose them twenty seven percent said it's not about him\nYeah look Mitt terms a referendum on President whether you acknowledge it or not Trump clearly acknowledging it but I don't think that's what\nThat was always going to be the case what's happened in the last ten days two weeks since a Kevin I'm hearing is not about Donald Trump it's about Republicans in the Senate it's about Mitch McConnell not being seen as sort of a hero for having the strength and courage to sort of push this through when\nYou know look what are the reasons Trump was elected was because Republicans were dissatisfied with Republican leadership they didn't like Mitch McConnell he had a terrible favorable approval rating among Republicans\nThat is completely flipped around now\nAnd it's unify the party so the energy coming not necessarily from from Trump but from Republicans in Washington\nYou know it's interesting too and you tell me if they're shows up in the polls that we know there's a lotta never Trump is on the right there was no I don't remember seeing any never Obama's and very few of aid to Bill Clinton when he had the impeachment thing lost some people seem to have gotten back\nBut when when when you Brett Kavanaugh you really had a Bush favorite son and when things got trouble for Brett Kavanaugh George Bush was working as hard as Donald Trump they were on the same page does that allow a road in for the never Trump or ... well\nIt certainly was the case and we saw anecdotally I'm ... you know you had folks like Brad Stevens who was one of the lead never Trump first come out with a column saying thank God for Donald Trump Erick Erickson who is one of the original never Trump or saying\nI'm voting for Trump twenty twenty because of this issue in particular so there are certainly anecdotal evidence to to suggest that the never Trump hers are now sort of have been have been welded Jew Jew Trump because of this issue but\nIt's not really showing up at the polls because they never traumas will never that big they were allowed but there were lab very loud I was saying because they are exactly cause they occupy spots in the media and the McCain exactly but but as far as how big they were as a percentage of the Republican base is it was never that big and so it's not it's not generating a big bump in the in the numbers for for Trump\nI been watching a lot of the rallies and they are even loud for rallies and especially when the cabinet things started heating up and they will be in an uproar is So Peter Baker of the New York times who I think it's fair and I also think he wrote a very ... bear book about Bush forty one Bush forty three cut twenty three I meet the press\nHas to Israel as this week in Iowa and in ah Pennsylvania and get a chart out of the crowd the crowd loves them there are thousands of people there there are people outside waiting to get him\nBut that can be ephemeral that can also be allusion Aretha any present as we know the fact that President Bush backing President Clinton and the fact that President Obama had big crowds during mid term elections they were not on about that lost a big seats and those are like I said this doesn't necessarily meaning but it does pumped him up and he's no longer in that sort of\nA restrained kind of like things are going to go bad a mode and he's on the fence rather than ...\n[noise] look I agree I mean you crowd times across can be deceptive\nAcross can be deceptive you remember in twenty twelve Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan had their final rally in Ohio and they had twenty five thirty thousand people I mean it was a huge deal everyone thought oh my gosh this is that look at these crowds\nUm conversely a but obviously it turned out not to be true conversely Donald Trump has huge crowds in twenty sixteen and that was sort of indicative of the movement on now look a bit of work down in Texas you generating big crowds there there's no question about it\nEarning big crowds there there's no question about it he's got energy energy in the bay but does that translate into votes I'm not necessarily and certainly not enough votes that he's going to need to win that race site or if you get your cigarette I have to run\nOkay then I'm going to give you my last question now okay I'm right now the FiveThirtyEight group says eighty percent chance Republicans hold the house and you can use me hold the Senate and increased elite eighty percent chance that house loses a house goes split because Democrats does real clear a echo there so\nWe we don't run models like that and we don't you do average ... we do average and we don't put statistical probability is on it but what we do one of the things that we do do is if we have these notes opposite maps so if the election were held today based on where the polls Dana right now\nAs I mentioned earlier in the house Democrats would pick up an average of twenty four and a half feet so they would win this they would when asked by one seat or Republicans would pick up two seats in the Senate based on what the polls stand right now so\nI live one more question Hispanics the big the big deception is a dispatch gonna run from the president because of his rhetoric on the wall and his uh problems with the immigration and can catch and release and things to that nature but it's not coming out in the polls why\nIt's not because again Hispanics are not a monolithic block monolithic voting bloc and what we're seeing in the data is that younger Hispanics or not has energized a vote but older Hispanics are an older Hispanics are more traditional more conservative um and and so\nThey typically vote more Republican which is why you're seeing Ted Cruz getting thirty percent tax is Dean Heller getting thirty percent of Hispanic vote in Nevada those numbers hold up\nUm it's going to be a bad night for Democrats I cannot give up that much of Hispanic so many states\nCombat and take so much real clear politics dot com or that's where to go if you want to find out what's

go there again a couple of weeks ago he was just over there in that region down south it is hurricane season after all\nA we're coming up a big interview the president what sixty minutes he's been forty five minutes with us on Fox and friends on Thursday night he was on with China and Bream he's been talking to the media every time he sees them\nSo he is very happy where he is right now explain it's not only Brian kill me saying it even some of his biggest detractors in the media are noticing he's getting more and more comfortable as president and his racket up a lot of victories\nIncluding the release of the pastor in Turkey without giving up absolutely anything including some great economic numbers the approval of Brett Kavanaugh and I think he just got another couple of dozen judges he's up to eighty four judges\nAs well as deregulation books in the markets are happy although the last couple of days but over the big picture a it's going well so before we get to Michael let's get to the big three\nNow with a Vegas things you need to know who the power of three Brian's big numbers ...\nThe Turks to share with us whatever information they have you know I Believe that they had intelligence sources inside that conflict I Believe that's where the recordings come from they need to share that with us and they need to share that have shown\nThat that is Michael morale up CBS former deputy director the CIA and acting director he wants to know did the Saudi prince or the killing of a Washington Post columnist the ramifications or impossible to overstate as pressure builds on Trump to impose some type of sanctions for the act or the ... said you better not\nAt stake relations with the U.S in Saudi Arabia and they are the counterbalance to Iran and the region to president just spoke about it I'll bring you those comments the number\nOf house can be very difficult for the Republicans may pain but I think given the last ten days the presidents have now not impossible and the numbers reflect that a\nGovernor Chris Christie really valuable inside because not only is he not understand politics she understands the president to mid term shifting grounds enthusiasm is high but now they're on the side of the G O P as well what the latest numbers are showing in how Hispanics might just be helping the geo pay\nSo our job is harder harder than American businesses\nAnd so I think he's very attuned to the political impact of everything he says and does it\nVery interesting and what about uh what about in the in the big picture he wants to go out and he wants to campaign he wants to nationalize this whole election\nOr in terms of in terms of where we're at right now as a a as a race I think it's a very interesting to see a lot of experts not willing to guarantee that the house is going to go to the Democrats here is Loni Chen or the Hoover Institute on meet the press ...\nMid term elections are a lot about convincing voters what is it you stand to lose what if you stand to lose and and for Republicans the pitches a Democratic Senate gets elected you're going to lose these judges for Democrats is if you have a Republican Senate gets elected you're going to lose Obamacare\nAnd that's why the pitch has focused in on judges and healthcare so thoroughly and I think the challenges in in some of these states you know Arizona Nevada you're starting to see the race creed away from Democrat and it's happening in a slow but steady ... in Nevada jak euros and the Democrat has not been in a had had an a public pool since the end\nI can Rosen the Democrat has not been had had an a public pool since the end of September in Arizona you've got kissed in cinema all this opposition research coming out on her recently being out of touch with Arizona so these races are creeping away but the met a narrative here is really about what do you stand to lose and I think Republicans have prosecuted that case effectively\nYeah I mean that's one thing they got to say and also when you saw how crazy it was going after Brett Kavanaugh is high school drinking\nYeah look I I think the\nSpeaker there Brian is is generally right but but I think that there is a big hole here is what do the Democrats really stand for I mean I don't think they nationalize the issue of health care successfully I think they are they are and they have been portrayed accurately\nAs a mob as as they are going to impeach Kavanaugh they're gonna teach Trump they're going to they want to raise taxes I mean they're going to come in and tell you what bathrooms to use and they are going to get in your face\nI mean I I don't see the Democrats coalescing around a platform with even one or two clear ideas they seem very much scattered and they are\nYou know I mean you you still get paid or work against Ted Cruz I mean look like a shining star there ... or ... it was already going to run for president\nAnd now as as the race comes down the stretch he fades so what is that what are they really stands\nFor I think that's why their voters are not as galvanized as Republicans because there is no real platform it's at the end of the day\nIt's very hard to elect people if you don't if it if you don't have a platform if they are\nRunning for something and I think right now the Democrats are just running against Trump and that I Know not proven to be their success\nAnd they're trying to rally around Obamacare something they ran from ... years it's a it's a push but the Republicans made it easy by blowing repeal and replace yeah not making it clear they're not guarding against pre they are guarding against pre existing conditions because that's something all of Americans were behind they have not made that clear they just avoid the

to them and they're going to get on the president return to the king not the crown prince but I actually think of somebody you didn't get permission to say it that knows politics says was genius for the president said he talked to the king because the crown prince would know but the king is in charge\nSo the president wants to get to the bottom of this but he's trying to blow up us Saudi relations you might not like that but he's thinking very trends actually here's my morale of what's at stake with the murder of the Washington Post columnist got twenty eight\nYou know the U.S economy under Trump\nIs booming and the rest of the world is slowing and so I think he figured out that we've got a built in advantages right now that we can sustain\nA showdown on trade in a way that some of our trading partners trading partners are trading adversaries in the case of some of these countries can't and so you know if your economy slowing a and all of a sudden credit Trump puts terrorists on you that's going to put a lot more of a squeeze on you whereas in the United states is fair going we're doing so well right now that we could we could we could absorb\nA some terrorists for a short period of time in order to in a showdown and they're going to in a game of chicken they're going to blink\nUh so that's what he's doing but I mean ... you know and even in the areas\nWhere he hasn't kept his promise like building a wall or repealing Obamacare he's been trying\nA you know that it's because of democratic obstruction that he hasn't done that and then you know in the ... the few rare instances where he has backtracked like you know he promised during the campaign to pull our troops out of Afghanistan he actually studied the issue very carefully if you read the Woodward book it's actually very comforting the process by which he went through or he has really\nTough question the scary and and he can he concluded\nThat he was wrong and that was that's that's good\nOr bad is said to him with that is said to me was Mr President matter what you accomplished in your term if there's another attack coming from Afghanistan and you pull the troops out that's all anyone ever remember and that's who it hit home with him\nYeah absolutely and then you know if you look at it you know he goes off ... when I say that he ... he says uh\nLook at it you know he goes off ... when I say that he ... he says uh our biggest tax cut in history what is worse to ... to claim that your tax cut is the biggest tax cut in history when it's really not the biggest tax cuts or to take your ... or to sell your ... your main legislative achievement Obamacare I'm On the basis of a lie that you can keep your doctor in your health care plan\nA I Would say that it's a lot worse to tell people they can keep their doctors and health care plan and say whoops I guess that wasn't true ah you know he hasn't sold any any any policies on the basis of ally\nMark when did you go aboard the Bush administration ...\nI've been I was there for the whole eight years I started in the Pentagon and two thousand and one went to the White House in two thousand foreign stay till two thousand a\nYear President Bush you watched his dad and Ronald Reagan up close and he was governor how much ramp up time did he need he didn't have much in nine months and nine eleven attack to really feel comfortable this is just more teasing opinion looking at the present\nIt's hard to say because I by the time I joined him and had a lot of face to face contact in two thousand four I was at the Pentagon for the first three years or so I didn't see him in those early years but by the time I ... I engage with him he was you know he was fully in charge and uh you know people who I work as you said he was a he was ... he said he was comfortable from the very beginning\nSo here you're a man named Andrew\nI'm here as well as we saw said about when she questioned him last night about him being more comfortable as president ...\nThink so I mean I felt comfortable at the beginning other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United states but I think that's true with everybody\nHow it is now I very much for like ... I Do I feel like the president you know for a little while it's like a Mr presidents or ... even my friends they call me that they don't call me down or whatever they call me Mr President I say we please loosen up I've learned on the job I have when you feel comfortable I feel very comfortable here\nAre you sensing that or is it or we over exaggerating that since we're talking about over exaggerating the role he's been on\nYou know I Know I don't think we're already that during the role you've been on I think he's got a roll of an enormous accomplishment I mean if you just if you took the litany of accomplishment that this president had\nAnd went to every never Trump or a three years ago and said we're going to elect a Republican president who is going to pass\nHistoric tax reform huge regulatory rollback destroy the ISIS caliphate a you know down the line or most people would have signed up for it um it's it's it's a a you know he's kept his promises of now you know the the difference between him and George George W. Bush or even you know to some extent is that\nHe's he's not he's the first president we've had has never held political office before\nUh so you know he came out of the world of business he's got a learning curve\nOf how government works versus how business works at the end this thing on foreign policy just didn't have a lot of experience and all this stuff but he's surrounded himself with really good people he's got a great foreign policy team now with the with a bolt in ... uh you know in in advising him in in Gina Haspel at CIA [noise]\nSo you know he's he's you know he's he's learning and he's growing in an office in in a good way\nSo I don't have any problem with the about him he'll walk over to the cameras and let depressed talk to them with a chopper going in the background he just did it in the rain I'll be very head out to Florida to talk about Saudi Arabia so he talked to us brought a doctor Shannon Thursday talked to sixty minutes over the weekend\nAnd I'm Wondering first off from a communication standpoint would you recommend did he do sixty minutes I think\nIt came off well you know from\nWhat I didn't watch it\nFrom beginning to end but you know yeah why not I mean\nI think the key thing you have to worry about it with the presidency in a long long period of an eight years is over exposure right\nSo eventually people started tuning presidents out but then they see too much of them I used to be you know Ronald Reagan's day you know I just looked at it from the volume of speeches that we were doing in the Bush administration you know he had two or three events a day where we had to have a written text of some kind of push in the in the Reagan Administration because you didn't have twenty four hour cable news and all the rest of it\nUh presidents were much less exposed and so when they went out and spoke\nA people paid much more attention because of the president's talking we'd better stop and you know pay attention\nAnd now you know and it's not just him mama the George W. Bush presidents are so overexposed and they're so out there all the time\nUh that it's you know at some point after you know we're still early in his presidency but some people just get exhausted and and stopped paying attention so he's got to worry about if he's got an eight year term or that you don't want to be so over expose that people aren't listening anymore\nI I Want you here Leslie stole sixty minutes over time about what went into the interview was that third cut fourteen\nWhy do you think President Trump\nDecided on an interview with you and now it's this particular time I was trying to win the ... the Republicans ... ... people believe\nSome out there publicly the stronger the chances are that the Republicans for better for him and I think the White House has come to believe it's let's try to restrain them to come off television to put them away from these rallies and who loves doing it\nKeep them away from these rallies and he loves doing it for ... to get a lot of energy how crowds or iPhones gets a lot of energy wrestling with no\nYeah I don't think he minded I that's what people don't understand he takes questions but he doesn't really get a bill if you get a noxious gas prices go up to them but\nHe'll he'll actually sit down as we still\nSo here's a here's the problem is that there's exposure and there's exposure if you're ... if you're doing these interviews and you're a message discipline and your message a goal is to put out there and let people know what what you're accomplishing an office what's your agenda is that's all good\nIt's when the president goes out and completely distracts from his successes with the rants about the Mueller investigation and the Russia probe and then the sort of these these crazy asides that he does all the time that make people exhausted by by the by the same in chaos [laughter]\nYou know the fact is if you look at his set of accomplishments and then you look there's ... there's a poll now that he was like at forty one percent which is like the highest he's had one of the highest got one of the highest poll numbers of his presidency but he's still in the low forties\nWith a guy with his level of accomplishment should be in the fifties or sixties\nAnd what's so would you have to look at it as a what's not happening with the Trump presidency is he's not building his base beyond his base right when you come in and you got your core base\nAnd then you go out and you reach out and you're trying to accomplish certain things and you get to get a level of accomplishment that people should be looking at this economy that this is one of the best economies we've had in in the generation\nAnd they should be saying you know what crops pretty good president maybe I should give him a second shot but he keeps doing all this stuff that just makes people dislike him and the ... not not as core base his core base wants everything he does but he's not persuading the persuadable out and bring them along you know I don't want to see the president\nAnd that's one thing that you know he got a few of those questions from was we saw biggest surprise since she took over that's when you human eyes yourself\nWell the biggest surprise for me was when I ... you know you could just tell a story that makes you seen a humble or the magnitude of the office or the biggest you know just as soon as he does it does those who went over independence that's when people say I really like this guy\nAnd he said no I'm going to bull straight ahead not show any vulnerability we all make mistakes on my mistake was not blowing up NAFTA early but that just the way he does thing is going to change but I think if someone to talk to him and say he won independence human as yourself\nYou know talked about you want to uh you want to ... game and he sat in the background and you're seeing how well he's playing with the Dc United academy which he is evidently is a great soccer player\nAnd just simply corner and know what he's sacrifice to come here and seemed fitting in so well with his teammate you realize how much it's so much more than just may then people go oh my goodness you forget he said dad\nYou really should data teenager now I think he's Thirteen twelve or Thirteen but he's being you know he's like six one that's what those people off [laughter] but but I mean those those are the moments when asked you don't ask him to cry\nBut you just say give me that on the side\nOr the end that would be fantastic but I'll I'll give you a perfect example okay\nSo African American unemployment is the lowest on record right remember Donald Trump went to that that that African American church in Detroit during the campaign and he said to them whether you vote for me or not I'm going to fight for you\nAnd I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going to we're going to crack down on crime we're going to ... we're going to crack down on on on drugs were going to create the opportunity and unemployed didn't and people don't know this but like the tax overhaul that he did it includes something called opportunities on a bill introduced by Senator Tim Scott\nLong when you ask me Herman

the house is not locked up some are pointing to the Hispanic vote what's going on with the Hispanic vote that as Democrats concerned\nI think there's a shift I mean there's a condom improve and unemployment\nYou know drops at three point seven to two lows that we haven't seen in decades [noise] uh people's you know outlook on how their family is doing a change and the more time that sets\nThe more you know it factors into a lot of strays we all know twenty two days as a lifetime as we say every week in especially in the Trump era of the stories that potentially could come up but\nIt does promising for Senate Republicans are you picking up one two maybe three seats on what they already have\nHere's what Chris Christie said about the house cut sixteen\nThe house is going to be hard and and we have said that from the beginning George I think by house it'd be very difficult for the Republicans maintain but I think given the last ten days the president's had now not impossible but you know with a new cycle here um you never know what's going to happen in the next twenty four forty eight hours a day to\nWhat I you know a bedroom disaster for the president and the numbers reflect that\nHe was ... and the New York times on this week with George Stephanopoulos got Nineteen\nThere had been the drain among some high democratic strategist as recently as three weeks

in terms of solidifying the Republican base in terms of\nThe Senate but in these districts in the house there are too many retirements I think the Republicans to overcome it I think the waning districts are carved up I also think we haven't talked about one important issue in terms of democratic voters went to the gender gap which is not going to have a Republican federal\nThey have a strong advantage to Democrats with women if you don't believe some of the polls\nI agree and that's why some of those house suburban districts uh where soccer moms or whatever you want to call them a factor in uh probably you know turn upside down for the president and his party that said uh it the map changes for the Senate and in fact\nSome Senate Republicans in the leadership are looking at races that they weren't even looking at\nLooking at New Jersey as saying that they could you know possibly create a brush fire over the next twenty two days and that becomes a concern for Bob Menendez um they're looking at Montana that was not really thought of as as in reach that is definitely in reach now\nInteresting so uh I have a quiz for you if I was to put you in charge of the Democratic party New Hampshire all these candidates to to pick from who want to run for president and to attract a good crowd everyone pay the ticket price who is you invite Brett\n[laughter] well if I'm wrong in the Democratic party undergrad of all because I think there could be a cast of thousands by the time we get there I mean really lick realistically Fifteen right I haven't seen\nA but you're looking at the same thing the Republicans looked at in twenty Fifteen as they were lining up and remember that first debate that we did in Cleveland you know we separated into tears I that's what the Democrats are going to have to do this next on\nBut that's why I thought like you that's why I was surprised when their choice was a very recognizable face and voice he is the voice of Donald Trump on Saturday Night live and the next day he was the keynote speaker in New Hampshire for the Democrats ...\nThe way we implement change the way we implement change in America is through elections we change governments here at home in an orderly and formal way it in that orderly and formal way\nAn awful way we need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump\nAnd send them

Pocahontas\nAnd now it's not over on occasion on its mass saying that uh the mass comes up one one thousand twenty four I'm is accurate of the testing that she would be you know Indian uh and\nListen to the politics of it you know changes that she took the test I guess and takes that talking point away from from President Trump but the politics of of the whole using minority status somehow gained advantage\nUm either in a job or in education are still\nYou know there and I think that uh the battle between Donald Trump Elizabeth Warren is far from over uh one thing is sure that she is definitively running she did the Oklahoma track she did the DNA test and she's helping out a whole bunch of democratic candidates around the country\nRight or the president seemed to like that match
