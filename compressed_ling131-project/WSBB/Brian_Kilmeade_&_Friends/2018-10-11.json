dot com and I'm kind of excited to because I got a chance to see edgy action America New Orleans salad on paper back and then the new afterward I pulled myself out of it and I just give you an idea what because Andrew Jackson seemed to be a controversial figure today\nI was just like you know it FDR with Teddy Roosevelt Harry Truman would Abraham Lincoln Ronald Reagan thought of them so you don't like uh who would Andrew Jackson was and some of the things he did okay\nBut I'm going to tell you in terms of leadership an impact on an era and a part of America these great leaders all thought he was indispensable so let's get to the big three\nNow with the stories you need to Brian's fake three three numbers three ...\nSeveral ... political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the ... started down\nBy Hillary Clinton weighing in on civility so don't settle in to you when something is that the message of a mature politician who is\nConcerned about the welfare of people just because they disagree not really plus Michael Bloomberg just registered as a Democrat he's getting geared up to run in twenty twenty after all who would ever thought Trump was going to win why not a businessman who's a little ... are they a little less a little more self pacing who also has\nTwelve years of political experience the number I think the Democrats are\nPutting max out on motivation and they've been raging for two years they're eager to vote so I think any additional motivation I get out of the Kavanaugh fair is likely to be only a modest increase Republicans on the other hand we're looking pretty sleep and the Kavanaugh case clearly has changed the equation there and the polling evidence we see shows and motivation among Republicans is up\nHe was helped enormously by the fact that the pool got real small in the upper Midwest a lot fewer people turned out to vote in those states than we expected there were millions of missing voters that was a reflection of weak democratic enthusiasm in places like Michigan and Wisconsin\nAnd this had a lot to do with urban voters and African American voters will those voters show up to vote as a proxy war against Trump and if they do and if they if if they if that share shows back up the Republicans are going to get their clocks cleaned in the upper Midwest and they would lose enough that they would come close to losing enough seats in those states alone\nUh especially on the governor's level to make it a good outcome for Democrats so we just got to see who who who is really going to show up how many people\nSo he would would present a of the population being that we are in in this unprecedented time of anger and passion right what do what would be a number that we have not seen in a while at the midterms what can we expect and what do you expect\nIn two thousand fourteen and the last midterm election we have the lowest voter participation of action right\nWhat do what would be a number that we have not seen in a while at the midterms what can we expect and what do you expect\nIn two thousand fourteen in the last midterm election we had the lowest voter participation of any ... any election dating back to Nineteen forty\nTwo it was thirty four percent it was bad it was real bad um and that worked out well for Republicans in a lot of places Republicans generally do better at any given Republican tents devoted a higher frequency than any given day\nYou see so for it to be for it to be getting back to the way it used to be it would go to forty anything above forty percent participation would start to look like a huge change\n[laughter] quick thing a Taylor Swift hope has asked people after she went for they'll breads and she has valuable to register to vote she got two hundred and forty thousand people to register forty\nWait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait a correlation is not causation\nUm I have seen this story a bunch of places and we don't know that that's what that was and by the way do you know why else there were so many democratic voter registrations in that period of time why it was the end of the voter registration period and Eighteen states so of course there was a huge increase in\nThe nano likely story they say the entire month of September there was a hundred and Ninety thousand [noise] yeah so you don't want to give her credit\nWell I'm just saying it's not it's it's not to because Taylor Swift said on her Instagram please go register to vote it's because it's the end of the ... it was ... it was the end that would be like saying Taylor ... on a a April fifteenth Taylor Swift said everybody should file their taxes\nAnd that it was like look at all of the tax filings that came in on this day oh my goodness so there is there is a little bit of the I'm sure that some people registered to vote at Taylor Swift best and
