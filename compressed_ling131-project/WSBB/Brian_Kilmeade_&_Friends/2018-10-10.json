Trump presidency and or as fair as it gets Jonathan welcome back how are you this is stunning news do you want to share with everybody\nYeah I just broke it I'm literally a bride about five minutes ago [laughter] wow that's thank you [laughter]\nA lot a highly has resigned to the president and he has accepted her resignation or the timing of a departure is unclear but ah that that is that thing that has happened [laughter]\nShe is arguably the most one of the most respected people in the White House who is just on our couch or we could go and saying that I had this great relationship with the president if I disagree I can pick up the phone and I get him on the phone and we talk about it and he listens what happened\nUm\nIt's very unclear to me now like if it came as a shock\nTo senior foreign policy officials and the Trump Administration um so I don't think that I think it's a very small number of people when I whenever people I mean less\nHaley resigning as UN ambassador my sense is if she's in the oval office now they've got to have a press conference at ten thirty it's right away\nOr what happened man skill it's all happening I think\nIn my I'm going to get I'm going to speculate you would never do this job at this one but I don't have your students about just\nWait and here we go breaking one minute ago Donald Trump big announcement with my friend ambassador Nikki Haley in the oval office at ten thirty I Am\nAn okay truck that was a minute ago\nYou hear my hunch health or fan judge health or family or it's been very tough and my only going to New York ah and I think that it's at this time after two years with this intensity glare I think it's important to me to be home\n[noise] I think that's a reasonable bet [laughter]\nOkay but you will not do that\nA lot to to play with your bad I'm not going to play all the speculation good\nOkay you won't do they go to my next question who is likely to replace her\nUm [noise] I can start it\n[noise] like in\n... ... look on the line you know about this one thing to do come at a shock to senior foreign policy officials in the administration I don't know\nHow certainly what that Trump was I\nI don't have any insight into exactly\nHow um how much the extent to which he felt blindsided by senior people in the administration this came as a shock to them so I\n... and and one thing that very clear to me is that the ... ... ... still sounds pretty sketchy so I don't know that that got someone lined up a a to a place\nSo yes I just I got some great speculation which will do not you will not participate I Know uh I say center a lot\nShe's been my yet been marching around to different people she's played a role in the party a big friend of McCain's a you know she was my\nMy push back to that would be um I don't think Trump is a huge fan can better um I think he has a very long memory and senator Ayotte was no friend of his during the twenty sixth day elections I Would be shocked to pee in\nLaw is a

but ah that that is I think that has happened [laughter]\nJob this one book yesterday was able to break some news today the biggest story in America he broke it and he talked about it for the first time here actually goes his own and he was able to use his source to find out the Nikki Haley's coming to the White House and she will be resigning has been accepted the president tweeted something friendly my friend Nikki Haley skill set for a big announcement\nMy sense is maybe going to resign but maybe come back at something else bigger in a short time because you still going to be part of the administration maybe as he buys or in some way but right now maybe family first\nAnd he did it to me two years in a row even though as advisors are telling them you need to go you need to do other things he said if she wants me to do it I'm doing it\nSo that's their relationship and I think that's called mutual respect we also asked him I ask how do you feel about ever running for president she certainly I Would never run in twenty twenty against this president\nSo she never ruled it out governor from South Carolina who spoke up for civil rights we also know what what she's done as a family person whose husbands in the military and now she goes and gets the international credentials in the position\nShe has man or she leaves hide this question is can you leave this position not do anything in public life and then come back in twenty twenty four that makes me think that the fact that he treated our friend of mine big announcement\nI get the sense that this may be a hiatus maybe family or health related and maybe she'll be back\nAnd yeah without having to get some headlines from the poll main thing that the president says the to Nikki Haley has done an incredible job for a job the president says that Haley told him six months ago that at the end of the year\nOr two year period which would come up next month that she wanted to take some time off those are some initial headlines of the coming out of the White House now so she said six months ago she was right\nAnd the national headlines that are coming out of the White House now so she said six months ago she was ready to take\nIt and so so Brian what's that in mind or you know everyone's going to again because it may spread claiming to your point or what does he do\nFor five years I mean she seems to become a political supernova receives a superstar or seen seen pushback against the president when she's had to ... more more\nTo the president said he hopes to Nikki Haley will come back in a different role and says quote you can have your pick out All right Brian your thoughts\nMy thoughts to things Gary Cohn similar press conference but Gary Coleman was always felt so he was smarter than the president and then we know he was a source of Woodward's book if you read the book\nNikki Haley has never done that she's been in our own person\nWorking for a president who who do personified being single mindedness in my way of the highway she thrived in a way that I haven't seen anybody else thrive next him so I Do look for her to come back in a way this has been a sprint\nEven though ... makes it look easy for going from South Carolina to New York is not a specially with a young family and a husband in the military\nSo I sense that she comes back takes a pause and then see who sticks around in this high octane highly demanding field you know a bolt in Tom pail something international like that there's a lot of prominent positions that\nThey could be coming loose in the next few weeks I'm sure she'll\nShe'll do a you know whatever works best for family will work for the president\nAnd Brian of course I'm a ... it's it seems we're restoring press fish that his position which has really lost a lot of his first name for a long time\nSo you know we've all been speculating or outside of perhaps of Lieberman who would fill those roles do you think ought to have to be someone was really good name recognition along resume someone that can hit the ground running but also have that sort of presidents because seems relevant to this position\nYou'd like to think too uh I don't get into the gender roles on this but it just she was the most prominent woman I think outside of ... for the president\nHave another woman and there will be great and I think Kelly Ayotte has been in it around the circles or Republican she lost a heartbreak or\nA for her Senate seat so she's been around is courting around these judicial nominees and I'm just thinking that she might be someone brought in I don't think it's that big a deal and she made some comments about the president and the tone in ten or twenty sixteen the president's gotten over a lot of that including with Marco Rubio and Rand Paul\nSo she's she's very talented I Know internationally ... Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman thinks the world of her ... John McCain she did a lot of that work and go into battlefields in two years after Lieberman left so that might make sense\nI don't know if she'd be willing to do it but clearly she wants to run for the Senate again didn't work why wouldn't she accepted position like this again\nTo see your point even Nikki Haley had ah some early issues where President Trump and even in this role as a basket of to the U.S who was never afraid to speak your mind or the push back against the White House machine thought maybe there was a difference a ... so so all of this in mind a and considering how how\nTense or we are in a certain relationships particularly with the with China but also North Korea or Iran and they're even our allies on certain things this is this is really going to be critical isn't an ...\nI think so either the secretary of state overwhelms the position or works with the position now she was their first upon pale and they did they respect each other but that's why you got to pick the right person to go in there the seat that he or she has to have the respect of Bolton\nAnd the secretary of defense as well as secretary of state therefore if they do have that the seat doesn't shrink\nThe sheep didn't shrink with um Bassett or Haley it grew but there are a lot of ... nations I just think twice and we do this every day who are they\nI mean Susan Rice was there she was invisible Samantha Power was on masking people more than she was actually sticking up for America internationally if you ask me and then you have Nikki Haley came in there and every space statement she made every policy she trumpeted seemed to make headlines because this president is a disruptor he's a ... balance sir\nAnd it's not going to be easy have in this position unless you believe what he believes what about governor Mike Huckabee in that spot if you talk about uh the synthesis of thought that would make sense\nYeah what I mean if you're throwing a lot of great things out there\nAre some really helping your show Charles and they were throwing books or even a president's press conference art or right now we're we're finished this with you this segment\nBut unfortunately we've run out of time and you were fantastic Brian thank you very much high rank right stuff you see Mali nice to Charles [laughter] and I said I if I ever meter [laughter] more lives are coming out of this Nikki Haley saying\nAll right one eight six six eight seven six six and I got some calls to make who just able to go on at the end and do some wild speculation I I Know Charles was reading something I didn't want to look down on camera Alison could you read to me with this early read out are are you getting the pool reports not going to pour it part of what I see here is Trump\nIt's not going to pour it part of what I see here is Trump currently said something along the lines that she told me six months ago that maybe at the end of the year she wanted to take a break he was governor this is perhaps even more intense and the style ah problems together and North Korea is moving along ... thinks the world Nikki Haley as soon as they get the tape andme overlook back\nUm but yeah that's what I'm saying so far\nWell All right when we come back I Want to be able to bring it to you so maybe if I take a break now we'll have a long enough to do it also get aboard one eight six six for all eight seven six six died it ends the best way possible but with Nikki Haley steps aside that is a big loss for the Trump Administration your thoughts next Brian kill me ...\nCurrent events and use that up a vaccine to Brian's got a lot more to say stay with Brian deal made [noise]\nVery overtly mining event in their ... ... what's the name of the\nWeek days right here on WSBIU ... have you ever looked\nAt your credit card statement of been shocked by the interest rate did you know you can actually wrote all of your credit card debt into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate light ... credit card consolidation loans from five point eight nine percent a PR with auto pay lower than average credit card interest rate of over Eighteen percent a PR\nGet a loan from five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars and you can even get your fund as soon as the day you apply white dream Planetree by the way with every loan they fun I feel great recommending to my friends and my family because it's life's dream my listeners can also get a special discount on top of ice creams already low rate\nThe only way to get the discount is go to light stream dot com slash kill made\nThat L.
