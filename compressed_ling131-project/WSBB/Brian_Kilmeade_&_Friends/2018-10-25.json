through all of it\nHe sees the shifting tied with illegal immigration we have the same problem why of Democrats looking for different answers and their answers are what's the big deal reinforcing the border or allowing those illegally to stay income\nOr Kevin McCarthy a leader of the majority in the house who wants to stay that way and be speaker what happened to that rock Obama\n[laughter] what happened to that whole Democratic Party could remember it wasn't just rock Obama yet Hillary Clinton grade\nVoted for purity along the border uh that'll gang of eight foot War Within the border security dollar wise and we're asking for to help build the wall what happened there there are no longer than their therefore open borders and my biggest fear that happens November seventh if the Democrats were able to\nWin the how to take the majority you know how big a caravan would start on that day and that movement coming across 'cause it wouldn't just be open borders that they stand they want to eliminate eye and he goes home town of who would then be speaker Nancy Pelosi bailout illegals to vote [noise]\nThey would uh would I also don't understand is we wanted to get a deal the country when I say we the country want to get a deal on immigration to the president said I'll talk about DACA but I Want to get rid of chain migration and I want to build the wall\nAnd that was a big deal to Democrats they didn't want to give in on chain migration but what happens you Senator Harry Reid in Nineteen Ninety three twenty two\nBecause a relative based immigration system inherently unfair [noise]\nHas been forced to adopt even more of a certain majors to deal with the demands of people\nUncertain measures to deal with the demands of people\nWho don't have relatives here\nAnd to be any wonder that the American people think our immigration policies are Joe\nWhen we used to like forty thousand new am I going to say here\nBy lottery yet that's the lottery a went on the heat on chain why I don't understand why they why they did the political calculus and think that's something to back off off\nYou know President Trump has been right all along and he's been here with trying to put up an immigration plan that would be fair to all secure our borders have an immigration system\nIt actually works and would not be in this problem that we are today\nIn the future what changed here is the Democrats just want to we\nWill remember not one of them voted for that tax bill not in the house or the Senate\nAnd now we're the most competitive country in the world we haven't been here more than a decade you had to go past any time of the Obama because he could never get us to this point but they just want to resist everything we do so even though that\nPresident Trump went even further about DACA than others have gone in the past to try to bring everybody together when we put those two immigration bills on the floor and it takes two hundred and Eighteen votes to pass one well there's two hundred and twenty three Republicans who voted for one or the other just not one not one Democrat would\nVote for those bills and that we would not have the caravan you'd have a secure border but you'd have an immigration system that actually works\nYou might remember this but evidently Dianne Feinstein of two thousand they passed in two thousand nine there really told the Mexicans are you are the problem and sent a message to Central Americans in South Americans will favor you that is why we're having these surges at the border\nWhat was that bill what is the effect when and how do you think we can out we can undo it\nWill this is the problem we have what it's called ... other than Mexican so if somebody from Mexico comes across the border illegally we catch them we send them back\nBut if there are other than from Mexico they get a catch and release\nIn our country that's why that care of and just keeps going and thanks for one moment if you had a group of people fit inside your own country was American but decided I just want to live in your house we are a rule of land land that\nBelieves in the rule of law you will break society down if you break the rule of law and they're just going to come up here and then they're just gonna scurry and try to come across the border and all different places that's why the president has a right of why we need the wall and that's why I have to build build the wall enforce the law and the other elements of\nJust building that wall sanctuary cities to in that because that's an incentive to come the ability to remove gang members hates law what we found numerous times that people have been deported three four times it's still coming back around but also supports ice and it can dams any idea of\nAllowing the illegals to vote I think that's a common sense bill that we can vote impact\nNo doubt how hard the president's been working in you have been working to try to save the house would you realistic you said there there's too many retirements to be optimistic even though you're not giving up and you also say there's a lot of rich people throwing money around especially former New York mayor\nMichael Bloomberg I Know he's been giving out money I did not know to what extent what does he done\nMichael Bloomberg if you if you watch just about a week and a half ago he read registered Democrat and he put you put it out on the press\nHe has now given a hundred million dollars eighty million to the Democrats in the house and twenty million to human that he's trying to buy the nomination because he wants to run against Donald Trump he's kind of by Congress but it's not just him come stiers\nMore than a hundred and twenty million and rubber whole goal is to impeach the president he brags that his impeachment list is bigger than a list of the n._r._a. and then we know what sort of that so three men alone has been\nUnbelievable amount of millions of dollars trying to win the house and that's what's creating some of the difficulties look I'm On the road tried to help conservatives everywhere we can't [noise] yesterday I was with raw than those in Florida that I was with Brian Bass remember remember who Brian masses congressmen today\nServed on military served in Afghanistan\nAnd you lose both his legs lost both his life but\nKnow when the biggest challenges in Florida is this algae he's been the leader on that\nShe's the one that that got it didn't lead the fight this today I'll be up in Jacksonville, Florida Michael Waltz he could become the first Green Beret ... Congress this is Ron defenses his old seat we're in a fight there and then I'll be in uh Atlanta\nSo the president is right on this he doesn't need and he's come off the fact that he says I Want this huge wall across the border he understands is that's not practical he gets it now\nSo he wants to finish off he's got about six to twelve billion to do this and continue the wall he needs the rest of it and he does he and he says he's been convinced by border patrol that some of it's got to be the true to see what is going on on the other side of the war and for those who say it's a primitive medieval way to keep your enemies\nDoes it say it's a primitive medieval way to keep your enemies away tell that to hungry tell that to tell that to a Israel it's dramatically affected on the good side\nBoth their populations rich or thanks so much Michaels in W. ex Jay be in a mosque Florida Mike\nHey how you doing [noise] Brian I just uh they're they're just too coincidental to me these packages that are supposedly going to these people on the left I think they're set by the left because\nThis doesn't fit an animal that's been going on this animal could have been going on if it was supposed to a lot longer ago then right before the election I think at the sympathy ploy [noise]\nWell what you're talking about is this suspicious package showed up the Clintons yesterday showed up with a Soros has has ah for the most part you don't really have a ... a lot of that\nYou know conservatives definitely don't see them aggressive in these diners are outside a malls or outside the Senate I don't know the answer to that but I don't blame you for being suspicious Mike\n[laughter] yeah I just hope that they do a thorough investigation I Would love for that stuff to come back to a like a private investigator or something and working or their side\nI don't believe suspicious packages are going to decide this but we do have Thirteen Days and it's probably going to be another major story that pops up Jerry Lewis and W. okay be in Jacksonville, Florida hey Jerry\nBrian I Am a Democrat I Love your show I Love Trump but this year has been really hard for me I had to swallow a lot\nYou know it started with Maria thrown paper tells a lot of people um and then you know like you know disasters saying you know don't monkey this uh now yesterday which president comes out and says he's a nationalist as if\nWe don't know what that means you guys are pushing us away led to do this for the weekend where history shows that we're really\nFeel so tell me tell me if this level and let me tell me a for example there are things that you could say to me that might insult me as an Irish Italian New Yorker you might not know it\nUh there are things that I can say to you or they might insult you depending on your nationality race or religion and I might not know it so Donald Trump saw that there was some problems with them using the word nationalist and expanded on it here cut thirty seven\nAll I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours so called allies they have not treated our country fairly so in that sense I Am absolutely a national is a proud of it\nDo you understand that this president is a lot of things but he's not a dog whistle guy there's nothing subtle about it which is why I Know we didn't have a metal the Russians didn't work with the Russians to win an election does that further explained it to you\nBrian I'm definitely you know I totally get what he's trying to say why not come out of say I'm a ... this is my country where to put this country first national is what was going to happen with these guys before they talk\nNobody to say my country first\n... America First that's why I voted for him so when you come out and you say something like that Brian I may not take it like that but my people are not stupid and we know that that was the same word Nazis years so why use it\nUm you know the definition\nA person who advocates Political Independence for a country a person who's drunk patriotic feelings especially one who believes in superiority of their country over others that's how Donald Trump is using the word here they care about the history he knows what he's using it for now\nThe media's twisting it though this is what I'm trying to save I mean you understand I don't think Donald Trump or racial I really don't you understand that but my people the people that I Want to come out and vote to get us to cross the finish line are you guys are pushing them away\n[noise] yeah I Do see you guys are nobody and don't think the president has a consultant on that he doesn't I\nDon't think that he bounce it off Kellyanne Conway or bill shine he didn't never does you don't you know he doesn't they don't deserve credit for the success he's had a and maybe on the platform and they don't take credit or discredit for some of those sayings\nHe's challenging again he's like I don't care about the past I'm telling you how I mean it but I hear you Jerry you know that's a good point ah both for the most part they got to listen to him and just said he said what does he mean by that\nAnd also even if if he is nothing else he knows how to when there's no way that the president's successful nor his party is winning if they just have one sect they need a lot\nOf Hispanics blacks women\nAnd men when we come back we're going to be joined by a guy whose campaign was struggling he seems to be getting it on track Ron dissent is

I I Would think that would be a good idea for a President Trump to dispatch someone not and his government\nSomeone the Saudis trust I mean ideally would have been George W. Bush someone like that but he's too old maybe Bush senior maybe a former ambassador someone they trust but to give them the no nonsense message you guys got to clean up your act\nAnd um and and and complete lastly a cut thirty six President Trump\nIs sort of became a\nWe're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nHis critics say that's code white now she says no it's America first I Want to put my country first\nRight to sort of does anyone think that President Trump speaks so subtly in code you sleep they they are attacking flipping bluntly right on the book\nI I think patriot is a better word a it it's it's parallel to the America First debate I mean I think the President Trump uses the word America First and the literal sense that most Americans hearing it means we're putting America's interests first\nOf course it has bad pedigree with Lindbergh and so forth I don't think he meant that I think nationalism sort of at the same\nAs any clue and when he realizes if people are misinterpreting it what does he do double downright drives everybody not ... we're going to buy the wall Street Journal secular as you're on the editorial page thanks Bryant Bryant hotel next brain kill me Joe we're also following the packages three explosive package is heading for\nUp for a president of the United states\nFine how are you or not I am to noon\nWeekday house Iran WFDD and I'm calling out the Lawrenceville and all of them on houses are doctrine movie of the whole town to add\nBut he was down by the does he have a case against the pollsters said the pollsters in Florida routinely short change him [noise]\nThey do um I [noise] I think that\nYou know as far as from a legal perspective and I actually know law firms that are going to be watching monitoring on election day in Florida and work with them mostly um I think his bigger issue more than on the polls is what's going to actually happened on election day we do have problems in Florida from time to time with\nUm with what happens election day from a voting perspective and I think unfortunately for somebody like Scott and his supporters they might not get everybody they want\nTo the other one is very intriguing is wrong to say it is again a congressman who has the president's support is able to win a difficult primary inside them put them put them as the established Florida candidates many people thought it was his time did break the president from back the wrong horse\n[noise] ah no and and I mean we got to talk about this because it was about uh Hamilton anyone is saying that you know who lives here dies who gets free tickets for health and I mean that that's the questionnaire today with with Andrew Gillum apparently somehow getting himself free tickets to Hamilton\nWell Andrew Gillum the Democratic candidate who won\nSomehow getting a free tickets I Hamilton\nWell Andrew Gillum the Democratic candidate who don't want it very difficult primary and he has a showed himself now that will lead in almost every poll that's come out and today a new revelation\nYeah yeah I I think that I think it can be closer than it is I mean the Santa's as an Iraq veteran it's got to really like well I'm good looking family I my understanding is that I'm the president likes him on and and you know the president\nWe had a very uh ingrained politician in our state and that and putting them Adam did not come out for the president during two thousand sixteen early and rounded and present remembers that stuff so back right or wrong horse presents a loyalist I think that's what's going on here I Do think to Santa's going to win\nAnd again Gillum can't get out of his own way this this ticket thing is something that seems small\nBut voters again an eye for a quarter three I think about it\nText message emerge that show what he said on Sunday in a debate did he got him from his brother is just not true when an FBI agent posing as an influence or a text message Andrew Gillum and says I have you\nI've gotten you uh Hamilton tickets and he says great so those are the tickets worth hundreds of dollars you can't get that as a politician you can't get favors like that as a politician\nHe seemed to have not told the truth about it and accepted it and it shows that the FBI agent is bathing him to do this what does it say about the investigation that might be taking place on the Tallahassee mayor [noise]\nYeah um well let me say this that hundreds of dollars I it says in Tampa Hamilton's coming for the first time in a spring and it's over a thousand dollars for tickets\nOr was it a Broadway play yeah yeah well no it's a Broadway musicals common so I'm\nLiving on bravo and he's going to end\nThe orange I my understanding was that was a tornado but the long and short of it is is that for\nSomebody like Gillum and Tallahassee having the reputation is I mean take it out of politics we talk football at\nFlorida State said its own problems with with a bunch of stuff there Tallahassee has become one part of Florida is looked at as\nOur swap our microcosm on a swamp what I'd like to see and other people who support Republicans in the state would be to Santa's coming out stronger against the state swamp than the D.C swamp I think he's flying too high rather than the ground game which is important in Florida\nWell I don't think he's really outlined what he would do more he just points out that a Gilman reality once Medicare for all Gilman reality once upstate taxes give 'em reality is not that a good job as mayor of Tallahassee what he has his great charisma great presidents and\nAfrican American candidate who ran a crowded poll because he was backed by Thomas dire and he was backed by George Soros so now you have a charismatic guy and you have another guy a veteran who's made a difference in Congress and he's been unable to separate himself because he can't believe he's running against somebody who seems so anti Florida\nYeah ... and Brian look at going because when you say Medicare for all the states Florida I mean I Know we we have the economy on folks over age sixty five in the country we still do you start talking about Medicare for people that are under sixty five yeah\nThat scares a lot of voters and to your point the Santos has not explaining that piece to health care if you gave Medicare to all the folks that are living over sixty five in Florida right now they're Medicare their Medicare Advantage plans I work without their business is all the time are going to get diluted\nThat should be a major major talking point and you're right it's not being discussed in part of it is nobody really discover understands healthcare\nRight and it is remains the number one issue of concern caravan aside a scandal aside the healthcare number one we were in between the Obamacare plan which is a disaster the Democrats are running from and it being taken apart by Republicans who don't have a plan\nYeah and and look I mean it's in the news today with what the president's doing with the Recovery Act that is a major band aid on the biggest piece of legislative malpractice and presidential ... malpractice I'll probably ever see in my lifetime and that was Obamacare why\nReally simple Obamacare for people that I didn't understand it expanded Medicaid that was three quarters of a bomb of care was expanding Medicaid Medicaid what's supposed to be for folks that were disabled had Down syndrome like my sister in law passed a couple of years ago [noise] supposed to be for the elderly poor Obamacare opened it up to single able bodied\nMostly not working men\nUnder the age of thirty five\nWhat did they start taking if you go to a clinic that takes medicate in Florida and it's a pain management clinic in the last ten years tons of opiates so now they're hooked on over the edge they're addicted on opiates and what's the president been left with and thank God it was a byproduct person piece of legislation\nThe Recovery Act where you try to now get Medicaid coverage that's what this does to help these folks on Medicaid get off the opiates we got 'em out\nRight or if you would have been numbers like if we had Medicaid for all for a country because that's what Bernie Sanders is asking for free education and medicated for all I mean do you have any idea how cautiously impractical that would be or impractical\nOur country right now it's almost twenty percent of our gross domestic product everybody knows as it were is health care if\nThe product everybody now is just as it is health care if you were to shift healthcare to medicate for all anyone in the audience who is they medicate patient would be able to tell you the experience they get into the doctor it would be completely different than the experience that all of our listeners who do not have medicate today half\nIs a different type of medicine that's practiced and it's scary and nobody talks about the actual care compared to the numbers and the copyright\nThe a good pretty Iowa's Brian row tell it they're not going to do anything that's going to sustain itself unless they work across party lines I suspect\nThat there might be of sense in this country right away for them to try to get a health care program on a bipartisan way because if you don't have bipartisan as soon as you lose power that other for the other party's gonna take it apart\nAbsolutely and the and look one thing that I can tell you that a lot of people\nReally like right now are two things one direct Madison used to having an Amazon Prime subscription there is an ability to get that now in the country and get it a low rates in going to see a doctor when you want to it's a free market private enterprise the other thing that people really really like\nThey like when their employers are doing wellness programs and giving them back money for staying healthy and staying in the workforce you'll hear about those things should be bipartisan\nYeah a health clubs are eating right things like that a lot of times a day revolutionize the workplace to make sure if you want to stay we want you stick around and we're going to give you an idea what would be good for you\nYou know number one employer it's nobody's talking about this apples actually got its own if you work for Apple in California they have opened up their own health practice you go to Capitol doctors while work for Apple employees in California it's part of the benefit of working for Apple\nAnd I'm sure you book those appointments on an iPhone five on

on the president's correct here he's saying\nYou know look we that's just terrible what was done this is absolutely wrong this violates all kinds of things\nHe's right on the path theories he was also correct\nTo be cautious at the beginning we need to make sure I mean there's there's people that want to jump to these foreign policy conclusions all the time and just assume that whatever's reported on some news thing or from some for an agency is the truth when when it comes to international politics you have to be cautious and judicious but\nYou know what really does kind of get under my skin and all of this as a as you mentioned earlier one now who is the this holier than thou defender of you know the the Turkish version of the first amendment and uh and then you see even people in our own party and and the other party\nWho are calling for this like excommunication of Saudi Arabia Rand Paul for instance of said let's just cut off everything was Saudi Arabia and at the same time yesterday\nHe called really story and relationships and lifting sanctions against Russia who killed two people in the u._k. and killed journalist all the time so there's gotta be some consistency here and foreign policy and the fact is we oppose the killing of journalists but we're not going to realign are interested in the middle east because of it\n[noise] so uh this now we have the CIA director over there trying to get some answers because we basically given up on the Saudis but how rich you said sarcastically is it for her to want to act outraged about the Saudis what do you think he's playing he's looking to get maximum leverage from Saudi Arabia\nHis economy's terrible he sees jealous of the relationship that we've got rekindled with Saudi Arabia who do you think about his comments [noise]\nWell I think you you never know where are the wind comes down I mean it's kind of had an unholy alliance with Russia and an oil alliance with Iran and then he says you against Russia and Iran issue down a Russian airplane disguise allegiances change every day for whatever's going to give him a moment of power and\nLook Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two polar is right now\nIn the Muslim world in the middle east and that bothers or the one he wants to lead the middle east and and uh and so I think he sees this as an opportunity in my estimation that take Saudi Arabia down a peg to probably get some concessions from um including\nSome economic concessions and reassert himself is kind of the dominant power in the middle east the reality is though he has no moral ground stand on sure he doesn't murder journalists in the fashion of Saudi Arabia dead and again\nWe need to be very clear and condemning this evil back\nBut he's not he's not you know some you know St Mary himself either me a couple of hundred journalists in jail and we had a pastor in jail for goodness sakes off a sham trial\nA congressman ... you know with a lotta times Congress takes the lead you guys did neuron during the Obama years what is going what is going to be the the backlash from this apparent killing a brutal killing of cars Yogi what do you what are you guys talking about proposing\nWell this is where you get into the internal politics and I think it's important to talk about this you know some of these people that are calling for cutting off arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nYou know basically the strategic realignment away from Saudi Arabia or the same people that were doing it the ... before this even happened this has been their foreign policy goal like I mentioned Rand Paul he's always wanted to excommunicated Saudi Arabia and frankly get us out of the world it's fine he believed that but I think it's important to know\nSo yeah you're going to have these groups in ...\nSo yeah you're going to have these groups in Congress that have always been this kind of anti Saudi more pro Iranian and they you know they love the Iran deal that are going to try to take advantage of the situation I think it's important for us to say things like travel bans on anybody associated with this certain sanctions against you know the regime\nBut at the same time we can't completely re aligned ourselves in the middle east away from Saudi Arabia because of this\nI Know I was just struck by Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker to defenders of a re killing that relationship feel personally taken a personal front because this happened and you just wonder as brutal is a citizen it's nonsensical and you don't want to think about it why the Saudi Arabia I think they can get away with it that's what I find it following\nYeah yeah and that's where that's where I'm blown away is is you know this idea and this is why he don't\nSuppress journalism pride it's because ultimately if you try it's going to backfire on you know the idea that the Saudis thought they could murder you know their own citizen but a resident of the United states\nIn in Turkey is ridiculous and it's going to backfire on him and I hope\nAnd this is why we're pretty intense punishments on this because I Hope that prevents those kind of behavior in the future but again I think before you know everybody sits back and says gee we need to just you know cut Saudi Arabia off the map and become best friends with Russia and Iran and everything in Turkey but look at what some of these countries did did before we you know be ...\nYour reaction to the suspicious device as it were a route to Obama or Obama camp to Clinton house and now CNN\n[noise] yeah we don't you know we don't know who sent 'em awful if no matter what the situation as a I Wish we could just get back to having good spirited debate instead of confronting Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz in a restaurant you\nSay and you need to confront um at gas stations and fight people and push back to their face because ultimately are going to have you're just going to have a huge mess that is not good for our institution democracy\nCongressman or how concerned are you what changes if you're in the minority\n[laughter] oh man everything I'm you know sometimes you sit back and yet you imagine how Nancy Pelosi would be a speaker I mean imagine every Trump official in front of every committee every day\nUh being attacked and asked for everything and and ... and they would where he is the Trump Administration\nAnd Maxine Waters and the chairman and Jerry ... is the chairman I mean I really just it gives me chills because you know and I think you know what is it due to the confidence of the economy people\nReally economy has grown up because people feel free to take a deep breath and invest a if you got this Nancy Pelosi regime on the horizon a I think people are going to hold back some guys get out and vote even if you hate your Republican congressman\nGet out and vote for him or her because ah it's you're voting for Nancy Pelosi or somebody else\nParrot a congressman thanks so much Adam ... joining us and I\nFollow the through suspicious packages as well as some of the investigation over the middle east\nAdam thanks when we come back we're going to be joined by Jason ... years is border patrol years in the army and now he's a whistle blower he knows the reality on the border and knows what we can and can't do to stop the seven thousand [noise] care of any this way [noise] [noise]\nWell what is the problem is this a problem solvable\n[noise] it is if [laughter] well I should say in theory it is but the what you cannot pass any laws right now we know that I mean you can't even get a ... a put through um\nWe need to pass immigration reform and we need a piecemeal it we know both sides aren't going to agree on a complete package but we need to have some sort of immigration control put in place because if not the optics in uh uh\nThe media down south down a central and South America are going to say hey you know what you have the possibility of getting into the United states climbing asylum or refugee status en route are here and you may have the possibility staying here and less you get rid of that message down south\nThe flow of immigrants is going to ... continue\nHow bad is it down there I mean our our people is this typical of Central America economically struggling with bad leaders who don't do anything in the population once overrun by gangs is there any different than twenty Eighteen than we've would've saw in two thousand nine\n[noise] no it's not and you know that but that's the thing is the message the messages if you come here and you can claim I'm a refugee or asylum status because of that um then you should come now everybody I mean if you're saying eighty percent of the people are are male military age males coming up\nI mean how many of them have ill intent and how many of them have a background I'm In that same violence that they're fleeing and I mean that's where the the problem with the borders going to happen is we're going to have to fat out\nClose to ten thousand people know you mentioned I was a whistle blower my biggest thing was about the whole vetting of these adults with children how are we going to are we going to a potentially have a two to three thousand DNA kids ready to go when we were down there I mean it's just it's just going to be a complete mess\nAbsolutely he sat recorder she's actually in Guatemala and this is what she saw cut Eighteen\nRan into people that were part of that and it's Thirteen it appears that there were other people well goal\nIt appeared there were other people as well as a lever for various different groups that would move norm is amount of now we were there it's green basically the second wave\nOf people crossing from Honduras and divide 'em all that is right on the high during border I can tell you what I saw were very few women and children and any normal for now that man\nThat's what you see and that's what's going to be at our doorstep how hard is it going to be to get that next the next nine hundred miles with a with a you know basically with sandals on [noise]\nIt they they can do it I mean I Believe me they can do it and I'm sure they're going to um there's trains that they're going to be running into soon ...\nUm there's other transit court orders I mean are they going to be linking up smugglers there's ways to make it to the border it just depends on how much time do we have to repair I mean if they're a thousand miles away we need the four deploy\nAssets down to the McCown area that we have Fort Sam Houston is right there which is great big military base um but we need to really start moving assets in place the border patrol will get overrun by ten thousand people\nAnd they're helpless I mean they were almost victims in this because ... politicians can't get out of the way and also I saw you know we have Tom Homan who used to run I said the for the most part twenty percent of everybody that crosses has a criminal record\nSo you had to deal with some form of the people who are trying to mix in the Washington Post so I talked to people that have been through five or six times and they using the caravan is cover to try to get back again here\nWhy wouldn't they Brian I mean when I was in a border patrol um and when I was with ice you know one thing is like when I was let's say I was in a border patrol and I caught a group of ten\nAdditive at ten you could say at least you had a criminal history that was verifiable now what about people that do not mean vetting is great people left talking about vetting but if you've never if you're a criminal you've never been encountered\nBy law enforcement then you're not going to have a criminal history so we don't know if you're in the area so I mean this is just it's mind boggling\nYeah here's a Mollie Hemingway I think she reflects the sentiment in this country Katrina\nThere's a lot of room for disagreement on the immigration debate and you have people who you know who covered the spectrum there but the idea that there aren't national\nSecurity concerns with immigration policy or economic concerns with immigration policy it's actually just something that a lot of Americans agree on and when they see something like that and I can't imagine a better visual for Donald Trump's argument that we need to have to care borders and orderly immigration policies and understanding of national sovereignty that that does not allow just\nLiterally the flooding of people over the borders\nAnd it used to be unanimous I mean we have Harry Reid yeah Brock Obama Chuck Schumer all saying we have to border security jeez in this you must have seen this what happened why it was only one party convicted on this\nI don't understand I mean that's I Believe both parties can agree\nThat there are legitimate or refugees and a legitimate asylum claims within that group it's the other part of the group that we need to be concerned about and it's not a it's not calling out I'm like hey you know calling fire this is there's actually legitimate bad people within a group I guarantee it\nUm but I you know Ninety six is when it's all really started fluctuating fried and think about the border of San Diego you still get inundated with hundreds and hundreds of ailing just running up the highway and Clinton passed a law back then and that's from the ... of the border patrol began that's when the the mass hiring started channels\nSo you guys got a wall at a huge fence\nAnd that yeah that was fourteen miles long but what happens when you get to the gallon where the fence only goes a certain point and I've been to the I was\nDeployed to auto Arizona were all there was was a strand of um\nA strain of barbed wire that's not going to stop anybody so let's say they may well let's say they are going to vote count at this point we don't know exactly where they go and that's just the closest water but what happens if they get to that other areas and then you also have the crisis of what happens if they start crossing a river how many of them are going to\nDie I mean there's so much to do with this and you got to remember one thing I brought this up the other day was\nThat a communicable diseases we have to not just only vet for criminal history we need to deploy a Center for Disease Control people down there a and FEMA tend to ensure that we're not bringing everybody across it has like a high fluctuation of tuberculosis or any other disease\nAnd Leslie Jason if you talk to anybody used to work with at the border is there any color you could bring to what their jobs like now [noise]\nTheir job is tough it's always optics optics optics a back of the day there was no cell phones are nowadays are going to see when that when the ten thousand seven thousand hits the border there's going to be cameras hundreds and hundreds of cameras not just news but cameras from everybody in the world and they're only going to take the good clips uh both sides are\nAll right uh Jason big low thanks so much appreciate it thanks for any one eight six six for all eight seven six six in the midterms are here so\nTake for all eight
