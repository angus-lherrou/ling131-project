so why you have to\nKnow how does that work you have to find out where in line I'd go back to the dealer and say here's a recall and I'm assuming it's up to knock at your bad correct\nGuessing yeah yeah the ticket and maybe you want I I\n... yeah yeah the ticket and maybe you want\nI contacted to knock people I Would contact lawyers involved with those people and I would go back\nTo the dealer and said is there a time is there an estimated time when\nI my car will be be able to be fixed and they can say talk has never been told us when it is we know we ever recall we know they said they're replacing the bags but again Kelly there's five million people that have your problem\nOkay they actually told her there was no solution letting them\nKnow that you know that's not true they can

contract does the word guarantee or warranty still remain in a ...\nThat's a good question and I would say no because there was a breach of contract going on and therefore there was no contract at all so interesting including the warranty once there was a breach ban everything is off the table\nOh interesting okay is that California\nI don't you know I Am frankly I don't know because I just made it up [laughter] so it's [laughter] me making it up is specific to California but me making up is probably across the country but I think I'm right on that one yeah okay I'll check it out yeah please you

interesting\nBeing concerns company says they're going to issue one shack for the total loss in both my name\nAnd the homebuyer Johnny insured name and it's up to us to fight it out now I agree that I'm not going to side of the check over to them and they've agreed they're not going to signing the check over to me so it leaves me in a rather precarious position\nWell and I I don't know if it does or not it probably leaves him in a precarious position 'cause they have to live someplace and you're still okay and so you you can do a couple of things on this one\nOr you can ask for a mediator\nWhere are you guys pay for a mediator to work this out in a mediator who has experience in construction law\nMediators are generally attorneys who specialize in this field and then just sit down and work it out over a few hours that's one if it turns out that they're not willing to really sit down then what you do is you file a lawsuit for the money\nAnd then you do in ... you actually enter plead the money with the court\nSo here's a lawsuit to the court hears the check now let's go to work and the judge will make that decision\nAnd the judge will issue in order and effectively the judge will sign the check on your behalf pursuant to a court order\nSo it's either a noun a mediator or a lawsuit okay and ... and looking in the mirror my friend and saying why the hell that I hold

together and if I may I in a life responsible for that\nBut first of all let's start with I don't know\nWhy would you marry someone who is such an honor flake that he hasn't filed taxes for ten years\nWhile he pay the taxes they have in the fact\nThat how does that keep ... just write the check to the IRS like no no\nNo I mean taxes come out of the ... nothing like that he does all that\nI just had to file that thought yeah he's probably entitled to some big refunds actually if you think up until maybe\nBut I'm just wondering if I marry him and my response from\nA hell you're only responsible for being stupid and home now well that's a given but I Know I'm ancient parts and I love and I'm not to get to see the will lessen well we can have that\nConversation can't we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible\nA perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry\nSomeone who has financial issues just keep everything separate everything separate and and and what I mean separate is everybody has totally separate bank accounts and you have a shared bank account that then you write household checks out of\nThe mortgage or a gardeners are utility bills or whatever and so that is the cleanest wait now as far as he is concerned\nHaving pay the taxes and not filing a tax return now that is a violation but it really isn't a big deal\nThe IRS doesn't really care he just file their taxes and you may even be entitled to he may be entitled to refine so why even though the violation and it's one of those and not paying taxes they get very upset\nYeah now he painted then you're fine and then just say hey I didn't file their taxes that memory lapse for ten years and I don't remember and I woke up and I have a long beard and ripped family go on it for whatever but uh I haven't gone to an accountant file their taxes dammit and get a refund okay\nI'm often yeah okay yeah you're an idiot primary\nGuy like

if that was going to low ball\nUsually not to that extent or pens on the insurance company\nIt really does ... ... the insurance companies run all the way from miserable and horrible to really terrific where they go out of their way to the adjuster to not only help as much as possible but then called back\nAnd say is everything okay I'm Mr handle I'd had a couple of those ah you clearly don't have one of those\nDisappeared recording week Carlo uber bully yeah\nYou've got you've got an insurance company you have to deal with all you can do is fight it I Am a ... at the end you may end up having to to even take your own insurance company to ah to court\nAnd all you can do is go to a supervisor level and scream and rant and you can screen bad faith uh but that's that's the tough one and so you're you're sitting there with ouch\nOdd without a kitchen correct months for five\nMonths I Lived in a while they're negotiating while they're doing all that that's part of the lawsuit I think that's very good that that's a bad faith all over the place so either you have a couple of choices first thing I Would do is contact\nA bad faith attorney in in a civil attorney who deals with insurance companies and see if I Do read the policy to see if you have anything they're they're all kinds of exceptions to mold or in many cases insurance companies will not do mold abatement you're sort of on your own on that one\nUh it's it's a question of your policy it's a question of ah the adjuster it's a question of the company that you're dealing with\nAnd uh of finding a lawyer that can look at it and at least start threatening I mean that the the only good news here or is it to you and not me [noise] and there's all [laughter] you know and it could it could be a lot\nWorse and or

was there also with his mother and we're here in California and\nSo he wasn't notified of his mother and then and it was just a big don't mess with that and then\nUm so what ended up happening is that she was here in California working as a teacher and she got ... here and she just she just received their first retirement check and and and so um what ever was left\nMy fiance was informed they eat wasn't part of it he\nWasn't part of it by whom but was he in ...\nHe was my my my fiance was informed that he was not part of the designation of beneficiary\nOkay and do you have a and you have the documents that show who was designated no okay well until you\nActually see the documents or you can I can inform you that you're not part of mine and ah so what you have to see the documents\nNo this is true we we have trouble getting him because she didn't ... he he died suddenly of a of a devastating\n... and ... ... if you contact kelp hers are and you say I Am the son I can actually see the documents or am I a been a fishery and here's my address\nLike just because step brother said you're not part of it okay step brother can say that all day long a bike you have to uh be told one way or the other and I think if you ask\nHelpers uh saying I Believe I'm a better fishery they will tell you\nOkay and then if okay so if he he's done the cap per se and then he turned around in the state of Oregon and he has filed with um with the court there I'm from somebody else telling us recently\nUm that back you know a right after she passed away he filed an affidavit of successor\nYou can't do it in their ... successor wanted a ... a probate has to be opened and he can file all the affidavit gee once and you can go in and say hold on them and if you heard about it then what you do is a contact of course if there is there's money here Laurie ... is there money\nYes because it was forty something thousand and then after her her credit cards and stuff that they'll be taking some but then she passed away\nI get it but you're talking about the entire amount of money we're talking about is in the forty thousand range right\nAnd it's just part\nOf the ... and how much weight is that just part of what\nWas the that the right after she passed away her father passed away which also opened his property up which is two hundred\nAlright but where does that if she dies in her and he she dies first or do you know about her will about well he didn't have one so\nHe had he had it but who does it name who does it name\nIt named her in and and and if she passed away in named her children\nOkay so the kids have a case yeah I think you're going to need appropriate in a state where for all of it it's a mess\nYou have a mess going on okay\nThere's too much complication and the problem only ever property was a couple of hundred thousand dollar yeah there's enough money there to uh to justify a probate in a state lawyer that's where you have to go on that one and you can find\nHave anybody it yeah yeah go to your show would you recommend it yeah it's\nTo go to go to handle on the log dot com okay alright handle a lot outcome All right All right there you go ... or something like a little impatient today\nI go I sound like I'm a little impatient today I should've just called me said\nYes I Do have one instead of screaming at the top of my lungs stopping you asked me for a referral I have one for you don't have to explain anymore thank you\nOkay what are we move on\nHello bill Dan welcome to handle the law what can I Do for you build\nA debt relief yes so you got\nTwenty thousand a credit card debt and they represent reduce it on to a Fifteen thousand and have a Fifteen thousand over three four five you know you've been relieved of five thousand dollars yup oh you have to pay tax\nYet fear it depends on uh depends on the state I Know it depends on whether or not the feds are going to go after that that's number one number two it's over a period of years\nAnd is the ah is the\nUh financial institution going even report they forgave the debt I think you're okay I really do the problem is\nUh do you say I've forgiven of this debt when you say here's the amount I paid in interest and I don't even know if you do that with uh the feds would filing an IRS a return if you talk about the amount of money that you've paid in credit card debt\nOr whether or not you have negotiated a lesser payment but bottom line is that yes that's considered income\nBut it's considered income over the three years so it's what sixteen Seventeen hundred dollars a year income does it change much I don't know if you get audited you'll be tab for uh eight hundred bucks the income tax so I don't know if I Would do it or not and uh the answer your question would I have to go to my accountant which I'll be more than happy to give you the number of\nUh if you send me an email but that's a good question actually\nBecause uh there is that forgiveness and that is income\nI mean that is technically income I only technically income it's income or ... or Jana hey Joanna welcome to handle on the law thank you yeah what can I Do for you\nAh well my Seventeen year old grandson has been going back and forth between my house than his father lives with me and his mother how and now he just turned Seventeen\nHe says he doesn't want to go back with her he finally it you know having courage and he said he's not going back and it's okay you know trying to convince\nThem that what's your question how can he stayed without sure that the cars I mean what ... you know here's the point is she going to go into court and ask for custody of a Seventeen year old\nI mean that's what ... and windows how how many months day I days is he going to be turning Eighteen from this phone call\nWhile he just turned ... here he just\nTurned okay so he just turned Seventeen believe me I'm a mom could go into court asked for custody and Seventeen year old son goes I you know what I don't want to live with my mother's\nIt's over I wouldn't I wouldn't bother\nNow she could file for custody just make her make yours and his life miserable\nOh he's done that for all the here\nWell then he has to then would have been what happens is I ... he well he can also here's a couple of other things you do okay thing number one is uh that\nUh she filed against the father asking for sole custody and the court is going to say about what's this about will ask your all will ask your grandson he could also argue to being emancipated minor\nAnd it's done and it's done at Seventeen I think the court will give it to him\nCan he do that if he doesn't have a job\nYeah okay I of course all of course yeah you don't need a job to be an emancipated minor so you want to look into that but you know the bottom line is I don't think there's going to be a custody issue I really doubt\n... or it was a it was a a no confidence is known for their salaries though\nAnd the answer to all that so when we see that I gave them they uh they they're they're ... and I asked them what to do it if they took their ... and pay I pay for the deaths of ... foot ...\nNone of this makes sense to you can ... you can get the death certificate and two seconds that's that's a public records yeah you're going to need a you're probably gonna need some kind of a clinic no lawyer is going to take design contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour\nSo called the law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia right okay\nRight All right you know good luck to you know so I just occurred to me that some law schools do have ... [noise]\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good uh those lawyers are or what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said hand I'm sure I'm going to get one or two calls and say come on bill really and I will say\nSure I'm going to get one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say do you have any pencils for sale [laughter] All right Tom Europe welcome\nOh [laughter] okay I'm gonna get right to it [laughter] okay I worked for an employer for about three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and during the for years I worked for them I worked a considerable amount of overtime during last six months I worked in an average of eighty hours\nPer week that's a lot wire ensue if you left a year and a half ago Tom why are you calling now\nThat was part of my question I wanted to know a is there a time limit\nWhere there is a statue but you feel maybe within ah I I don't know if it's a year and I I don't have the statute in front of me uh but I think if you don't make the claim within certainly there there is a statute I just don't know one year six months whatever it is if you are passed that time you're out of luck so the trick is for you to contact the state\nDepartment of industrial relation there's a whole section\nOf a there's a whole section involved with a wage enforcement and you can look on the Web site that will have a state of California and then the the department of dust relations and then frequently asked questions or there'll be some somewhere there they don't talk about a statute okay\nYeah um can I can I ask you sure question if we assume that just somebody told me it was three years okay it could be\nIf we assume that um you know I'm within the time I'm One of the things about it is um during the last six months that I work those eighty hours\nA week um [noise] the the management wife uh passed away that's all I stepped in and basically uh just just ran the show for them a during during the\n... did they know you're working eighty hours yeah\nAll right okay doesn't mean that it doesn't matter what for what reason you're working eighty hours\nWell that's the thing is that according to them basically a if you're a manager you get paid a salary\nThat's true that's true but you you reach a point where I ...\nI think eighty hours as ... as a a little bit over and over the top here and you were not as you are not an hourly employee\nWell that's the thing they never actually made me the manager several\nTimes were you in our early and put it doesn't matter if you took over management jobs were you an hourly employee\nDoes actually commission and play um the commission\nOkay so your weight body okay so your commission but you're still an employee\nRight it was just based on a commission um yeah I think you you get paid it's time for you to look at a website and if nothing else you talk to an employment discrimination attorney and see if anything's there because it could be pretty substantial\nSo you can go to the well yeah you can go to the website and look for him to handle on the line dot com\nAnd just look at attorney says employment discrimination those are the people that was on that point and law [noise] does his handle on [noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask comb advice on what\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with ... that can do the job [noise] nice how much does it cost home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews check pricing book appointments for free\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com for just download the free home advisor at [noise]\nNothing small and not your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation on huge\nYour partnership even bigger [noise]\nWas down small business technology advisor you'll get the ... and ... and one on one partnership to help your business ground because of the reliable down PCs with Enron core processor you can focus on what matters now getting business\nHaving seven by down to speak with an advisor [noise] eight seven seven by down [noise]\nMessage and to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line to find out more\nTax scale to seven nine six four or five\nThat's S.

vacate the judgment\nWell all you have to show up again it's not a question of vacating the judgment all you do is peel it and you get some and he gets an appeal if he asked for it it's called the trial to know what was her side of this not making the judgment\nIt's as if it never happened that this white once he follows the appeal David there is no judgment to vacate it's a brand new trial is this the first one didn't happen but here's the problem you're going to have\nAnd that is a he stole my wife's jewelry box what what how much is that worth David how much uh what what was the value of those jewels inside\nOf the ... the five thousand dollar yeah how do you prove that\nWe have the also have a picture of her own Julie Rovner\nOkay All right and you have and you have receipts for all the jewelry and you can actually points every piece of jewelry that she's wearing that a ... that's gone\nOr if you don't have receipts we do have a picture like actual cash value of a semi product\nOkay honey okay I'm just I'm I'm I'm just trying to nail down so far you're doing great David\nUh how you're in front of the support so in\nThe piece all important means nothing police report and he's nothing 'cause that's what you said a however uh let's say she's wearing a piece of jewelry and you don't have a receipt how do you establish what that piece of jewelry is obviously you uh you can establish that she only jewelry\nShe's got like a sort of puts the Amazon where she can go back to her a lot of history\nYeah but but here's the problem is a if you're talking about or is it real gold is a gold plated is it to the I mean there's really no way to tell I mean that's that's the problem is always a question of\nProof or because the or the court isn't going to say well here's a piece of jewelry and for example here's a ring a and it's a and a jewelry store and it's a a thousand bucks well I can get one that looks just like that on Amazon for four dollars and fifty cents so\nHaving a picture for a very loving and then we go back to her rapist or an Amazon her she purchased it and productively said\nOh yeah then you got it then and then if you have a picture and you have the Amazon recede then you've got it so now I it's an issue of um do you hold the walk Smith liable I Would I'd go foreign accent\nDirectly led to the [laughter] and he didn't have proper identification\nOnly that but one of the ways that up but what good if he did have proper identification see that's the problem is the how does a locksmith no who owns the property does he asked for a ... a deed for example\nBy the code or whatever like\nI don't I don't I don't know because for example if you go to my house and I keep my deed or in a safe deposit box and I asked a locksmith you know what I Need new keys well no I Need the dean of the house\nTo help prove that into the call then I'm Sorry who does he call if you've taken a ticking and done you know I get my vote who to who does he call David\nCalling like a telephone let me get into the service call\nYeah oh I don't understand he was called to show up at a place and why should he who is he supposed to call not show up\nNot college even it's her history is taking the service call\nWhy in the last with ... and I know I don't know of a locksmith code don't want to do what do you what do you expect him to do he if someone calls he had not yet I'm sure not show up\nBecause you should check identification\n... what I ended up David what is the ID do\nI Need to show that somebody live at that when\nYou're saying it has to be it has to be that address got it so it says showing ID to show that he lived there and he didn't have any idea\nAll right All right All right I Know that in the federally concerns no no no no I I think you have enough\nThere certainly to ah to take a locksmith and your friend to court I or even\n... detective give it a court thing my ex friend criminally we're thinking of luck for the court civilly\nUh yes and the locks and the detectives are going after him criminally Oh yes oh then you know what you do it at that point once you have a ... ... here's what's going to happen once he is a job I Would dismissed the claim okay at this point\nI Would dismiss it with or without prejudice so you can sue again because I'll tell you why if it turns out that he pleads a couple of things can happen restitution is going to be ordered a and that is far stronger than any judgment you can get David\nA judgment for people like this mean nothing you have to go collected and these cock roaches what do you think or let's say you get five thousand dollars okay you have a judgment against the ... where's he going to cost about five thousand dollars David\nFrom ... from what [noise]\nI'm Sorry I was thinking about your friend\n[laughter] oh I'm Sorry I was thinking about your friend a friend or another and then\nWe're wasting police so the police are going after the walk Smith right\nWe're going after the after my body weight so they're not going after the locksmith I don't know I don't I don't think so no I\nThey wouldn't All right so what you have is okay you sue the locksmith for a civil eating put all that shit okay that makes sense that right I think you're I think you have enough there certainly go to small claims court\nYou know yeah I I Would I ... I certainly would take that okay take care of them All right so either or he didn't do a great job of explaining all of that or I'm an idiot\nAnd actually I'm leaning towards I'm an idiot on that call\nHuh yeah 'cause if I had called and asked the ... that question and I got the answer that I got\nI Would definitely call me an idiot or call whoever cold or the name of bill and idiot even that makes no sense to me oh I think we're going to take another call what do you think\n[noise] hey James uh yeah yeah\nI got up from school oh it's been nine years now and I want to just after the fact that I have to pay all that long\nWhen you say nine years you ever made a payment nine years\nYeah the payment on that you have not made a payment for nine years yeah\nOK how much is how much was the original loan James\nUh twenty eight thousand\nTwenty eight thousand nine years ago yeah now thirty eight that\nOh I saw I thought it would have been one point eight million ah it's only thirty eight thousand well this one I still think you owe it but how are they contacting you\n[laughter] it's like they keep selling it for a third party\nAll right well some point James you're going to get sued
