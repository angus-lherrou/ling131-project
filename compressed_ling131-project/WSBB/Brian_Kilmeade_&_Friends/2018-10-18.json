lesson immigration\nI wasn't qualified people you're one of the few countries there are growing you know how much the Russians would love people the Europeans with love people no one's going there but you're right I Want to get to the premise of your columns you believe the\nBest thing to happen to the Democratic party would be for them to lose because of how they're trying to win\nOr lose and lose big and this is what's so important we've seen over the last few weeks with the Kavanaugh\nA crisis in so much else the way the Democrats and the left to behave themselves you know screaming or sending like a band she's screaming from the gallery of the U.S Senate during the final vote on Kavanaugh a screaming at a Ted Cruz and other people chasing the amount of restaurants\nOr you've seen vandalism against a GOP offices from Wyoming to Nebraska even here on the Upper East side\nOf Manhattan uh offices torch vandalism this kind of thing\nAnd I think if the if the Democrats win if they win either or God Forbid both houses of Congress we're going to get a peach but Medicare for all the Democrats socialist agenda\nOr that will continue if they are barely lose if if the Republicans hang on you know just by a thread\nOr the Democrats are going to blame it on Russia they're going to blame it on white nationalism a what racism whatever you want\nI think only if the Democrats or Republicans deliver a crushing blow\nAgainst the Democrats only then will they sit down focus realize you know it's not Trump is not rush it's not ... it's a it's a bad message it's the resistance is the violence the mob rule and then I think they may engage in some self reflection and trying to think about okay what positive agenda what positive message can we present to improve the lives of American\nPie the over the next two years that the president wants to put a stake through the heart of only white people vote for him who want to go back to old America pre civil war you spend your time focusing on Hispanics and blacks\nAnd you just say Yuri helping them these opportunities zones are happening things you're taking place they don't trumpet them at all but I Want the president to go back in and do the McCain style town halls and take a step back\nGo to rallies with your friends but also try to convert the ones that are not and I think that will begin to bring people together I understand what you're saying that I Would consider that when Kanye West in his ranch said I Am not first stop and frisk it doesn't mean he's a bad person he disagrees with the president\nHe was we'll talk about that that's the beginning of getting somewhere and marginalizing your enemies\nI think that's absolutely right and I think that um look the President Trump in the ... you have an excellent message to bring into black communities that we can talk about the fact that the black unemployment rate is at the lowest\nIn us history or when the economy grows that are about four percent versus about two percent under Obama double what we were told a couple of years ago was the new normal in the ceiling on growth that such as good for white people that's good for black people that is good for Hispanics it's for everybody in this country\nAnd he ought to go into black neighborhoods and and and preach this and it's very hard to accused him of being a racist weights black people he's actually meeting with black people\nRight or at once it might it might it might not say things like her she'll walk or Jim Brown they're friends of his uh go with people that need to be converted\nTo do it in a civil way begin to change the tone ... who's the most ... what is the most effective way that a Democrat can counter the present\nThe most effective message for the Democrats are all trying to play his game Elizabeth Warren's trying to play this game ... trying to play this game Cory bookers trying to play the game they're not going to win that way well the thing the funny thing is that\nThey raised it they they they grabbed as bait every time he offers that you know if Elizabeth Warren decided okay I'll get a DNA test that'll show him and it kind of explode in her face and she's a ... at most one sixty fourth jerky I I'm One eighth\nChinese my great grandpa came from either ... or ... or Hong Kong or you can't get into Harvard you just ... now your age there goes the ...\nOr I Am eight times more Chinese than a Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee at at at most for her but why should doing it she's playing this game she is settled in the right point is you do in all of their head incredible and she ... she could have stuck\nTo her message talked about getting more people in it involved the economy or talk about corporate a justice quote unquote whatever she wants to whatever messages but now she's ... distract them at the Democrats are running around talking about ancestry dot com and all this and that's that's a pretty weak vested for them to\nUh and and to to\nSomeone that has a a U.S green card into their embassy there turkey and like you say\nTo dispose of his body and that matter\nWe cannot accept that we can I can do that and so there has to be ramifications of consequences for Saudi Arabia and if this young man is going to be the face of Saudi Arabia we'd have to say what a push away I think that we have to move away from this either or thing we have to be embraced Saudi Arabia more because\nYou know Iran is so bad you know we we don't need to\nThe more because you know Iran is so bad you know we we don't need to associate with any type of hate us escort behavior like we have seen just recently out of Saudi Arabia\nWell we don't eh you know the big the flip side to this China and Russia move in there that they don't mind making the sale\n[laughter] well that's true but the other thing that we need to do that's why the economic\nSanctions and our economic growth is so important and we are gathering up the allies on our side to put more pressure on China and Russia with or without a doubt we see China that is you know closing up in Pakistan we see Russia and what they're trying to do and the middle east especially with Syria but\nThere there's a clear cut a path for the United states of America and if we\nAccept this type of behavior we don't you know come down on Saudi Arabia not only are you going to get more that behavior but\nIt's going to lessen our staff and the world as well\nYeah I mean they evidently does ... that's good and he was exiled and he was interrogated and these ... pretended to be good is the one is actually in charge they turn out the Turkish ship it concluded that they painted the whole place they also brought in a cleaning crew to clean up the whole place\nAnd uh the one of the people that was involved with it fits in with the twelve man team that landed and went into the consulate is known to be very tight with the crown prince\nAnd on top of that the consul general has disappeared so he's not available for questioning this is the worst most ill thought out brutal assassination\nWith massive ramifications that I've ever seen it so stupid and rip make you wonder if we're missing something\nWell it was definitely premeditated but the other thing is that it shows an incredible a level of belligerence\nAnd the ... matter of the Saudis and that will do something like this and\nWe dare anyone to challenges we dare anyone to you know ... bring any consequences against us so this is an important stats or the United states of America\nJust the same as we were tough or North Korea was brought into this table we got to be tough all Saudi Arabia say look as long as this crowd princes you're Arab parents this guy has this control this hour we're not going to do business with you and if that means that you're going to be catching\nYou know rock is a ... from the who the rebels out of Yemen so be it\nA real quick on immigration I Want to get a question now your book uh the maybe the future speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi talked about why the president needs to build a wall it's his own insecurity the audio is not grade uh by the way either her comments but they were sharing cuts Seventeen\nHall\n[laughter]\n\nReally I mean the last well\nThose type of delusional comment so the reason why she won't be the speaker of the house but\nI said that Nancy Pelosi should ask you know Pope Francis if they're concerned about you know their manhood because the Vatican has a wall or she should call up a is the Israelis and ask them about their manhood because they've built a wall to stem the flow of terrorism\nComing to their country but yet and still there you know getting rocket and missile attacks we just saw the most recent one coming out of Gaza so we've got to do something because we are sovereign nation at a sovereign nation has to be able to control is borders we do not have control over our borders\nI can argue a ... on hold Texas hold a nation what is going on in Texas and made you say I got to tell the country\n[noise] they said that is happening in Texas is happening all across the the the entire country is that you know successful businesses and corporations are moving into a successful\nRed states they have the right economic policies regulatory policies but as these businesses and corporations are moving in there not explained it to their employees while they're moving there and so you're seeing an incredible ideological shift in Georgia and Tennessee in\nTexas in North Carolina and that is going to be very threatening for the future of these states because for whatever reason is a locust effect as I call it where people are coming out of California Illinois and New York New Jersey and they're still bringing their failed policies whipped up to successful states\nAnd you're witnessing any taxes you think Texas is changing\n[noise] without a doubt when like I always tell people you look at your major urban centers in Texas and you look at the colleges and universities and matter of fact I wrote about today Texas women as university as a restricted people to apply free speech zones\nNow that's the University of Texas a public university of Texas the saying you only have five free speech designate his own on his campus\nThat's that shows that something is happening at Texas this is not Massachusetts it's not Vermont is that California\nUh I got to bring you to uh\nBoy you or I got to bring it to a ... this on on Texas in particular do you believe that are in Florida in Texas in these other places in in Georgia do you do you think the Republican Party is is being caught napping\nI think that the Republican Party lacks a strategic vision a but yet you see that strategic vision on the other side look the northern Virginia dictates the politics of the state of Virginia and they've been able to flip a Virginia Colorado I used to be a red state what Parkland mouse blue and the space\nOn Denver and Boulder uh the major if those major population centers or what you have these major colleges and universities so I think that the Republican Party nice to have more strategic vision and it used to go into these major urban centers where you see the greatest amount of failure progress a socialist policies and they need to make the argument\nRight and by the way just on the latest poll and the real clear average cruised by seven it was a one or two point race but he seems to be pulling in a way so if Texas is gonna flip ... go blue I quit the LBJ\nDays or not there yet

New Jersey that sentiment end as who we had a hung jury that kept him out of jail a and it was censored by the Senate we we\nWish we did pull that race and we had Menendez up but\nYou know here's a case again where you've got partisanship New Jersey is a blue state so people break along partisan lines and a lot of that seems to have put aside there were people who who weren't thrilled with with what a senator Menendez it done on but we are voting for him anyway in that regard but that it helps the Democrats in places like that it hurts them in places like say Missouri\nLeslie Florida Senate race Nelson verse Scott yeah was that hurricane done for Scott do you think you could have pulled it yet because you in the middle of\nTrying to help yet they haven't pulled it yet the suspicion is the questions that we'll ask is you know does that give Scott a chance to look like he's doing something to act like an executive oftentimes NATO natural disasters do give somebody in power a chance to do that\nUh how'd you cut a deficit from Eighteen to nine and we know they do at your energy we know that Don junior is coming out there correct\nYes a darn junior will be out here uh tonight we're

Twitter at John James\nL L Y you here with congressmen and maybe future speaker Nancy Pelosi said about the president's push to build a border wall especially in light of the caravan of over a thousand people were heading to our border cut Seventeen\nYou're home all\n\n[noise] I\nThink it's a man who'd issue\nUm I I think that ah that's ridiculous I the the president's job is to enforce\nOur laws in this Nancy Pelosi's job to make the laws if she doesn't like the laws of the book is her job to fix them in ... and and and and and to legislate and she is basically camp\nAnd and and to legislate and she is basically campaigning on issues that she's created\nUm we need to secure our borders I Believe that legal legal immigration is a moral and economic imperative for this country by illegal immigration must be stopped Nancy Pelosi is part and parcel to the problem and she's refusing to solve it\nBecause ah for her own political gain we need to send people to Washington who are more intent on keeping us all safe who are intent on upholding our values as Americans\nAnd not continuing to to divide us ah like Nancy Pelosi and and the establishment politicians are doing\nHave you dealt a John with a race issues in your life\nUm I I have I have my mom and dad are taught me or that I Would need to be twice as good to be considered half as worthy and so I I've always uh endeavor\nTo uh to do my best or put God first uh end to serve my country and that's what I'm doing now I'm like I said before I just have a future good friends are the folks who uh who just don't know me yet I and I'm going to show through my actions that is not about black or white about red white and blue and I'm looking forward to representing us all very\nWell do you think we're getting better as as as a society as a country or judging people equally not on the color of their skin\nOr I think that um if we are backsliding it's the um\nThe political prejudice and beginning to see\n'em you have this political prejudice people are beginning to assume they know exactly who you are because we are or the the by your name when I went to Iraq I didn't fight for Democrats or Republicans I fought for Americans and so people are are assuming that uh that uh\nUh that they know who I Am and what I'm all about just because of the party and running and I'm an independent thinker too many people have died for me to have the right to vote to think for myself\nAnd we outsourced our our thought process and in in our ability to to vote in the lead for ourselves to a political establishment a cares more about getting re elected than representing the people a part of the American dream is not only being able to elect our leadership but also the dream of being leadership\nWe have in the system right now in this country was the only way you can be a U.S senator is it your super wealthy or if you're a super connected if you're a political politician\nGroup politician that's wrong and I think that people are are are are getting Americans against each other a ... and and then blame the other side when things get done our country is in the throes of a generational change and the Dems and liberal media wants to keep talking about um\nAbout things that continue to inflame a and I'm looking forward to bringing us together because I've seen what what a partisan sectarian divisions can do when I went over to Iraq Sunni fighting Shia cousins fighting cousins\nA we have a history in this country of family fighting than when we cannot go back that way and so yes we still have a racial tensions racial divides we still have gender issues and gender divide but despite our issues we're still the best country in the face of the planet and can't forget all Americans\nAre not perfect but trying to be and fighting along the way and lastly I think the ... the United states to do a lot of race issues Kanye West came over Jim Brown came over to the White House did some stuff in front of the camera\nAnd then people are saying they'd Kanye West is is are being used by the president as a sample that he shows he's a racially tolerant but he's not what is your reaction to it what what on last week as it came to came to gang issues and race relations in America with this with this White House\nWell ah I I think that anyone who who speaks out it just goes to show that are Democrats aren't interested in diversity of thought they're interested in getting people in line are telling the party line because uh\nUh ... it's ridiculous um we in this country I remember being raised to believe that uh everyone was entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts but now the Democrats are you saying that everyone is entitled to their own fast but not their own and [noise]\nUh I'm looking at breaking down a bit the shackles that that that Shane us to dependency and victimhood and I believe that\nUm by reaching out to the communities people selectively forget that are that the president um has a has forgiven millions of dollars of debt to strictly black colleges and universities they tend to forget that the president has met with the presidents of those universities um\nThen reached out to them where I'm not even sure that the uh the previous president did uh we need to make sure that we take a look at the the underlying issues of income inequality\nAnd get to the root cause which is opportunity inequality and having those honest conversations because in in these areas are these are the places that are that that a progressive liberal policies have failed Americans overwhelmingly where minority African American we need to have these conversations we need to change now\nI can guarantee one thing I'm for the state of Michigan or if Debbie Stabenow stays in office nothing will change we need to make sure that we end her rain hyper partisanship we encounter rain\nTo make sure that we in her rain hyper partisanship we encourage reign of ineffectiveness and we end her reign of broken promises I'm looking forward to represent Michigan\nUh and uh I Believe that among African Americans specifically we need a seat at the table when Ninety eight percent of those one party than either party feels like they have to work for your vote\nWe have to silence we had been ignored and now we need to have a seat at the table because righteous indignation is not going to change things right just influence will we have marching from Selma to Detroit\nWe've been writing from lots to Baltimore and nothing's changed in forty fifty years we need to make sure that both parties work for a vote we have a seat that both tables so that we can continue to push changed now\nI remember I hosted a show with a Jim Brown out an ex TRL sports radio\nAnd I was we were talking to get all of these calls about black coaches by general managers he said forget that we need black owners and then then you'll have somebody in power and then there's the black or is going to pick the people are going to get the most wins and that's what you should be looking for it not for it you know go out and you know go out and get it\nYou know and that's the thing and I love that Jim amounts that we need more black owners but the thing is African Americans have been have been rolled into the sense that not only should we accept mediocrity but we should expect it\nOr you take a look at not just an NFL with the coaches and the and the and whatever\nBut we need to look at owners and you see that right now with what they're saying and Fifteen dollars an hour why are you telling us that we only should expect Fifteen dollars an hour watching teaching my babies how to make Fifteen hundred dollars an hour why aren't you are doing the things that it would take to poll entire communities out of poverty by by actually uh um\nIncentivizing people to get married and keep families together rather than saying but hey if you're a single mother and you get married somebody making the same amount you could lose your benefits that incentivizing people to do the wrong things I Would need to have these conversations\nBecause we need to bring everybody up not just black or white but everybody because these are issues that all of us face but disproportionately speaking\nOr African Americans who have been forgotten I'm looking forward to working for everyone but particularly those who've been categorically forgotten\nJohn James year exciting candidate and I have a sense a I have a sense is going to be a sprint to the finish you had

F. C. global\nSo he's all about making money earning money and the ... is also about a business\nBobby still with us [noise] All right\nUh he's gone so if a businessman can be successful in the White House can you be successful in balancing the budget and bring some fiscal sense to the state of Connecticut I Will say this\nThe most people I Know now my son works in Connecticut most people I Know are extremely unhappy with what's going on there and nobody blamed Republicans because I've had absolutely no power wouldn't have been a window McMahon was extremely successful as an executive in Connecticut\nOr she couldn't breakthrough but got close Bob I was just talking about the fact that you were the c._e._o. of the F. C. global last UPS you mentioned before that and more C O G O O G a a G corporate finance why would you want to put all that knowledge into trying to balancing er into getting into politics\n[laughter] it's a good question I I'm a ... a group in ... I went to public schools uh\nFor it to a local college Fairfield University it's been great to me but I've been watching it being ruined by horrible economic policy I've got three daughters ... even ... I don't want to have to get on a plane to see my grandkids in Florida some ...\nUm is all about the economy here I'm an restructuring businesses for Thirty years the school to get a forty billion dollar\nBudget that needs to be structured so it's ... my little house and I just felt that it was time to read the ...\nUm fortunately for me to a recording of good with a ... or ... or go now it's down to two ... ready for schools don't want a politician eighty five percent of the people we called and not on a politician I'm you're looking at ... or ... ... how to be running for governor it\nWell I mean you've got one resent Iran Johnson's one of the most effective centers are from business and of course the price of the United states a much of this year in many politicians is we're trying to run the government like a business ... business where he's actually making a lot of decisions himself a Bob Bob stepping us Keith thanks so much for joining us\nThank you for having me on a cruise I'd love to come on get what\nYou got it as he face off against ... and tries to pull up the upset for the Republicans in Connecticut when we come back Jerry Lewis joined us the market is down put your money doesn't have to be one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine\nWell yeah we're good at that what we know how to do right\nAnd be the president would say because I needed the money for defense either trade off on some of these social programs jury at some point maybe it's a re election of President Trump someone's got to go in there and a bipartisan Simpson Bowles way again and present some type of political cover way to make spending more sustainable\nSo you're saying no Medicare for all is that what you're telling me I mean that's one thing I mean I mean I think that or wherever you are you talking to you or just saying even the defense department says we have enough missiles we have enough right thanks so\nOkay so it's not really about defense it's really about the entitlement programs that's the thing that really drives us over the edge of the question is how do you manage that right\nOr is that about having people as they approach their elderly year's\nFall out of these programs or early I mean you don't you get into them later in life because our lifespan is so much longer I think that's a closer answer but this idea of Medicare for all\nDoes not work and why does it work because of the money the dollars and cents we can't afford that and why why why would you at Tel corporate America to stop\nGiving your employees healthcare insurance [noise] this is a program that has worked since World War two hundred and fifty three million Americans get their coverage through their employer for the love of God don't put a knife in the back of that well\nWe love it a news Corp we got great health care and I love it and if you will to visit to say I got news for you don't have to spend on health care they'll high five you and say thank you very much I guess what the quality will go down nobody reinforces in Medicare they all need supplemental I Know that for a fact that's right and so that's for somebody that was never meant\nTo cover the whole country but there is a legitimate nonpartisan issue health care remains number one jury have you seen a model that works [noise]\nI think this idea that there is an easy answer like government funds everything is stupid and I think every market will have a different solution and for us I think it's a lot of different pieces of the pie coming together it can't be one thing it can't be just a big old government\nIt can't be one thing it can't be just a big old governor fat government program that covers it that's like oh that's such a great idea no it's not I\nDon't know how that works I Can't make that work in my head we've got to get these companies to compete against each other for your health care dollars we have to and sent private citizens to know what they're paying and to complain when they're paying too much we've already got a program out\nHealth and Human Services secretary this week saying look we're going to get these prices on drugs down and part of the way we're going to do it is when you advertise your drug on the television you have to say how much it costs\nAs you're sitting there going to have exposure and just about everything starting the new year I heard the president's insisting and for the big pharma is resisting\nThat's right they don't want to do it they got their own plan it will be fine go to this website click five buttons go some will eventually will get you to answer your question I don't think that's the way to do it\nI think informing people you know information is the key to this and getting these companies to compete with each other they're having you know success at the margin with small things that ultimately will make a big difference there more generic uh\nDrugs coming to market their getting faster approval for drugs this is all going to help\nYeah I Want you to do with President Trump and tell me if you're comfortable with that said ...\nWhat ... is the fed because the fed is raising rates too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because you looked at the last inflation numbers every little thing for them that\nI mean I'm not going to Janet Yellen I was going to be honest I'm not blaming anybody I put them there and made me a thread maybe it's wrong but I wanted to get it wrong for so couple of other people there that I'm also happy with it so that was very happy with papal\nShabby with people with a guy there is going there we can't do anything about it no fire and out but he has a point and how are you really have time evidently used to scream about the fed where we're all going to be okay but it does it bother you at all that the fed might look at it as a become more of a political Oregon that everything that they do raise rates are not have\nTo become a political Oregon all they do is ignore him that I mean that's all they have to do and that's probably what they will do but I think he's got a point\nI think that we may be at you know look inflation not an issue right now right and the president's looking at camping down the growth of we have why would we want to do that at this point I think the fed overreached when it said we're going to look at two things not only are we going to look at\nAnd ... not only are we going to look at inflation but we're also going to look at interest rates would look at these jobs are going to get jobs the fed has no business looking at jobs in my view and that was the decision they made like two presidents ago\nSo here's the part of the United states moments ago speaking with Stuart Varney on trade with China cut fifty one rather stop talking with China again we're all very ready for you\nI don't think so and then I told them they want to make a deal and I said you guys aren't ready if you're just not ready because look they've been taking five hundred billion dollars a year out of our country it's time that we stopped okay we rebuilt China you know that better than anybody you talk about it more than I Do I say\nAnd it stopped and you see what's happening with China's a whole different ballgame so now they're paying a twenty five percent tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars hasn't affected our economy housing costs have gone up inflation so low\nVery low hasn't had any impact that we see except for one billions of dollars are pouring into the treasury\n[noise] so um do you dispute that fact of terrorists who bringing billions of dollars into a a treasury because I've heard that that's just beautiful\nWell would I dispute is that it has no effect on prices we've already got companies warning that they're going to have to raise prices because of tariffs that's already there I'm Sorry if I add on steel\nSteel also and in other ... ah Proctor and gamble I mean like mainstream and when you get a chance\nAfghans and when you get into the language of the terrorists it's going to be food stuff it's a lot of stuff you pick up at the grocery store okay those prices are going to be going up you know the reality is a lot of stuff you would buy to put under the Christmas tree which those prices were probably locked in in the summer\nBut stuff that you might pick up Tuesday night at the grocery store may go up saying right\nOr the jury you know I was using it it's pretty obvious he's using it as a way to get used to the table I'm going to punish you with this and get you there I'm going to take your car away and then ask you how much you got to pay to get it back when like you're giving it\nI think that's true I think what's interesting about that is this is going to be hard\nWeighing in the president's favor the Chinese economy not doing while the stock market terrible you're on how to add more yeah you're unhappy with an eight hundred point and sell off on the ... go to China it's much much worse right\nUm so he's got a lot of things we're working in his favor he has to be able to rely on Europe he has to be ... able to rely on Canada or Mexico other Asian nations he's got to pull the world together against China super difficult it's a high hurdle but you know this is something that needed attention\nDid and Chuck Schumer agrees Europe agrees really on they said Mr President why are you fighting with everyone\nAgrees early on they said Mr President why are you fighting with everyone wants Korea Brazil or breaking up NAFTA European Union and little by little they've come into line the framework for the use air but I'm not sure what's happened since evidently Japan is on is ready to be is ready to be executed in a good way that deal\nBut now if you can organize the world against China most of all this theft of intellectual property that's the key isn't it and it's\nAlso up to our businessmen not to be money hungry to the point where they sacrificed technology for their families but it's American security overall\nIt as well as American security it's also America's future right I mean basically what China has done and in that race of the turtle and the hair Dave jump to had Twenty years because they were able to steal our best ideas and that hurts us and we need to stop that\nRight I Want to hear what to do with the president just told steward Varney about cutting spending and regulation cuts forty nine\nAlways cut regulations more than any president ever as you can go for years and years it doesn't matter [noise]\nThis tremendous regulations that we can be cutting still and we're doing it you know it used to take Twenty one years to get a highway bill\nYou know bad case but it would take Twenty one years we're trying to bring that down to two and maybe even one and right away if it's not right we're not going to approve of the we're not going to take Twenty one years to find out whether or not we can do it\nBut uh that's pretty much what he thought gee you've you've gotten reports too that he has legitimately cut the red tape and regular\nAt that I mean there's no doubt about it I mean you can like there are studies that show the number of regulations that existed pre and a number of regulations that existed after and there are fewer and I really think that's why you see at these companies\nBeing so much more aggressive ah and and going out hiring ... you know spending money because\nThey know that this big weight on their shoulders of regulation has been lifted and that they can do more things you know when you know that the White House is on your side it makes life a lot easier you're not always on the defensive you're not always back on your heels trying to figure out how to fight back\nOr last week there's another businessman looks like he's going to get in the race Mike Bloomberg regrets that getting in the last time a what kind of uh what kind of not politically but what kind of resume does he bring to the table that could give Donald Trump trouble while\nHe's a hugely successful businessman I mean massively successful\nWithout any nobody can argue with his track record with Bloomberg the Bloomberg Terminal I shouldn't be talking like this because we compete right against him but he has been incredibly successful businessman no doubt about it he had a vision he executed it he hired so many people are here in New York and elsewhere\nThat's tough he can get things done he knows how to get things done a better president says he'd hold our trash or Reagan he he she he said that", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville",
