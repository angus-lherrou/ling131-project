wrote a a fascinating comments on Fox News dot com I think it's there it's on the front page right now and on the New York post Michael why do you believe what you're hearing now is somebody who's preparing for for a rematch\nWell run just a clip you played as is one of many examples of\nI've been writing for months and often you know people say you're crazy but I've been writing for months that she wants to run\nAnd that each of these things as another little sign another little step into the arena\nAnd I think you're seeing more and more uh once the midterms turn she and her husband are going on this speaking tour for six months seven hundred bucks at the high end too yeah\nBut that's true but to me I think the main thing is she going to be out there the two of them are going to be out there this is a way of keeping her name front and center at while all the other candidates scrambled to put together their teams instructor raise money she's going to be ahead of them again and I think she's been sitting here thinking who can beat me\nWho among the Democrats can beat me uh in primaries\nAnd you'd think that President Obama could step up and say step aside he'll review or you're too old and you lost\nHe could but still who is the alternative I think that's the question and until somebody emerges\nShe is something of the default incumbent in that position of being the nominee I look at us Brian who can lead the party who couldn't unite them around them a message look how divided the Democrats are there may be twenty people\nRunning in twenty twenty or just as President Trump or in sixteen had all of those are Republican opponents\nLittle by little he started with a small base a little by little he gained traction he got his base up to twenty twenty five thirty thirty five as everybody dropped out he gained more and more I think you could see something like that with Hillary Clinton a war of attrition where she starts with the biggest base\nAnd grows it as they all drop out\nSo you know you do point out some things that I read the New York times editorial section is actually was critical of her to Vanity Fair wrote an article saying that she did you learn the lessons of me too because they kill us answer\nAbout did your husband should your husband have resigned after his affair and lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky so her and she was she was an adult much do terrible and so that is\nWhat is technically legal but that's but that's the Clintons they're never going to change I mean that is the thing they never really changed show would you a\nChronically news to push back on the left nuts on the right the right would be high fiving if she ran again here's Murray Harper worked for John Kerry said\nI think that she has become a distraction I had a mensch respect for many of the things she in her life and her career but her goal is to help the Democratic party ... comments particularly about me too and sexual assault\nIt's just not helping it is a distraction at a time like Nineteen days out from the midterms white democratic candidates are looking to the future not the past and she is the path\nI think that's a that's a very good point that Maria ... makes but she's also talking about the limit terms that\nShe is a distraction to the midterms and I think that is all of those all of those women who wrote those articles that you cited two or three of them\nThey also basically are complaining that she's a distraction against the party's candidates in the midterms that'll be over soon enough then we'll turn to twenty twenty almost immediately the field will start to take shape\nAt that point she will not be a distraction she will be one of many people I think she but she's going to do it on her own way look she may have health problems that surface\nAt some point I spoke to President Trump to my interview with him or two weeks ago he said he thought that she did not have the mental or physical stamina to do it um I don't know if she does or doesn't but I think she's getting ready to run I think she's gonna she's preparing herself she's positioning herself\nNicaragua will giving money to even though we're giving humanitarian aid to them\nThey feel as though they have a right to come in here\nUh put Mexicans don't feel that way they get it why don't endure ends in Guatemalans\nBrian I I I I Would really leave up to you know the ... the U.S to determine domestically what's the you know the appropriate or a system of immigration\nOkay I didn't want to put you in a bad spot near kind enough to join us all what a what a what the us here here's I Want you to hear this have you comment short Katie Waldman opponents\nHere's here's I Want you to hear this have you comment for Haiti Waldman of homeland security uh was kind enough to come on with this Friday and she says this dates back to two thousand nine listen what happened then made the ... ah they they made politicians think the central and south Americans were more important than Mexicans\nAnd take a kid that innate law written by Dianne Feinstein that tree in Canada Canada and Mexico different than it trade in Central Americans because back in two thousand eight most of apprehension\nWe're all Mexican now they're all predominantly Central American it's a shocking that when you look at it at the hundred thousand family in at apprehended last year from El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras nearly Ninety nine percent of them remain in the country today\nSo what that says it's all pretty much does four hundred thousand apprehension is we cannot repatriate on their way once they enter put a cow in the United states we cannot just send them right back\nSo that's the reality ... your country is not the problem\n[noise] ... you know listening to what you just played\nMy comments would be the formal in just a few days circle Mexico into the United states coke convene a conference here in Washington\nA including the ... northern triangle concrete subsided level on Buddhist and walk them out there were was very clear about that meeting which Mexico and the U.S participated work ... was that we need to work\nOn a you know regionally on a two track approach\nOne we most assured the development is better on those countries\nAre so people are not forcing ... immigration decision and that also LOL lost most of the year before that was the main conclusion Indian the only long term solution to this is making sure that there's development in this country and the United states his work its stores that goal as well as from Mexico\nAnd the Central American countries but at the same time we cannot obviously um look the other way to the fact that a ... most the trail and absurd that as a in in my view that's the protests will change things\nI guess everything is going on is just a um you know ... it really a call ... ...\nTo a step up the pace to find long term structural solutions to this phenomena and that is precisely what we're working for\nInvestors so you're saying if they want to stay in Mexico they can stay in Mexico but they just want to come here do you guys have laws and rules when it comes to refugee status or guest workers status or\nYes we do we do have both things we do have gas workers styles and we do have a a refugee status are ordering to our own immigration laws on the international law and in fact Brian about a piece of around ... ... ...\nA ... gift that he had already requested refugee status in Mexico and I was the intent\nA and we will continue to do so and that's why we call on the guy an office or the commissioner of the United nations on refugees to help Mexico into this process so which transparent it's clear it respects human rights and he'll holes that role\nAnd it's an important challenge August but I think we will be able to handle it\nCorrect yeah I Know you don't want to comment but there's some message that we're giving to Central Americans in those tribal countries\nTo make them think now more than ever now over the last eight years more than ever did they feel as though they can come in and not to beat the system and can stay you heard that that that did American\nExecutive American a federal government worker or the spokesperson for homeland security who said that Ninety nine percent of the people coming in or not Mexican so\nThere's some message that we're giving that's being misinterpreted or they know our laws better than anybody else now let me ask you a quick question about the wall when I look at what happened when I see the wall be ineffective in Israel when I see the well being active in Hungary\nUh when I saw how effective the Berlin Wall was a because for the wrong reasons when\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nStates I've bought off any concrete to protect its borders on air force of law and I want to make that very clear and when stocks have a very\nStrong corporation agenda with the chips and all the authorities in the U.S we don't see eye to eye on everything and\nYou know the United states has the right to protect its borders and we don't question if you ask 'cause we were you know you're friendly neighbor we would say perhaps that's not the best way to go and we have made that very clear and I think that's several analysts have pointed out to the fact that there are you know perhaps better ways to\nSecure our border and we have a very comprehensive agenda with United States\nSorry comprehensive agenda with United States that were um so that's that's pretty much where we are we you know we as as neighbors ... some friends who you know\nIt was on an issue we sit here and I understand that but it is it's there's something about a wall that bothers you I mean there are communities that don't want fences with my community everybody's got a fence but you don't take it personal if we could control our borders it'll make your southern border more defensible\nBrian where again we're not against any country forcing and protecting its borders a and the fact that it was personal because uh you know white white Mexico in general does not appreciate this position is ... is because it has been\nIn some instances a couple with a narrative that is very offensive to Mexicans uh Mexicans are hardworking people absolutely you don't have ... you know there's likely to be a you know ... people in a big group that's all he is okay\nBut um if you do it generally stationed in that regard you will go on to offend all of Mexico and let me give you an example but you know being born\nIn previous administrations more than you know five hundred miles of fence it's were built yeah but they were not coupled with a narrative that was offensive to our country\nAnd that it's important so we go we have a good luck with the Trump Administration says yes we do have differences but we believe that through corporation on ballot we saw those differences as we just don't like that that is precisely what we're going to eat it too\nYeah a pride matters so I understand that um and hopefully people will get that point across but when you see how many jobs we had when you talk to farmers\nI'm not I'm not saying all Mexicans are Central American should be working on a farm I'm not generalizing but a lot of them do and seven million jobs are open farmers are desperate for a guest worker program it seems like we just can't get out of the blocks and we're and we will have some simple problems\nI agree wholeheartedly with you I I think for example and we have had discussions with us from ... in that regard\nThat for example the age to a pizza program which allows temporary work is on the ... to come to your should probably be reviewed an updated in a way that it's more a it's more simple and more effective uh let me tell you something Mexicans don't have a ... plant that event that\nYou know goes ... tells him go and you know break the law on entering the United states um if there are sufficient\nAnd simple legal avenues I think that people will choose those the alive and\nThat's what I Hope and I understand I understand that this is a very sensitive on devices Easter political in the United states and we're extremely respectful of God but you know\nYou know a thoughtful discussion about how to fix the immigration system including you know discussions with Mexico will end up helping India has both countries our demographics are complimentary\nAnd as you just had I had sat down with the act sector people for you know I Believe in the last month and they feel that they need a lot of people in order to you have all the jobs in the same happened with the uh for example um construction business\nSo they can be a win win absolutely old countries yeah and and we should work on the ... right off the ship Brian\nAmbassador of the you know the story of our country you know when the Irish first came over they were building the railroads and when the Italians first came over they were they were working their way up but you know up the ladder it happens it through that's the history of America you have your own history as well but I got to just back I before I let you go and I know you're busy\nJust on this four thousand to seven thousand people that are coming towards a border\nDo you did the Mexican authorities have one last stand before they get to Texas Arizona New Mexico or or California\nWhat I Will let you know it's a Mexican authorities will make sure that everybody ... is complying with Mexican immigration
