would ultimately be confirmed but this happened multiple times and I was listening on a on the radio I wasn't seeing it but I saw it was even more horrified\nAnd then when the vice president walked out he was a ... to buy a boost in his is a by a great number of people across the street with me right now is rich Jones a uh find the newsman here handled in the morning for years and W. okay V. in Jacksonville, Florida or one of our great affiliates welcome to Jacksonville\nHey thanks rich first off I used to but even though it's Washington do you feel the anger and passion down here\nYeah I think you can I mean we haven't seen that kind of an electric atmosphere at say like a town hall or at a campaign event necessarily so it feels like we're at a distance there but you can certainly feel it and it certainly comes through on the radio on your show and many of our other shows are alive and local show\nA little bit later in the morning and ... through the afternoon you can certainly hear that as well\nBut it also I I think that the take away that we have in northeast Florida is the Florida Senate race is really really tight when you look at what some of the recent polling it's been kind of back and forth where Rick Scott held at one point advantage in July from a Mason Dixon pulling their based here in Jacksonville\nIt there was a little bit more momentum around the incumbent the Democrat Bill Nelson and he was able to turn individual by one point advantage do I mean you were talking about\nOne to two points swings that will happen every month or so as a new poll comes in and things and for weeks now are getting narrow razor thin we also have a big governor's race here as well it hasn't bled too much into that it would appear maybe in the ads but not so much in the campaign trail\nThe whole country watching a Gillum is somebody who's had some legal problems over in Tallahassee he seems to be able to shake that off the dissent just got off to stumbling start when some comments he made were\nIt would be able to shake that off of dissent just got off the stumbling start when some comments he made were misinterpreted but he may get a republic get the sense he's ready to wrap it up now was there a bit of a learning curve for the congressman [noise] I think so\nI think you know he's he's not run that state wide race so much he did run for Florida Senate for a brief period of time when Marco Rubio was running for the White House remember to Santa's was running to replace Rubio but he really had not\nPenetrated the state wide audience to be able to kind of make the name for himself and of course when Rubio exited the presidential race to stamp just went back to his house seat and likely at that made the decision to ultimately run for governor would it be really interesting now is\nThe impact that will soon to become hurricane Michael may have because the Tallahassee mayor needs to be Tallahassee mayor as the panhandle in the Big Bend area prepares for possible hit and Santas seemingly play in the right political card and saying he's going to spend a lot of the activities this week as everyone prepares for this possible impact\nFrom a store right you got to be prepared we see what happens in other cities when you have no infrastructure and when you're not prepared for catastrophes Florida seems to have that down but I don't want to get ahead of myself you guys seem to be able to react also notice a lot of these lines are buried here so in New York when something hits the telephone poles go down you guys put the investment and have a new\nYeah but I I Would say that we also have tree damage and we have flooding which are big issues and storm surge is always the dangerous part of a storm I mean we get\nEven on TV and you see it on Fox News channel as well Brian where you see the reporters who were out in the elements in the wind is a big thing but storm surge is always the most powerful and flooding is the the greatest killer in these kinds of events and so\nIt may not look as impressive as category two and three wins but it's the water it's the rising water we saw with Florence in parts of north and South Carolina\nThat can really be the deadly 'em up parts of these systems\nFor the most part though we've had a run through these and last\nYear was a really rough year in Florida and north east war with Hurricane Irma well I Know one thing the president wants to come down and help out around this and this and he wants to help out a Rick Scott question for you from what you can tell the president won Florida and that was the beginning of the shock that oh my goodness he might be able to win this thing and twenty sixteen\nBut yet some people and Rick Scott he or friends\nHowever is there a downside to the president coming here full\nVoice vote for my guys you know it's I I guess will ultimately seeing for weeks uh but I Would say that over the last few weeks when we've seen the president makes stops here in Florida whether it be a home in mar a Lago or if he's done campaign events\nIt hasn't been a full throated endorsement that that maybe you would come to expect from this kind of campaigner in chief\nFor Rick Scott for example he's in Orlando today it's not a rally it's a sheriff's association and so a number and law enforcement are going to be there\nHe'll likely mention right police chiefs are so he's likely to talk about Rick Scott but I Wonder\nIf the way that the Trump campaign and the ... campaign of worked kind of at arm's distance from each other if that ultimately comes back to hurt the Scott campaign it's all gonna we're gonna sorted out in the next four weeks and will ultimately no what was or wasn't the impact of President Trump\nFor rent got Senate bill is instinct is to put his arm around them because they are buddies forbidden former business people who decided to get into politics and not take any money to do it\nThe negativity I heard is and you tell me if I'm right here the rich got very worked very hard at winning over the Hispanic community and things he does need attention he's given especially the the Puerto Rican influx after the the slamming of there are again they relocated here some are still here and he's afraid of losing that on the perception that President Trump is not popular\nPolitics as a moment to remember Marco Rubio when he was running in that race for US Senate on the Republican side with former governor Charlie Crist there was a moment in that race it was when Charlie Crist gave a hug to President Obama when he came to Florida to the stimulus the Rubio campaign used the hug\nAnd they were able to see a huge spike in the polls as a result because he was able to rally the conservative base of the Republican Party off that one thing so you talk about the embrace\nWhat if Rick Scott is too close and too cozy from the perception with President Trump how might that hurt and penetrate women for example and Puerto Ricans and others as you mentioned you never know what that one moments may ultimately be used by your opponent and how that ultimately will play out in the closing weeks of this campaign\nRich shows with this year W ... helped me with this red tide why is Rick Scott being blamed for red tide where he was forced out of a restaurant we understand because of protesters\nI how why use me because it's an easy thing to be able to put blame on something that's a really complex story to tell it's easy if you've not followed it and you don't know the background of how this red tide situation ultimately comes to be\nI'm I'm moving forward you you learn I humility from the process and I think that's going to be the case for justice Kavanaugh's well I you know you can't you're you're going to always have people out there who are who are going to be an\nOpponent but um if anything I think it it remind them that that's not that's not your target audience as Justice Thomas would always say I didn't take an oath to you know to to New York times editorial board right after he knows the constitution I got I got a follow up on that and so that that the real um [noise] you know single audience there\nUm [noise] you know single audience there\nTo congressman Gerry ... of New York and as a New Yorker I'm embarrassed that he's one of my congressman or but he came out and said this if the Democrats win the house\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so if you use on the Supreme Court ah and and the Senate hasn't investigated than anything else will have to\nPush it on the Supreme Court so the house will do an investigation on a shooting Supreme Court justice\nA shirt you want to keep politicizing the process you know have at it that um look the Senate Judiciary committee has\nDone an amazing amount an investigative work and frankly they they still\nAre looking into more of these ah these ... claims but they feel like OK even you know we're we're going to at least I'm do our due diligence on all of this so uh hopefully if he if he wants to be that he'll just at the Senate Judiciary committee and they can they can share their nose at that because they've already really done the work see\nI used to I just do the benefits anyone for them to do that and you're not you don't do political stuff but I just don't know if there's going to do anything except for get Republicans to the polls uh we'll see how that\nThat's something we've stayed in this whole time and people on the right getting so incensed at the way this has been on just\nPoliticized by the left everything from the way that the investigations started and ... and were leaked it that are on the whole time it wasn't something that was good for judge Kavanaugh it wasn't something it was good for doctors four dollars she said she wanted it's not what it was it wasn't good for the court\nAnd it wasn't good for America so uh that's not the way to go about this process I Hope we've learned it if not I hope that that there are some people I Know people kind of screaming in the last maybe that's what they want it but I don't think that's what the broad swath of America how they want\nOur confirmations to go now to be to be just a circus of uncorroborated allegations one after the other uh for for purely products at parties and reason so I Hope I learned a little like this\nWhere are you know I Hope so I Would say that it had been saying this now I think we're all everybody's staring at the edge of the cliff and see that no one survives if we take one more step and so my hope is that going to be a sense of decorum on\nThe next justice or maybe on the next polarizing issue there's going to be a sense that vilify lying and I think one of the first test is not villa vying weeds Murkowski or Susan Collins for making different decisions\nAnd Joe Manchin if Democrats want to be arrogant into Joe Manchin let us down and shame and all these things good maybe he'll continue to do that now he has no reason even feel guilty or maybe he'll just flip parties you have to look at the picture\nA ... to the big picture but I Want to just tell you those protests\nMight not have been organic I got the sense when I saw Jeff Flake the fact that the cameras rolling the fact that all these are all these people knew exactly what the senators were coming out there was a script\nAnd vice news showing a raw Thomas said this about this ... twenty six\nWe also some people who are organized and that moment with Jeff Flake on the hill we talked to one woman who worked for ultraviolet was paid\nShe helps steer people in the right way is to be able to to confront center were paid there were people who are paid by organizations like ultraviolet to to try to harness that energy in a way that would make the viral moments that we ended up saying\nThat that really bothers me does it bother you\nAt yeah and you know we saw this as early as said his I'm On the initial confirmation hearing to remember this isn't something that suddenly they go oh no there's been this allegation we've got to stop they had been opposing him from the get go some\nSenators even from before he was nominated the fact that we can't have any one of the the um the appointed by President Trump so uh you know they they brought people said they were people who were on\nTaking taking video of people being paid at the protest during the initial here it's two hundred people were arrested that wasn't just a a you know to a spontaneous ah that that people decided to\nTake go to a whole new level of of disruption and I'm really lack of civility we should be having a debate about something it's fine not democracy but shouting people down isn't and now we're heading that I'm engineered\nFor TV kind of a moment but I I'll tell you there were a lot of people there I Know\nOn the other side I Know there were groups of women\nFor Kavanaugh walking Hall's not paid and then and people who are taking time away from their jobs their families to come in and walk peacefully in the hallways\nAnd and kind of talk reasonably with their senators not shouting not trying to get in their faces and and make a viral videos out of it but let's actually just show our support praying up and down the hall so I think there's um there's a lot of people\nOn both sides and this and we need to make when we need to just kind of return to a moment where we can have civility and not be trying to make this about the next spectacle\nOr carry less question do you think you were there when Justice Thomas who there you saw the dynamics between the judge Supreme Court justices do you think they will treat him differently because of the controversy that came through that Kagan in sort of my or for example um might be an briar might be like\nFor example um might be and briar might be like keeping them at arm's length like the Senate has become in the house has become parties don't interact to so called just a justices of different ... a political backgrounds who they stop interacting\nI Hope not I haven't yet that hasn't been how it had been so far and remember this court many of these members were there for Bush versus Gore I Can't imagine more politically charged into the case and yet\nThey know me working with for the rest of your life that if there's no point in making 'em unnecessary enemies and people forget because we focus on the high profile cases about forty percent of the case Easter\nOr unanimous so there's actually a lot that find that got this as we saw that several of them were there for his swearing in on Saturday that they get a quick white so he could start getting to work Justice Kagan with their Justice Ginsburg was there and I think that's great even I even on a kind of spontaneous for the moment thing because they were they were\nShowing that um I think the court just not the rest of the country at least knows how to work together they don't show to each other to make that point they make written documents and then they sometimes\nPersuade each other when one way or the other that's how our system should work and I hope that on the court can be a lesson to us of how to move forward as a country\nAbsolutely and I love without one is Steven Kobe's lead writers wrote and I'm being sarcastic I'm just glad we've ruined his life he later to cut down so allow you yeah what do you say that um\nI mean that that that that is the tragedy of what it seems like they're going for the hey you know what we can't lock you but at least we can ruin your life and that's horrible I don't think any I I just hope that that is a\nNarrow fringe Americans who actually want our politics to go that way but I think the best thing he can do it out it can move forward it ain't like Justice Thomas in fact\nI you can't run my life I I'm going to go out for the limit on live out my oath to uphold the constitution and at that that will be I think his best final argument and that is to have a you know continue to sit on the court and\nBringing those ... those are the principal decision and that continued to be the kind

here on the Supreme Court ah and also with Michael ... his former student who I think really taught himself beyond tolerance somebody self and really hurt the entire process in the country along the way so before we get to our next guests are let's get to the big three\nNow with the thing is they really didn't know who the power of three Brian's big numbers three\nMy advice is don't plain Traub help us don't hurt us help us because there's gotta be parity there's got to be a level playing field there's gotta be reciprocity China regrettably is not playing by the rules [noise] uh and there\nYou go to Larry Kudlow is just about had it China the president's got your number and has since Nineteen eighties now he's calling you out and even our allies and Democrats cannot argue with our approach the present looking to build another campaign promise taking on China to get them to play by the rules in trade and more all while secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nAmerica knows that they are they're not in who really in foods in North Korea or do they getting panicky that we're starting to move directly with North Korea and not going through them\nI I think it's both a I think that China and Russia want to be great powers they want to be involved and so this idea that the United states South Korea and North Korea or the center players in this drama\nWorries them they want to make sure that they are are still players on the international stage but the second part of it is I think especially for food and uh he sees what's good for the United states is bad for Russia and vice versa so I think he's looking to play spoiler here\nAnd the economic pressure on North Korea has been important to get us to this point and so I think Russia and China are I'm looking to defuse that a pressure a little bit which is going to make it harder\nSo that a pressure a little bit which is going to make it harder to get a deal side um so\nI Know I Know that you you are you're devising Mitt Romney for awhile and Marco Rubio to people that have had conflicts with President Trump\nWhen it comes to foreign policy your resume is unbelievable and so diverse and some people who have been in the establishment for a while have trouble seeing any benefit to a Donald Trump's doing one of which was Colin Powell I Want to get your take on what he said the free to carry yesterday cut forty one\nDo you think this president can be a moral leader for the world I don't know that they can do that because right now that is not the way he is acting let me give an example my favorite three words and our constitution is the first three words waves of people way the people but recently it's become\nMe the president as opposed to the people and you're saying things that should not be happening\nI'm sure you talked to a lot of people in Washington circles they feel the same way who's right\n[noise] you know I was a skeptic of President Trump a but over time I've been persuaded that um he's doing a good job and a better in my view then President Obama did us so we certainly unconventional his styles unusual a button area after area he's been\nGetting results so if you look in Europe he's pushing back against Russian aggression there you know despite the pro Russian rhetoric that people point to he's been arming the Ukrainians strengthening missile defense or you look in the middle east he defeated ISIS he's\nPutting pressure back on Iran and then looking at Asia and he's willing to stand up to China um he's making progress on on North Korea so uh it's not perfect no administration is perfect but I think he's doing a much better job than many people expected in a much better job than he's getting credit for\nWell put a Matt thanks so much a best of luck today my

Democrats Republicans verse Democrats or the Democrats have today burst what they used to be and make them think about what they're doing as compared to what they used to do Marcos on W. H. I. O. and dating mark real quick\nA and getting women drunk and taking advantage of them and nothing held up Jonathan Turley used to have a student in my lab and I joined us right now welcome Jonathan\nHi how's it going\nA good idea how do you feel about which Democrat Senator Chris Coons just said\nWell you know what's interesting is I I didn't find the allegation particularly critical but uh I did find it strange disconnect you know the Democrats came out and said that the accuser always\nOr should be believe and I I thought it was interesting that when ... got to the uh concluding line he said well the Republicans didn't believe her eyes so it's just strange politics of\nSexual harassment and the me too movement for damage or cause was clearly signaling that he didn't believe these allegations otherwise he would have been objecting to the treatment but he prefers to say the Republicans didn't believe her a so there's there's this weird environment where we're living in instead of just saying look\nSexual rafters have a right to be heard not to be believed that everyone has due process rights of fairness right but for some reason a lot of the Democratic ...\nIn fairness rights but for some reason a lot of the Democratic members can't get themselves to say that because they don't want to appear if they're anything but totally in favor of\nThe me too movement and I think that ultimately this hurt the me too movement a bit uh I think that it's clear that this final allegation did undermined the previous to allegation\nAnd in the big picture to win Susan Collins gave that comprehensive speech\nShe didn't say I'm voting because I'm a Democrat or I'm voting for and I'm a Republican I'm going to she used to let me just tell you what went into this let me tell you how I insisted on this let me tell you how I came to this decision and when you listen to the way she liberated it's hard to say while typical party politics I I just don't think you you could be angry that it didn't go your way\nBut as you see there when Kavanaugh was accused of something that happened Thirty years ago something might have happened Thirty years ago\nI'm not saying it didn't but when there's nobody they weren't rate the story how can we possibly held this man he's not worthy of this seat or it's okay to destroy his wife\n[laughter] well I I this is far I wrote a column recently in the hill that we finally reached this level of primordial politics you know we live where we engage in\nTotally on limited on the linking rage and ... you know politicians have unleashed this in the age of ... you know they we we now live in a time where people have been given a license to\nBe rage full hateful and not consider any elements of fairness her empathy and there's lots of people are waiting for that moment we saw that I didn't see that on both sides\nBut what's missing here is what you know it used to be said about statesman that the difference between a politician or statesman the politician thanks to the next election we're statesman thinks the next generation what we really found out in the Kavanaugh confirmations are very few states in the left in the Senate to bother you\nThat was me a lot you know I came to Washington as a page a fourteen year old page and\nWhen I was here giants walked those calls you know people like moynahan end and Humphrey and the Javits and\nOthers you know they were Republican and Democrat they were institutional is they believe deeply in the Senate\nYou know when I when I handled the impeachment church last impeachment trial or in the Senate there was last judicial peach mislead counsel I remember arguing I'm a part of the case and they took a break on the Senate floor and center in a way a came up to me and said\nHow so how do you feel that having these hundred senators as your jury unless you know I just can't get out of my mind when I was a page because in a way was there with a ... page\nAnd I said you know they used to be giants here you know and I'm and I'm arguing these these people they all seemed so damn small\n[noise] and in a way it got really sort of silent and he said I think about that a lot and the Senate changed and it hasn't changed for the better um and at some point or and a half to decide if the majority of the American people\nHave had enough of these people on both sides that seem to be trafficking in the politics of rage\nWell I'll give you an example I Susan Collins is as I have death threats and that people praising me and she does Sunday shows you back away from the decision did sixty minutes\nNow ah people say Murkowski you're done we're going to run against you how dare you vote against them if you want to show that it's a new day\n... and understand it to Europe it's on your best interests to tell mansion Murkowski Collins I respect your decision\nNow you're going to have to earn those Senate votes but don't alienate and vilify this'll be the first test not just from other senators but from politicians and people do not hate Murkowski for not agreeing with your decision or going with her party you harder to make her own decisions well representing your people\nAre and if not there's an election don't make her enemy number one\n[noise] try and I think that is just incredibly well said you know the I I actually wrote a column and Murkowski first came to the Senate that actually criticized her uh being appointed to the Senate or ... or ... because of the\nUh cause a concern and a half or ... you know that her father was a senator and I never liked that it never like these family yeah I just found a lineage but I have to admit I and I do so gladly\nShe's one of the most thoughtful senators are in Washington I you can disagree with their decision on Kavanaugh\nBut she's one of those senators that quite frankly thanks very deeply most of these people I got to tell you are just grade the actors you know there I you know is is the form and is it is yeah the worst performance is when they tried to convince us they actually care of this stuff\nBut they're few and I think we're ...\nThey actually care of this stuff but they're few and I think we're ... does care I really do\nAnd the thing is you you you can't do it by the Democrat too crazy to alienate Joe Manchin scanning shame at him and ... and his party no he's representing West Virginia well being a Democrat and if you keep pushing him what is the endgame did he switched parties\nAnd what does he engaged with Susan Collins said she never ever deliberate Republican or not what do you want to say okay we couldn't convince her this time maybe next time\nI think that's right and we're going to see another face of this tomorrow perhaps we're gonna see protesters tried interrupt the Supreme Court proceedings that would be a new low uh you know ... they sent the the Supreme Court chambers has always been\nA place of considerable reverence they're much more strict in terms of\nDecorum in that chamber room [noise] all of the justices believe strongly in that and we're going to see if this is rage full environment that we live and will penetrate the chamber itself and there'll be a new low if if protesters or interrupt those proceedings\nAnd we heard them interrupt the vote over and over again and the vice president demanding order listening to if we if it does translate to radio I Hope it does these are the protests are swarming the door at the Supreme Court cut thirty\nHer home either tapping into\nAction pro fronting senator has a\nWhole building the Hart building in a restaurant or home all of that\nAnger on the part of the protesters\nTo I mean that was it was crazy scene where the vice president walked out he was back then he walked out again on the Supreme Court steps they which this crowd chanting angry things had him so you're you've never you've never seen this before right\nI have and and we were we've lost any sense of\nControl or decorum I've seen it with friends of mine you know I come from Chicago from a very liberal family and die the rage is overwhelming but what concerns me is I just got back from Chicago and I said this to\nSome of my friends and family that they're enjoying it too much\nThat they they're enjoying the rage too much there's a sense it suddenly it's okay to say hateful things one person said I really hope that Mitch McConnell died that someone kills him or he dies of cancer ... do you do it if I played that statement back to you\nDo you think that you will be ashamed in and she said no they said that's the point there was a day when we still have the capacity for a shame that that is a shameful thing to say but we've lost that capacity\nWell I mean look at what just happened to me or as I'm walking while he was a train so I mean that and I actually\nI think that's a great example Brian what happened to you what's an outrage that sets it there are people that would not only do that but then posted and people would congratulate them this nice are really horrible people you know there are\nSuch things as they are yeah the the people that followed you like that are horrible people and they seem to have found their audience\nAnd they have a and I'll give me an exam so people say well Mitch McConnell you started this when you did not vote with nine months left in President Obama's term at the tragic death of Vince of Justice Scalia and this is what you said when you didn't even ... meet with Merrick Garland here's his answer cut their team set at our

to be taking your calls and giving you the latest says we see the president just spoke to the press will bring you some of that we see he's got to be speaking to the national\nPolice chiefs in Orlando we'll give you some of that and we also go to see the speaker of the house the outgoing speaker of the house Paul Ryan give his state of what the policies in what the programs and what the things I've actually done since he's been in charge you'll be talking about that\nAnd we'll bring you the latest there were also see in the aftermath of what happened over the weekend the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh and I'm\nAlso let me remind you to that we have a brand new affiliates starting today Kay H W ELL Ninety eight seven and lone wolf Oklahoma where our prisons Oklahoma continues to expand and we thank all the listeners for being there ah let's get to the big three\nNow with the stories you need to Brian's big three numbers sorry\nMy advice is downplaying Traub help us don't hurt us help us because there's gotta be parity fares got to be a level playing field there's gotta be reciprocity China regrettably is not playing by the rules\nYou're exactly right and unfortunately we've seen this too many times that the left will will\nBasically did invite someone from their own definition of whatever it is they're talking about if they don't agree with you you saw how the left ... lost their mind when Kanye West said something nice about the president you see them calling Susan Collins a fake feminist\nWe we've got to get me on to these kinds of labels and\nIt it just doesn't do our democracy any good\nAbout Mike Pence the vice for the United states a cold out China\nAnd I want you to hear a little of that speech because it didn't get as much play but it did you did it did we hit a home in China because they say a lot of this talk happens behind closed doors but no longer at least a longer with this administration listen\nChina's building unparalleled surveillance state and it's growing more expensive and intrusive\nOften with the help of us technology the United states wants Beijing to pursue trade policies that are free fair and reciprocal our message to China's rulers is this [noise] this president\nWill not back down\nHe's saying I mean it's a prison one of the first guess he had over at mar a Lago was the Chinese leader you say we're going to be able to work this out but now with all by literally turned up the heat and he said you know maybe my friendships in danger\nYou were there in the beginning what happened how did what was supposed to be an initial show of trust and disrespect to President Obama no one denies that why why did the wheels come off\nPresident Obama no one denies that why why did the wheels come\nOff I think it's multi faceted one we have our trade issues which most people tend to focus on but also going on behind the scenes and doesn't get a lot of coverage\nIs the pervasive activities that they are also doing in other parts of the reason region with whether it's militarily whether it is trying to influence our political elections in the midterms\nIn including some of their activities in in other parts of the world where they're offering basically loans to cash strapped\nAh countries that are barely trying to stay afloat and then when they can't repay them they're taking over key facilities such as ports and things like that in order to build a base of influence that's going to expand across the across the Pacific and\nWe've got to confront all of these things all at the same time we'll get the trade issues worked out China has to work it out we are the largest economy in the world where their largest customer\nBut we also have to deal with these other issues and that's why the president the vice president's speech was so strong on that because make no mistake those were the words of President Trump and the policy of President Trump that the vice president was was espousing last week\nThey mark now that you're on the outside what\nA ... and we can look at the administration away communications is done in policies is implemented what do you what could you tell them that you feel comfortable telling my audience now about what has to change\n[noise] well I think it's difficult because I still work on the on the twenty twenty reelection committee so I'm Still very well kept closely connected with with the administration and I'm I'm always one to uh to to save my advice for private council a\nI think the folks that are working and they're doing such a great job and they're working very hard at getting the president's policies are enacted or promoted\nBut I think the one thing we have to do and what we have to make sure we do and this is true for all Republicans whether you're in the ... the house the Senate the White House\nWe've got to make sure that we relate our policies to real people they don't pay attention like we do in Washington DC and New York to every occurrence that comes out of of politics\nThey're busy living their lives we've got to make sure that we connect with people and I think that sometimes where there is a disconnect as we talk about unemployment rates in GDP Growth yeah great things\nBut make it related to people at home which means\nThere's a better chance your wages are going up your paycheck going up or because of the low unemployment rate\nThere's never been a better time for you to either go get a new job or having your employer have to pay you more to keep you in your current job these are all real world good things that we've got to get out we have to make sure we communicate with people\nHow they think not how we view it through government statistics and reports yeah there's a reason why most people don't like economics class ring but Israel mark Latta thanks so much thanks Bryan alright\nOne eight six six eight seven six six nine at the bottom are we bringing the great Bret Baer but next as you

B. radio dot com and register your chance to read this week's loyal listener and apparently Becca tickets to Atlanta Gladiators opening weekend October nine keep doing that and put it in the ... season I'm Single game tickets are on sale male and Atlanta Gladiators that gum\n\nThink this president can be more when we do for the war I don't know that\nThey can do that because right now that is not the way he is acting only giving example my favorite three words and our constitution is the first three words we the people we the people but recently it's become\nMe the president as opposed to the people and you're seeing things that should not be happening\nSell as secretary of state a Republican by name only a who worked for Reagan and Bush\nAnd Bush a totally a poor or just to upset the fact that Donald Trump president and the new way as doing things I guess who else wants to call the task Thomas was K. S. A. L. in Kansas hey Thomas\nHello and burned kilometer shorter show very much better joined us are very much this today\nOh I appreciate your support your station has been fantastic for us what do you think about ... is he right\n[noise] no the way it is the way I see it is a\nWay that people are as it is constitutional they voted a downer of a slave for Donald Trump so far we the people are satisfied I can say that because he's doing exactly what I voted for for a he's been a Bush did in Iraq and people therefore has the way that people\nFor eight years under Obama it's been the the dictator and none of us had a horse so he's wrong as far as I'm concerned also true for justice\nCavanaugh I Am absolutely floored as happy to know that the fibers ball of fire snakes mating ball or snakes called the Democrat Party not all up just those ones that are being so evil or their teeth knocked down their throats\nMany times seven CIA investigate that they didn't know what that is\nSo he's he's not running you know see he knows politically is to his advantage was instincts tell him to bring up what will happen if we lose the house what happens if he loses Senate interesting tactic right\n[noise] yeah I mean listen he sees a an upside you know answering the question like\nLike he did he sees that especially with Republicans who are going to turn out in the mid term election or the fact that he delivered on Brett Kavanaugh and he got it across the finish line and and the senators did\nA is a is a big win for him and you know you wouldn't know that if you looked at the week of coverage of it but once it happened a it was a\nPromise delivered and it was one in which ah especially evangelicals and conservatives are conservatives all over the country were really pushing for\nIt's just so interesting Brett because yesterday last week while you're away maybe it was a coincidence but I think there's a lot to do with you being away they cut a new NAFTA deal because you were standing on everybody knows that kind of knew that the deal they could they got together and opioids\nThe president has ramped up his rhetoric against China which even unites them with Democrats on that initiative and with a lot of the EU\nSo now we're getting closer to a bilateral with Japan and you have a a Trump like wheat or emerging Brazil so there's a lot of people who are saying wait a second\nThere's a lot of dominoes falling in the president's direction right now what it on the economic numbers would even through a hurricane or the unemployment dropped now the three point seven percent and they don't ... yeah and the fed raises interest rates because he feels the economy is healthy\nAnd the fed raises interest rates because he feels the economy is healthy for the long term kinda hurts the economy a little bit it hasn't stopped Colin Powell for a for ... for taking a look at what the president has created I Want to hear what he said they're free to carry a cut thirty nine\nAnd so America has to take a hard look at itself and especially the Congress take a hard look at yourself and see what we are doing to try to keep things these forces in check and put America back in the middle of all this as opposed to being sort of a reluctant player and trying to pull out of agreements rather than helping to make new agreements\nAnd you know he went on to say they were hurting alliances were insulting allies maybe if you look at it on the surface but what he does he pushes back he says he wants to or we can figure but he doesn't alienate but I think his unorthodox approach is just never going to resonate\nPolitical success or failure with people like Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright and maybe the George ... of the world who used to doing things a certain way\n[noise] I think you're right and it's definitely not a traditional way for diplomacy or dealing with trade deals but over time um\nSome of these deals are he's big ones have come across and have you know I mean the the Mexico Canada thing was huge\nUm the south Korea deal on the precipice of Japan or who knows what you is going to deliver that promise but it's you know if there's a new you deal\nI'm not saying that they are all to the benefit of the U.S if their reach structuring deals based on his problems with how they were structured but for the devil's in the details but uh I think a lot more people are looking at it and saying it's an orthodox but might be working\nAnd yeah I mean this is what I what I find is so interesting is that\nBecause he's Donald Trump they don't even give it they don't even attempt to give them the benefit of the doubt and I was one of the people read the Woodward book and I'm reading this and he's sitting down with generals and he's telling the generals including that is hey guys\nYou would do this to Seventeen years why making me sick more money into this tell me about a plan that works come on army tell me to tell me you got to plan is going to work\nSo it's characterized as the president doesn't respect his generals what it is is the c._e._o. going up to his brother his division presidents and saying produce more it's Steinbrenner looking at his hundred million dollar Yankees in saying winning by three games is not enough or trailing by three is not enough he\nWants to get more but not everyone says well how can you be so disrespectful of the military but\nThey people aren't even open to we might some of this unorthodox way of doing things in politics might be necessary does that surprise you\nKnow listen I'm ... people and we traveled last election twenty sixteen\nBounced around the country people or most that we heard the most from or people that were sick of both parties\nThey said Washington doesn't work it's trying to kick the table over and try something different well this is something different the operates in different realm she uses Twitter says things that don't you know it's not comfortable but\nThere is stuff that is happening we cover the iceberg that's on top of the water and the controversy ... day but there is a huge iceberg up changes happening in Washington and different agencies including the Pentagon um that often don't get covered\nYeah it is the you know now he seems to have more of his people around him that might say oh instead of judging him works with him instead of saying why is he\nWise you know fly off the handle wise you wanna do five things at once they go to that I Know that guy that's what he always wants to do this is what you do is they handle it you don't run to the Washington Post and say invoked the twenty Fifth Amendment I even sense that it's to the ways we spend the whole thing with a\nRosenstein is working he let 'em out let him calmed down and let the story die a little bit and then they're going to go talk Rosen someone to talk right away that's kinda the way it works in business in our business especially\nYou know you're not getting the stories you want you're not getting that your your case right 'cause you get all the stories you when you're not you're not be able to talk about this Sosa this so maybe a maybe a news director is a little upset you know knows you a little upset gives you a week or two to cool out then you bring him in office on your to an his time or time and then you talk it through like we're used to this world but in politics\nThey handle it just totally differently and and the president's not bending he doesn't care if it upsets people\n... clear clear\nHe does not care if he upsets people and um and we'll see we'll see how the country reacts or the next you know barometer that we can really measure is November sex and it'll be fascinating to see if if what Democrats are predicting um holds true or\nThat's at predicting um holds true or if he's numbers really don't line up to the sentiment of how people are looking at their own personal economy and the state of the nation\nI'm going to give you a good question for tonight or tomorrow that I think is really gonna work out for your panel I'm In Florida right now in Jacksonville and a rich Jones who does the mornings here is news director said look out this hurricane is real it's going to hit Thursday or friday\nAnd guess when a hurricane hits Florida who's pressured the governor guess who's pressure the mayor you got to Enron just had this is there you might actually have\nThe verdict on the Senate and governor's race by how they react to a hurricane\nAnd because a lot of the campaign it was the other side yeah and I think that keep very forward is going to again be decisive for the Senate in congressional races and certainly the governor's race a hurricane might actually be composing music so there'll be afraid to use that and your panel\n[laughter] you have to search you\nI Would prefer it yes which is can you put it in Cairo and I will be ... into the right to kill me radio show that this right\nPut in my ... don't
