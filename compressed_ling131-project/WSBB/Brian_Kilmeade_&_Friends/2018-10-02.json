S. but this is not just to tweak and you know frankly if this exact same deal\nHad been put forward by Obama or the left would be supporting it and say this is meaningful so it is meeting\nOdyssey blowback yet him throughout Ron Wyden said we needed to do this I Need to see the details it will sunset and sixteen years are going to look at it every six years we just for auto workers as I mentioned will rise a so that'll be good or the steel and aluminum tariffs day I thought wait a second\nGood uh but steel and aluminum tariffs day they are and I thought wait a second why because I thought they were just like a hedge pushes towards negotiating these these trade\nDeals they were and um they lost the trust of Trump has backed off of the automotive tariffs that he was up ... planning to put in against Canada and he had used that as a stack up but they decided to keep steel and that's a little surprising because the Canadians took such direct offense and Trudeau himself\nOr when the United states Lebanese those taps to begin with it's clear that the U.S is looking for um some more leverage with the Canadians going forward the fact that it wasn't seen as a give with this deal was a little surprising well okay we'll see what the president says eleven but he's not going to be in the way government works we'd have a new government\nFor the ratification for correct yes and now another reason to a more intrigued built into the midterms it's a new U.S government it's going to be a new Mexican Government that has to ratify as well when that President Lopez Obrador er and er and he is a new Congress actually comes and\nSays a lot of change happening also Canada won't have a new government there but they're going to be election season 'cause Trudeau has to come up again\nIn twenty Nineteen so you know this is not it's this is absolutely progress the markets are very pleased that they don't have to worry about after falling apart but we don't have a new NAFTA yet\nBut here's the thing in and you know it it matters so much that the president at eleven doesn't uh say we won because as you mentioned the two governments guys sell to their people if they feel like they're losers in the deal that will only make things harder to ratify\nYeah I mean one little thing I don't like the new name I mean aside from the fact that you can't say a some ... very early but also didn't ... the fact that it's not North America that it's now the United states first and then Mexico who was second to the deal and then Canada\nDefinitely see I ever saw a little bit of symbolism Trump understands that her brand stuff I or\nBy the way even though you you only took over so if you're still paying it bothers me a Donald Trump said this let's talk North Korea about in his speech over the weekend got thirty six\nHours really being tough and so I went back and forth [noise] and then we fell in love [noise]\n[noise] we fell in\n[noise] what's your reaction to that he didn't have any new studies diplomacy was meant to be funny\nUm the people that are left it was a rally um he does a lot of stuff that isn't real and rallies um I I Do think on\nThe one hand it's very clear that I'm a leader a dictator who has the worst human rights abuses record of any in the world and that's a low bar [noise]\nUm you don't want to say things like that it's not presidential on the other hand you can't say Trump doesn't care about human rights at all because with leaders that he has a real problem with like in Venezuela or in Iran he has used their human rights abuses to wacko right it's very it's very opportunistic and transactional\nA it was a it was an unfortunate statement I'm In the sense that it's obviously meant to just beat the opposition and they got right onto it and you know sort of a took it took that bait\n'em but I I think in a in a couple of days we won't be talking about the U.S Japan South Korea how do they view Trump's initiatives with North Korea first of all the Japanese right now we're very happy with what has been the best bilateral meeting they've had with Trump\nSince he won the presidency and they came over immediately with that gift of the golf club um they've agreed to engage in bilateral trade negotiations but not formally to talk about an F. T. A. a free trade agreement\nAnd Trump has said no on the automotive tariffs so the Japanese feel good at home right now I'm ... the prime minister as one another term running his liberal Democratic Party they're not super comfortable with the United states running ahead with diplomacy with North Korea\nI Need even more time and I just real quick on the reef and the EU cutting a deal and cutting the U.S out you're feeling where this is having the right to avoid the dollar\nThe Iranian foreign minister they've talked this morning about the potential for getting oil out directly\nA number one I don't see any major European CEO that's going to say I'm going to risk access to the U.S market\nBecause I care about Iran the Europeans are very deeply angry with Trump for pulling out of this Iranian nuclear deal the Jaycee pure way that is a very different story from saying they're going to start doing business as usual with a Iranians again I think the Iranian economy will be very deep recession come next year but they're playing hardball with us when you say\nHe lost all credibility to me I thought he acted out of more his moral compass to made him stand up and thought he could heal everybody but listen to how what he said to Scott ... question\nFlake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running or not you're not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to Puerto ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there is no\nThere's no value to reaching across the aisles there is no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWhat is he talking about I thought he was just doing the right thing and yet he wasn't doing the right thing he's doing the right thing because it doesn't matter he's out there anyway so it means nothing\nWell not only that Brian I'm I think he's being dishonest\nThey're he wants to run for president he talked about that and and there is among many I think Republicans this idea that you can be a Republican in the anti Trump at the same time I mean the never Trump voters will love Jeff Flake and I think that's so this is this is a\nPolitical move disguised as a moral move now politics can sometimes be moral but let's see I I think flake as being dishonest when he denies any political that this is an anti political move this is not anti political for him it's very personal and very political\nUh it just it's unbelievable so here we are we have an investigation going on and the FBI has five let's say five days to get it done so they're going to talk to Deborah Ramirez they're going to talk to a his best friend mark judge from childhood they're going to talk to 'em or the other guy Patrick Smith\nAnd that's as far as we know we don't know where he's going to go from there and they're going to talk to judge you about ... and what she said about the third accuser and what she said about huge parties that are basically a group sex parties where they do\nUh I don't know what they would they are doing their I guess it's a some illegal acts so that's not good enough for Democrats of course they want more they say that's not we want to know the scope of the investigation because you know seven days is not going to be enough cuts for\nEven ten days that's bad enough but then to limit the FBI as to the scope and there's no question that that really [laughter] I live in these away far and that kind of the nation and all of my arm expecting them to come back\n[noise] so now the seven days not good enough not the investigation they want to see done they would like to go I don't know have one go months\nWell look Brian ... and I think that gets to the heart of what we're discussing that this was not done in good faith by the Democrats they bought a week old but NATO now campaigning to a week is not enough I mean I think at this thing the thing was done\nMore than two weeks ago and then they extended it with a whole for trickery now they extended it again another week thanks to flake because of a very narrow majority and now oh that's not enough so the aim is to deny a vote\nThe aim is to hold this off until the election then run on it run on the election as though that Supreme Court she uh is is the basis for\nThe rallying cry the Democrats in in the\nCongressional races and then the Democrats want to fill that seat themself Chuck Schumer would be majority leader if they take the Senate and ah and then they would deny President Trump any\nPick at all presumably he's being investigated we can't generalize him by giving him another Supreme Court seat so this is all part of a long game strategy of the Democrats to not give this\nSupreme Court pick to a Republican president because it could it with a fifth\nConservative on their reliably consistently conservative voice that would strengthen\nOr the conservative wing of the court make it very difficult for even the liberal Democratic president or a liberal Congress to pass the big government programs so that's what this is about and so it's not surprising\nAt all that one week is suddenly not nearly enough well within three weeks no\nNot enough it's got to go to November that's the ultimate goal\nWell the thing is uh I think that how many CEOs would we have how many people in prominent position where we have if we had to open up their high school yearbook talked all their high school friends and their college friends and then exam and if they acted like CEOs when they were Seventeen Nineteen\nI mean do we wouldn't have any everyone at Wall Street you'd walk out you know what everyone in the news room across the country should walk at all these anchors she's turning their blazers because believe me they were not but they will not pristine college kids\nOr the sexual assault I get it is serious but I also get this Rachel Mitchell the extremely average questionnaire prosecuted from Arizona seemed like a wonderful person but never got to the point where adjusted to a five minute increments says after all this study and she did\nDo you put out a five page memo and it was obtained by the Washington Post and she said the accused the person who accused cabs sort of a salt saltier at our house in southern Maine\nUse cabs whoever saw a soul singer at our house in southern Maine she would never been able to prosecute\nDue to many holes in her story to missing key pieces of evidence this is a memo never expected to get out including notes from the sessions with a therapist we couldn't get we don't know how she got to the house\nCouldn't get that don't know how she got home from the house I don't know who invited her to the house I don't know where the house was I don't know how she knows it's Kavanaugh and the people that you listed that were there all say it never happened and they don't even remember her\nTo the conclusion the prosecutor joined a private meeting with Senate Republicans on Thursday after the hearing where she told the senators after eight hours of testimony that she heard and study she would not have prosecuted the Kavanaugh Kavanaugh for assault and was even close\nSo I mean does any of this matter\nWell Brian look I I think I think it raises a good point in terms of\nThe conduct of others but if we're going to do all that and and come and dirty up Kavanaugh then I think we're entitled to a response to about those who are doing the dirty up what about Blumenthal notorious wire\nWhat about Cory Booker notorious fabulous makes up stories all the time uh Dianne Feinstein with our Chinese spy on there and her office for Twenty years\nI mean on and on and on who are these people who dare to to condemn Brett\nKavanaugh for something he did in high school on which there is no evidence and so now they've changed it from sexual assault now it's drinking so it's it's always about dirty and him up right and and I think that the problem with\nThe flakes of the world is that they don't have confidence in anything\nRight it's never going to be enough at some point you've got to decide at some point I mean who is the purists person you're looking for who's the super St who's good enough to pass the judgment of of flake and the Democrats\nNo such person they exist this is the real world Brett Kavanaugh has been a ... per judges per person for his entire adult life if he committed a crime that's one thing\nBut the search for anything that makes him look bad I mean this is a real travesty and this is what the Democrats are doing simply it's politics and I think people like flake who want to make it about something else or living in a fantasy world or I think\nIn his case is just doing it for himself I think this is the ultimate selfish act of Jeff Flake\n... oh yeah I mean now we know is not even a pure rack he's not saying I I have to get here to my inner a minor set of values no it's a oh yeah well I'm Out of politics I can do whatever I Want\nAll the uh before I let you go I just got to get your way into something else that President Trump promised to do and has done not many people looked at the south Korean trade deal and said that made news but it did matter but\nNot many people look at the fact that the EU as a form as a framework for a new trade deal with America put that no one really paid attention and now we finally read did NAFTA here's Peter Navarro today we're on Fox and friends with me cut thirty for\nThe biggest deal in history no hyperbole at one point two trillion dollars in trade a great day for America great day for North America and Brian my uh my favorite part of the deal is the fact is going to turn a this hemisphere back into a manufacturing powerhouse\nSo deal done we're going to get the official a detailed shortly but the president's going to announce it in about an hour in ten minutes what's your reaction\nIt Brian ... it it's been the case the president's approach doesn't it that that he said these deals are no good\nAnd we're going to change them now you know lots of people have said the deals are no good and they kept sort of gently knocking on the door of Canada or Mexico or they eat you China oh search pleased would you change that they'll know okay thank you very much I mean Trump said look we're going to tear the deals up\nAnd everybody acknowledges NAFTA has changed in the ... the world is you know you know Internet five years that\nThe same way I look at it this is how Trump negotiate it is working it is working for the benefit of the United states but of course the Trump haters one that's sort of take the opening shot and say oh my God you've broken the China well yeah\nMight've horse was years ago but I still feel a

the Republicans are now motivated because they see their probing into as bringing court justices\nHow would you feel run high scores and FBI investigator going with ... with his suggestion\n[laughter] well look I I I think we they ought to examine credible allegations and they ought to be putting some thought into allegations that seem like they're not credible maybe they point to flaws in the process we you know part of the FBI's role is to look at\nIt evidence of bias evidence that suggests the person is making it up from whole cloth a ... again it goes to how long do we want this process to to continue how expansive should it be\nHow do I characterize entered and try to process a personal bias that oh yeah it turns out that guy broke up with me or he said something that I didn't like in Nineteen Seventy two\nIs that should that be part of the consideration or should it not be again by the you know the FBI's role here is fact finding they will challenge people if they have something to challenge the Mondale tester recollection\nIf they have something to challenge that Mondale tester recollections\nBut at the end of the day we could end up with you know a credibility\nA back and forth a exchange about somebody's credibility I and the overall nature and and and uh people's taking different people taking different views about somebody's reputation in their character that may be completely unfair and\nFrankly as as as we've seen this play out\nMost of most of the senators I think on this panel have have long ago made up their minds one way or the other that raises

can certainly go interview cooperative witnesses very quickly\nHave it grew to reduce the paper and have a lot of that information in the White House his hands and and the ... the Senate committees hands you know it within the next two days they could do that then the question is does that expand the dire they asked\nNot because they should or should not but because of political pressures and

do see it and make or when I look at CNN hour after hour after hour icy panels rather than reporting exchanging opinions the overwhelming majority of which on this network I regard as quite critical or hospital for Trump now that may be justified\nIt made me that these folks have concluded on the basis of how Trump is behaved and the Republicans that they deserve this kind of push for CNN in effect or most of its people have taken a stand up and this president\nAnd about this nomination\nJeff Greenfield being critical to Bryan shelter about what we saw I I laugh out loud and to me I cannot believe that as Janelle if they actually want it to get a bigger audience they would\nTalk about ten people on panels all hating Trump in different ways all acting emotionally when if you will get Fox on the worst our boy in the most part is that you can find we always have a balance it\nOut and there's not the hatred the hatred that they get pointed out by Jeff Greenfield he's been on a show before right\nHe we let you we got permission to interview him when he was still a CNN because he had a book out and he seems to be fair and an analysis critic doesn't mean he doesn't have Trump or it might might love Trump but the fact is he felt an obligation to give them a fair shot what I've loved about this last few weeks\nWith Kavanaugh Trump is almost out of it\nAnd I think he got to be reflective and say it's kinda good to be the either storm overall Kavanaugh's candidacy and the controversy\nIs going to help Republicans if he gets through they'll say my goodness they fought and now we have to fight for them if he doesn't\nMy goodness we have to make sure we get another shot and get the Senate held for them for Democrats they already motivated I think overall America benefits we might have get get over sixty percent of the people for a mid term to actually vote Zacharias online and Arizona Zacharias\nBrian Brian thanks for taking my call listen I Want to say that if Kavanaugh gets tossed overboard as a result of Jeff Flake actually up\nI Believe that Jeff Flake is potentially potentially giving his Senate seat to cure the cinema remember Jeff Flake is not running for his seat yucky and because he was calling about Seventeen Eighteen percent so heads Marshall mix Sally Republican is running I can tell you\nThey cabinet was involved in really when you she was an art she witnessed it oh she's two years older but still go to high school parties noticing Brett Kavanaugh because he could be a future Supreme Court justice will listen to a news Ninety six five and a land do he will\nSay well you're in Atlanta\nAh yes I think it's ever tell you where you're colder I'm I'm a I'm a longtime listener of ... all the way back when hurricane first started and uh the cabinet they used to travel to the countries are more respect\nAnd well if they get away with any person that that will you know like better led to stab her life has been a justice and and things of that nature and\nThey they're trying to destroy them if they get away with this you know what else will be next you know they they knew they waste it\nDrove what two years of an investigation if there's no they're they're rush rush Russia and look at the progressive president has made if people don't realize and understand this is a slap in the race\nPeople don't realize and understand this is a slap in the race into the face of the American voter is here we have been elected is or none of this would have come to light\nIs who is in a couple of things will\nAnd you know America First Republican or Democrat do you know that the president amped up his attack on ISIS in a way that's not going to be public maybe for ten years he basically took the gloves off and let our special ops go to work led by the the courage on the ground and what other things we did in terms of intelligence to get Iraq back\nAnd to battle I'm Out of Syria\nYou know the president's adjusted now left our troops he says when the stay in Syria as long as Iran and Syria\nAnd Afghanistan rules of engagement were still up in the air seven hundred billion more dollars into the defense department to build us up to where we were\nThe growth rate is a four point two percent he's got re done a deal with South Korea he's just re done NAFTA he's got a new framework for the European Union he has gotten rid of around necessary regulation there was a logging everybody down\nEven Jamie diamond a Democrat who was thinking about running for president says he give the president and a minus so far and what he's done for the economy so around the world he's telling NATO you got to pay more he's actually done everything that he said\nExcept for the wall built and Mexico pay for Mexico is not going to pay for it yet there might be fees to come up there but he's not able to pull it off a Republican said that stood by him on that because they're the party split\nBut we'll here we are trying to move forward with a nominee that happens to be conservative that's what he's guilty of\nYou cannot tell me the doctor for to count is enough to destroy the life of will in Orlando or Brian in New York all my other callers\nYou can't come out with the allegation don't say how you got there how you went home who invited you\nBrett Kavanaugh is never met you his best friends says it never happened your best friend since you don't recall your therapist who let the notes out and you never mention his name to the therapist you mentioned it to people your beach friends\nWho told you to go to a congresswoman who went to a senator who ended up having a staff or somebody else leak your name out and now next thing you know you're supposed to destroy somebody who's been thirty five years in the public eye and as an impeccable records\nOr it is a scenario I don't think anybody's life can withstand John also\nA news Ninety six father land oh John\n[noise] hey Brian thanks for taking my call 'em you're saying all the right thing and you know I'm after hearing the or listening to um the hearings on on Thursday um I agree I I I agree\nWith and I appreciate what um [noise] uh the senator a gram\nHad to say and I think it's clear to the American people or what the full intent of the Democrats are I think a ... somebody could have 'em because they were always questioning or wondering why not to let you have this delay a and\nThey some ... a Senator Grassley or someone could vacuum little how long of a delay we know what they would have responded and the fact they probably wouldn't have responded to that question because we know their fall into\nA job that when they already know how they're voting there's this whole issue right we already know\nThat I Know but we can but how many people were were watching those savings\nI think it came out to millions and millions of people watching that proceedings and so this by asking that question would have put the Democrats\nAre in a position that they didn't want to be put in that would have been may make clear to all the viewers what their full intent was because they they weren't going to come come out with a date or how long and in fact if they did it would have probably been like eight weeks and weeks three months from now after the election\nAnd teach and then John I Know what you're saying and it's not a bad thought but you know the way there is playing out if we all want the same goal and that's the truth your scenario works but their goal is to lay and we're seeing it what kind of investigation what's the scope of the investigation I Want to see it in writing\nReally now all of a sudden you have just as we thought a friend came out and says I Can't believe Brett Kavanaugh says he never drank too a blackout he used to drink\nA lot and to me he got really so you know he was belligerent when he was drunk what does that have to do with anything we're talking about as sexual assault or exposure in a situation where the accuser\nAdmitted Lee says she was so drunk she doesn't remember\nAnd it was thirty five years ago so do you see out of the accuser come somebody else who said why ... then he has a roommate\nFor mayor wow is roommate that sounds bad he used to drink a lot well it turns out it was a roommate he was stuck with the other three two we had no problem with that fourth won all three of them had a problem with so he's got a chance to stick in the cabinet oh let me see Yale doesn't endorse him well yeah had protest to keep him out of there\nOh doesn't endorse him well yeah I had protest to keep him out of there there are so ridiculous because he's a conservative they ride the protest to keep a Yale alum this off the Supreme Court\nThat's unsinkable but that's the mindset that is what you're dealing with you not dealing with a group of people that want to get to the bottom of it and Chris Coons is the biggest disappointment listen to a little of his interview with Jeff Flake a and a and Scott Kelly country\nHad exchanges with Senator Feinstein was quote shower with others that I thought one of her life [noise] um he was clearly the full entrant\nAggressive angry\nMade you wonder about is sort of building in my case yes what Senator Flake you identified with or do you want to sing partisan but ah but boy out for myself in that spot down to\nYour ... you're going to understand why he was angry and ah [noise] you know continued leeway there\nYeah and uh you know Chris Coons are basically and the company never even gave them a fair shot they never were open to voting for him and he was willing to put up with that but not when you start talking about his integrity you want to challenge his decisions roe v Wade and you might be a emotional about that go ahead\nIf he if he snapped a three hundred nine decision said he had to defend but when you go after and basically says he's not there was an editorial out today says he should not coach girls basketball think about that\nYou're not somebody who's gotten out of prison that wants a second shot you son was someone that finished newborn is class in in jail and it was an exemplary life on and off the court to go on and who should yeah literally on and off the court in sports and beyond\nAnd now has all of that thrown in the street by people who doesn't even know who basically hate Donald Trump\nRoswell see on K. R. M. G. in Tulsa, Oklahoma Ross\nGood morning sir thank you um I Would like shooting investigation of the FBI and the cat when all the oil you can learn a little ... tactics short spend the next week\nInvestigating Dr Ford and the coalition lift Feinstein and every other Democrat so the way I can turn up everything you can but don't just go on why after all all\nBut you know what Ross I don't want to do that and here's why because I'm totally back the White House decision we're not investigating drinking\nWere investigating allegations so if a kid is a freshman in college drank too much what does that have to do with anything even as something to do the incident that it's alleged okay but if some guy's going to come out and say you know I saw him really drunk and he was belligerent\nI don't want the FBI investigating that and if Dr Ford as an incident go ahead\n[noise] but if you want Dr Ford investigated then we got to get mark judge investigated then to be fair we got to get this other Peter ... a pat Smith investigated a because they were thrust into the limelight here\nI think we're way off course then and I think that this if you are the White House if you were Brett Kavanaugh FBI go to town on these incidents I Would not I I put it ... client can go jumping a lake I don't see any validity that\nYou've got to be kidding me she witness groups sex and spiking of punch the Kavanaugh was at parties ten of them\nAll or listening on serious for fifty Paula\n[laughter] hey there hum I appreciate your taking my call I have a couple of points here to make um number one I used to think that those in government always had the best interest of the country at heart\nAnd I used to think that if the Democrats got in President maybe for maybe ... years that's fine you know because a ... and nobody really wants to damage the country and everybody has the best interests and everybody has family and kids and grandkids are going to have to live what they

anytime\nYou're in your car and you got to keep moving the only but\nIs tripled the traffic exclusively on WSBIU\nThat's couch for to fend off [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm\nThrilled to speak to the American people to share truly historic news for our nation and indeed for the world to one of the bank\nVice president Pence for joining us this morning my great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA\nAndy NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement called us embassy a sort of just work and [noise]\nAnd with that the president is fulfilled like you said a campaign promise we'll get the details Ron Wyden among the Democrats who said we need to redo this among the people who have benefited farmers Tom Bevan here from real clear politics dot com Tom how big a deal is is [noise] well\nI mean again this is a it's a promise kept for Trump it's delivering he's talking to his base or you know right onto the stump absolutely and and look the one thing that Republicans are here's the problem for Republicans the economy's great\nRight it's better than it's been in the mid term since Nineteen Ninety eight we haven't seen this kind of an economy sixty nine percent of people say they're very or somewhat satisfied with where things stand\nUm the problem is is that voters don't vote out of gratitude they voted out of anger and frustration right and fear and so you've seen Republicans change their messaging from Haiti economies grateful for us to\nThe economy is great but if you vote for Democrats it all goes away right and they're trying to really instill that you're on the base to get them out to vote because um it's it's\nThe economy is fantastic but Republicans are realizing the benefits of it I\nWould you explain to that time that's why when you say hey if you lose that\nHey hey if you lose the house the president got to be a nonstop or investigations that fear that's right if you lose the Senate you don't get another judge that fear that if you don't have a gender\nThat's right and the other problem with the economy too is when the economy's good voters tend to\nFeel comfortable and where they are and start to pay attention to other issues and so you've seen healthcare rise you've seen education rise in the mix um economy is still the number one issue but not as much as as a it has been necessarily in the past and that's because things are things are pretty good right\nNow here's congressman leader Kevin McCarthy cut dirty one\nWhat I'm finding is prior to the Kavanaugh hearings intensity level was really on the Democratic side that more Democrats were wanting to go vote than Republicans Republicans thought there was not an IED but in the last week there's been a fundamental shift that\nPeople are now becoming upset not just how justice Kavanaugh was treated but Dr Ford that the Democrats knowingly had this letter held it and then put her through this\nSo I Know that's what he wants is he right Tom [noise]\nWell that's that's the big question we were trying to figure out right we're trying to get some polling data in here to see what's going on Democrats have have clearly been there outrage meter has been eleven we've seen this gender gap it's been at or near historic highs right in the last four polls taken in September\nA took a reason average and and women were voting in the congressional about number for for Democrats by Eighteen points Republicans were voting for men were voting for Republicans by two points we got twenty point gender gap\nUm that could and probably will go higher and the question is how much more can can Democrats squeezed out among women and whether men actually respond and get angry and upset and and move toward Republicans I think we will have the highest gender gap that we've ever seen the selection of because of this because of this hearing\n'em you played a clip from John Heilemann earlier about if if cabinet goes down this'll benefit Trump and Republicans I completely disagree with that I think that's a hundred percent wrong I think if Kavanaugh goes down as nominations withdrawing gets torpedoed whatever\nThe Republican base is going to be so disgusted into spirited what happened they will stay home and there'll be a bloodbath\nHuge white I think there's a chance you might be wrong in that was repeal and replace you clearly could see the Republicans blew it they never had a plan ready to go in the skinny repeal is that even a play and it was empty who you're in the paper and they couldn't get their numbers together\nThey're going to look at this and say we got to give Trump some weapons we gave him three moderates he this is exactly what to do he took it from a list there was handed to him screened by the federal is screened by his own people screened six times by the FBI\nGuy you gave me fifty gave me fifty one you got to get you he would generally as an argument both repeal and replace Republicans all we're staying how do you feel about that theory\nI mean it's part look anything's possible I think anybody who's going to go with your theory that might attack\nBut anybody who who who tells you they they know what's going to happen five which now is lying I mean we could see and here's what's interesting about this and if you look at a real clear politics you look at our no top Senate map which allocate to the states based on where the polls are right now Democrats are picking up one seat of goes fifty fifty\nIs not spending money on Trump people it's telling us people you know don't don't mention Trump's name it's still in shock it still hasn't gotten over it really what we're waiting for is a Republican Party in Congress that will mirror Trump's appeal to ordinary Americans\nYeah and by the way he uses ordinary Americans here's the west cut that you have up there on auto workers and then they matter to him\nYou know they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars that new purchases of us made automobiles\nWants to prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker they will say they understand they voted for us in large numbers even though their leadership\nAlways goes Democrat [noise] a couple of them said to me I don't know how I can do it again many of them the leaders would back Democrats and would tell me you're going to get most of the votes\nFrom union workers\nAnd we got most of the votes from workers period [noise] but [noise] the American auto worker was very much behind what we were doing as one primary aspect it will transform North America back into a manufacturing powerhouse [noise]\nI Love that I totally yeah North America you know something more trade passes over the ambassador bridge between Windsor, Ontario in Detroit than our entire trade with Japan so you know the border is so porous as just one time delivery systems this is great for everybody\nYeah I'm very curious to see him in ... Trudeau remember the G six seven rather a they had that left the communique after president was irate let 'em have it but here's what he just said you know about your do you think he has the highest regards from you up for election to\n... yeah uh and uh you know look just and I think it's been a complete embarrassment for Canadian so I mean you want less well you know he had this totally embarrassing trip to India\nOh you know he had this totally embarrassing trip to India where he dressed up his entire family in Bollywood costumes and even the onion said this is totally ridiculous right and you know he's been posturing knows the moral conscience of the world and you know and the world has been saying enough already you know you know hey it straight here just Canada\nRight [laughter] well\nHe is very flexible you know he's very good a yoga and as he says he's endlessly handsome\n[laughter] I'm only kidding the um but\nSo the president's talking right now and he's got to be speaking about this but the other thing is with the cat in a situation the president has been remarkably restrained I Would I'm been I'm Amazed if you've seen this before when he had to pull it back together after the convention they will seem to be going off to reconstitute the burning Kelly in and bad and\nCan you bring us back to that moment and the discipline that got the campaign back on track\n... it was a moment where it looked like the whole world was against them I mean I'm I'm thinking about the the point a couple of weeks before the election where the the video surfaced and and everybody wanted 'em out I mean I was just you know it was sure guts and determination\nThat kept things together and that's been all but that's the guy I mean we liked him because he was tough I mean we looked at those other sixteen candidates and we thought you know nice people well bread you know great families but uh they can take on the Democrats\nRight and when the in the present wanted to do is to billionaire resonated with blue collar workers and that always wore ties to wear blue jeans shared housing or pretend to be somebody who wasn't\nYeah absolutely and you know something on the gap and we decided really early on we are not going after blue collar workers we are not going after private sector unions\nPublic sector a totally different that's beyond the da but you know regular people on the assembly plant these are our people had something else\nYou know I debated a bunch of left these about my book the Republican workers' party and and they just got furious right they said workers we own that word right I mean we're the workers' party and I said you know nice try but you know something that's ancient history or not the workers' party anymore you're the party of transgender bathrooms\nDo you believe that the president needs another four years to drill that through Republicans has because you don't feel like you're there yet\nThat we're not there yet uh I was hoping twenty Eighteen would do it we're not there yet I mean at this point people I Know tell me we are going to lose but you know as many as forty seats in the house\nOr in which case will have an impeachment Congress at that point you know the impeachment Congress will play on Trump's favor I mean if Americans like divided government we're talking Trump and twenty twenty I think we are talking trumpet twenty twenty whatever\nRight but yeah it's it's going to take a pro says\nIt's going to have to say and hopefully you have to understand too is that the president did they did and they have to Mitt Romney got hammered they did an autopsy yeah but you believe the autopsy in many ways was wrong\nThe autopsy was absolutely crazy it was like you know let's be nicer right uh and and you know let's let a lot more people cross the border from Mexico it was just\nYou know ... the Hispanic\nYeah it was just a a classic example of a party so down on ideas that they did they didn't all the way up so Trump said you know this is just totally wrong you know and the great thing was that report said we really need a mild mannered\nGuy yeah right [laughter] and then we got so ah you got into the Trump campaign now I um [noise]\nRead programs for judges and I send a list of possible judicial appointees when I heard they were looking for them and I offended the speech and you know what afterwards I found myself a you know two or three messages a day with Jared and Stephen Miller and read it in a bunch of speech is kind of was a it was it was fantastic\nAnd have you been in touch with the president since no I haven't I'm In touch with the members of the family also Jared next week though who\nHad a huge role evidently this trade\nYeah Jared was one of this was a tribe of Trump it was a triumph of Jared Jared it's been a very important member of the administration and he was a guy but this one together\nUm graduations I S H Buckley the public in workers' party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why was just what we needed they thought he was back at home with your calls you listen to the brain kill me ... and we'll bring you the latest says Robert Lighthizer
