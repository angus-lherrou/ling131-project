claim of dubious tax schemes really are they also reported that Trump received the equivalent today a four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his dad not one million as you can imagine the White House is fighting back\nAh we'll give you that retort\nHave read the Democrats have faith in five weeks all of them are in states where the polling shows that the Republicans strongly support the president they strongly support judge Kavanaugh and one of the number one reason they went to a vote and twenty six same by the Supreme Court\nAh and that's true and they're about to get another

weekdays nine to noon right here on W. S. B.\n[noise]\n\nFlashlights and there are times on luge this major story got the judge Kavanaugh\nMay have been accused of throwing some ice across our college bar\nIn the mid Nineteen eighties talk about a bombshell\n[noise] ah yeah and then we found out that he was a writing notes to people saying ah to his friend saying let's meet at the Maryland sure we're going to have a few beers or so that to a rat and we're talking all this stuff\nNineteen eighty Josh homes with us now former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell president founding partner of calvary yellow sea Josh you know Mitch McConnell well do you he says we're going to have a vote this week do you believe he will\nYeah I Do I Do Brian I'm you know they work through this process which has just been absolutely horrible and I think we should probably spend a vet at talking about a regrettable is how we got here in the first place but\nUh yeah McConnell has been working when you have fifty one members yeah fifty one different personalities people just react to different things and\nYou know last week we got to the point where three Republican senators expressing reservations about moving forward without a another FBI investigation that the seven now that Kavanaugh will have undergone\nA and so that's happening and I I I think if you're listening McConnell he expects that that'll come back today or tomorrow and apple time for senators to review it and cast a vote on friday\nNow a one on one you know the it's the same a cast of moderate Republicans usually or people anti Trump hers they'd give which what kind of a hard time can you tell me how he's going to go about dealing with Collins Murkowski and it's like\nWhen you listen to them right I mean it is it like I said it's a different stimulus for each senator and there are a large number of vast majority of Republican senators at this\nPoint to think that we are engaged and a left wing charade here that is how I Do too tempting\nYeah and and I mean I I agree with that but but I think you've got senators Collins Murkowski in like a colon\nSays downing amazing amount of due diligence on a cabinet all met with them for over an hour of viewed every one of his uh\nA decision as as a judge and has gone through everything and she wants to be absolutely sure that she's got a handle on everything\nThere now Murkowski in particular wanted this FBI investigation and so now that she's got that\nI said ... you know she she made it very clear in meetings after Senator Flake brokered is quote unquote deal that I needed the parameters that she would be comfortable with and she would move forward once the FBI or that's the issue came back and assuming it didn't reveal anything we didn't already know you know I assume that she is she's also going to be\nComfortable with at the end of the day when he also\nHave Brian ... it's not just the three Republicans you've got senators like Joe Manchin of West Virginia whose\nIndicated that he's open for business and you got senator Heidi Heitkamp who has an announce one way or another I doubt very highly that she would vote for any Republican Supreme Court nominee at this stage but but but perhaps in the least they haven't ruled it out as every other democratic senator has\nLike a good couple of things you know when health care went down I Know he was disappointed but this is personal for him what does the Supreme Court mean to him\nMeans a lot it means a lot you know going back very early stages in his career he had a heavy focused on the judiciary and then of course his career before he became majority leader was defined by the judicial\nCareer before he became majority leader was defined by a judicial fight that ultimately went to the Supreme Court and McConnell the SEC where he sued the federal government over the McCain Feingold campaign finance laws um and lost five four\nAnd you know if ever you want to have a sense for how important in a Supreme Court is you could lose five four at the Supreme Court and so you know he's dedicated the last Fifteen\nYears to making sure that they have the most conservative judiciary possible and of course that has gone through many iterations taking us through Merrick Garland and everything else to where we are today\nI Want you here with the president said that I don't think it's helpful to Mitch McConnell but you might know different cut to\nThirty six years this this uh\nI had one beer [noise] right I Am one\nYou think it was I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the time I don't remember how many years ago when I don't know\nSo and so it was really the first time he's been remarkably disciplined over the last two weeks but not last night doesn't matter\nIf it's not my favorite stuff for sure but but I also understand that frustration you know you look at a New York times every day and got a new report we know that Brett Kavanaugh frozen ice we know that he writes letters to his roommates caught on the ... of noxious drunks we've tried to assassinate his character\nAnd every English in every paper and English speaking language and yet nobody has done a simple property\nCheck on on Dr Ford or any of the people who have come forward and\nAccused Brett Kavanaugh's everything from from\nGang rape to being at a tawdry parties so I understand that frustration and I think highlighting some of those inconsistencies as an avid ... it's also part of the reasons why this process should never gotten here in the first place you know the kind of allegations that\nThey give it a gay behind closed doors and the Judiciary Committee often does to make sure that you protect not just the accused but the accuser hey you know and you know what\nI'm Wondering Josh or the one thing about Democrats in less than was the same boat for example you don't didn't invite for the Senate deal did the Iranian deal because it was a bad deal with the president said you don't have to worry about it I'm going to implement it anyway I mean President Obama\nWhat was the most part the Democrat stuck together and I wouldn't say they just no matter if they're a moderate liberals are mostly on the left they'll stick together Republicans never have that\nMitch McConnell's always do mccaskey in college a major issues there's always a problem with an anti Trump or whether it's been fast or in this case or a Jeff Flake and I remember during the Bush years with central Lugar sometimes and others who would take on President Bush of the things why is it hard for the Republicans tonight\n[laughter] well Democrats don't have moderate you know kind of like a\nFun little retrospect to hearken back to the days of ... of\nPresident Kennedy and others who had you know more of a moderate ideology but now you look at the Democratic party and Elizabeth Warren find yourself in the mainstream you know this is this is a party that derives its\nEnergy from abolish ice in a peach President Trump and some of the most radical ideas that you can come up with and in American government and so you know what the Republican Party I Love if everybody agreed on everything absolutely but I'm also Greg glad that they got a big enough tent where we can appeal\nTo the whole faith based on where they live\nYou know these people can be won over that's where it used to be a Leslie Josh of the United states might have been one of the most significant things they got just buried start really the president's fault and that is redoing NAFTA us MCA whatever it's called a ... but it's done and I just had I talked to a dairy farmer on television and hour ago or ...\nPraise this deal this is unbelievable this is a worker former delivery is if the president promised and delivered\nTotally incredible and it's the first time any president is even try right I mean we've heard\nFrom the Democratic party and particularly over the last Thirty years every campaign cycle is about how bad NAFTA is our shipping jobs overseas and tell President Trump braces that agenda and that every Democrat talks about how great NAFTA is and and the bottom line is the first president is actually a rolled up his sleeves and went to work I Try\nTo make a make it better for American workers across the country right like he set includes farmers that quiz manufacturing includes all the the tenets of the American economy that had been really neglected for a whole lot of years\nThey just have to find a way I mean they should be easy but they have a hard time packaging their success\nOr they seem to be on the ... they're good good fighting back against the taxes they think are just Republicans ... haven't been effective in packaging the success they've had let's see if that changes I Know you help get Mitch McConnell reelected in twenty fourteen and he wants to hold on to the Senate and his power Josh Holmes thanks so much\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah uh so we'll see what ... is Jeff Flake says Michel Lucy and serious on channel four Fifteen Indiana hey Michele\nRyan they will tell you my likely I\nAm fascinated we're not making the headliner that perjury situation of the letter of his ex wife and I think it's like she should get many people especially the women that still are holding out they're about to go look\nAt the ... the big deal and I'm just getting a deck with Kavanaugh I I don't understand why they tell us what\nAnd why they took ... leading line you're talking about the accuser number three sweat Nick\nNo I'm Talking about the ex boyfriend\nOf ... as far as he said I watch Cher administer polygraph perjury herself\nShe yet that you're right she did she did say help a friend because she's a she's a therapist to psychologists his PHD she did help her friend and coach your friend through a polygraph test and she answers and no I've never done that she did\nAnd you know she knows how to pass one obviously and that was what I guess the prosecuting attorney maybe new that ahead of time I'm not sure but I'm sure they did ask the question so he he's the president didn't go after sweat next attorney he obviously does not like ... and I don't blame him I don't either country\nWe I don't know not just sleaze\n[noise]\nWell it turned out\nEven NBC who is as bad as again\nEven NBC couldn't deal with that interview did you see that as\nSoon as she when she did and she gives his story how she saw him a a teenage Brett Kavanaugh\nA standby punch bowl and he knew found out later that these punch bowls were spike so she didn't see him spike the punch bowl was quite lose or any type of liquor but he was standing by their he didn't do anything in terms of solving that he knows of\nBut he was in a group he wasn't in a line for groups actually was in a group or huddled around a room that had group sex in it she sadly is assaulted if it was indeed true but people around her including of parents don't really believe it\nNow on the earlier topic on the polygraph\nFormer FBI assistant director for intelligence Kevin Brock\nTalked to Shannon last night about these claims of forward training of friends for the polygraph test cut twenty three that is\nStandard polygraph to have one or two operative questions that are asked um so but\nIf somebody wants to look at the recordings I Want to see how the question was framed they want to hear what the actual answers were [noise] um but I Will say my experience and I've dealt with political first both from the FBI and those were hired privately [noise] um [noise]\nWhen you hire a political for you get what you pay for that's been my experience as a simple as that uh nobody should be surprised that an outcome of a polygraph ah from somebody that you hire largely comports with the outcome you're looking for\nWho they know what to ask the questions and she knows how to ask the questions now we know she was helping a friend passed one [noise]\nSo do you see the problem ... if she sexual assault is terrible but if she was Koester phobic that's not true it doesn't seem that you couldn't ... she lived in a five hundred foot square apartment five hundred feet with one entrance that according to a boyfriend or six years\nShe's not afraid to fly she lied about that not afraid to fly lately\nYeah and we don't really know what you can't really left out so there's a huge problem with the story you know how I Know Michelle they're now looking at Brett Kavanaugh's temperament or in the hearing that's how I Know\nFor a polygraph with yet they're now true or false ... she lied under oath and it started she died\nRight of tax Michelle Richard in Montreal Richard you disagree with me you think it was a good move for the president to sort of ripping her last night on stage and Mississippi\nYes I thought it was an excellent idea he pointed out all their lives these aren't inconsistencies are bleeding lies and all these journalists will continue to say how credible she is and they're not even on the other networks are not even reporting about her ex boyfriends letter and it's quite a while it's going to report that on Fox\nNews 'cause he likes to cover up everything to now he doesn't like to cover up following covers up plenty of things I I don't know long thing he's covered up I really don't\nHave that he did a report that the the [noise] anyway it covers Iraq to report this he covers everything up the attacks Trump day and night and I'm tired of it that's why he's always with shut Smith just shut Smith hates President Trump how come I never secrets wild on Sean Hannity's show\nUm he doesn't do the nighttime shows he does Tucker\nHe does shot and um he tries to stay off the opinion shows he does because he does not want to be listed as a Republican or Democrat hoax it doesn't do any good\nAre these people who could Chuck Todd and they go he's left you know they they look at which I actually think the new hosted Margaret Brennan a face the nation is pretty fair I Do or this week uh George Stephanopoulos when people see George Stephanopoulos they see Bill Clinton I don't care how good is questions are better questions or to Chris Wallace his goal is to say tough questioner\nThat's it he's ... he's not going to be afraid to go after you\nSo I Know what frustrates people but I Do say I I don't know anybody who doesn't think Chris is fair\nUh but I Know that some people think they maybe he should be easier on the president I I kinda like his tone it helps me get ready for this year\nI I kinda like his tone it helps me get ready for this year they listened W. H. I. O. in Dayton, Ohio he Dave\n[noise] yes\nI agree with the previous caller yeah and I do agree with\nYou go for it but you're still thank you love your show and I love watching you know ... anyway uh\nAnd and with the issue is with the issue is you um you see problems and I see problems with Ford story I think it's tactically\nIt doesn't help Trump get the fifty one votes he needs by going out there and and making a cartoon of it\nNothing he said was inaccurate but you don't say everything you think is specially because your audience is this not to your audience to Mississippi it's Susan Collins and Murkowski\nBecause and Jeff Flake who you might not be able to win over but just don't make it easy for him I feel like you have just made it harder for Collins to vote for Kavanaugh that's my point\nOkay okay well I can kinda understand you know some of those together but as far as Trump supporters I mean people are so many people turned out that these rallies that they can't even get in\nYou know for our lines and they still they go home and they still want to watch these people are charged up I'm not worry on a little bit\nI'll tell you what to let the last Quinnipiac poll shows you shouldn't be worried at least a you have a reason not to worry that much because Republican favorability is rising uh injustice last three weeks in September\nA day thanks and by the way you don't have to agree with me to get on the show in fact I kinda liked the fact you can agree with somebody all the time\nSo I like when you call up and you say you disagree because maybe you're convinced me I was wrong one eight six six for all eight seven six six that when we come back\nThis whole huge New York times story about Fred Trump the father of Donald Trump not paying taxes\nI Am not a tax attorney maybe you're not Gary ... is a an expert in that area he's the president of cap bumped Capital Management he knows all about ... multimillionaires not uh doing the best they can hold onto their money that's what I think happened here even though everybody else wants to pay to different scenario\nGary next don't move to try to take some calls to caves Brian kill made [noise]\nVery avoiding bombing with Arizona has denied the name of the week days right here on W.

doesn't a friendly way are on the five and everywhere else a and alerted\nWay he comes from a deep background in politics and more as well as race relations what the hell do you have to lose name of the book one Trump's war on civil rights now this is Trump's line why did you use that line title\nBecause I thought it was such a such a provocative line some people say condescending other people say straight truth as then\nTrump said black community in this country might as well live in Afghanistan here I'm paraphrasing but it's that Afghanistan is a direct quote\nThat things are worse in the black community than they are in Afghanistan because of poverty violence in the street you know Chicago Brian people shooting each other not bad schools all the rest are and he said well what do you have to lose why don't why are you voting for Hillary Clinton and not for me right so this was like such a powerful question\nAnd the book is an answer here Mr Trump is what we have to lose but I Would begin by saying this to Mr receptive Mr kill me\nThat he distorted the reality of what it is to be black in America in twenty Eighteen\nAt a time when forty percent of the black population in this country is making between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars twelve percent a hundred to two hundred thousand I saw a clear majority of black America\nIs in the middle class or beyond so these are striving people given what obstacles exist historically slavery legal discrimination ongoing biased especially in the public's the private sector\nI Would think boy what a great American story people who at times had had some difficulties been denied equal I'm ready but believe in American the American dream\nInstead President Trump present black the black community as something for the white community to spare someone's got a mug you or the twenty percent than living in poverty that defines a whole bunch of one\nDid President Obama take your stats and paint day positive picture\nYes much more in other words and by the way\nI don't know what I interpreted from him I said quote one speech but that's not what I got it all of them\nIn fact President Obama respond so many people responded to this what the hell do you have to lose my including President Obama who said boy\nLike I told my wife I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nOr that is it doesn't sound like he's on board yet\nI all I can say is they were coming after him and he was\nAbsolutely right Kavanaugh is absolutely right in the sense that this was a coordinated campaign designed by innuendo and false representation to smear the guy's reputation\nIncluding accusations of gang rape I mean anybody that would not be upset in fact Brian\nI remember one Michael Dukakis was asking the debate what would you do if somebody murdered his wife or something terrible what would you do and they gave this kind of bland on emotional response he got pilloried for that and here's a guy that comes out swinging when people were swinging at him and he's getting pilloried for that I think he's a human being\nAnd I'm with you and the thing is to if you're somebody in society that's working their way up and then somebody ... it's tough enough but when you break Cather you spent the last thirty plus years living is a very laudable life on on and off the on the job in off the job\nThey want to go back to the Nineteen eighties and call you a gang rapist and drunk and you watch your kids\nGang rapist and a drunk\nAnd you watch your kids and you see them get upset and you watch your parents and you see a humiliated they are and you wonder what happened in my life I was about to get the most prestigious job in America and now I have to worry that my integrity might be last forever I thoroughly get it but the fact that people are talking about this now\nTemperament and they're talking about highschool drinking does that also show you they have nothing else\nMay have gotten nothing else for one thing I think a little bit of a different take on it the people coming after him with their questions were being highly partisan again using in your window to attempt to do exactly what you are saying\nDestroy his reputation he could either ignored it either pretend they weren't bi partisan they weren't using innuendo and miss truce to tarnish him or he could come right back out um [noise] um my gosh at some point you just got to call people out for what they're doing I think he was calling them out\nSo to ... you know you're a doctor first you did this political thing at a this is the last ... one of the last phase of your career this supposed to be given back in your mind\nSo I understand your frustration you talk like a real person or on a regular basis with a God of experience but I Want you to hear what I think is a this just blew the lid off Jeff Flake for me and I like the guy you know I thought for a while I thought he'd get over the fact he doesn't like the Republican president but he despises them\nAnd then he thought well he got yelled at in the elevator and he was overcome with emotion he didn't want women to think that he was ignoring the allegations of sexual assault so he called for this FBI investigation and Republicans had no choice but listen to why he did it listen\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running out of ... and not a chance to\nBecause politics has become too sharp to pardon me there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nI thought he was doing what was right now he's talking about currency and value and politics if he was staying on the job like you wore he would never done what he did what does that make you think about the authenticity here\n[noise] um let's just say\nThat if anything comes if you think something is right you do and it's important you do it no matter what including no matter what the electoral politics period end of story and that's what you're elected for and every now and you take a vote and you still have to explain it and I may not be able to explain it well but that's what you do\nAnd so I'm going to disagree with Senator Flake no ... for his position that may be the case but also for I'm I'm a better way would be it was important is the right thing to do I'm taking the vote and let's see what the consequences are by the way I think John McCain did that on numerous occasions\nI obviously or he did that and he got under George Bush's skin and he got under a obviously Donald Trump's skin a lot and he also went after President Obama lot when he thought he was wrong especially on foreign policy so the big thing in Washington now and it probably in New York who knows could happen to me tomorrow\nIs all these protesters disturbing everyday life people trying to do their jobs or spend time with their families or or a loved ones we saw with Ted Cruz last week\nWe saw it with a we saw with kerosene Nielsen we saw it with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and that's just off the top of my head Mitch McConnell at the airport and then member Jeff Flake got harassed right here on friday listen\nYou're not you\nKnow we\nWe know what happened he didn't say a word or he was a he was saying you know she was obviously if something horrible happened to her and she was taking out and Jeff Flake but listen to what happened to let everybody here what happened when you got confronted by a protester list\nTo go ahead Reverend charges for\nAnd that's what she got a full FBI investigation center Cassie you actually you we worry about being politically correct you actually are actually engage the issue in the protest here she was not ready for that\nAm being politically correct Brian because by golly give our country gets to the point where an accusation can destroy somebody which everyone who is there says isn't true now I can tell you that everybody in our country is subject to being destroyed and that is a tyranny and we cannot tolerate tyranny\nThat is a tyranny and we cannot tolerate tyranny\nAnd and do you so did you did you know have you been harassed by protesters I hear they're crawling all over the uh the Capitol building\nUm they're all over the Capitol building um but on the other hand a it is time to push back\nIt is time to push back on people that think that um collaborated accusations are enough to destroy a life lived a above reproach up until these uncorroborated accusations\nUm and if we don't do that prime they're coming after everybody\nA there is no there is no stop as to as to how this weapon works\nYou know that the president brought up the other day in fact he said last night at the rally cut five\nThat's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very difficult time [noise]\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of it's a free or just [noise] it really does brown you are certainly guilty until proven innocent\nAnd Chris Coons said as much the president recognizes do you think we're talking about something even bigger than this\nTotally by the way this is just to the left or just started going to this they went up to Nikki Haley saying girl is things about Nikki Haley\nUm and so somehow um they're gonna charge again in ... to rumors as a way to discredit people in the right um and you can't prove a negative so of course you say how do you just proven negative um uh the Christians and others know better than that but it doesn't just attack to destroy\nI tend to Cassie give me your prediction it do you have you heard that the FBI report is in will you be one of the senators had read it carefully\nAbsolutely I'm really carefully because I have no doubt it's going to be misrepresented by those on the left\nAnd we have to be able to speak for protecting the identity of those who testified are thinking that there'll be speaking confidentially you got to respect them but nonetheless I if if people on the left are going to be ... be misrepresenting than people who are right need to be able to set the record straight\nSo then the procedure would be if it comes in today you have called cloture vote tomorrow and then you could vote on ... tomorrow will be Thursday coach a vote on friday and then you'd actually have a floor vote on Saturday\nTo thirty hours and so whenever that runs out whatever time it's first filed suit was filed at ten o'clock at night on friday a Sunday Morning that sort of them\nAnd with kids enter Cassie or would you talk personally to Centre College Murkowski make your case\nYou know we are having we're regularly scheduled lunches and there is a group discussion\nAnd they fully participate I have great respect for my colleagues and I speak other speak but we speak to a group or not Hector in any body we're speaking to a group respecting the need for folks to come to a decision I think the process is working very well\nDo you think we'll all we should all see that recipe I report\nOr if you could one let's face it a Kavanaugh's been smeared and\nAs Mitch McConnell says the first one is obituary will refer to the sets terribly can't hurt him any more [noise] um I'm actually in favor of openness\nBut I also recognize that people gave testimony thinking that their identity would be protected and it may be that you can read what they said and you would be able to figure out who they are so I don't want to be like dying out let me just put it this way I don't want to be like some of the Democratic senators leaking things that they that they said that they would not leak\nGrandstand fought\nThe doors brought it home again

I Can't get enough you watch on the story at seven o'clock and she's already here in Studio if you're smart enough to be watching the stream and bright kill me Joe dot com welcome back\nSmart enough to be watching the stream on brain you'll meet Joe dot com welcome back so you started this whole thing with your view of Brett Kavanaugh yeah I mean it's a remarkable alright\nWhat a week um as you know I feel I feel like the Brett Kavanaugh that I spoke to um that Monday morning last Monday\nThe Brett Kavanaugh that was on Thursday with kind of simmering loaded beneath the surface he was obviously very upset very stressed out very uh intensely concerned about this entire situation what it was during his family but he's trying to keep a lid on it and I feel like by Thursday he had been advised or maybe it was his own decision to let\nThat led just pop off and that's what we saw in there\nA obviously a but people are saying that he went over the top and they're worried about his temperament now among them is somebody who really has to win over and that is Jeff Flake cut their team\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the remarks or the initial defense to judge ... capital gave ... was something like I told my wife I Hope that I Would\nSound that indignant if I were if I felt that I was unjustly middle maligned but then it went on the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\n[noise] so where do you think flake is with that [noise] well\nI I'm going to say that I think like it's still open minded um I talked to him about this last night he believes that Jeff Flake is still open minded\nUm but he was clearly disturbed by judge Kavanaugh as a performance and I and you know he expressed is a pretty clearly tried to walk back a little bit after that it said I was talking about the judge was talking about the whole situation\nI think it's grossly unfair no matter where you stand on this to come after him for his temperament in that hearing if he had gone in there all controlled like he was on Monday morning people would say he has no passion if you were accused ... how could you just sit there and answer the questions like that\nThere is no satisfying some people on this issue clearly and you know when you look back at what Clarence Thomas said to that Judiciary Committee he was as angry\nAs Brett Kavanaugh was their different people so it's expressed in different ways but he went after them and slammed to them for their political edition of his process in no uncertain terms and nobody is saying that judge that Judge Thomas shouldn't have been serving on the court all these years\nUm I I I think it's grossly unfair and I also think given as judicial history it's it's very unfair to suggest that because he as personal feelings about what he's been through that he's going to throw all that are out the window as a judge 'cause he we've already seen for the past twelve years on the circuit court\nThat he has a very um appropriate judicial temperament so you know I\nDon't know I don't think that some people would be happy with his response either way are you telling you have a son in college I Do\nAre you telling him right now if he screws up these not going to get on the Supreme Court [noise] have you have no in fact some\nOf my sons about this and them and my daughter as well to be honest it's it's really incredible when I look at my younger son um who is about the age that Brett Kavanaugh was is when these uh charges have been leveled against in fact I have to think that you could be\nThis is going to dog him for the rest of his days I I don't think this is going to go away it's not going to go as a political issue and twenty Eighteen orange twenty twenty you weren't going to see the people who accused Brett Kavanaugh on the stage of the Democratic national convention I guarantee it this is going to be a political issue all the way through the next presidential as\nWell as we are pretty amazing astounding if Dr Ford was like that because she didn't want her name out there and we know that she uh wondered at him and he's just like to fly a lot a lot about Dr Ford has not panned out\n[laughter] it's hard to imagine just like to fly her boyfriend of six years says I'd never heard you want to fly it never claustrophobia she lived in a one entrance five hundred foot square apartment never mentioned sexual assault but that's up to individuals they clash and it was\nMentioned it to anyone until twenty twelve and then it came out in the therapist discussions and that it's in the notes so that that's consistent with her story that she didn't share it with him in the late nineties\nYeah so that is or something it popped up and now we also understand too quickly to the boyfriend the export friends deserve an axe to grind\nThat Dr Ford helped a friend of hers prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect out probably gross work and help with clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nWhen asked did you did have you ever take one or prepare for 'em before she said she\nHadn't yeah no I mean that if that if his story is true that potential for lying under oath and that it was interesting question when it came up when the prosecutor asked that question did you ever health anywhere for cat she where she's coming from here and now it appears that perhaps they had you know some of that testimony that led to that question I thought that was very interesting\nSo with this next story is fascinating because I have an oddity who feels like he's on a road Stormy Daniels which is odd things say of feels like I got another client and this guy's going to blow everything up yeah she did a her credibility she goes out there and says\nWell your your your Brett Kavanaugh was by the punch bowl did he spy get no we\nKnow I was standing there at though handing solo cups around standing there at handling girls drinks who came to\nTwo cups around standing there at handling girls drinks who came to the party to go to a party I Would assume\nParties that he is even confirm these beer and she's a college person and then she stood outside a doorway when there was group sex going on and he might have been somebody who has a rerun of\nImage she's got so many ... and she was asked you know why are we at the party when you're in college and they were in high school and she said oh there were people of all ages there from like Eighteen Fifteen to like twenty five I think she said you know and then I I mean it's just so her story has so many holes in it\nIt's incredible I I Can't figure out how and then he said oh can you know some of your friends who are with you there verify that you were there and NBC called all four of the friends they couldn't get one of them to verify her story\nOr Alan Dershowitz was on he said that I think that a bridge capital should be confirmed but he wanted to see an FBI investigation first Kevin ... speaks she speaks he says I think they're I think he's in it you know I think you should we confirmed but I still want to see the FBI investigation\nAnd I would start and I didn't know where it's coming from the time which I think that's the third accuser for herself why ...\nI think the FBI to investigate every single one of her claims and if it turns out if it turns out that she made it up out of whole cloth\nThat she never met Kavanaugh that she was several years older than that she along with others or by herself\nSimply made up a story the FBI should conclude that she should be tried for perjury and she should be sent to prison this becomes a very important education moment because we have to teach the women of the world and the men of the world that there is no genetically linked\nAspect of telling the truth\nI think that he makes an excellent point and I think this is what we all need to get back to the idea that all women should be believed is a false premise we need to strip away gender some questions of truth\nIt doesn't matter who's the man and who's the woman in these stories what matters is who's telling the truth and you know there's a lot that we still need to discover there's a ton of these stories out there but if you strip that a way you are at least on the right course to figuring out where the truth lies\nYeah and I think that's where we're at a now when Donald Trump junior was asked the question are you more worried for your son or your daughter about this in the future he says no doubt for my son's here's what Donald Trump senior said cut it\nThis is a time when your father\nOne your husband or your brother one you saw\nA terrible things you know a person what never met said that I did things that was horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't want to do\nThem sad situation I think about something I don't know how\nAnd who do you worry about more your your daughter or your\nYou know what I worry about them equally when it comes to this and I would say that one of the big lessons for young women from this whole thing is\nAs hard as it is if something happens to you you need to document it right away you need to tell people what happened do you need to tell your parents you need to tell the police you need to have whatever evidence you can possibly grow up in that situation\nTo prove beyond a reasonable doubt that what you say happened to you that is my message for young women and I think it's a very important\nFor young men they need to be extraordinarily careful because we're living in a time in this me to moment where the pendulum has swung too far and where an accusation becomes an indictment and that is not the judicial system that we live in in this country\nExactly a and by the way the other thing I Want to go to Theresa W O Katie because there's another issue on to bring up with your Theresa Martha ... so you're getting said first show at seven o'clock you want to talk of the protesters\nYeah um my issue with them is like with the women have accused him like the protest or in the elevator\nBecause she wants to come out there and screen every one thinks oh my gosh something that happened to her how do we know that I feel like\nI literally the liberals when they said they will do what ever it takes to keep a top appointee often which makes anybody think that these women\nAre the type of people that could do that because we saw that on TV we saw all the women wearing the John ... we saw what they were doing and we heard what they were saying I mean if there was a woman\nI Can't remember what ... was she was only TV talking about very gross things that go along with women's bodies every month and it's almost like they were wanting to blame all men\nJust don't get it right that's the kind that come out and they say that this happened to me we don't know that All right they retired yeah I I Would say be honest\nWe don't know that it's All right they reach I guess I Would say beyond that we don't know whether or not\nYou know the women elevator went through these experiences I'm going to see and they did I I I think they probably did\nUm but their experience does not translate to this situation\nThese crimes are individual crimes they are not a broad brush that you see all men with each one of them it needs to be determined on its validity and so do you know Jeff Flake and Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Ford\nTheir situation that they're all determining the truth is completely separate from every other one of the situation I Would feel Cassie do when he was confronted yesterday listen\nTo go ahead [laughter] no charges\nI hadn't\nHeard that exchange that is really remarkable and it's a it's a very evident of what's going on and if not you know ... I ... in the sand drifting off at a the the president tapping into this and I you know your son has\nBecause that that's a very bold strategy and the president never shies away from saying that he something that he thinks is tapping into what a lot of people are feeling in the country\nBut I Do think that men are the majority of which are good and and don't spend their time assaulting are attacking women feel under siege I and we're actually going to a men's pale tonight we did a women's paint on the other night uh for moms\nAnd we had people on both sides of the fence who felt that you know Kevin ... was was guilty and and other women who said that you know that they didn't feel like the charges had been proven\nTo never going to talk to men are about how they feel about about this issue\nGreat Martha ... going to host or show at seven o'clock tonight we're back to wrap up this hour ...
