part that crosses the line\nAll right [laughter]\nYeah that crosses the line matter of fact legally it crosses the line because it's a libel per se\nIn other words a libel per se beans you're you don't have to prove anything\nIt's by law liable and it goes back to common law goes back to a oh it's fantastic law goes back hundreds and hundreds of years English common law and the rules were liable per se is a accusing a business person or dishonest business practices um the ball\nThat's one of them are attacking a woman's virginity a was another one that one is and use very much anymore Erica 'cause there aren't too many versions running around out there or the other one in my my favorite one is accusing someone of having a lot of some disease\nNow in those days are low some disease was ah basically it was leprosy but\nChild cry it said believe me that's considered a loaf of those in the Los of disease yeah it's a case for defamation straight out uh I Would I Would contact her lawyer is there any money on the other side does he have some bucks\nWon't let you know yeah okay yeah and then you definitely on it then\nYou want you want to definitely talk to a lawyer there's no question about it now here is a I think the question and maybe one of the most important questions because you know what you know what the defense is ...\nSince because you know what you know what the defense is to a defamation suit\nNo okay the defense is the truth so Erica here it goes do you have an STD\nBlow off oh wait a second you said that pretty forcefully matter of fact you say that a little bit to forcefully if you really want to know into quickly if you know what I'm Talking about ... percent protest too much\nOkay I'll get a whole not yeah yeah that's another a concept in the law ... dos protest too much I just wanted to say OK\nDefamation libel per se love that and that was like no one does that anymore but I Love the low some disease one and then it attacking women's virginity I mean how speak tactical or is that huh OK Dennis hello Dennis [laughter]\n\nNow that you're up welcome to handle on law hello I'm Sorry Dave I Apologize\nOh that you and that's my fault hello to have a good morning that already has her\nI have a a a file a personal bankruptcy which will be discharged are completely next September in the meantime I'm In the middle of a cash out refinance on my personal resident\nA it's almost at the end and so we're on a timeline a title search revealed that there is a second mortgage owed by a large bank or the title company will not fund the refile left that second is paid off outside of the re fi\nAh contacted the bank they said there was twenty five thousand note but they would settle for ten I don't know anything about this loan I never paid on it I asked him to send me the records of the contract they said the records don't go back that far\nHow do they know you all the money\nThat was my question to them but it showed up on the credit report right well that could be an air that could be an error\nI I understand that but they won't they won't\nProvide any croquet alone in the meantime the the brief I as being yeah yeah\nAll right so I I think at this point I Would I Would do is get a lawyer letter over to them\nAnd if it turns out that they don't have any proof that you all the money is just hey you all was the money I Am because there was a letter or someplace there's some indication we have no backup what you're doing is a illegally interfering with my ability to get a ...\nA and there's some there's some liability there\nWell understand that in the meantime though the locked in rates are going to\nCome here there's no question now rates are are are exploding oh there is no issue about it at all so you want to work with your lender although the lender is going to do everything now that interest rates are so high would love to get you out of a locked in rage or maybe a they still want your business who the hell knows at this point\nAnd that because I don't know if they anticipated the rates going up as quickly as they have been going on in the last few weeks\nAnd so you work with them but this is where I I think you have to threaten or the banks saying you were holding up uh my rate which is locked in interest rates are now higher there some damages their and die you just you can't do that without\nProof why don't we don't have the records well then how do I know the money well because you do I do [noise] so that's\nWhy a letter from a lawyer and making a couple of demands would help\nWould there be any advantage to waiting until the next September when the bankruptcy discharges to get us just the standard a of a conventional\nEarly on that well it's put your interest rates ... what are they are two points higher yeah or you have to you don't\nWant to wave your rights on this one goal for he'd get the letter a and nail the bank if you can wow All right I've ever heard of that happening are and and do just\nThat we're always money [noise]\nThe bank [noise] maybe there's a letter there\nThere's no proof problem\nIs handling the law [noise]\nNothing small and not your from your passion your hours your reputation ... huge\nTheir partnership even bigger [noise]\nWas down small business technology advisors you'll get the demise and one on one partnership to help your business ground because of the reliable down PCs with Enron corn processors you can focus on what matters most getting business down\nSeven seven by down to speak with an advisor [noise] eight seven seven by down\nBut when they put out flyers saying when a meeting with the but they've ever put out of the time so I didn't know was eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night when it hit that put the window when ... or what they said the CDC in ours um rent we who having a window because of the zero outlying [noise]\nSo but I went to the board meeting got very very nasty personal a wiki away yet maybe in\nSo a wiki away yet maybe in Rio back [noise] um [noise] so that's where I Am [laughter]\nAll right and what are they are they finding you now or is it just is screaming at you\nKnow to find me a hundred dollars a month or ... or because somebody and they expect you to take the window out I'm assuming that demanding I kicked the window out or else they would keep finding\nAlright has anybody else in the building or put windows in in those locations\n[noise] not dying alright so this is new well I it's\nThey have the right to say no or are they have the right to say if you put one in ... that in violation of the CBC in ours or they can say ...\nAnd you take it out until you are an and getting here's your fine and uh we're going to keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in and they they made it impossible for you to even\nUh even make an application and there it is and there there by the way there is the court case okay\nUh you have to ... ... what I Would do is have a conversation with the attorney that represents the board and every every board of directors a H every age away has an attorney who represents a that represents them and to have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible to management company wouldn't call me back\nWhat am I supposed to do well what you're supposed to do is just keep on trying and trying and trying and at some point I'll tell you legally what should happen even though it's the biggest pain in the ass\nYou go to the point where they make an untenable and then you get a court order allowing you to do that because they made it untenable but that's\nWay down the line so you've caught it early on now is the question of a what a pain in the ass the board is they're going to say hey we set up by the time we set up a date you could've called us and found out it was eight o'clock or eight o'clock AM PM and you're gonna say I tried\nYeah you never responded here's my phone call the management company and what you guys do where ... year playing chicken with each other\nFor so it's a it's a problem\nAny attorney for the board or sitting right next to me at a board meeting but one of the board members around ... ... ... what the window for putting solar panels on a small ... kicked the window out while a trip to us\nOkay that incidentally uh if anybody else will\nUh will state that who was in the room now he doesn't have a right to do that by the way that's not a legal decision okay that's that's a board decision by that adds to your argument that says a decent argument really is it's a tough one God everybody has problems today that I don't so that works out hello Dennis Hi Dennis\nAre I'd want to know what's good for me to Kurt ... or ... or renting a property that are flooded for time there's carpet in the bedroom that we've we've had over ...\nFor and go on to dry them out or we're going

here are very well aware that you're outside\nAll right we're all ... and you want out and you want out correct\nYeah All right well based on the fact that his untenable to live there is basically uninhabitable you say hey I'm Out of here and I don't even know if you need noticed you just say it I just can't live here anymore because of what's going on thank you I'm done and then what I Would do is give this much notice as possible\nOr or and or they're going to withhold a security deposit probably depending on the management company or they're going to demand some kind of a rent till the end of the leaves a I'm assuming you're do you have a lease\nThrough may okay uh so All right so you've got a good long time so you let them know or what you're going to do and ah they\nUnless they're willing to repair inside right now and unless they're a ... and they're saying but we have to do it from the outside in a then you can withhold rent whether you can leave or not I don't know uh but are you a negotiations with them at all\nNo more crop render a it is a criminal owner and what she's gone to um the knowledge that the stem from the drier and carpet is horrible and how\nDo you live

T. session and um he seemed to be okay\nAnd then uh the company the insurance company from the other party said hey look we'll pay for your medical costs and will for went to a five hundred dollar bone pain and suffering mound pointed out my son is having recurring nightmares and he's going to college out of state so the insurance company wants to settle I'm trying to figure out well you know do I take 'em to small claims\nNo no no you don't take them small claims court I your first of all your son's case obviously is still open because you haven't signed or accepted money on behalf of your son 'cause you have to guard emit light I'm and I'm assuming you did none of that\nCorrect that's correct or he is he is more than Eighteen okay so it's still the case is not settled against him\nThat's correct All right yes a recurring nightmares is no small thing if a if it's going to be chronic and if you've been connected to that accident so your problem is where your challenge not your problem is connecting his nightmares\nTo the accident and that you and they were going to have to deal with the shrink uh alright there's no way that\nYou can say well in my opinion well yeah ... where did you go to a psychology school where's your memory they held the Amish therapy have you done so it's a question of going to\nShrink and there could be some ... a substantial money uh involved\nThere I mean we had very similar case uh with my children are when are we sent them and it wasn't in a car accident but we sent them to a psychologist for certain problems they had and it turned out their entire psychological problems was due to the fact they're my kids\nAre in a you know [laughter] there's not much we can do about that but connecting the two is the challenge then then you start talking it's going to be a lot more than small claims to my friend\nOh really okay yeah yeah it's a personal injury case I'm going to tell you you you got a backup see the connection\nDo you think I should hook up with a personal injury\nOr hurting I Would yeah okay I certainly just starting to yeah I certainly started all uh for sure\nBetty Hi Maddie [noise] [noise] yes I have a large pine tree is hanging over in my yard and the ... the house next\nDoor with a ... I don't know who owns it but there's several people living in it because of the ...\nNow who owns it but there's several people living in it because of the four or five cars I see out front\nOkay well they're probably they're probably squatters and her\nWay I can yeah I'm tacked or get a hold of somebody\nBetty how old are you\n... pardon how old are you Betty anyone or you've really got you sounded day over Ninety Oh thank you All right now is very yes and so you want to do this fairly quickly before you die I understand that [laughter] All right so bad that right yeah well good for you\nGreat sense of humor All right so Betty or the trick is finding out who owns the property and that you can just pull title and it could be the bank or someone owns that property it with a rate of I understand so therefore the bank has it\nWhich is exactly what you want the bank to own it because then you contact or the bank and say hey clean this up get\nRid of a though that hanging do those hanging branches now what I Would do is you've got to do it anyway at some point and a is there a danger your property I mean is there a wall that so being affected\nAnd then there's the fence between the two property and I understand I've been here for years and I understand it's a common than\nAll right well I ... doesn't matter even if it's common fans that they're responsible for any uh trees branches hanging over your property so here's what I Would do I get a bed\nAnd find out how much is going to cost if it were me I Do it myself I pay for it and then turn around and sue those people but doesn't necessarily have to be that way I you're simply finding out who ...\nOr ... and use a poll title on that that's easy ah that's just a ... Internet search because these are all public documents and then you contact the owner now\nYou hope it's the bank because if it's still\nIn the name of the previous owner\nI they're going to tell you to go pounds than they don't care I mean they're losing everything anyway I mean the worse that happens if you get a judgment against them let's say three hundred dollars okay just get in line\nBecause we've lost our house but he didn't got credit is like already\n[noise] their their distaste and their son took off\nThen you have to find out who owns a property 'cause that's where you going to go or you just pay for it and just suck it up I mean the people that are squatting next door they don't have any responsibility or how bad is your problem with this\nWell it it to the point I haven't done I hadn't said anything about it 'cause I don't see anybody coming in and out but it it is a hanging over at least half\nIraqi are it's a lot how much do you think it's going to cost to clean up\nWell I think it's quite large and the pine needles are about ... inches long\nAgo yeah All right so you've got an issue I so I get a bad idea and I don't know how ... how you doing for money are you living pay for oh good All right because then the next question was going to be I like are you living in a dumpster and is it nice and clean and so that's not the case I Would just pay for it and just have it done and then find out who owns the property and just send the bill\nOh okay that's and then uh it's right in the same small claims court as I said if the bank owns that do clean it up because that's just what they do I mean they're\nTrying to sell the house and they don't want any liability and ah [noise] they're they're pretty good about that especially if you're talking a

literary question tore a bill cause I'm because I'm so literary I understand because yes because you're so literate yes\nI'm I'm I've written one book and I'm writing another one and then the first book we held off on publication because we were worried about we would describe a couple of experiences and hotels and it was all positive\nNothing negative or we were wondering if those hotels would do try and do anything to us legally because we talk about him and we give their name to the hotel\nOh no matter of fact even if there were a negative and you give me your name too do you give the hotel name out of the what you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way this defamation or a or you can tell them what go ahead\nNo no go ahead yourself\nAlright so uh let's say a year accusing uh the hotel and having bedbugs in your story and he named the hotel uh you know I don't want to name any names but he'll Marian Wright Wyndham let's just go through the names incidentally what was the name of the hotel or can they want it\nThey go through the names incidentally what was the name of the hotel\nAnd don't want to say that on the air bill why they don't know who you are a\nWell actually truthful and I'm not sure if I can remember\nNot fair enough I mean it's been it's been a few years\nYeah okay fair enough by the way a ... if they couldn't go after you because uh there is a uh uh just to let you know you've heard of the attorney client privilege there is a there is a hotel talk show privilege that's recognized under the law so they couldn't go after what laws that what you got you\nKnow by the way you can't remember which hotel I don't have it here in front of me uh when I'm sure it's there no the point is is that let's say there was a horrible experience and you're a disparaging the hotel if it's true but\nAh you know what there is no defense there is no such thing as defamation to the truth is an absolute defense by the way they're not going to go after you if you say OK their bed bugs are the people were horrible and if you're talking about a non disparaging remark if you're talking about something that's positive that happens\nOr not only is there no disparage meant not only is there in the lawsuit for defamation 'cause it's not defamation or they're getting a commercial\nYeah that was kind of my take out your way out what what kind of book to write well the first book\nWith the travel experience a that was done and sort of a novelist stick\nIt in real time you know strangely enough I probably didn't read it how to do well we didn't do because we we put it on hold okay has worried about legal as I understand there are no wonder you don't okay you're very lawyer understand don't\nYou don't have to worry about that uh because uh the fact that it hasn't been published yet there is not going to be a whole lot of difference when you publish it I uh-huh terms of sales okay what's your next book that you're working on okay\nThe the second one uh this is a book about a um a period of time in my life I guess you could call it a memoir that takes place in Mexico ahah\nAnd part of it involves they very well known cancer clinic and Mexico okay\nAnd there was an extremely negative scenario involved with this with this very famous cancer clinic and what I did and the second book is I changed the name of the hospital and all the doctors and and uh ... made it as I'm recognizing\nTheir childhood then you're fine I to do anything to do there's okay here's a little detail they're getting long had part of\nMexico where it is it's the only cancer clinic and it's very well know\nAlright so big deal in the meantime here is ... I'm going to give you a reality check okay let's say there's defamation right ah and ah there's it didn't happen there's legitimate you're giving a you're issuing facts dating facts that\nAre are not true so now you they have a case to things have to happen number one uh people have to give a rat's about what happened to you and they don't\nWrite so uh I I wouldn't worry 'cause all three people going to read the book uh it really doesn't matter a number two they're going to be three people going to read the book uh they're never going to hear about it and if they do they're not suing you so don't worry about it enjoy yourself defame them\nI just have a time of your life a couple of rules make sure it's a that you don't make up the facts and number two is as often as possible I make it your opinion\nOkay for example a it is my opinion that when they operate on me uh they took out my diaphragm but that shy opinion\nI really don't know if they don't believe you can have died from well there you are okay thanks for the call is handle on the law\n[noise]\n\n\nSeven Daniel full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off\nIn stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin will look laminate flooring all on sale up to forty percent off refinished hardwood and bamboo starting in Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nIs nothing small and now you're from your passion your hours your reputation ...\nYour partnership even bigger [noise]\nDown small business technology advisor you'll get the ... and one on one partnership dump your business ground because of the reliable down PCs AmeriCorps processors you can focus on what matters now getting business down\nSeven die down to speak with an advisor Kevin solving by down [noise]\nAre you putting your retirement savings four one K.
