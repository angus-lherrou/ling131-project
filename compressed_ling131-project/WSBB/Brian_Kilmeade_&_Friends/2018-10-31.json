brown\nOr he is somebody that was mentioned as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton but now I Thirteen point average lead or an Eighteen point average leaders being cut down to six what is the congressman been doing let's ask him congressman what is it about your campaign that sound resonating\nMorning Brian and hey what's ah what's happening is finally people get to know me I'm In the states a big state multiple media markets and I've been able to get out there and let people know that you have a business guy somebody who's been created Fifteen\nHundred jobs unemployed three thousand people over Twenty years who ran for Congress as its Chevy dealership has taken away from them versus\nSomebody like Sherrod Brown who\nReally when he graduated from college ran for office has been in office for forty four years is only worried about one job and that's his\nUh and it's interesting because that message\nResonates the problem is a ... you you might not notice I jumped in this race just seven months ago when\nThe individual who was running against Sharon the last couple of years have to step down for family reasons so I've at a seven month a opportunity is trying to get people to know me and it's happening people are finally getting to know who I Am\nRight congressman and a couple of things if he was just amazed that these senators from states that are ... battleground states never vote a with the president I mean short brown ... never vote for the president but yet the people of Ohio already voted for the president at the very least it's purple right\n[noise] well absolutely and he and short brown has heard what the president that's along president he was ... bomb almost a hundred percent of the time he has been voting against this president across some against this president approximate eighty five percent of the time and that's the other thing I've tried to let\nPeople from Ohio no he's a fourth most liberal center in the country ... outlook Ohio's a purple state trending read it's not a liberal state or he votes Ninety four percent of the time of war and he probably would be better representing Massachusetts or California than Ohio\nRight and I think that's a lot\nThat's the truth is er California than Ohio\nRight and I think that a lot Claire McCaskill tried to market yourself to the middle I'm you have\nUm you have a cinema also trying to prove that she's trying to shows he's a moderate I tell you what the country would be much better off if the if if these if leadership had to earn your votes in the Senate they're all these people who are sending so fair and balanced have not shown to be fair and balanced what kind of senator would you be\nWell look I've shown that uh Brian when I went to the house the first thing I was disgusted look was all the backbiting between Republicans and Democrats and I literally on the first month started a bipartisan breakfast at seven years later it's still\nGoing forward so sure from joked about it every day and our debates and anybody comes for breakfast but you know we have almost thirty members hurt the Republicans hurting Democrats that talk about things we can work on together uh and I've said this time and time again our problems are not Republican problems are problems are not\nDemocrat problems are American problems that problem that I've learned the violence in being being in business and then going into the house of representatives says it's politics gets in a way of everything and that's why we're so divided when we should be at least looking at ways we can get things\nDone right or that would be key maybe they're maybe it's going to come and vote to try to get things done after a while a congressman what do you plan to do to close I Know governor case it gets finally backing you\n[noise] yeah the the real issue here is just getting people to know me I mean we've spent seven months of getting around the state are trying to get as much a media attention I tropical because uh I'm as the president calls it the fake news and much of the mainstream media\nHas been very vocal ... toward much in local Ohio media has been very vocal toward shared because his wife was part of the media for so many years that we've been breaking through that little by little but we're just going to continue to get that message out a business guy somebody who was created Fifteen hundred jobs versus somebody who's been in\nPolitics for his entire life and\nWe're going to continue to work a travel this state and and get them get the message out that's the key\nWhen people get to know me they've come my way and it's just been such a big state that I realized even in our last poll we only have about fifty five percent name id ... brown has a Ninety two percent name id that's the difference we got to make that difference and make sure people know who I Am\nIs a six point devastated right now so\nLet's let's look at this is a couple of issues out there in the plate or on your on we Congress is going to have to take a look at the president's got an executive order working he's going to announce it officially Sunday\nThat he wants to get rid of birthright a ... birthright citizenship you have to illegal immigrants parents were born here you're a citizen Trump things were misinterpreted in the constitution where do you stay in ...\nI I Am a big believer that Congress needs fixing immigration program people in Ohio and people across the country\nAre mad because of too many illegal immigrants share brown actually supports not only no no border uh he he wants to eliminate ice like the rest of the Democrats and when it comes to sanctuary cities he supports them too that's where people don't like so they start there and then they started looking at an immigration system and saying spoken\nAnd then they look to those that are born in Ohio or in this country and say you know wait a minute we're we're letting them would come across the border or doing everything just to let go immigrants and that's why I say it's just not one issue\nIf the entire issue we need a strong border wall we need to make sure that Congress gets immigration some kind of immigration law passed and um\nThat's what I'm hearing you know in Ohio of course people are mad that anybody can walk in the state I'm but I'm not sure we can override the fourteenth amendment just yet I Do believe in the constitution and I'm not so I think we need to support those as well\nBut president bit of help\nBut it has been a big help coming back to Cleveland on Monday next week the vice president in tomorrow to try and push the votes I mean this is about getting the voters out ah let's face it we know the Democrats are going to be out we gotta make sure the Republicans out and the independents are showing\nSign 'em all that's exactly where I'm coming from ... to always a pleasure thank you so we'll say so\nGo get him Stewart is on now will welcome in Jonathan Turley Jonathan\nHey\nCosts to show I said Georgia judge George Washington university I think I said on television Georgetown but I correct constitutional law professor Jonathan tap into your constitutional knowledge what you never leave at home to the president have a case\nHe does have a case by the I'm not too sure how strong of a case because the amendment itself a is hopelessly ambiguous says to six words\nThat the amendment states quite clearly that all persons born or naturalized the United states are citizens of the United states but right in the middle of that line are six words that say and subject to the jurisdiction of their of\nAnd it's sort of a weird claws and ever since it was ratified there's been a debate over what it means\nSo for for many people the amendments suggests that we have unlimited birthright citizenship and the country while many including some of the draft or is indicated that they believe\nThat they that the amendment says that you have a birthright citizenship if you're subject to the jurisdiction you're either a citizen\nSection you're either a citizen or a legal resident but not if you are undocumented or a diplomat or a tourist\nSo this debate has literally raged for a hundred and fifty years now what the president is doing um it could resolve this by pushing it into the courts because the Supreme Court really address this in a famous case in Eighteen Ninety eight\nWithout really result in the ultimate question is a case called long Kim ark and involved Chinese parents who came to the country had a child here and the Supreme Court said that child is a citizen\nBut the problem is that those Chinese parents were legal residence\nSo the case doesn't really answer the question on all of our minds about undocumented persons\nSo what was the president for that case [noise] well ...\nYeah the Supreme Court said that reading the fourteenth amendment and these people are subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and therefore their child is a citizen [noise]\nUm and most people who adopt a more restrictive view of the fourteenth amendment have no problem with that they have no problem with saying that legal residents can can have their children recognize the citizens [noise]\nThe the issue is what to do with all the rest and that's a really tough tough question now part of the issue here is the means\nThat by using an executive order or the court may ultimately say look you can't do this alone you can't unilaterally just make this decision [noise]\nNow the funny thing about that is that I'm actually a critic of executive orders cause I think decisions as important as this really should be made by Congress but\nThe funny thing is all roads lead back to those six words\nBecause it's the amendment says that anyone born in the United states as a citizen that President Trump clearly cannot change that with an executive order if on the other hand the court decides that the amendment has a narrower meaning\nThen sure he can exercise that power as an executive order so even though the the there's the threshold question the court may have to answer the ultimate question\nAnd then and then it would go up to the highest court and is very conservative view of this any liberal view of this is the liberal view let everybody become a citizen is a conservative view it no one\nIt's sort of a mixed certainly a lot of liberal professors argue that\nThe amendment is clear it's a constitutional right it can only be changed by the constitution [noise] um I don't see how you can really say that I mean it really terrible thing about all this\nIs and and you know I've talked about this in the past about the lack of civility or how we don't really talk about issues anymore in this country this is a good example there are really good faith arguments on both sides this is not\nSomething where you could say the other side is just entirely ignoring the law the constitution they're strong arguments on both sides we should be able to have this conversation without labeling each other\nAs you know racist or or destroying America this is a legitimate question people really don't know what those six words mean\nI'm ... I'm looking at this and did so called anchor babies applies you are right\nWell yeah but a lot of people do game the system uh you know we have ah people who have these hotels these maternity hotels where you come in and have the child in the United states and then you get that citizenship for the child\nAnd so there's obviously gaming that goes on is that the a serious motivation for immigration yeah probably not I mean most people are coming United States because they want a better life\nBut I sure there are people that game it\nOr they say between Nineteen eighty two thousand six the number of birds to unauthorized immigrants\nWhich you are with your opponents of birthright citizenship co anchor babies sky rocket to a peak of three hundred and Seventy thousand\nThat according to to the Pew Research study in twenty sixteen one slightly down when the great recession hit and now I assume things get better will be attractive once again\nSo the president's going to get people talk and that's what that's what's happening today seems like you embrace the challenge how we always felt like this up until what year did we view or do was has always been the case if you were born here\nOr whether your parents were documentary or not you're a citizen here\nNow you know what Brian this has been a Hong unresolved question but the irony is that the Democrats are at one time supported the narrower ruling a view of the constitution Harry Reid actually put forward a bill to confine citizenship to citizens and legal rights\nConfined citizenship to citizens and legal residents eyes so that actually gets to a third possibility and interpreting the constitution\nThere is a ferret interpretation which is that by saying that it's if you're subject to the jurisdiction\nThere famers may have just wanted to leave this to Congress the Congress can change the jurisdiction can change the definition of citizenship under that interpretation President Trump still could not use an executive order so of the three interpretations\nOnly one of them would allow him to use the executive order and that's the one that says no they always intended this to be just for citizens and legal residents\nAnd it's hard to imagine a day when the midterms are over since it's so anticipated but one day they will be over some say a week from today a if everything gets done and then we'll going to be having hearing about the Mueller probe once again here's the president last night when asked by Laura if a shield he'll sit for mowers questions\nIt's ridiculous that have to do anything because we didn't do anything but we will probably\nDo something else will respond to some ...\nWell that could be written in some ... probably said don't just pick and choose but from where you understand where's this probe at\nWell you know it's a fascinating question because mowers acceptance of written answers only applied to collusion\nQuestions he actually did not say that he wanted answers in writing to obstruction now whether he would do that orally or he's insisting that must be oral is anyone's guess I still don't believe that there is a prosecutor\nBull or credible case of obstruction\nI I you know what he has we can only guess at a bite if the president does sit down to answer questions I think that Mueller would move fairly quickly to get this report out a and it would go to Rosenstein and the assumption has been that Congress would\nGet a copy but that's entirely up to the deputy attorney general he could not give Congress economy\nAnd if he's still have the job after the election\n[laughter] yes all these things are up in the air but the good thing is\nThat you know the the reign of political commentator as well and and legal commentators will once again come to the\nForge is all about Jonathan Turley a which path for you as a career it's so so typical of the ego [laughter] so typical so John and a couple of things that I interviewed Papadopoulos twice once on radio for a half hour and\nTen minutes on Fox and friends which is like four hours in human time so that you know how short those interviews or and basically he figuring out\nThere in some way shape or form he was targeted\nAnd missed it worked for British Intelligence who was the one who initially talked to him and said he had Russian contacts and he didn't\nAnd that Christie was due in Mississippi were linked through the world cup investigation because he worked for the world cup committee and now they have the ambassador down or might have intelligence links with Australia Australia he will not answer the question Mr there's now disappeared and now the insurance policy tax back and forth\nA coincides with the arrival of Peter Struck a good friend Peter's trucks to arrive in Britain one day before he was questioned there's a lot of things coming together around path but apple is who now works might do to overturn his his plea deal\nSo what do you think's going on here I mean it's getting harder and harder to follow but for you and I who have been following it close it looks really diabolical", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "city":
