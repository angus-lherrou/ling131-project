the pernicious why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre roast tenant printed this program she was home with those yesterday you\nKnow she exposed this is their hateful garbage abroad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem posted eight points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention and then anyway and it was so they invited a I guess it interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors and priests and you know people the costs are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nYou know my friend David shown on this program has been to the tree of life says rabbi Myers is an amazing man\nAnd um why what did you want the president to come and comfort your congregation there's never been a more pro Israel president in my lifetime than this one\nIt's just it's just the fact all the president's promise that Jerusalem which is the rightful capital of Israel or going to move it from Tel Aviv Israel and they never do it because they never have the courage to do it\nWhat Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the ... region and I said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my word\nOh why don't we have a little bit more of that that is one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word is gonna he's fighting for it we see now happening on the immigration fight\nOr the president and Lindsey Graham of teamed up to and birthright citizenship in other words if you enter the country illegally and you happen to give birth to a child that child's instantly\nEven though you're in the country illegally interest in it\nInitially is just automatically a U.S

apparently Mike Allen let's see if I can pull this story up here is a tweeting out that special counsel former FBI Director Mueller is accused of some type of sexual impropriety\nAgainst women and the FBI now is looking into it that it's a false stories I Want to give you both sides of it daily news as of a very different take on it and they're headline is FBI asked to investigate allegations that women were offered cash to accuse Robert Mueller\nOf sexual assault I Know for a fact\nThat a tape exists or where there is a very prominent person on the tape on about Mueller\nVery prominent person on the tape offering money to somebody to make allegations against Donald Trump why this tape has never been made public I don't know\nBut it does exist and I'm not going to go any further than that at this point so this type of thing does happen and I think like every other case\nI mean I'm not a fan of the team that Robert Mueller put together I you know I'm always torn 'cause I never want to ... I'm I'm very fond of law enforcement I just hate\nThe people that he hired in this witch hunt how we ever got off into things like you know bank loan applications but it was supposed to be about Trump Russia collusion you know we're at a point in history where this is not phony Democrats are they only care about Russia collusion an interference if it's Donald Trump\nBut when you have real evidence 'cause there's no evidence of Trump Russia collusion when there's real evidence of Hillary paying for a phony Russian dot CA disseminated by top intelligence officials\nAnd FBI officials to lie to the American people before an election is used to commit fraud on Pfizer court judges four times to get into the Trump campaign ... be a Trump campaign associate\nAnd then is part of old media elite strategy that we've now learned about it's taken Eighteen months\nThat dot CA is used in legal all over the media to create the impression oh there's smoke here about Trump Russia collusion\nBut the leaks were about the phony ... a Russian does save and Hillary paid for\nOn top of of course Hillary committing multiple felonies and having a rigged investigation and this week strategy leading to the appointment of Mahler which we now know to be the insurance policy just in case Trump wins because Trump should lose a hundred million to one according to Peter Struck\nEven Peter Struck said there's no there there used to pay ... just prior to the appointment of Mahler they had no evidence of any type of collusion none\nSo outrageous you know you watch this this vile anti Semitic racist Trump hater murdering of Lebanon innocent people injuring six others I mean you see it's basically the face of evil evil exists\nIn existence society exist all around the world why we need to spend the money we spend on a strong national defense that's why we need to be tough with oh Kim Jong un and the ... and a wrong\nYou know it's we have the deadliest attack against the Jewish community on American soil in our history president said nope will destroy you if you attack them which was the right answer is no place in this country for evil\nRacist anti Semite none I don't think\nThere's been a president in modern history that has demonstrated his support for our number one ally in the middle east and frankly between Great Britain in Israel but this is the closest alliance we half\nAs America founded on Judeo Christian principles it's a personal connection in his own family with his daughter and son in law his grandchildren you know as um you know he's the one that supported the Nazi death camp guard Obama didn't do it could it but he didn't\nSpend the most pro Israeli president rightly so since Nineteen forty seven moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem past presidents never had the courage to do it\nIsraeli prime minister or I've often said it was the only adult on the world stage finally has a partner that understands the evils and the threats of radical Islam and\nEspecially Iran and the mainstream media Democrats speaking with one voice blame Trump but this horrific attack Dana Milbank\nTrump but this horrific attack Dana Milbank writing Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews what a lie\nWhat a slanderous disgusting despicable lie\nAlso in the Washington Post an editor writing you know Trump is stoked the fears of those like Bower one columnist the New York times Trump is flirted with the deepest racist the Nazis and it is not gone unnoticed the least of all by them\nBlaming the president now not only is Trump historically since forty eight the most supportive president of Israel and the Jewish community\nThe monster that committed this evil atrocity in the synagogue a happen to have Trump why because Trump is so close with our friends and allies of Israel\nAnd Bowers posting online is hatred in contempt for Trump because of its support for Israel but yet the mainstream media coverage that doesn't matter at one you know CNN and\n... you know GQ correspondent saying that the president is worse than ISIS I think you know that's\nOne of the things that have really launched his presidential run out of

continue with former congressman now\nGubernatorial candidates the all important state of Florida around the Santa's going up against radical leftist party supporter Andrew Gillum just as a way of background you did go to Harvard how many years did you serve the country\nI was active duty for five years in a U.S navy\nYou know I'm you know I I look at Florida they had a little bit of a red tide problem is that something that happens sickle ugly over long periods of time occasionally\n... natural I think the issue we've had a lake Okeechobee the Army Corps of engineers discharges feminist polluted water into the rivers and so I went to the river goes into the area where you where you live in southwest Florida and\nI think what happened what some of those nutrients mixed with the red tide and exacerbated so we we got it bad southwest Florida got really really bad\nSo I'm committed to making sure that we're batting that stopping the discharges gun in order to do that you gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnership I'll be able to do that you'll I'm wants to impeach track so I don't know how the hell is going to be able to work with him on any of that so I think any of those problems we have ...\nWhat I understand it's gotten a lot better sense of it so I guess it in the early part of the spring and summer this year a lot of it's gone away right\nIt's just I mean quite frankly Michael watched I'm a bad um you know out and so it's not as bad as it was for sure but it really yeah there was a two month stretch there in southwest Florida where\nPeople were just getting hammered it was in that sense that we're fish kill it hurt our economy and tourism so are we need to do whatever we can get a lot of it is your fault you know the federal government are discharging you know all this water into the river\nA round the Santa is running for governor the great state of Florida Rick Scott running for senator down there a it is one of the most important states has Florida always is I'm a forty percent business tax by Andrew Gillum would be a disaster economically put Florida\nI Hope people are waking up to that fact um and you are you how you're in the middle of early voting now and absentee voting obviously goes on and a one week from today we'll find out hopefully that you're the next governor of Florida\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a hot sauce it's like New York city because that's what's happening in my district of New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nThat's not something I Want it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nDo you think the ... what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads\nWhat was in the bottom line is throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people to use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you under decided disadvantaged now I kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want as freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races are obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\n[laughter] why I think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republican for very long time and uh we're going to win the seat\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now when people are just so upset\nI think people get up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean that you're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their at their bills and there are other male [noise] um and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox we'll be right\nNow we have enough money yourself to fight back on who you are\nYou know we're putting on our message we're putting on a message on what I've done and how we accomplished thanks for this district and people like that so that's that's what we're gonna continue to do and\nHow do you have these other races Duncan Hunter Rohrabacher ISIS old seat the other you know Southern California districts that targeting how do you feel about those six because that could be the tipping point one week from today\nWell I tell people all the time you know Southern California is a\nIs a hot spot right now and it's it's because uh you know the two people that are looking to be speaker on in the next session are from California and uh so they're looking at the seats but I I actually think we're going to do well I really do I think maybe showing well I think a Danish doing well [noise] um it's it's going to come down to be\nCandidate though that's going to have to pull it through for themselves\nA lot of money is coming in and there's been a lot of help and I appreciate all the help\nBut the candidates really got to pull it through\nAll right well we wish all the best in your race a Congressman Steve night again if you're in Southern California if you're in the\nUh it you know seamy valley area if you're in the Fresno area the Bakersfield area you know we've been out there are a number of times those are all important seats and uh that could tip the balance of power in DC and that's why all that money is being flooded into their\nAh anyway we'll watch all race very closely or Steve night California's twenty fifth district thanks for being with us\nThanks Sean appreciate it\nLet's get to our busy phones eight hundred nine four one Sean our number you want to be a part of the program right Andrew is in Albany New York WG why Andrew Hi how are you in by the way Albany is like a ... onto its own in terms of\nEvery single high powered Albany politician or every friend of theirs ends up getting indicted I've never seen anything like it in my life\nSo corrupt on each side so corrupt these polls\nAnd I'm One of the times website there live calling I don't think that it ... I think that it's based on who's you know answering the phone don't want to Pennsylvania one on the computer right now don't on in a district for national just there\nWas no one answer is no one else all skewed towards dunk close to Philadelphia I put the Africans I\nI'm not sure exactly what you say explain that again you think the ... or an accurate I agree okay\nAnd I think it's just based on results 'cause a lot of the district for the first uh most of the Republican vote so it was in the northern such such right\nOn the border with New York right\nRight I Want to answer the phone up there it was all students towards the bottom what's Philadelphia\nThat's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and you know look everywhere here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live I\nWe are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota raises California races\nBut the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection well we need a majority it doesn't have to be a big majority but if you can win the majority and pick up the Senate seats I think we can pick up hold the Senate seats that need to be held\nThen it could be a very good night one week from now\nBut I Am telling everybody gets in my opinion right now Republicans a plus three for the Senate they add three senators but I also would say that in the house I'd say it's probably on paper looking at poll paper and I'm hesitant to say this but\nJust analyzing the races analyzing all of the new candidates you know forty five retirements in his time\nUm I Would say it's ... it's it's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with the positives because right now the Democrats have two hundred and five locked in races for the house the Republicans two hundred and now the problem is the toss ups are almost all Republicans so you're going to have to run the table on those\nWe put all that information the most important the top thirty that we picked then identified it's easily you know you can find a ...\nFight it's easily you know you can find that easily at ... dot com\nYeah so I don't know I'm looking at it I made a like a toss up right now Michael shit I'm up in a toss up then I I have it with a toss up on three looking one way to put a lot of those seats Shawn\nYeah look let me give me one anecdotal piece of evidence we know one twenty sixteen that the exit polls show and all the polls leading up to the election showed Donald Trump wasn't gonna win\nAnd the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and it said he lost everything Florida North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin gone and the same thing happened to two thousand for five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen or in a midterm if we go back remember twenty fourteen\nIt was for cast as a close Senate race but the GOP one nine Senate seats\nI mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize\nThat if you don't want Nancy Pelosi speaker if you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do in your power at the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house that's the best case scenario one is a split decision they gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker the worst case scenario it Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen\nRight now the they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends whether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment\nWe're going to they're rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats are we going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like\nYou're the same people that ruin the health care system with three big allies keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats vote for ... polo see any Democratic Senate vote as a boat for humor\nThat we should have a pretty good night a week from now\nBut the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide\nAnyway um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program we're going to get a little

I'm all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nAnd they were in they reside knows a make or enforce the law so now according to the historic perspective here um eat and what the line is subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nIn the congressional record 'em ... it is according to the members of Congress of the time the this applies to people with diplomatic immunity ambassadors and whatnot because they weren't subject to the jurisdiction there up\nThe ... the common ... with the common law understanding from Britain is that if you were born in the British Empire you were subject to the jurisdiction of the British Empire\nSo the only application ... exception there was if you were in a basket or\nAnd you were in a bastard a Great Britain or in the British and wire and they were all amply was ... you had a child born a while you were there and\nThen ... I mean witness stand and so what you're saying then at the Vikings came over and set but on the guy on um you know there are a baby as babies you know he did go I mean you know an invading theloop\nWe have on the way here it's kinda scary\nWell [noise] ... they're not coming armed um yeah that that that's ... that that helps tremendously ah\nThey were reporting today that this latest group is on I heard that I have yet to\nAn al ... they're not now there there is a small group at the border between Guatemala and Mexico a\nThat is having issues and they're not able to get into Mexico and is there not able to get into Mexico they can't make it here they have sealed those people out I was a smaller group they were violent\nOr they are in no way shape or form getting here or is the large group do they are not armed I have seen media reports on some of the fringe websites of their arm but they're not um even Fox has gone down and check them out there not a\nArmed thankfully and and I don't know that they're going to be able to cross the border anyway with the president sending troops to the border now\nFive thousand two hundred let's see if we take time out and go check with a\nVibe you buddy of mine forty three now that you asked me if you're on the other end and all of a bomb but I'll do it if I might have been out over an hour to drive ... nobody around I Won the exit wrestling is\nAbout an hour of thirty five hundred or get around you know we just have a spring on the west could act Cooper lake wrote a clear but it can't have\nThank you very much um so let's bring down this amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there off\nWhat does that mean according to the people who wrote the fourteenth amendment this subject to the jurisdiction thereof part referred to everyone except those with ... by then it was already an established will settle principle diplomatic immunity\nSo if you're born here and you are not part of diplomatic staff of another country you are presumed to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nThat's the way it has historically been read\nAnd in if you read it that way and that's what the people who wrote it seemed to suggest it means then if you're born in this country you become an American citizen the only exception bean if you are born and your parents are in the diplomatic corps of another country\nSo all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states end of the state where they reside so in other words if you're born here\nYou become a citizen of the United states and the state where you live\nNow historically this was designed to undo Dred Scott it was designed to apply the slaves\nBut what Dred Scott did was it got rid of the English common law understanding of if you're born on our land you become one of us here's the problem there are two problems one is listen I I'm not wedded to the idea\nOne is listen I Am not wedded to the idea of birthright citizenship but I'm vehemently opposed to the idea that the president of the United states can undo it with executive order none of you should want that power after eight years of seeing what Brock Obama did with executive orders you should not want any president to have that power\nIs this isn't about Donald Trump this is about the president's see the president of the United states whoever that person is should not have the power to change a historic understanding through an executive order this should be an act of Congress in fact\nThe amendment in section for says Congress shall have their uses section two or three of the amendment um is this Congress is going to have the power to do with this not the president\nSo I don't think any president should have the power to do with President Trump propose but there's another problem is the problem the continental Europe pass the ghettos\nContinental Europe right now France Germany or in several other countries in in your ... they don't have birthright citizenship\nSo what you have is a class of second tier resident in countries who have no political power and so they begin to agitate listen no president in this country including Donald Trump has rounded up all the illegal aliens in them home\nThey're not going to do the Donald Trump is not going to actually do that he hasn't done it he said two years with a complete Republican controlled Congress and he still has a rather them all up it's not going to happen\nAnd so what's going to happen now is this class of people's gonna grow and what central Europe has found in the last hundred years two hundred years of this is that these are people who have no emotional investment in that country Germany and the Turks is is a good example or or France and in Islam populations\nThose groups have no emotional investment in the country because they are not citizens but they're they're it's home to them they're not leaving\nWe don't want this to happen in this country and even some of the most diehard immigration restriction lives in this country like Mark Krikorian\nAre really opposed to getting rid of birthright citizenship because of this because of the second class person we would create in this country\nIn this country and in the British Empire if you're born here suddenly you become a citizen and so you're invested in the welfare of the country as a whole as well as you're on welfare\nAnd so you have an emotional stake in the country in central Europe ... during the Republicans don't and it's reflected in what happens in those countries we've got to be real careful about this\nEvening news very very\nNews militias accurate that'd be a federal five day
