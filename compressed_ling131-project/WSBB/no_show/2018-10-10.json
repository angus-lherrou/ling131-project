for Joe and people like yourself is it's successful is ... ... what a lot of people feel which has boy I guess everybody gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think\nIt was astonishing that Donald Trump\n... with the help of the Democrats have been made or something that should have played very strongly and the Democrats hands and it's something that is going to on ballots help Republicans especially\nSomething that is going to on balance help Republicans especially running for the Senate because five painting it as a notion of mobs of people who try to destroy us and I say I'm a somehow enough he changed the narrative\nSo ah so smart Walter Isaacson a very an extraordinary story and to do at the Benjamin Franklin you might know did was ask personally by Steve Jobs to do his biography will while he was still alive and to be as brutal as you want to be\nBut uh the the he's analyzing this is as a way in which he's not taking sides used to run CNN by the way so he's not taking sides you know where he stands he's probably outraged by dropping can recoil by the notion of him being president I imagine but\nFor him to say that it's just that's called accurate analysis accurate analysis and why the guy we spoke about yesterday Michael ... cut sixteen\nRight under Donald Trump's hands off and on the way Michael Gerson writes about it that way understandably a passionate Democrats self had to show the same fashion that from a public and half but they play then says the hands of those who thought this was a mob rule\nAnd that people want listening to both sides and it was a shame that the Democrats in my opinion so overplay their hand because up until then whichever way the vote when it was going to help the Democrats\nNow if the Democrats lose the mid term elections I think the Democratic politicians in ... that\nReally ought to go into another line of work or not you know you can't win them it turns out to get a different type of job\nBut let me just tell you the big story in the Democratic side is who's paying all these protesters one thing is to be outraged the other one is doing it as a job so you go there and you have a strategy of how to head off a senator you have a strategy about how to interrupt a dinner you have a strategy about how to get on camera and they're all getting paid\nThey're all getting paid and yeah it does take away the authenticity if you're protesting something I think you should be there I don't think it should be a profit oriented adventure deal\nI mean maybe for the travel agent if they want to build in some travel incentives for hotel and buses but once you get the air you should be sacrificing something not earning something go get a regular job in protest during your free time\nYou being paid for a point of view by other people who have a lot of money and they want you to go ahead and do the legwork unbelievable\nBut that's what we're seeing any of these a hundred percent right the guy that I Am so glad is lost the prestige Anglo is Michael ...\nAnd his sweat next person who came forward and said\nYou know that a judge Kavanaugh then Brett Kavanaugh was out there might have been spiking the punch by never saw him might have been involved with groups expos never there might have been part of my sexual assault but I don't remember really those are the allegations Michael ... brought forward and almost everybody to a person said that\nHis allegations were so out of left field and unsubstantiated it ruined the entire cause it made Ford seem less credible and Ramirez as you know the freshman at Yale could not remember originally what happened\nTook care of herself a week Democrats crawling over campus trying to find somebody that saw something about something that Kavanaugh did\nAnd the New York times that I can write this the New Yorkers to love to write this [noise]\nSo that's what he's talking about they have thoroughly overplay their hand them for the most part the president at two events that you like to take back all of us and I my mind should take back over the last twenty days besides that\nHe's been perfect he's been perfect and we'll see if it translates because we know that George Bush could not bring along anybody in his mid term elections and we know that you're up rock Obama had the worst mid term elections of any modern president gradually he lost his party almost everything\nAnd now this president says oh yeah I'm going out now they told I think it was Joe Lockhart a will say no excuse me George Stephanopoulos\nSo that you know when Bill Clinton won the presidency you want to make sure the wind is Margie prevent big losses in the mid term so we went out and they checked oppose after he started helping out congressmen and women and they went down and almost everywhere he appeared to he stayed home\nThis is another thing different about President Trump\nThe approval rating might be forty one percent but when he goes out the crates momentum excitement he gets big crowds and they're always they're always going crazy and then he creates new soundbites and other people run maybe Britain disdain because of the things he said well maybe it was a news were newsworthy because of who showed up\nSo this guy is different in every way and by the way he is taking on the number one enemy of America China in every way he's stopping them in South America he's challenging them in Africa he's going ahead and plus preventing them from dominating the south China Sea by making land masses out of the ocean\nThat he was going to redistribute wealth and give people more or something and make it free and there are folks that tend to believe that that is never been a successful economic model anywhere in the world and that's what a socialist or economic model\nIs and that's what we have to try to educate these voters are to include what we see with these threats coercion intimidation of the violence emanating from the progressive social is left of it\nThe vinyl is emitted from the progressive socialist left\nToday so what's at stake I mean right now there's a seven point difference in the generic ballot or in between the Republicans and Democrats were not voting for people how do you feel about the party seven points is doable for the party in power doesn't\nMean it's an obtainable board asked what do you expect to happen in the next four weeks\nI think in the next four weeks there has to be a clear delineation about uh the path that the United states of America is on right now would you look at all of our economic success in the past that an opposition party wants to take it towards and again just look at the images of people climbing on statues\nThere at the Supreme Court banned in all the walls\nIs this what we're really what do we really want to move away from the rule of law towards a rule of law and that's that's really the the question we have to ask ourselves all you have people like Tom ... leadership for the Democratic party that are not denounce in this day are truly encouraging or other that's not what we want to be an American\nI didn't think so so we're we're at right now Greg Valerie he's a a political columnist talked about what this whole cabinet or confirmation battle has done cut thirty two\nBullets ... this morning I think that the Republicans have a file as your sorrows and Maxine Waters and Michael ... not that they're in the entire Democratic Party but they do have a foil and\nI think that in ... purple districts where the Republican base was kind of indifferent fair motivated now so it makes a difference but today is what October knife who knows what's gonna happen between now and election day there can be more wild cards\nThere could be and you see that now all of a sudden CNN is reaching for some type of twenty sixteen issue Israelis might help Rick Gates with some type of negative or ... or negative ads against Ted Cruz in the primary\nSo you know they're going to reach the mother when Kavanaugh failed it's almost as if the darkest rated as it they have a a hundred stories in their quiver and they decide when to release the time or the time bomb\nWithout a doubt they have a strategic war room as you are right they'll look at at this at each and every way that they possibly can if this uh avenue of approach fails and we'd go to the course of action number see or plan B or plant F\nA and this is what we're up against we're up against people that are seeking to obtain power and control at dominance in the United states of America is an ideological dominance instead of sitting back and say you know look\nMore Americans at work at an ever before our our stock markets are doing well for all the cage door where foreign policy look at what we just did was ready to go ... this trade trade deals our military is being a you know restrict the world a good path\nDo for them is about obtaining power and getting back control and and why do they want that control because they want to take us this country on a different path\nSo a couple of things when you see Mike Pompeo in the foreign minister of China allow public ... what is colonel Allen West thing somebody was station nearby and Korea\n[laughter] I think is very important that we let the Chinese know that we're not going to accept the status quo and then we let them know that the theft of our intellectual property and the you know forcing a technology transfers or it's not going to happen anymore and we're going to close the uh the the\nThe circle around them we're gonna have better trade negotiations and deals with\nOthers and if they don't want to be a part\nOf the civilized society if they want to continue down their past that they have chosen as a communist country or they're not going to be welcome and we're not going to ... this is no longer the Obama foreign policy of strategic patience remember\nHow President Obama left off his last visit to China\nThe American media was stuck into one small room away from the event and he has praised the United states was forced to leave leave off the cargo entrance and enter a and enter the event ah I mean you know and into the event and then of course me the leader of China\nThat is humiliating I mean they would not open the door they would not line up the stairs so he had to go out to the emergency exit so this president said okay I'll get to know you will try it you're not moving your not budging you're still a problem so we'll battle it out everywhere I think it's so genius that we're going to India\nAnd it was saying how can we help you how can we work together\nWell absolutely so because one of the things is now the Chinese Pakistan economic corridor that they're trying to establish China is building a poor facility in Pakistan so I think that it is important that we go to other allies like you say ... to say that you know we're going to check you and we'll go to check you\nMake a colonel congratulations your book drops tomorrow go pre order now hold Texas hold the nation victory or death talked about the history of taxes what it means to the country or their ...\nAnd they wasn't too long ago where they were a democratic state LBJ remember took tax absolutely what happened then what happened now and what's about to happen again colonel Allen West thanks so much\nIt happened now on what's about to happen again colonel Allen West thanks so much\nLike so much broad you take care\nYou got it we come back it's your turn one eight six six for all eight seven

so\nShe has told the president now the cabin or things going I'm sure that's not the timing is not a coincidence Kevin O's done she came to see the president the oval office today they had a press conference Fifteen minutes after leaked the story was broken on\nA bike Jonathan Swan on ... and then he hopped on radio with us she heard it here first now she's explaining it why she's leading the way she's leading and the accomplishment and what they have achieved at the un and it's no worthy\nI don't know the figure that Democrats have not criticized\nAnd the Trump team\nIs ... is the only one is the only one new one boxer SNL doesn't make fun of her or nobody looks at her policies in her speeches as something manufactured comes from the heart the relationship has and had with the

three\nNow with a big things you need you know through the power of three\nBrian's big numbers hurry\nKavanaugh fight has certainly are thrown around share into the political landscape seems to be really helping Republicans the base has been activated in those states we've seen that bear out in the numbers in North Dakota for example Heidi Heitkamp as we've seen a bear out in Tennessee\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp is toast I think although I evidently Kamala Harris is raised born and fifty thousand dollars for like nine seconds are here we go one month to the twenty Eighteen midterms as going to be a sprint for the Senate and house I'd have to save both are in play\nThe number this has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so if he is on the Supreme Court\nAnd the Senate has investigated than I than the house will have to\nAh do you go a representative Jerry ... from New York\nSaying that if he is chairman of the ... in the house side they'll investigate Brett Kavanaugh\nAre you kidding me can anyone see the big picture here the president if he wants to talk about two victories in to see to the Supreme Court all Gulf War but if he wants to talk about hope and all the things that might de legitimize the Supreme Court and polarized as I say Mr President please don't [noise] number one that\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared and\nNo one can read even after the on the way we're not done working with him on the middle east peace of mind if I'm not going to find and they do a lot of things\nI Wish more people come down because we're not our country and administration\nSo that's interesting Jared ... again you have brought us so we just when you were fading away does that mean in the beginning Kelly was pushing them back but now they've stepped forward but they don't want the credit is an interesting they don't have to credit\nJared Kushner or does a lot of things I mean the the Mexico when she mentioned NAFTA I think it was primarily his he's been in Mexico a number of times talking to the current president and the new president the old and the new\nUh he's had a very big hand in that uh the Mid East or I think he clearly had a big hand moving the embassy or we haven't seen the peace plan that the Trump or people have been working on I think it's clear that\nThey're trying to line up a lot of Arab support before they present it to the Palestinians and try to make the Arabs push the Palestinians to agree to it I think that's been the hold up but yes look I think you know Brian you and I talk about the ... we we we you know constant media coverage\nPresident Trump is accomplishing many many things that you can it it's almost like pieces of a puzzle fit in together\nYou can it it's almost like pieces of a puzzle fitting together\nYou can see these things taking shape it takes longer it doesn't always go smoothly and sometimes the noise obscures the picture that is developing\nBut you see with these trade deals you know I was talking to somebody the other day or something like forty or fifty thousand new coal mining jobs since the president took office that's a number ever at\nA think of that forty or fifty thousand families with children their father or their mother or as working again they're having in common to the family there's hope about it even as someone said to me one of those jobs can last I don't know what job can live\nWith the artificial intelligence\nDon't worry about it I mean\nThis is an enormous good thing for people how can that not be celebrated\nI agree

a great loss it'd be difficult to find someone to fill fill that ... to do as good a job as she has done I'm sure that John Bolton would be prepared to take maybe or he would provide the necessary input\nTo the president as far as recommending somewhat but that happens it very quickly after she leaves are they shut somebody you're a Jew a Jew or a good position\nYeah I mean you've got a few weeks a you know you have a few weeks you get everything is going to cool down for a while you know some people are speculating there is a story about flight back and forth to South Carolina I don't think there's a chance of that but it just goes to show you the scrutiny of these cabinet members run by the way this did that should not surprise you\nDespite the economic boom that we're living in right and the relatively piece that we're experiencing outside Afghanistan American the American people are experiencing Trump coverage that is Ninety two percent negative Ninety two percent negative how amazing is that\nCountry with the full support of the administration and she's not only had a good relationship with the president but also the vice president secretary palm pilot is a very sharp contrast to her relationship with the president to what was rex Tillerson's relationship with the president and so\nYou know as you go forward what she said was she went into the un every day with body armor on\nBecause she has to be ready for that fight fighting for America first putting our values and our agenda at the forefront of the UN which is the job of the un in ... and she's done a phenomenal job\nBut I have to think that in and out every day that weighs on somebody trying to move things in your direction regardless of if you're the most powerful nation in the world it is a fight it is a battle every day and she has done a phenomenal job in the last two years representing our country to the un\nSo I'm just asking you to get your take on the brake cabinet struggle to get his confirmation through and to see how the president has managed by sitting back through most of it\nAre really gain an advantage you remember the number one story in America was about Paul Manafort cutting a deal and about Rick Gates testifying against him and now we you know Papadopoulos a gets his sentence influence coming up in December and everything looks so grim\nAnd now that is a lifetime ago because now everybody's talking about cabinet\nAnd Brian you know this the ... the news cycle move so quickly so fast this president's accomplishing so many things people can't keep up the fight with Brett Kavanaugh lasted\nTwo to three weeks and what we're going to know in two to three weeks from now is that people say boy that seemed like forever ago but what this fight has done I mean this is unified the Republican Party from the establishment wing\nTo the to the outskirts and everywhere in between that they're unified because now they see the playbook of the Democrats what the Democrats are talking about is not only if they take over the house will they impeach the president of the United states or attempt to they will trying to teach\nHouse will they impeach the president of the United states or attempt to they were trying to teach justice Kavanaugh now this is what's on their agenda and the Republicans are waking up to ... election for weeks from today realizing exactly what is at stake I think\nThey were a bit complacent there were so happy with the three point seven percent unemployment rate and the economy doing so well in our national security homeland security all doing better than it's ever done and so they were complacent and now they see\nIt as a reminder of what these what the Democrats want to do which is not just impeach Donald Trump and remove him from office but now they're talking about potentially impeaching justice Kavanaugh for nothing and this is not motivated the Republicans and we've got four weeks ago early voting starts\nA very very soon and there was some key battleground states where this president is on the road reminding people to success tonight you'll be in Iowa\nOkay I Want you to hear how this whole thing played out ... and he used to run CNN a big town biographer of Steve Jobs Benjamin Franklin major projects this is how he sees this thing out of the president played a cut sixteen\n[noise] that's what President Trump does he turns the pep rallies and turns them into reality shows and that's what he knows how to produce the problem though for Joe and\nPeople like yourself is is successful here somehow articulated what a lot of people feel which is boy I guess everybody to gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think it was a time and sharing that Donald Trump\nAlmost with the help of the Democrats had been made a made something that should have played very strongly and the Democrats hands and it's something that is going to on balance help Republicans especially running for the Senate because by painting it as a notion of mobs of people who try to destroy those nice man\nUh somehow or another he changed the narrative\n[noise] and I think that some students houses and I'd probably paying bills rice who seemed to say that\nBrian he's absolutely right and what this president did is he allowed the Democrats to overplay their hand\nYou've seen the footage many times on Fox News bang on the doors of the Supreme Court to sit in the hundreds of people\nAt a time being arrested at the Capitol the screaming during the confirmation process look Republicans don't do that whether you want it you know can't get on the court or you want it whoever it was you didn't see that with the conservative they let the process play out the Democrats\nAttack demand ... his reputation went after his family this is a man who in his spare time unbeknownst to anybody else for the last dozen years goes down and feed the homeless services the poor he doesn't do that so he thought someday could get them on to the bank she did it because that the character that he is\nAnd no one wants to talk about that and everything that they threw at him he returned fire and I mean that in a positive sense when he made a very impassioned statement his opening remark on a second confirmation process at at that second hearing but what was most stunning to me of everything that judge Kavanaugh said\nWas that his ten year old daughter\nSaid dad we need to pray for this woman who said these things and we need to make sure that we're praying for her that that type of value that he has distilled on his children and that talks about the character of the man and I think the turning point in his confirmation process\nIs when Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said you know what this is not right and he made such\nA moving argument between him and senator Collins and ultimately Mitch McConnell lose three individuals helped to change the public opinion of what Brett Kavanaugh did and the fight that Donald Trump put behind him because I Believe Brian\nNot any other president if it wasn't Donald Trump would have stood behind that nominee in the way that he did and far from the way he did and Donald Trump has proven to be successful because of ...\nYears with the president said to judge Kavanaugh his daughters cuts six\nMargaret analyze your father was a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens and now\nFrom the bench of our nation's highest court your father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms of all Americans\nThat you right back at the kids you must have heard some of the negativity the horrible allegation from Michael I've been out of you know there's and I thought that was a great part of the speech\nHe'll Brian I I've seen this in my own life where I was attacked mercilessly during the campaign and my children are old enough to watch the news and go on the Internet and see what happens and I remember then candidate Trump and ultimately President Trump calling\nMy kids and you're saying your dad is doing great work and that goes so far you know and and saying nice things about me and it wasn't just me he's done it so many times to other people because he knows that the media attacks individuals who are associated with Trump innate\nTax individuals who are associated with Trump in a different manner then if they weren't and we've seen the double standard time and time again and we've seen it with media reporters who say one thing if they're liberals and get away with it and if they're conservative they are chastised till the end of the earth we saw just this week with a CNN reporter\nWho use some disgusting language on Twitter and all of a sudden all of those people on the left to fend her use of that language and say well it was a a childish mistake but at the same one to chastise Brett Kavanaugh for drinking beer when he was in high school thirty five years ago the double standard is out of control and the American people are tired of it\nRight Leslie What do you think of a idiot and we're just chances in New Hampshire in the first district you know New Hampshire well a he's a navy veteran graduate the FBI National Academy in Quantico former chief of police of the town of Southampton what chances does he have\nAny has a shot and New Hampshire and it's one of the few seats that the Republicans are actually on the fence so most of the places where the Republicans are running where on the defense because

Facebook\nA I'm not I I don't know if it's I mean it's it's a I guess you could I don't know you could maybe argue that it's because it's not unusual for people particularly within the White House to hold it for a specific amount of time and then move on and so there's like a\nKind of a lifespan to how much people can take it as a stressful job I thought she but I thought she did such a great job\nI'm as the UN ambassador though so\nShe apparently she had resigned that position last week but it was you know made official and public this week I don't know if he is\nGoing to he said it would be like a week or two weeks before he would appoint someone else\nTo her a to her seat one of the um I Love looking at the speculation though\nOne of the things that that a lot of some of the speculation that there's a ton of different rumors out there and again not as a bit of it is verified but it's fun to entertain a summer speculating well maybe it's because Sessions is leaving after midterms Graham is going to replace him and then Haley is going to run for Graham Senate the\nThat's why to exchange of chairs\nI don't know I kinda like Graham in the center right now so I mean Nikki Haley would be great as well but\nUh and coming up John mayor wants to create a new mail contract regarding masculinity I have your pop culture round up including Taylor Swift finally vows to the mob

Bernie Sanders her own party didn't want her\nSo why I'm you know I'm just how I just think that's stupid to say and it's really ... exaggerate isn't the right word it's hyperbole of the worst kind\nShe simply saying that the existence of another opinion is threatening to her she finds that threatening the existence of a different belief she finds that threatening\nWell I'm not sure I'm comfortable with anyone like that in elected office because the United states has made up of a multitude of different beliefs and thoughts\nAnd in order to dehumanize your opposition you wrongfully test them as people who are oppressing you and destroying your the things in which you believe in simply because they win elections and they exist\nThat's\nHow I interpret her statement running it through several filters that's how I see it [noise] so I I just um I I don't think that that helps and she's sitting here saying well\nWe can't have civility until so what she's saying is that so long as people disagree with you can't be civil she's telling people to not be civil\nThat remember how mad people got at me when I did a show promo and I used in our glass to know when the show would start and how everyone including the New York times and Clinton surrogates screech from the rafters oh my gosh it's so violent\nHere she's telling people to stop being civil with other individuals simply because they think differently from them and yet that's not a call the violence Maxine Waters isn't a call the violence I mean if you really want to have that conversation\nI just think that's incredibly irresponsible you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nShe's\nEverything that she everything that she does and everything and what she believes it's completely manufactured because see she says this and she cops this attitude after the fact Hillary Clinton is always a day late in the dollar short\nI mean days late like months days late but\nLate last month days late but now now she's ... I just find this fascinating\nI mean it's just it's just manufactured in Seoul is you can't be civil with people well your party has already stopped being civil\nThey've been doing that ... that's that's been happening for a long time I I I Do think it's it's really\nFunny that she's saying she's looking at what her party's doing and she's trying to speak to them in a way to still remain relevant because the base of the Democratic party they believe in these tactics as a way to campaign they believe in these tactics as a way to\nUm to to\nTry to when when they lose at the ballot box [noise] let me share with you this headline\nThis is from Robert Costa of the Washington Post I find it really funny it says an angry mob Republicans work to recast democratic protests as out of control anarchy\nSo this column in order to be honest would have to ignore all of the antifa violence and all of the other progressive protests and all of the stuff from this weekend they would have to do all of that\nUm Republicans don't have to work to recast Democrat protests as anything I've you know I think burning buildings and punching people in the face and doing all of that stuff um they do a good enough job of that they're by themselves\nThey do have they do a good enough job of that all by themselves\n\nAnd they work and like for instance with the cabinet situation I have seen and this is the left is really stepped up their attempt to try to dehumanize people with whom they disagree\nI've seen them tried to cast the cast Kavanaugh and and everything else as well he's you know he is a uh he's guilty as he's a rapist he has this they're making statements about him that have been no proof there's more proof of big foot then there is that the any of these accusations are true\nThere's more proof that the abominable snowman exist and there are that any of these accusations are true there is more prove hell and global warming than there is that any of these accusations are true\n\nThere's more proof of the last man than there is that any of these accusations are true more proof of Santa more proof of the tooth fairy and more proof of the Easter Bunny than there are any accusation then they're then there is any proof that these accusations are true\nBottom line but it hasn't stopped the left from still trying to\nCast you want to talk about working to cast their working to cast\nThe now justice and trying to they they they went up in the Supreme Court now and that's not me just saying is I was looking at Lawrence O'Donnell they want to be Shakespeare MSNBC who was saying well this you know we really are going to have to [noise] uh we're gonna you know we have to rethink\nYou know talking about the Supreme Court and and and maybe uh maybe you know in the number of senators you know maybe we shouldn't have just X amount of senators et cetera so see this is this is there\nThis is their standard if you lose an election the Democrats lose an election it's not then and it's not their candidates and it's not their messaging\nIt's the electoral college we have to up and it if they lose a Supreme Court nomination it's not the fact that they're out there ambushing people in restaurants or or ambushing them at their homes are screaming at them and the airport it's the Senate that's the problem\nThis is why they don't win because they don't get it\nThey don't\nRepublicans don't have to work to cast them as anything they've they've done that themselves they have done it themselves and now I'm looking at polling\nAnd it is well it's not going good for them they may have hurt themselves in terms of being able to try to flip the house I looked at these points I mean literally and Huffington Post they have twelve self care tips if you're struggling to deal with everything today\nPractice deep breathing recognize your emotions and allow yourself to feel them take a social media breather limit your news consumption empower yourself through action call your mom recognize the potential for positive change\nDon't be afraid to ask for help find a healthy distraction I mean goes on and on and on and on\n\nBut in terms of polling though all of this again Republicans didn't have to do it\nAll of this again Republicans didn't have to do it\nAll of it is it's all just they did it themselves they did it themselves\nNow Taylor Swift I Know\nI think she finally about to the mob and decided well if I'm going to come out I'm just going to do it with with explosively so she says I cannot vote for someone who won't fight for dignity for all Americans\nShe said that she's going to vote for Democrats in November and she's specifically focusing on her home state of Tennessee in which you have a Marsha Blackburn who was running\nAnd uh she wants to oppose Senate candidate black when she says over her voting over her record on women's rights and a ... T right\nThat's what she says she says she opposes her because she voted against gay rights as she votes against the women's rights some how I don't know how she votes against women's rights but okay\nShe ... she goes she talks about them how she's going to vote in Tennessee uh she goes I Believe\nIn the fight for algae be tiki writes in any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong or she says it cannot support Marsha Blackburn her voting record in Congress the Paulson terrifies me she voted against equal pay for women she believes you know talking about businesses have the right to do what they want to do she goes I'm going to be voting for ... for Senate\nDoes anyone want until Taylor Swift that sold resident voted against same sex marriage\nUps look what you made me do look what you made me do [noise]\nHe voted against same sex marriage oh by the way he supported Cavanaugh I don't know if anybody like informed or of this before she decided to rip off of Twitter\nEverything I say yeah so I I think that's hysterical so she ends up she's tried everything that she says about Blackburn the reasons that she's saying why she's not going to vote for ... are the reasons why she's the president literally shares the same views that okay but now blackbirds ahead of him\nShe's opening it up\nThere's a I have a new pulling hair she's I'm really opening up the uh uh I think what is like a she's up in up an eight point lead now\nAnd they kick you off it's called road rage\nThey're Mandy over paid on a used car because they didn't go to ...\nDot com [noise] car facts has a better way\nWhen you search used cars and car facts dot com you get the most accurate price based on the car next report and so you never had to overpay on a used car again and start your used car search today at ... dot com\nBubble you asked me about ... er Cox media group station [noise]\nTwenty four hour news weather and traffic\nFive and a um seven fifty\nAsked me to you\nKnow [noise] good morning\nIt's four o'clock I'm Mark ... from the Donald us read twenty four hour news center\nA category one hurricane Tuesday Morning Michael is exploded\nInto a category for store window one hundred thirty miles an hour it's taking aim at the Florida Panhandle of fast moving storm of governor Rick Scott says the forecast is for a storm surge of eight to twelve feet\nWater will can laws ensure an easy ride over the Russell houses so you're not going to survive storm surge if you're in the in the middle of a storm surge you're not going to survive president\nTrump declared a federal state of emergency in Florida across the state three hundred Seventy five thousand people are under mandatory or a voluntary evacuation orders\nCounty deputy walks up to this crowd on the beach and asked for identification he wants to know the names of their next of kin who should they called it their all killed by the storm but like you're a closer they won't leave you try to come back home on the cross the bridge so you're so Pete combs ABC News animosity Beach Florida and in New York\nRichard can't to ABC News rattled us ...

the danger obviously there's danger in the hurricane force winds but as the is it the storm surge that there are people who are really worried about right is that is that we're the big danger is going to come\nWith a wider danger certainly is still it's ripped from\nHurricane Michael is expected to be between nine and Thirteen now they're saying or the beat in parts of the Florida Panhandle mostly

this is talk on the issue here is like at the\nEnd so right you're talking about a storm surge that could almost in a day or a and when you talk about being on this little island this Panama City

something popping up in the tropics I just\nYou have to have two homes you have to have another home you can go to write in case of the if you live in Florida or something like that I don't care what it is it just has to be on high land and are not in Florida or on the coast\nThat's up to me don't move to Florida unless you have a hurricane home that's what I call them another home you can go to write in cases if you live in Florida or something like that I don't care what it is it just has to be on high land and are not in Florida or on the coast\nThat's up to me don't move to Florida unless you have a hurricane home that's what I call that I Would I Would fly to my hurricane home\nAnd for those that have already evacuated by the way that are on the road and maybe they don't have hotel

the way to stop off you got to let a motor speedway there I've tried and\nTried to offer them a deal it's like a ... started to like Clark Howard\nHere really there's no need for them to come into the midtown area and clog up your streets right that's what they're saying let's get to the truth and you're trying to act\nAs if you're trying to be so nice but in reality you don't want these refugee\nUh oh is that my pinky going up right in a little pretentious I think that you don't want the refugees I think you are looking to build a wall for him [laughter]\nAll right here's a story that we left on the table this is from ... why you're leaving all these polls and stories on the table this is not a poll or to enter a survey this is going up right in having a little pretentious I think that you don't want the refugees I think you are looking to build a wall forever [laughter]\nAll right here's a story that we left on the table I think this is from the leading all these polls and stories on the table this is not a poll or an or survey this is actually your segment here\nI don't know I understand that but I'm saying as you said was left on the table were leaving too many things on the table go ahead\nAll right Philadelphia Philadelphia football analyst says the eagles so that's the football team there\nSo it's not a Philadelphia Eagles eagles who won the super bowl last year okay yeah I don't remember that there's a\nCommentator his name is Gary ... he's saying that the team's doing so bad they should abstain from having sex\nPong and that will help them be better champion played better on the field does anybody know if that's actually a thing that's ever been a sea of ... seem to work I Know for years I Would always tell like boxers right forty eight hours before um are you ... your box you have a match\nAfter senior chi yeah you've got to retain your chi\nIs it okay to say that on a family shells hitting so the FCC going to get our ... air Rogers did the same thing too he would\nNot a really do that really is a friend at the time or money back then yeah Patrick now correct I don't know if it's\nCarried over or not but uh they would not do it on the Saturday prior to gay day\nBecause some athletes actually believe\nI really do that really is a friend at the time or money back then yeah Patrick now correct I don't know if it's\nCarried over or not but uh they would not do it on the Saturday prior to gay day\nBecause some athletes actually believe this is true now it seems to me in my mind I don't know but it seems to me it sounds like a a myth that sounds like\nA old wives' tale or we call an urban myth just something that's been passed along but\nI guess you could see where\nIn boxing anyway and in in in fighting and I guess football the same way very aggressive sport you don't want to be ... you want to be kind of angry right yes the idea you want to walk into the game or the or a boxing match angry and maybe the the idea there is well if you've been satisfied if you know what\nI mean yeah you lose your you lose your chi as it's now ... but maybe it's just you're more relaxed after yeah\nOK okay once again you're not a man and I don't know how do you think you're allowed to speak to these issues when you've not live the life of an issue with that show\nThat's [laughter] I Would say\nThat there is a a a loss of

I thought it looked great so wow man I lost\nLike thirty pounds at this is fantastic it feels great you know what I'm about to celebrate by eating yeah and you start\nOut with like wow I mean I've lost so much weight I Do my word yeah ... yeah exactly and but what you do is you break the habit\nThat got you to lose the weight and I think that the Philadelphia Eagles celebrating that first Super Bowl they they they forgot how to be hungry they broke the habit of what it takes to actually get back to another Super Bowl\nThat being said I'd still put 'em in the top four or five of being able to turn it around and go yeah there's plenty of time and uh so I say uh uh have all the sexual\nYou just got to remain hungry for the prize like you it sounds dirty but it wasn't\nDirty and all that good

Georgia get when sit near hurricane force\nFrom a storm that hit all the way down or close to ... miles or two hundred and fifty miles to the south west but the torn addict activity yeah make sure we cover for that eastern eastern Georgia eastern South Carolina eastern North Carolina\nAnd these tornados as as a storm winds down in the lower levels still very strong in the upper levels so what happens is that discrepancy creates these border see these ones and twos and so you get these higher costs with that and you have\nTornadoes it wouldn't be surprised if there are a couple of dozen tornadoes tonight into tomorrow in the area south and east and and so so the rainfall I'm Sorry I'm I'm you know just about misinformation out it's like there's so much coming in and I can't\nCan't get it out here are the rainfall three to six locally twelve inches off from uh where we are in Georgia as far in Georgia now but through South Carolina to North Carolina and a lot of that area that was devastated by war and other coastal areas\nProbably aren't going to get it as bad they are going to get pretty strong wind gust in there but this is just the inland until we get to Elizabeth City and you folks in tide water\nVery late tomorrow night and on friday morning you're going to get north winds coming in their sixty Seventy miles an hour right now in Chesapeake Bay\nBecause there's this reaches the coast\nAnd those same professional effects I'm Talking about overland diminish the storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay a male be coming in their sixty Seventy miles an hour right now in Chesapeake Bay because there's this reaches the coast\nAnd those same professional affects them talking about overland diminish the storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay a male be there'll be a nor'easter from a deep sea to to Boston\nTell me because I really what ... what are the areas that that may have tornado activity exactly so people can make ...\nSeveral hours I Believe they'll start putting that out of putting that out there if they haven't already I'm sure this tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into fought it\nYeah All right now I Want to just go through this very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is that pounded hard the the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast\nAnd as it moves north east is going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through a gun on\nA hundred mile a hundred two hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty to a hundred and\nNot making a ... he got a ... then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the the north east coast or to the Carolinas I guess through the tip Columbia through uh the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City two AM in the morning on friday and then about a hundred miles east of Norfolk in the morning or seven AM eight AM and then on out to sea and a glancing blow a\nA you know ... like a nor'easter for three to six maybe eight hours or New Jersey on in the southeast New England out of this and this is the last this is the last one short so you don't have to\nWorry you know it's the last one that fascinates me that you said it's the last one this isn't going to happen for the rest of the year\nWhile we knew back in September that we're going to have one come up out of the Caribbean because it's the overall patterns and I'll tell you what folks you ... and he says is two thousand and two all over again except slowly slowly which was the big hard for the rest of the year\nWhile we knew back in September that we're going to have one come up out of the Caribbean because it's the overall pattern and I'll tell you what folks you ... ... and he says his two thousand and two all over again except lonely\nLonely which was the big hurricane in the Gulf it a little bit earlier in Louisiana and October of ... we had all the warm weather in September and October\nThis is pointing the way believe it or not this is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big winter for much of the United states this year\nThere's certain types of patterns is set up so it it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm that will then establish it we may see something that tries to develop but stay or most likely stay offshore before it's all said and done but impacts dorms on the United states\nThis is the last one in my opinion\nJob to start a you're helping to save people's lives and uh you help every day you nailed this with the exact pinpoint perfection an accuracy which is so vital for the people that make proper decisions about whether to stay or go Oh thank you for being with us we really appreciate it will go back to you later Oh thank you for having me showing\nAll right eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program there is a really disturbing piece on the law and crime website it's Dan ... sister website the media I ate\nAnd ate chronicled the FBI Director who's testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by\nAny government intelligence agency\nNow you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not but that's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring\nNow the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump\nAnd during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember when he was first in office they were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible to ... the president's conversations with international leaders are you know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise response never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible to ... the president's conversations with international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database\nAnd raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to in this setting well then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... is a database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that well senator I'm quite confident that we are conducting ourselves in a manner of consistent with the law in the constitution a that's a subject to extend some oversight I don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations\nAnd then Rand Paul asked director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up by the intelligence communities vast spying apparatus simple\nTheir politics to work the concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant\nThe information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that had gathered with no bar there is no war it there's no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it on a domestic crime\nThat has been our complained for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I are there is no war it there is no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it on a domestic crime that has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought it was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ\nThat would literally be weaponized sing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people\nAnd I never in my lifetime thought that a political candidate him put together a flimsy dusty a\nWith Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer Warren application but not one for\nThe original application in three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified that corroborate it but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it bites wearing you know we'll get into this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "10"}
