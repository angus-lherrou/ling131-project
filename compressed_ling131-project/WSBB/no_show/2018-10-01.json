and I'm honored to welcome as our guest on the program today Fox News contributor the journalist the activists\nJuan Williams he has a new book out the book is called\nThe hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights it was just released this week September twenty fifth you may not know this but the year that one Williams was born when you're that the Supreme Court outlawed racially segregated schools in the landmark brown\nVersus board of education decision and as one William screw up he witnessed an incredible shift in American society as the movement took shape and activists succeeded in winning important advancement changes in the laws\nEverything from voting rights to equality in education to protection from discrimination and housing and employment\nSo it should come as no surprise that Mr Williams and we'll let him tell us this that he is a note I had said appalled will let him choose his words with the current administration intends to take them to task\nIn this new book Juan Williams welcome to perspective\nWhat a pleasure to be with you thank you are in a prospective thank you for having me on\nSo how old are your friends at the Fox news channel taking the release of your new book well\nHighly critical in some cases but ... you know I think this is typical of my relationship with my employer um they tend to agree to lean conservative and we have lots of strong pro Trump voices Sean Hannity for example at Fox and so for the most part they're\nPretty excited that I've written the book but they disagree with it but they don't shut me down which is you know for me I really appreciate that that they're willing to have the conversation or they're willing to even you know engage and not just have a conversation\nBut to tell me I'm wrong where they think I'm wrong and then I fired back and tell them where I think Berra\nSo everybody one Williams also writes for a number of newspapers and clean the Washington Post the New York times the wall Street Journal he's been published in many magazines including time\nAnd the Atlantic monthly he was a senior news analyst at NPR\nAh and of course he's an author\nHe wrote eyes on the prize America's civil rights years Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen sixty five a companion to the documentary series of the same name about the civil rights movement\nYou wrote Thurgood Marshall American revolutionary in two thousand which was a biography of the first African American to sit and serve on the Supreme Court of the United states\nAnd he also wrote something called enough back in two thousand six a book that was inspired by Bill Cosby speech at the end double ACP gala and deals with his critique of black leaders in America as he put it then\nThe culture of failure Juan Williams with what happened with Mr Cosby this week I Can't help but ask what is your reaction to the allegations that trial the conviction and now the sentencing of Bill Cosby three to ten years in prison\nYou know so I Know Bill Cosby he cooperated with me when I did that book\nWhich was based on what he called at the time has pound cake speech where he said you know a if a young kid is in some corner store and stealing pound cake why shouldn't the police arrested ... why is that kids deal in the pound cake in the first place I mean he was asking tough questions of the black community\nOn several levels you know why aren't we are out there protesting against the drug dealers why aren't we standing up and saying hey these schools need to be better so he ... it was all about kind of taking responsibility\nSo for me this week to hear Bill Cosby designated by the court as a sexual predator a violent sexual predator it was devastating to me on some level um\nIt just it's like you know somebody you looked up to somebody who was iconic sort of being the flavor right in front of your eyes as a phony mean there's no getting around that designation so you would mention game so you know hey what about the sentencing\nAnd seeing him in the bracelets you know in in handcuffs walking out of I mean\nThat's harmful but I just thought were that day for a nation doesn't leave any doubt what we're dealing with here in the eyes of the court are based on the\nSo when it comes to something so important as voting rights minority voting rights what's what's he doing oh he had a voter fraud commission that was what he did right after his election put in place people were going to find voter fraud because he said he would have won the election the popular vote against it\nBecause he said he would have won the election the popular vote against Hillary Clinton if it wasn't for all the voter fraud for all the people who voted illegally and here is talking about people in the black community he's talking about legal number they could find nothing eventually that commission was disbanded but what isn't this band that is\nHeavily Republican legislatures who had been trying to limit\nWhere polling places are located I think you guys know about that here in the state of Georgia where do you know about cutting back on voting hours you know about gerrymandering and so there's no effort now from the federal government or from the courts to try to\nProtect minority political power as a function of minority voting rights so that goes beyond the rhetoric\nThat's what I'm Talking about let's let's look at the actual policies\nFor example one of his favorite response is when you're ever he's asked about making\nLet's just be as neutral as we can't racial statements or statements that could incite racial tension in the society he says I don't I don't know what you're talking about black unemployment is so low if it's ever meant is that a historical low\nAnd he acts as there that should answer all your questions about race but then you stop and say wait a second one most of this decline\nTook place under President Obama's only dropped one point or a little more than one point under President Trump secondly black unemployment remains double wide unemployment in the country and third\nThere's from trying to remove programs that are intended to help black people get into the middle class and I think the key question for any president black white Obama Trump whoever\nAt this juncture is are you helping to grow the black middle class in this country and are you helping the black American political voice to grow because those are the two great achievements of the civil rights movement\nAnd in both cases Trump is not trying to help with the voting rights as I explained to earlier and secondly I think that he is intent\nOn policies that do not help to grow the black middle class so what is your message for the president with\nYour book or if you could get in his face today and as someone would want to take some sense into him\nYou know I don't think it works that way I think that he's pretty content with who he is he's a Seventy two year old man uh you know he grew up in such a\nEra where his father was quite clear about not having blacks living his property is the federal government sued them they had to settle that soup I have to pay fines\nAnd then you know as it goes down the road he gets involved in controversies I don't know if you heard about the Central Park five in New York or group of young black and Latino men who were charged with having attacked and raped a young white woman well when those people are exonerated\nDonald Trump doesn't apologize for having run full page ads condemning them and calling them animals no no no he's he's still says that he in fact this right\nAnd then don't forget that when there was the first black president he was the one who was behind the birther movement suggesting that Obama was not an American and and in fact somehow\nBeen some kind of you know Machiavellian candidate who was put up there for a for no good reason and wasn't a legitimate presence in the United states this is his history right so I think when you look at that you understand that if you were I are sitting there and trying to talk to him\nHe if we are famous people if we're like celebrities right like the card bastions oh well then okay hill is but in terms of saying oh well this is a really smart person this is a black academic this is the style or this is someone who is long engaged in black political thought her activism\nThat's not going to impress and that's not going to change his mind I think he is locked in and at this point unfortunately for us as Americans not of any one race or the other but just as Americans are he's locked into a position where\nAntagonizing polarizing people are dividing people he thinks wins and support at the polls that people may say one thing outside of the voting booth but once they get inside they'll vote for him\nBecause they quietly privately agree with him\nAgree with him or think you know what they want that kind of bully boy tactics\nAnd or they think that he's someone who is looking out for their best interest and they worry that there are people who are taking advantage of the system and it's not them they're not the ones getting ahead how come they are all these immigrants and their country how come black people are doing better than ever we see that's the you know we were talking about when he's made the ah\nThe comment what the hell do you have to lose again I don't think\nThat he understands the progress that has been made in black America over the last Seventy years when I started this book I talk about the fact that you know not only has there been a black president there's been a black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff\nOnly has there been a black president there's been a black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff you have Oprah Winfrey on television you have people like uh everybody from ludicrous to Michael Jackson and then in sports Michael Jordan too you know LeBron James yeah\nWho again he thinks it's so dumb\nA but his opening schools in his community correct but he so for him I think for Trump it's like you know what I'm gonna\nI'm gonna win with my hand and the two of you on the radio with all your criticism critique\nThat's fine but I I'm sitting in the White House and not you know what happens after the midterm should the Republicans lose control of the house\nWell then I think we are on the path to even more partisanship uh it's not that we're short on partisanship at the moment but I think that what you're going to see is that they will ask questions and Devin Nunes who is now\nHead of government or ... I think it's a house intelligence committee it is he does not want to ask questions his questions don't go after president after Russia connection his questions go at Robert Mueller in the ... his questions go at the Justice Department his questions go with the Pfizer court\nSo if you imagine that the Democrats are the ones with subpoena power I think they're going to start asking questions about the president's actions or inaction\nAh and that's a whole different kettle of fish because I think Trump than reacts to their questions and really and so I think it makes for an even sharper political divide in this society but the good of it and I think the reason that voters are likely\nTo give the house to the Democrats as they want to check or oversight of Donald Trump's impulsive behavior and some times upsetting a behavior\nAnd do you think that the voters may also react to the fact that the president's party has essentially abdicated the that that role as being a check on the third branch of government\nAbsolutely that's what that's what I think I think that there are people who have not bought into the whole cult idea of well you know I like Trump so anything he does is fine or all I care about is a hard conservative right on the court a majority of their or all I care about is a tax cut\nRemember I this term going into the midterms\nPresident Trump and the Republicans had hoped to be able to brag about the tax cut it has not gain traction with voters most of whom say they haven't seen much difference in their paychecks it looks like large result of that tax cut went to the corporations in the very rich\nUh and then the second part of that is that they wanted to brag in big time about the economy in general and the economy is doing well\nBut again it's a time of tremendous income inequality in the country so if you're at the right end of the spectrum and you have a lot of stocks you're doing fine in fact you might be celebrating that's evidenced in our high level of consumer confidence\nBut if you're in the middle\nOr working class or poor\nYou're just being left behind at this moment and Trump has not held\nWhat are you wanting readers to take away from your book what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights that study of the policy that the changes that have actually happened beyond the\nStatic yeah that's right I'm so glad that you know if you put it that way 'cause it is\nEasy for people to say hey you know Juan Williams\nYou're ... you're suffering from Trump arrangements syndrome you just angry at the ... you know or so what he said that uh you know a that LeBron James is dumped so what if he said Maxine Waters is low IQ or that he just talks about people like that don't be so sensitive\nBut you know let's look beyond this at the real policies of this administration let's look at how he's doing away with community development block grants let's look at how he's doing away with community financial develop things that help black people who want to invest and start a business get going\nLet's look at what he's doing in terms of education in the country in specific putting more barriers and the way of young people of color and poor people who want to go to college\nOh wait a second that's so much more serious so how much heavier than his rhetoric and yet somehow people don't talk about it it's like that's not as interesting it's not as sort of popular and scandalous as the latest Trump tweet statement insult or evidence or bad attitude\nBut treatment for ... also hinders lots on different types of medications and they often have the common theme of suppressing the immune system or call that I said earlier that rheumatic diseases or auto immune diseases when the patient's own immune system attacks their own body\nSo arm medication as we used to treat it tried to tamp down a little bit they they'd decrease the immune system with the hope of it\nWith the au decreasing the disease activity\nBut does that open you up to other things if you decrease the immune system\nIt absolutely can and has to be a conversation between your provider in the patient doesn't basically a risk benefit ratio and of course we think the benefits of our medications far outweigh the risks are all want to prescribe them but it's definitely something that everyone needs to be aware of that went into it\nSo if somebody thinks you know or perhaps perhaps thinking I got a little arthritis here has some swelling here or are not knowing what their diagnosis is do they find a rheumatologist initially or do they go to their their primary care doctor first\nIt's a good question they can probably do either or but sometimes it depends on their insurance people need referrals from their primary care doctor before they can see\nA rheumatologist in general you know I personally advocate for having an open conversation with the patients primary provider just to get a sense of here to shut them somehow I mean what do you think about a referral to ... just\nBecause as you may be aware of you know our diagnoses are difficult to me it's not a simple blood test that can say\nYes I Do ... there are a lot of\nThings that go into or diseases and patients can actually get a little bit more information about this at our website Senate you report card in fall ... that simple tasks dot org forward slash report card\nThat is phenomenal more than fifty four million American adults have been diagnosed it rheumatic disease imagine all the ones who have not been diagnosed and so we need to kind of get on that because in the long run I talk about what happens on diagnosed I'm In the long run what can happen here\nSure it varies greatly actually depended on what traumatic disease for talking about um [noise] but in general we like to have a crunch therapy an upfront care we kind of talk about this window of opportunity from\nThe time it patient first developed symptoms to one day can you know get plugged into a rheumatologist care team and have adequate treatment that's a very important window of opportunity to really present damage\nSometimes that damage can be in the form of chronic joint pains joints damage but also other organs sometimes kidneys can be injured in the long should cetera\nThat's amazing amazing give that website one more time for more information\nAbsolutely so that is a simple tasks dot org forward slash report card\nAll right Dr Christopher ... John John's Hopkins\nAmerican College of or mythology talking about romantic disease in September is romantic disease awareness\nMonth thank you so much for joining thank you ...\nYou're listening to business in the black with the one the block you know um\nChicken soup has been around for a long time you eat with accounting for yourself a chicken soup for the soul has\nDifferent\nBooks now um any new mark joins us each publisher and editor in chief of this iconic book series how are you this morning\nI Am good I'm good and thanks for mentioning how long we've been around you know we just celebrated our twenty fifth anniversary\nSo how many books I have several of them I mean look the ... out there\nYou know I don't know the exact number we bought the company and two thousand eight and it was roughly a hundred and eighty or more\nTitles that a lot more like range titles you know not the normal [laughter] and we kept a hundred of the old titles in ...\nAnd now I've published another one hundred and fifty so we have two hundred and fifty in print right now and there's a whole bunch of other ones available at the bucks\nWow that's what nominal that you did you ever think that chicken soup for the soul friends franchise so to speak would just expand to the numbers that it has\nI guess if we had all understood the power of storytelling mhm and storytelling is getting bigger and\nBigger right like you have that pod cast the moth and doctors are using storytelling now as part of curing people in Madison ...

[noise]\nHewlett Packard is all about losing money on every print or they make I saw and analysis recently in Consumer Reports that one of the popular Hewlett Packard printers every one they sell they lose fifty dollars on the print or\nAre you what Packard 'cause they don't care because then they're selling you the eight or ... billion dollars\nSo that printer that looks like it's a deal is not at all\nThat looks like it's a deal is not at all\nAnd I watch people when they're shopping printers and how they look at him going down the aisle\nAnd they're never looking across to see what they ate costs were that printer and that is car courageous because I don't care what the prices on that printer it's what you pay for that ain't that really counts\nThe great news is now more and more companies are selling printers that you pay a real price for the printer but they ain't cost basically nothing\nAnd I told you about for years about the epson eco tank printers\nNow brother makes some printers that run on the ultra cheap ink and more recently cannon who's joined this movement of having the printers where the ink is basically free but you pay a real price for the printer\nSo don't stab your wallet in a back do not by a printer just because the printer is cheap you got to see the whole story and make sure that you know what the ink is going to cost because today\nBuying a printer that appears to be more expensive is one that's going to make you happy month after month year after year without having in many cases to buy ain't\nThe apps and I have\nThe ankle last it looks like for three years\nAnd I pay two hundred Nineteen dollars for the printer and won't have to pay a penny for ink for years to come vats the deal\nBuying a printer that's cheap and then the cartridge costs much more than the printer itself remember don't do it don't waste your money because the cheap price up front\nOnly tears your wallet apart\nAnd that is Clark rages you're listening

how's it going well I Can't complain it's a beautiful sunny day\nWell how perfect it as that but you want to talk about clouds on the horizon the clouds that would make you worried about having any regular money and having instead\nCoal of yes basically\nSo tell me about your thoughts with gold\nWell in the past ... thoughts with gold and silver and I've done very well on them in any case has tripled late in life now I'm kind of curious about where you stand on buying a actual bullying\nOn them and much bigger fan of you doing what you've done so you are buying gold exchange traded funds the ts it yeah I think that's the only wise way to do it\nBecause if you buy physical gold you've got to buy sell spread on the price where you get a little bit ripped off on what they\nOr you get a little bit ripped off on what they sell it to you for then you get a little bit ripped off and what they buy it back from you for you have to store it you have to worry about theft it's not\nIs convertible as quickly and to cash is you have with the exchange traded fund it's much cheaper and much more efficient to own gold or any precious metal with an exchange traded fund in ATF which where people aren't familiar with what that is I should say\nJohn that essentially is like buying a stock\nRather than buying the physical gold but the gold is stored for you\nBy the fine and in a vault in a safe place to protect your investment\nSo if if gold is where you think it's at physical gold is not where I Would be\nOkay and how much of your assets do you put into gold are precious metals\nWell right now I don't have any my wife and I are both retired we have both defined benefit pension voyage we have been free for a number of years so we'll nothing like cars on the street carrying a credit card debt so\nGold for you is only a protective hedge against bad news\nIn a shed she has a ... ... I Would say in your case that you are in such a solid secure\nFinancial situation with you and your wife you don't have debt you got nice steady income that golden precious metals is just for a rainy day Laurie is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Laurie\nClark how about you know\nGreat thank you you want to talk about men Mm oh\nI Do my God I think ... that I downloaded apps and it would make it ... and they left to transfer money back and forth to each other as well as the other friends and family and I'm just not sure if it's a safe way to transfer money\nIt just shows that your daughter's brilliant a liar I already know that\nAnd then ... has become the go to way particularly for people in their teens and twenties to move money around to friends family whatever and it works flawlessly IM zero for complaints ever about ...\nDoesn't mean they won't be a problem at some point but I have never had a complaint\nIs it similar to pay pal it's owned by pay pal I remember um [noise]\nWhat Ben mo is is it set from the ground up as a mobile payment platform that's free to use so\nYou instantly can move money around from friend a friend or family member and family member\nAnd so let's say people are sitting at a restaurant and the restaurant doesn't split checks for people and one person wasn't planning to take the other three out to lunch or dinner so than most people just instantly ... money is the person who picked up the check their share of it\nSo there's no way that the person on the other end can get any information out of my account correct\nCorrect okay it just works\nGreat well thank you I won't go ahead and download the app them\nAnd don't forget to tell your daughter she's brilliant\nI'll tell her that you told me that\nOkay and I should tell you the banks are so green with envy about then ... and other independent payment platforms that the banks daylight dollar short years behind are trying to come up with their own payment platforms that so far or a big fat joke in spite of spending so much money\nBecause banks always think within their own walls\nAnd none of them have done a good job doing something that doesn't care who your bank is who your credit union is who you're paying ... to\nBend mode did it right making it work across any platform\nMike is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Mike\nHello clock how ya doing I'm doing well how are you good\nYou have a question for me about seeing if you are on track and on target to have enough money to retire with comfort is that right\nThat's correct so I've gone on to um some retirement calculators on line\nAnd I get a enormously wide variety of answers and that\nSo frustrating\nYes well it's it's some some days I'm happy and some days I'm scared out of my mind so\nThere is one thing as a retirement calculator that is more than playing horseshoes okay you know there is no precision with the the closest there's been to precision is a tool that was developed by a organization called financial engines\nFollowed by a organization called financial engines but generally is available to people if I remember right to people that work for a specific participating employer they use something known as Monte Carlo modeling\nThat takes projections and calculates in worst case scenario based on historical declines in the market and what age you are and all that and comes up with\nA best guesstimate about how close you already are targets and how likely you are to never run out of money\nOkay but again as I as I recall that's only available to people at participating companies unless they have some consumer version now\nUh but if you tried different calculators are a lot of organizations elect you used there's even if you're not a customer of them you think of any of the big financial companies they all have a calculator you usually go to Fidel to investments and use theirs\nAnd they are all using different methodologies\nAnd that's why you'll see such variation\nIn who thinks you're on target and who's not so if somebody who wants to rest easy at night you find the one that says you are headed towards financial Armageddon unless you increase your amount you put aside by so much\nAnd you go with their very pessimistic projections to make it happen\nRight okay so the Monte Carlo model would that be something that if I met with a like a financial counselor they would have that available for me\nYes there may be there may be some that are ... subscribing to Monte Carlo simulations\nThat would be able to give you based on the all the various\nScenarios give you the likely outcome and it's not a certain outcome is ... percent outcome with ... percent hide that you will be okay if any of the tools you you have used have they shown us based on a ... percent calculation\nNo it's just been basically you need this much per month and I'm your projection is that you'll have this much per month [noise]\nDollars okay and it's been all over the place so\nRight and that's it and that makes it is clear as it could be that what I said is true and that's that they're doing their best effort using the best methods they know but the likely outcomes are going to range so far\nBecause right now buddy nobody can know with certainty\nBut somebody who is if you go to a um [noise] the only financial planner you know you might if you want to check up you might contact people with Garrett planning network\nAnd they charge you an on an hourly basis to give you advice and guidance and ask if they do Monte Carlo simulations about how you're doing and then you know if you found somebody that you can pay on an hourly basis to run those analyses for you\nOkay gotcha but I Will tell you that my general experience is that when somebody is asking the question you're asking and running the simulations you're running that you likely are fine on your path to having enough money in retirement\nWell you're the\n... four hours a day from\nBreaking news and the largest he's\nCan do that when you ask me about ... er Cox media group station\nHas twenty four hour news weather and

a [laughter]\nHave you ever play about have you ever played quarters with with ah with autumn Fisher Mr cabinet if you ever played quarters let them Fisher now than they do not know how that's not my recollection what about what about devil's triangle have you ever played that with the with the no [laughter]\nThank you [laughter]\nSee that's not what the truth is that [laughter]\nYou were telling me on line yeah that that I see I didn't know devil's triangle has some sort of there's also a sexual connotation as well\nTurn that over the autumn she's the one the founders\nSorry no no no hold on hold on to not care no no autumn you don't turn subject matter where you have to be careful and the radio over ... okay then I'm just tell you what it is yeah [laughter] I don't know how does yeah you know what a no\n[laughter] I find\nIn the modern parlance it means that ... the two guys and one woman\nOkay All right but we don't know that there are many other interpretations of Islam is a drinking game\nIs their Israel you know yes there's a seventies or a big game and they called it the er the Bermuda Triangle game right and the devil's triangle and there'd be Bermuda Triangle are synonymous\nYes there is the same things I mean by us because I don't know what exculpatory or slow not on a mishap how did she not know what it's called ... that\nI I mean I've heard and I feel like I could figure it out in the set and let me ask ... while in the middle of everything I'd be like could you just\nTell me when I ask you something though is your name Dr autumn Fisher\nBut sometimes you don't know certain you know there's just because you are a doctor if something doesn't have you know out already ... not okay it's not maybe it's a ten cent word but it's more like an eight and a half sent word I mean it's the it's not it's not one of those words you never hear is the ... and she knew exactly how her memory is a weird\nAnd I don't want to listen I I I Want to say this or that uh I think that she came off as I'll give you my honest opinion\nAnd people are getting angry yesterday when I was saying I thought she came off as credible what I mean by that is I Believe that she believes her story but it doesn't stop there with me I saw somebody who appear to be very fragile human being I she teaches classes I Can't even\nI I she teaches classes I Can't even I I Can't even imagine this she seemed very fragile to me I thought that she was credible but I'm not a lawyer and I think I could have cross examined her and and really\nPut her in a bad now the Republicans didn't want to do that I guess 'cause they didn't want to be seen as usual the Republicans playing for a tie\nYou know did not want to be seen as as bullying or or uh or anything like that so but it was very strange I thought that when she was talking about her own mental condition dealing with this event that happened in the early eighties\nShe gets very technical and the way that like most people would say you know oh I compartmentalized it I I did ... there are certain things I remember other things got fuzzy a book and then she starts telling in the hot hypo campus\nSame way that I share that and ... right now in fact the basic memory functions and and and\nAlso just fell out of that for a ... brain as codes that ... that that can't that than China related experience than as kind of locked there where it that they have to ...\nSee here's the thing you can't keep a man off the Supreme Court when part of your thing is the other details sort of drift Wall Street journal has a on the opinion page you know really kind of late stuff out and I just wanted to talk to on about 'cause autumn actually although she's more into reality shows she actually watched a bunch of this\nOh I was glued she's text neglected my kid yeah well good [laughter] they're still hungry\nOr so it and so she texted me after she gave his statements so you'd watched her and\nI was only listening which I Know what I liked a lot better because I wasn't taking in his visual stimulation really able to sort of you know here and not be distracted by any way they look and they were like there's like the Nixon Kennedy debates you know why exactly didn't want him [laughter]\nAs far as you were considered you are listening so Nixon one right or so after he gave his his opening statement sheep\nAutumn treated me it's so hard to know who to believe and in reality yes that's true and what do we do in that situation we have here whether people like it or not a classic he said she said so you bring the two sides in and they give you their testimony\n... what happens when they both come off as credible\nThat's a difficult thing the answer is gather round the big radio box 'cause I Know most of you didn't learn civics\nThe answer is all we can do\nIs rely on our notions of justice\nAnd the number one the bedrock of American Justice is\nYou are innocent until proven guilty and all of this stuff about this isn't a trial [laughter] this is a uh this this is a they have a job interview you know how many times have you sat down for a job interview and had a guy a claim that uh he heard you were a gang rape is\nThat's not a job interview if someone was coming in for a job interview and you were even rumors\nAbout gang rape you would as the c._e._o.\nCancelled that job interview before it even started so you know that was a false city there that it's it's ... it may not have been a courtroom it wasn't a trial but we still have our notions of American Justice\nAnd the bedrock of that is you can't just point a finger and accuse you have to corroborate we understand that some times\nAnd this is what people on the left used to always say\nLet a hundred guilty people walk free before one frame and goes to prison this was a notion from the left for a long time\nYou know hey we know you did it but it's important to us that Miranda rights are red and you didn't read the Miranda rights so we think it's better to let this obviously guilty person go\nIn order to maintain the notion of American Justice but you are read your rights that you don't have that you do have the right not to incriminate yourself you don't have to speak and we've knowingly\nLet people off that we know are guilty to preserve that notion [noise] so what I Would say\nIn a situation like that he said she said they both come off as credible all you can do is fall back on the notions of American Justice and the bedrock is\nInnocent until proven guilty after everything yesterday she still doesn't know what the house is she doesn't really necessarily know she says she thinks it's eighty two but she isn't completely set on that\nShe doesn't know how she got to the party she doesn't know how she got home from the party now I understand\nHe doesn't know how she got home from the party now I understand when you step into say yeah but that's it's trauma and that happens all the time and I would say I agree with you I've been exposed to these notions enough to know that that's true\nBut because both are coming off his credible we have to fall back on our notions of justice so you have to prove it uh another thing that the left side left out\nNo pun intended\nThat they would have if there was a pattern here and autumn who loves to loves to psychobabble knows this they went off and always tell you that it's a pattern that maintain through life if you are a sexual abuse or it is not known\nAs something ... usually happens to you a salt women for a couple of years in your late teens and then you just stop\nAnd it never happens again\nSo that was and that's a piece of exculpatory lack that you got it ... evidence not Kevin now with all that being said do you have anything else you want to

so that if the line is thirty one that they got to win by thirty two or more you start looking at that rate expectations how did you delivered our style points involved yeah absolutely\nI Would I

Rockies have a one game lead over the Dodgers so how it's going to have to go is the race have to win the second spot outright because they would lose the tie breaker what the Rockies and the doctors who three games left one of them all wouldn't hurt\nLet's say but J what do they really want home field advantage they played poorly it's on trust part for most of the season yes you still want

palate that I have now\nBut I Do feel bad sometimes because I Love to see great steak\nAnd I was living thing then I'll turn on a National Geographic or something or see the living planet and realize they're no better than us\nA matter of fact there's they're worse than us all they don't consume all these animals do is just hunt one another down and look for the slowest in the heard and and so I don't look\nIt's a weird thing in life we have to eat other living animals I guess we don't have to but some people think the plants may have feelings as well so what do you do that in macro by

both of them in the early eighties to have an idea of who we simply cannot no it's just a matter of who did better on television\nAnd from my point of view heated better on television\nYou know her old Saturday Night live you know okay go after him and that funny they found all of these comedians on Saturday Night live I'm sure they did their due diligence they found no possibility of parity with Dr Ford's testimony she was just lockdown tight forget the fact that she changed her story\nI'm Sorry am I now is they're fun has thrown out in favor of rape if he says\nShe changed her story she changed their story from what she told a the Washington Post in several different areas\nOr am I wrong to notice that ah the the the the hearing had to be delayed a week because she's so afraid to fly except when she flies west apparently to vacation spots oh what a couple of times a year she flies to the east coast for a family sort of thing\nI guess if I notice that or even by bringing it up\nWhether I Know we're not being a fifty four year old white male part of the patriarchal system I should probably go into a sociologist they will be the ones who should tell me that I'm somehow supporting rape because if I didn't support rape you understand I wouldn't even begin to notice the doctor for changed some of her testimony\nHow can we even have a conversation if one side must be treated with kid gloves and the other side needs to be treated with a hammer repeatedly so you can prove that you're not in favor of rape which is something I never thought any of us would have to prove it should be kind of an assumption\nGive us would have to prove it should be kind of an assumption that anybody who's living life is normal moral human being is anti rape I don't even I Can't even tell you what age I became anti rape I think it was just always there I don't even think I ever had to sit down and way both sides\nI remember it was a big day I'll never forget that day I became anti ... I guess you would think about this the wrong way for you know just a light bulb I also ah the the ...\nWith which this guy's being taken down you know in reality\nIs if it is true if we somehow had some real evidence that it did happen in reality\nIn a good world even the Democrats who had found this out would be some somewhat somber like oh this is we of course didn't want this to happen we wanted to be able to take him down on policy but this is just awful and we're a bit saddened ourselves but there's ...\nThere is ... with the Democrats on the committee there is the lead on late night TV\nAnd the fact of the matter is none of us knows if it happened if you're on the right you don't know if you're on the left you don't know that's why I fall back on notions of justice\nI Believe there can be no carve outs charity automotive you know what no means none not at all none not at all not one not one single carve out on the presumption of innocence\nAnd having to prove guilt\nI don't understand people who think no no in this area also that it'd be very unpopular here\nThis notion that women never lie\nThat's not true wait a minute turns out of done the research are human beings\nAnd as such they display all of the good and bad qualities that are found in every other type of human being there are now according to Facebook fifty seven genders I Will stretch it over all of them\nYou break down any one of those fifty seven genders and you will find that in every category they're a truth tellers there are liars there are moral people there are immoral people there are good people there are bad people\nWomen are not exempt from this\nWomen are good people and bad people liars in truth tellers because they're women know because they're human beings and this just happens to apply to all human beings\nSo what I have to hope for is that we're living through a phase that it's America America always rejuvenates or maybe the next generation sees what the generation before did and maybe a reforms that\nBecause I I have to believe to believe in the country that we are not heading down this path because let me tell you something if you think you're only going to have one car about in history\nWe're just going to carve out this one thing women who claimed that they had been sexually assaulted we promise we promise this is the only carve out we're gonna have where there will be no presumption of innocence until proven guilty\nYou really believe that's the way it's going to work have you ever heard of precedent it seems to be the way of the world since the beginning of time and will probably apply to this there's no such thing as one carve out on anything\nOnce you carve out anything you create a precedent that says\nThe cancer it was that there was gone make it easy on yourself and do have the heart and lung skin done\nThanks to virtual imaging your cancer free that's exactly right virtual ... is now offering free heart and lungs scan for the first time with the minimum requirements thousand dollar value seven seven zero seven three zero zero one one nine or visit virtual imaging ... dot com\nBubble you asked me about ... er Cox media group station [noise] twenty four hour news weather and five and I am\n\nNow eleven o'clock I'm Sabrina cupid live in the delta USC twenty four hour news center this our President Trump speaks from the rose garden on the new trade deal\nThis is Jim Ryan negotiator during the George W.

that's no no I Know you know what it is I always for some reason I don't my brain always wants to save Villanova I did that at first yeah I don't know where does fees and I was just searching and I thought ... know\nFor some reason Vanderbilt is one of these things that will stick in my brain but\nIt should be because I'm going to go sit next to some listeners of ours is that contest still going on here we've picked a winner tomorrow in eleventh fifteenth so what do people have to do if they want to sit next to me and Tim Andrew while they dismissed by the way the two of us attending our first bulldog oh wow yeah yeah\nSo I have no idea what we're going to park or how are we going to do that but it's seven thirty at night so I'm sure we'll be in the stadium in time what what do\nWe have to have that handy W. S. B. radiolab on you and you just go on there and you could sign up for the contest super easy\nAnd then we will call the name tomorrow and eleven Fifteen that's right so do you guys have to take the listeners all around campus or he'll just meeting as soon as meeting the silk I you know how I Am the idea you're not ... you're not going to wear your red pants and I well I got to wear red paint given\nI think the important thing is\nI don't know if I have any red pale you have re important thing is uh\nI think what is going to get there early and then we'll go have fun for a while in Athens and then head back to the stadium right that's the way to do it because they're like two and you know like a full day I don't want to get stuck in the in the last minute trap yeah we do we have to leave to avoid all that I think would probably have to leave about one with all that ... I get there seven hours for kick also if you want to leave then\nNo I mean when the game's over I'm going to games over oh you know what I have a I have a I have a method oh you do as a method that works in every stadium I Know football games I Know how this works now the problem is it's going to be probably a little bit of a blowout so maybe I won't be the first one to leave my seat so\nYou're going to be a little time it nineties bar me to get a creature comforts beforehand and heavily on the floor of the story it out again\nTraveling back to Atlanta I have to be responsible not going to give the local news that headline the former shock jock gets DUI I'm not giving George Stein those kind of headlines you know I Will not be a certain set of [laughter]\nSo yeah so used to sign up for that and I'm a how do you feel the Georgia right now ranks up against the other powerhouses Alabama obviously being in an FCC but also a teams like Ohio State Clemson these other Auburn\nAlabama zone a tear by itself yeah George is not there yeah I mean they're they loaded\nI don't know if you're just going to get to that Alabama tear but we still got ... seasons ago house on ... fall over and over and has won last they last to LSU an alternative they struggle a little bit with southern miss they only had a Ninety six Russian your just seen them\nStruggling a little bit with southern miss they only had a Ninety six Russian your Justine that runs the football only had Ninety six rushing Oregon southern miss\nSo all been struggling a little bit el issues on beat and that's the team George Will play next week in Baton Rouge Kentucky who Georgia's still has to play as good a right to Thirteen yeah they might have one of the best teams they've ever had\nSo the schedules getting tough for the second\nHalf of the season is where the dogs will make or break it so you got to the dogs have to run the table in may really refer LSU against Alabama\nRight well let me turn to beat George George or on the table they beat unless you know no but I mean you want to LSU to beat Alabama and playing again oh do they do I'm Sorry I'm confused I'm always confused on college football Alice she was already played Alabama LSU play Alabama later in the center of the land and the western division\nThat's what I'm saying I'm saying is we're on the table and root for al issue to beat Alabama that's correct that's what I was in wrong thank you very much or not in a in the NFL or\nWould you agree with me because they're not on the first year yet but would you agree with me that from the point of view of Matt Ryan if you're often puts thirty six on the board you should expect to win that game\nAm I right or not hard to figure out what the problems here\nThat's it's also expert and I was to say the defense is banged up and they kind of state yeah and\nI mean I Know that he missed a he missed Hooper at the end but the falcons it always seems to come down to the last\nPlay the game whether they're defending a lead or they have a shot in the red zone on the last play the game I've never I've been watching football since Nineteen Seventy I've never seen a team like this every week it comes down and this year they've they've been on the wrong end of the\nMan who is a matter of Ryan ... are you trying to consult a guy just ... memorial dresser show him the ball and\nI didn't want it matter do want to thank you for being stealing my fantasy draft I'm getting my fantasy team says ... does not helping\nThe optimist excuse me what did you say there are a and he said oh my [laughter] in his own\nWay a and I think you would agree with me that ah without a doubt so far as the NFL goes Buffalo Bills best team in a league I Know\nThere's just nobody who am I on yeah I mean I listen to their own sixteen even though the same thing that I'm a oh hey we already won one yeah we invite you know we're we're we're we're we're the browns last year so we're not going to worsen on two years ago she says I Would have to be worse than that\nPlease try to explain to me\nExactly what is going on and uh the\nBaseball playoffs because this is unique yes so when I think that kind of understand it but I don't know ... this is the first\nTime that we've had two division tie breakers\nIn baseball history so this is actually gave one sixty three we played a hundred and sixty to the west and the central came up tied the Dodgers in rocky desires time ever that had to yeah okay so the Dodgers in rocky start in the west the cubs and the brewers tied in the central so we'll have a one game playoff it'll side of the division champions\nOkay but I mean what about the other one game playoff\nThat that's the wild card okay game so what will happen is the two teams that win today will be division champions they go into the national league division series did they both get home field advantage that yes that is that right\nThe two teams that Louis will drop down into the wild card game and play each other I Know the winner of that game will play the winner of the central typewriter game which is one between the cubs and the ... it all makes sense to be an algae bladder winner of the west typewriter between the Dodgers in the Rockies will play you are not a Braves\nOver there on Thursday the bridge now get home field advantage in the first round so they're going to have to travel west they just don't know where they're going you\nKnow how do you feel about the last few games the Braves are we seeing some uh says anything real or just have they didn't\nSay was you do is kind of taking a break you know I mean you know they they went for it sort of\nWhat we're going to go for it but we're not going to break our backs to get home field advantage because wrestling was more important\nThe bigger issue sorting out of what was going to be all the playoff roster especially the bullpen which I don't have that answer and I don't think they do we\n... you know fancy some sell the Braves expert dancey Swanson hand I mean is there any updates on that it's not panic so I I've heard that he might be able to go but I they don't have to submit the playoff roster till Thursday morning I don't know if we're going to know about dance me until\nYou've already with the Braves fans should just enjoy the ride yes nobody expected this uh and it's going to be a long long long slog and a lot of things have to happen\nTo even find yourself in the world series and I'm not saying it we've had it's been a magical season so why not but I don't want to hear\nAngry Braves fans this year because this is so much more than anyone expected and we knew they were a young team in them to begin to come into their own this year rather than next year I think is a a a treat and people should enjoy it as it is it is like Nineteen Ninety One just not\nQuite you know the Sunni on fire to that level but I\nI have been really good Jay and this year all my teams are are not doing well except for the bulldogs okay and uh and\nAnd ... and ... on Sundays we have friends and family over and it's a gathering my kids don't live in the house anymore so having everybody back and I used to get angry and ruin it and this year I've really been good that's really concentrate on it and I want to say the people listening\nWhy do you have a favorite team because you love the game first of all you don't have a favorite football team if you don't love football and I am finding myself this year able to still have a good time with friends and family and enjoy the game\nThat I Love Namibia took fifty four years to get to this point he's my hero expectations are are are pretty good although with Atlanta Falcons I mean I I\nHad them as a Super Bowl favorite starting the year so it's working on both ends where I'm not going to and I want to say to people you got to give this a try because it takes mental readjustment\nTo say to yourself I'm going to enjoy the game of football the matter how my team is doing but if you just try it a couple of times you really do have fun what's it about your getting together with friends and family you're watching the games enjoy that we never know if we have a tomorrow my right Jay Black you and I talk about this an awful lot of very optimistic way of looking at sports\nI'm proud of I I I don't know how people are jumping on that jump on that bandwagon but and it's not mushy thing I'm just saying I'm a little ... I'm not going to get into an argument with a relative you want to fight it out\nOn owner you ride or Israel have a chain you bring whatever you want\nYeah effect jade laugh he says I don't like change you know what he said to me he said you said if if I say knives he says knives\nIf I say guns he says oh you got to settle it ain't even school this big Jay Black is a is tough what I'm saying is why create rifts and arguments with family and loved one is just ball we just we we we love our teams right\nAnd we want them to win and it's so awesome when they do but if they don't what the hell are we going to do about ... and you know what", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "01"}
