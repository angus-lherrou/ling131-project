hello Daniel so how can I be of service do you\nYes so I was approached a with a co worker who has a great reputation in my book and he was talking about eight to ... he was starting to work part time for and so forth\nSo he set a schedule time than him in a representative from this company came on over to sell kind of ... life insurance and uh besides life insurance mutual funds and get not at that age that that sort [noise] uh and of course at the end uh\nKinda pitched a little bit about how they were taught fifty in a way that forms a New York stock exchange that they are on and how I can work for them so far with that\nThey thought it was ... was not about necessarily buying the products although they'd like that but you selling for them as well\nCorrect okay they catch from what it seemed like was you'd have to pay nine dollars\nFor a background check and what they stated a and from there are a twenty five dollar technology see if he chose to use the technology for it now this company said that they are trying to help only middle class families\nUm and that they would also send us your licensing or for the state just sell life life insurance mutual fund et cetera with that but my question was is if it was a legitimate company if there was a legitimate potential\nIf it was a legitimate company if it was a legitimate potential side income or just a regular MLM or a multi level marketing\nNo no this is a legitimate seller a mutual funds and insurance the fees they were talking about those are completely normal there's nothing okay rip off or weird about them\nWhat you should know is that when people call me and the other side where they're saying hey I've had the salesperson offer me these mutual fund should I buy them\nAnd on that score I've said they're very very high cost funds so if you were coming to me as a customer for the product\nI Would tell you why is not a product I'm excited about it all OK but as far as selling it's not a scam it's not a rip off\nUm it's just inexpensive way for someone to start to build up investments for the future and to buy insurance\nSo okay does that help at all that's all it does what does that make you think he wanted to do\nI Do like my normal job right now like if it's a it's not the best product that I don't want to and you're supposed to be helping families out she'll comfortable maybe sound that product it's not the best product out there for them\nGot it okay good for you and it is I'm Glad you have a specific reason that you're able to give them other than say will Clark set I shouldn't do it [laughter] I'm not a bad okay [laughter] I got enough of that going on there is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Andrew\nHello Clark how are you great thank you you have your retirement plan with tea or a that's correct yes are\nYou a teacher a college professor or work for a nonprofit how'd you end up with them\nI was a teacher for fourteen years in public schools but I'm a college professor of seven years at this point so\nAnd so the the University You're at offers to your retirement plans\nThat's correct and they're very generous to they contribute to eight percent a year to our retirement and uh in addition to that I haven't been contributing roughly Seventy percent to that same retirement\nAnd the question I had for you as if that is really the best thing for me to do because the eight percent is really not match it gets contributed whether I contribute or not\nAnd I also have a credit card debt or that my family is a build up over the past couple of years because of some\nHealth issues and medical bills as well as some damage that occurred to our house to water damage that we had to have repaired a\nWhile I'm Sorry yeah we've had a lot to deal with how much you\nWell yeah but I mean life necessities you know you take care of them out in each year so uh so we have five but now we're I'm I'm sort of at the point where I I Need to sort of figure out the best way to eliminate that credit card debt and I was wondering\nIf I Would best be served to pull that seven percent that I put into my retirement and use it to help pay that credit card debt off and I guess the overarching question is what I'd be better to even be putting any money into this ... or would I be better with Iraq once this credit card\nKnow you know the the plan that you were in with the uh is so low cost\nDid and it comes automatically out of your check I'm really comfortable with doing that and at some point see a may offer some form of a raw for three be\nInstead of going to traditional and you could consider at that time going into the raw version but going from the seven percent you're putting in to zero and just picking up with the employer puts in what the university puts in there to concerns I have that I'll just lay out to you\nOne is that\nOnce you've reduce it to zero it's hard to get back to putting that money aside for your future and all the time you have that you're not putting money and you're losing the opportunity for that money to grow for you\nThe second thing is that and I'm Sorry both of these are so negative what I'm saying I just got away I'm Out the other is a lot of times if somebody does let's say take it down to zero and then you have that seven percent this now I had to do your check\nWould be a little less than seven 'cause it would be pretty tax money going and now the net effect you may be like five percent more bump into your take home\nIs does that five percent actually make it to the credit card bills are not a lot of times the money will somehow vanished before it goes to pay those bills so you got to know yourself\nShore or compromise would be what if you\nOff shore or compromise would be what if you cut your contribution to let's say three percent from seven\nSo you're still contributing to your retirement and you use the difference to go towards the credit card debt okay and\nThat's a thought 'cause you'd still be saving roughly eleven cents out of each dollar with the employer money put in in what is what you're putting in\nAnd then you can put your focus on getting that credit card debt paid down and I wish you the best with the uh with the medical situations and with the house\nAnd that you're able to get this debt wiped clean\nYou know it's so important to me that you have access to the

important\nThat people not an friend\nOther people because of politics this happens a lot now I'm not on the social media is what my wife is and\nRecently I've mentioned this before but it's it's gotten deeper now recently she started getting in political arguments\nWith what I Would call old friends not friends who are older than us just people who used to be friends say Fifteen Years ago Twenty years ago twenty five years ago social media has changed the world in this way\nUsually just have fond memories of your next door neighbor from twenty five years ago we were younger our kids were playing together\nWe drink on the weekends\nHave cookouts but that was twenty five years ago and life moves on and you don't stay in constant contact with everybody and you just have these sort of nice memories and social media came along and everybody could just type in their friends from twenty twenty five years ago and started up a conversation with them again\nAnd then what happens is in this polarized political environment\nIn this fifty fifty country everybody is one hundred percent on one side of the other and nobody wants to hear anything so uh [noise] my wife was thinking of on friending\nA friend from twenty five years ago because they're always mean to her because my wife is reasonable and her friend from twenty five years ago it was not\nAnd I just wanted to say I mentioned this before but I really want to get to the financial doctrine is here not just to entertain you but to help you live your life to be more serene they had a better life\nAnd this is on the said you never on friends someone because you disagree with their politics now you can on friends someone because they're just\nMean or they call you names or whatever I'm just just when it's we disagree on politics and we're a hundred miles apart on politics\nDon't on friend people because of that first of all I don't like the idea that I have to even get into a scrum with people who should be a distant memory that I think about barbecuing with twenty five years ago and now we've got to bring the modern world into it\nThat's absurd [noise] but I was saying this\nNeed to hear people who disagree with you and you\nPeople who disagree with you and you need to hear those people if not on a daily or weekly basis and the reason that you are afraid to sheer opposing views whether you're on the left or you're on the right is you yourself are afraid\nWhat are you afraid of\nYou are afraid that you cannot actually back up your belief through argument the best cure for that if it's true if you're an emotional person who will just feels right to me is to educate yourself\nAnd the best practice is debating friends who disagree with you\nAnd not calling them names because once you go there you're admitting that you don't have arguments you don't have a good argument for what you stand for the middle you call somebody a name\nThe minute you denigrate them and it has its ad hominem attack it has nothing to do with the issue whether you realize it or not you have thrown up your hands and said I Can't back up my position\nAnd so many people it's like the candy but then you get a stomach ache it's great to be vitriolic it's great to just go out there and tell people what you think it's not so fun backing it up with an actual argument that's the hard part\nChallenge yourself\nHear voices that disagree with you whether you're on the left or the right or the extreme left or the extreme right\nChallenge yourself to surround yourself with people who disagree with you\nDo you how

I think we may have to take significant steps ear and sanctioned some people and blocks and people from coming to the U.S and I think frankly the crown prince it better clean this up or he will not be allowed back\nI've seen gang members arrested I've got the video I met and drug warehouses I've got the video I've caught people while I'm at the border literally beginning their cross at the Rio Grande\nI sat with Rick Perry at a meeting that block Obama should have been at and what did I hear six hundred and forty two thousand Texans victims of crimes by illegal immigrants in a seven year period and we've\nCrimes by illegal immigrants in a seven year period and we played that video and showing you that audio\nA of showing you that video and play that audio for you is how many times you know you see the tunnels built from Mexico into the United states\nWant to know where opioids are coming from I don't know where a lot of the heroines coming from you want to know a lot of the ... coming from we have nearly a hundred thousand dead people a year now because the drugs crossing our borders\nAnd here this president saying oh we just want borders but\nYou know we'll we'll put a big door in and we'll just vet people so we know they they come with the best of intentions and love and respect our our way of life and want to be a part of our family it's unbelievable you know border patrol then you've got the sanctuary city and now we have a sanctuary state of California what does that mean\nThat means people that we know are here illegally that broke the law is to get in here no respect for our sovereignty no respect for American law well now we know those people when they got caught committing other crimes some of them well pretty serious\nThose six hundred and forty two thousand crimes I mentioned included yeah murder in some cases\nHow many parents angel moms we put on this program and angel dad on this program and they tell the stories about illegal immigrants that were in the justice system that will let out on the street because they were in a sanctuary city now the sanctuary state of California\nWith a with a sanctuary state free health care for all legal or illegal\nCandidate Gavin Newsom out there in California they're talking about not California Good grief you know we now have on record number of migrant parents entering the U.S with children surging to record lows listen\nThey want their kids here in some cases we've actually found out that people that claim that the young children with them about their children's turned out not to even be their children but they want to beat Donald Trump over the head with a hammer over this he's the one that stopped this family separation he's the one that's been saying build the wall\nHe's the one that's been saying you got to pass laws that I Can't do it by executive ... happened under Obama nobody cared happened under Bush nobody cared but of course the standard double standard is so transparent so obvious we have House Republicans now calling for an investigation here we are watching this these videos of\nMembers of the illegal alien caravan actually being paid according to Congress in ... Florida he wants an investigation into whether the illegal alien caravan now head of the U.S\nAs being bankrolled by wealthy Democrats in America so Larry has to watch you know there was I saw a conspiracy theory tweet out there by some prominent Democrat it'll actually remember the name but\nActually that sources say you're so scared of losing the midterms he's tweeting at the real Donald Trump\nAnd impeachment hearings that you your team influence the caravan so they're blaming Trump for the care about if the dog bites the beef things you're feeling sad\nUm it's Donald Trump fault if he cures cancer he wouldn't be liked by some of these people unbelievable alright eight hundred nine for one shown as a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program\nYou know we also have Trump saying the president saying well we may have to use the military at this point to protect our borders ... he's president today tweeted this morning I must have the strongest the terms as ... Mexico\nTo stop this onslaught and if they're able to do so I won't call up the U.S military and close our southern border\nI'm watching the Democratic party led because they won't open borders and existing week laws of salt in our country by Guatemala Honduras El Salvador\nAnd leaders are doing little to stop the flow of people including many criminals from entering the United states from Mexico in his third tweeting emphasize the importance that he places on stopping the migrants\nFrom ever entering the country said the assault on our country and our southern border including the criminal elements drugs pouring is far more important to me as president than trade or the new trade agreement that he has with Mexico and Canada hopefully Mexico\nWill stop this onslaught at their northern border is that all Democrats fault for week laws have been trying to fix it now for a long time right eight hundred nine four one showing this or toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program Dan is in Michigan Dan Hi how are you\nWelcome to beautiful Palm Beach where here Rush Limbaugh for the full hour on Hannity tonight what's going on Dan how are you\nA son get good hey I'm allowed to just go back to those documents that that are not what the inspector general you know the final court documents that a couple of weeks ago Trump order to be declassified right right okay [noise] and then Rosenstein came over the White House immediately\nAnd I didn't go over from what I understand there was a phone call\nBut I Want to paraphrase what does the same basically I'm a I'm gonna truthfully point on what was the same day he called him up and said look this president myself and my buddies are trying to\nSaid look this president myself and my buddies are trying to impeach you put you in jail if you released documents it's going to prevent us\nFrom teaching your tail and put you in jail and they're probably gonna explode in her face and you are going to be a free man so which do not released because we still working to support your presidency\nAnd then after showing after the phone call Trump find out how all this stuff about Rosenstein and the stuff that was after the phone call why wouldn't Trump realize they're trying to impeach them put them in jail calling us general said get that to the White House sit around the oval office in these two things released threats\nFrom my understanding is there being extra super careful that the president still committed to de classification\nOf releasing the the unwritten acted buys warrants these are the main thing is we need we need the ... weren't applications one we need the gang of eight material to we need what's known as the thrill twos or the reports Bruce or especially\nWith his contacts with Christopher Steele because we already know because there's some of the leaks and communications\nThat Christopher Steele who under oath and under threat of perjury in Great Britain and in in Iraq and tore even he couldn't stand by his own pony fake Russian ... but he was paid for\nAnd I got all these people down to Nelly or doesn't want to talk or Glenn Simpson pleading the fifth Rod Rosenstein not only not turning over documents it's time to talk to the wall Street Journal but no time to talk to a the members of Congress and and hand over the documents\nSo I understand it's on track it's a little more complicated than him just saying release it release of the second lawyers are on it as as the latest that I heard my sources\nBut I think and I hope that they get released before the election because I think the American people deserve to see it\nYeah it well they're trying to put them in jail he needs help himself\nListen I I Will tell you this has been a soft coup attempt\nThere's no doubt about we know what the insurance policy is\nWe don't delete strategy is we know that they knew there was no Russia Trump collusion even in the words of Peter Struck there is no they're they're Lisa Page even saying no we had nothing\nThat's why they started leaking the the phony dot CA information all the left wing or in the news media than ever told them that it was an verified are uncorroborated like they never told the courts that it was on verified uncorroborated they tried to lie to us manipulate us would live from Russia like Hillary paid for it before the election\nAnd they tried to take down a duly elected president after the elections so you're right um but I promise you I'm On it less than I can walk and chew gum at the same time but\nThat big but

S. B. talk I'm going to pretend he's there before I go to anybody else because I Want to talk about this topic and that is what do Republicans in Georgia do to keep the state from slipping\nAnd\nI actually bought a lot about this and there was a lot of data out there um number one and this will be somewhat controversial to some people\nBut it is um you don't invest as much in luring black voters into the Republican Party in Georgia\nThat is not meant to be a bad thing but the\nShows more and more that it is very difficult to get black voters to flip through the Republican Party or in Georgia this is not a nationwide thing I'm Talking about Georgia don't at me\nDon't ask me\nIs actually far easier to convince Hispanic voters\nTo go to the UP without even pay attention to this one or the data suggests very strongly without the GOP even changing his position on immigration\nIs easier to convince Hispanic voters and black voters to come to ... to come to the Republican Party or why is that well the longer Hispanic family stays in the United states you know ... is white and identifies as Republican\nNow again these are just database arguments or don't take offense at um I I'm just telling you the the the question that was going to be asked by the color is what is what is the GOP do how you got to convince Hispanic voters that the Republicans are with them and you know culturally the Republicans are but here's the other thing let's go back to black voters\nI say you should see the phones they all lit up ... when I said did he go go Hispanic not don't focus on black voters measure of the Republican Party in Georgia has been years trying to convince black voters to move to the Republican wave number when they do it really badly\nA ... and number two it is a lot easier than all the data in polling suggest to persuade Hispanic voters instead of white voters but let's not give up on black voters that's not what I'm saying focus more on Hispanic voters but\nCulturally black\nVoters are more and more in line with the Republican Party on cultural issues and because black voters are more and more in line with Republican voters on cultural values based issues there is a way to persuade some you're talking a numbers game\nA there's a way to persuade some to come our way when you combine that with the education issue\nRemember the Democrats candidate for governor is running a campaign where she wants to make history by being the first black female governor nationwide and the first female governor in Georgia\nBut she wants to do so by destroying all of the advances made on the education front by Republicans since they took office in two thousand two Sonny Perdue\nAnd that will set black families back in Georgia\nAnd particularly in the Atlanta school system that is a failing school system are so many school systems in the state in rural areas of the state failing or kids need a way out and the Democrats don't want to give them that you can connect with black moms at that level on education\nYou can connect culturally in economically easier with Hispanic voters in Georgia in the UP really needs to make a go of it and find issues that resonate if nothing else by showing them that Republican policies are good for them or keep them employed keep them in jobs in the ... not hostile to them\nAre now before we go any further down the road we didn't check with Dr ...\nThe written into one of the five and six forty or another do and the the outer due to anybody was founded ... blowout over twenty minutes or four hundred over and I have any by twenty there in God's got ready to rise\nTo anybody down between twenty and twenty five Seventy five\nOn the freeway north of it is not allowed to anybody about it all almost thirty minutes to get over five from Georgia and it's out that they'll be Seventy eighty five today by the before the\nThank you very much ah I don't know that Republicans in Georgia have spent as much time as they should as a party working with their elected officials to try to find economic policies that can grow their coalition\nAnd I know there have been efforts to do this in the past but I just don't know how will they have done and this is something I've thought a lot about uh there's also the Asian business community in Georgia which again the the Republicans Georgia population wise are still\n... ... are still in the majority\nAnd you're going to see this in down ballot races on Georgia where you will see that the Republicans spread down ballot is is much wider in some cases in the top that are highly contested with Democrats but you're going to have to persuade a these voters that the ... for them is good economically and that the party will keep them safe\nSo you need a a party that is tough on crime and you need a party that was good for the free market economically eating at a party that is good on education issues particularly school choice options for mom's a suburban wise one of the things that's hurting the Republican Party right now is suburban white women\nOr don't particularly care for the president but the other issue interestingly enough\nIs that the higher income and educational white voter gets the more likely they are to consider themselves a secular progressive\nAnd as Morse rich secular progressive move into the Democratic party you have an opening for the Republican Party with Hispanic and black voters were culturally conservative Hispanic voters in the United states or the most culturally conservative voters\nIn the United states was Hispanic voters by the way you're talking very small numbers when it comes to the vote\n'em is not a huge percentage of voters who are\nIt's not a huge percentage of voters who are Hispanic in Georgia but it is enough particularly with the trend line to Bruce and there's been a community in Georgia is enough to secure longer term the Republican coalition in Georgia you're still going to
