with us on the Clark Howard show hello Mike hey Clark our it's a great pleasure to speak with you\nWell great to have you here and I'm excited you're going to go to Costa Rica\nMy bike unless I'm really really excited and my boss is awesome and gave me ten days off a story about\nYou are going to love it are you a surfer\nI'm not a surfer but an avid outdoors than any hiker\nOh you're going to have a lot of that in Costa Rica you're gonna you're gonna be surprised at the diversity of the topography through such a small country\nYeah at the beginning with all the research I've been doing\nWell how can I be of service with this upcoming adventure\nShow carpet but no poking around for rental car prices on the Internet on there and Costa Rico oh boy found one on one way to take a look like a dollar a day oh yeah that's probably too good to be truthful and most of the others are in the ...\nOkay so Costa Rica comes with an unpleasant surprise when you rent a car\nOkay the government there is one of the few countries on earth that the government makes you buy a whole bunch of pseudo semi fake crummy insurance type products with your rental\nSo when you see a car rental company for Costa Rica listing raided a dollar a day or five dollars a day or whatever they're just trying to lure un and then for the government mandated semi insurance things they charge you a fortune\nSo we've got a loss leader and what I recommend it in the past with Costa Rica is rent from a well known and recognize company\nBut before you even do that you want disclosure from them which they will have on their website what the mandatory or semi insurances\nAre going to cost you okay\nSo expect the car rental and Costa Rica to be actually a fair amount more money than you have anticipated\nTeen closer to accurate\n... team the closer to accurate\nNo it'll be more than that with all the junk they make you get\nOkay\nBut again there's a range on the junk fees like one company maybe two or three times the cost of another for this stuff that the Costa Rican government requires you have you know normally when I travel somewhere\nI anywhere in the world I refuse all the pseudo insurance if the car rental company tries to get me to get\nBecause of the coverage I have my own auto insurance even outside the United states and then I have a credit card that covers the gaps in what my auto insurance doesn't cover none of those rules apply in Costa Rica\nInteresting\nSo if I tell you what I'd like you to do is go to like trip advisor and read the briefings about renting a car and Costa Rica or just Google a Costa Rican car rental and you'll see the posts people are put up\nAbout all the stuff that comes out of your wallet for Costa Rican rental\nOkay what what is the price range I should be thinking is as close\nI we just all in at the low end you'll be paying thirty five day for a car\nWhile yeah it's a bus or\nYou know that's completely different than a dollar a day isn't it a little bit and I must congratulate you might because you you smell the rat and you wanted to check that out because you knew that they weren't going to rent a car for a dollar a day\nBut then they've got you they're standing in front of the counter and your dollar a day becomes who knows what with all the junk fees they add on and what are you going to do at that point so knowing in advance of knowing what's going to cost that's the right thing Jenny joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Jenny\nHow are you I'm doing great how are you\nGood tell me how I can be of

thing is starting to the joints whatever you call it where do you open it up and had it starting to sound like it's a two hundred year old man trying to get up from us over somebody's making these terrible crunching noises and all that\nAnd I just won't let go of it because it's been so good and it's been so cheap\nEven said for all my banking on line I'm self employed I have a free kick in credit card transactions for my clients but some still have a chance they write checks so\nI'm used to use an app on my phone to take their check check and make a deposit that way sure would I be able to do that on a crown fires and I\nYou know I wouldn't do that on your phone because you're you have any out from the financial institution you're making the deposit with that is a better safer more
