Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton care fiasco they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out the Republicans when they took power Clinton was smart enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick Morris and others to move to more to the center right\nAnd we were able to get to a balanced budget it was one the Republicans put together they finally got Bill Clinton assign it and it worked but it was more at a political necessity than any any principles that that he held deeply liberalism\nIs a failed law the ideology that never works it seems\nGreat on paper free health care free they care free free free\nYou know we got this guy running out the Gavin Newsom in California three everything for everybody whether you're a citizen a non

so many important skills that we had you may be surrounded by technology\nIt right now Sean but you had the benefit of growing up at a time when your formative years you had to learn how to have conversations face to face when you know I was thinking about my middle school than the other day I you know that boy had to get the courage up to walk across that dance floor face to face asked me if I Want it to ...\nTo tell you where I was I was in the corner hanging out with my buddies and I wasn't I can anybody dance that wasn't happening\nBut you but you had those important moments face to

off\nIt I'm torn with you because I Will say when my son was young\nAnd I guess it was a battle of the time but I got um a PlayStation ... for and we were playing Scooby Doo night of a hundred and ... and ... this four year old kid learn how to figure out how to get to the twelfth level and and kill the mastermind long before I could ever figure it out and I tell a\nFunny I tell a funny story in the book about that because my dad is the least tech savvy person in the world hates all that stuff and he got a ticket the super Mario Brothers and I\nCan do about that\nYour brothers and I can do about that but you know but I think about all these kids they now get on line of international competitions on X. box and I mean I I watch my son played two X. box is at the same exact time\nYeah it's

I'm not saying throw away all the AIDS all your phone in the river ever do any of that stuff all saying is is that when you're raising your kids or even by yourself you have to remember\nThat certain things can't be done online you still have to learn that eye contact for these kids that go on job interviews still have to be able to get their hobby that's a personal relationships\nAnd excel if you're an adult and you're sitting with our phone next\nTo your bed at night you wake up for ... breaking it keeps you up in the middle of the night and that blue light and then they didn't find the ... bridge asleep that's a problem I heard from so many people that said that it was interfering with their\n... were out of me I listen I did enjoy having Twitter fights with people a lot and I will it it was so much it it was well I think probably a little too much I mean I was I mean there would be announcements a game on Hannity that it\nWith you know Alec Baldwin ... Jimmy Kimmel whoever I happened to be fighting of the time\nAnd I realized that became another job but more importantly hey when what happened with our Twitter account was compromise what was what's compromised and I just finally said this is ridiculous and I I just took it off my phone I don't I I ... Linda does the tweeting\nAnd somebody at Fox does the tweeting I just you know I said please tweet those south pleased to meet that I don't have to do\nBut there's also a component here too because we often talking politics about instant gratification and whatnot he is the gratification society people don't get processed anything anymore nobody in Destin I think if you look at dating in relation to anyone who has teenager should be terrified because these you know these apps\nAnd kids are in social media what kids are doing all these sites it's all very overwhelming and you\nCan't remember that relationships are requiring that all the\nValues that we value on not to talk about conservative values all on out pointed it that's great but a lot of that going by the wayside with with the ... so that you can't play video games and you can't have fun and I watch a a bitch watch something on like but you also have to remember to have these conversations with your kids have to have these conversations with yourself you yourself the\nSocial media behavior ... pop stars it's\nNot it has gotten ... there's no doubt I mean like\nA certain amount of fighting I'm not going to sit here and why I kinda like\nAnd it's entertaining to watch people bubble in ... when you take a shot at these old leaders in uh Hollywood or left wing or but anyway the book is great do not disturb how it goes to my cell phone to take back my life should have diabetes ... and of course you seal off and on the Fox news channel now that she has been rescued from the view and\nWe're we appreciate you being back with us and it's good to hear your voice thanks for being here\nThank you so much on greatly appreciate it\nI Want to go back to what happened earlier today at the White House when Jim Brown and Kanye West met with the president it was an unbelievable exchange or play a little extended version of it here and then we'll try to get some calls and listen to this\nYou know people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats I have a a I\nHave conversations that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it is it to a limit to amount of jobs are so the the father's lose their jobs and they say we'll give you more money for having more kids in your home and then we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner rapes just shot up and now you have ...

how's it going\nClocks I I have been wanting to fix your ... about this for some time over the past six or\nEight months I have been hit up on line by\nSellers of a certain open source media player it sounds too good to be true on one hand they claimed that if you buy this stick from us that you know you can basically have free access to any program any movie any sporting event that you want\nAnd is this the Cody again yes yes oh man\nI'm getting so many calls about Cody K. O. D. I. and Cody itself is not illegal at all the things that people are marketing the Cody for or illegal activities\n[noise] this is what I'm trying to cut through because I've done a little bit of online research about it and it's difficult because you get such a disparity opinion some people say it's legal if the best thing since sliced bread et cetera et cetera others say\nYou know buyer user be where and I'm having a hard time sort of figuring out what the truth about it is\nLet me give you the straight story okay right what's different than Cody versus something like the Roku is are you familiar\nWith Roku are okay you oh sure yeah All right\nSo Roku controls what programming can go on its device and so they make sure that people are copyright compliant\nBit the programming that's going on it is legal Cody media player on the other hand is like truly an open source kind of thing so Cody itself is not doing anything else\nTo Cody itself is not doing anything illegal at all but it provides a platform where the pirate stealing content can put their content and sell you access to it operates through the Cody media player\nSo there's lots of legal content you can watch on her Cody\nBut it's the same kinds of stuff you legally can watch on a Roku or other competitors of Roku\nAnd so the difference is Roku is not going to allow somebody who is pirating\nUh let's say soccer game from Europe\nFor free or NFL football or NBA basketball or the latest episodes of some HBO show\nThat you're able to stream supposedly for free through Cody they're not they're not saying for a year pay 'em like thirty dollars or fifty dollars and it gives you this license supposedly you're able to watch all that kind to\nThirty the if the price point for the stick is that what you're referring\nNo I'm Talking about when somebody says hey we're going to provide you\nAll the programming from blah blah blah and so that then you access through the Cody media player Cody itself is just a platform\nBut it is a gateway for the crux the pirates to sell people programming that you are not legally supposed to have [noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n... my name's Nigel ... is an educated out well I Know the difference between what's why an unwise suffered needlessly without uh due symptoms unwise getting a free tend they sampled ... quite five [noise]\nCycle

investigation of that\nBut here's one of the greatest weirdness as I can think of\nFrontier airlines one of the deep discount airlines has reduced its fee for changing cancellation and in fact if you book a ticket way ahead and you decide three months or more out that you're not going to go they charge you know the at all and give your money back\nSo\nIt's so weird that the three full affairs American United and delta charge these massive change fees and even one of the hard discounters charges last or nothing\nBut goes without saying that if you want to avoid junkies you only have one choice in the United states and that southwest two bags free every flight and no change fees\nBridget with us on the Clark Howard show hello Bridget\nThank Clark idea when great thank you Bridget somebody keeps giving you a gift day after day and you want him to stop giving you that gift\nI keep trying to return it later fall stop being a target for a while they are and that's\nProbably one of my main concern so how how old your market daily paper ally slip in the\nRye and silver advertising circular onto my driveway at least once a week actually like from tiny thing for who I Am very good about cutting now call them and not having academics illiterate when I'm Out of town and they travel frequently Wayne advertise a little circular\nHigher up when I'm Out of town and we are now for the fat cow\nI called the circulation you depart land on the paper and the number lifted\nAnd they actually how anything will they well they said they\nLie and they're not getting your phone ... the battle ... always newspapers so many people no longer get a daily newspaper that a lot of newspapers are doing this week cleared twice weekly delivery of sales fires\nAnd they may have an outer package that has like a news article or two in it and that's it and there's really just an excuse to\nWhen it and that's it and it's really just an excuse to have all the flyers delivered\nTo you and\nYou're a non customer they're throwing these typically only to the driveways are people who don't subscribe to the paper and I don't even know if they have an address system to prevent dropping it at your address in by the way\nAre I think over the years you're the third or fourth person who's called me complaining about this\nStudy I can I can kind of what kind of a litter or an end or something like that now\nI don't think so now let me tell you what I Do I'm like my own unofficial neighborhood watch champion and as I walked through the neighborhood\nWhenever I see you let's say somebody gets a Sunday paper and there are way you know you can tell their what they didn't get their paper and it's like noon or I see one of those advertising supplements thrown\nIt is I hide those things that go put it behind a Bush or whatever that as well\nAnd so when I Would say is that you need to have some kind of buddy system with a neighbor that you look out for them they look out for you because even if you get that circular stop by some miracle for awhile\nTurnover is going to happen somebody else is going to be throwing them and you're going to get one\nSo it's gonna have to be something where neighbors work together to prevent because it's such an easy mark for a burglar last weekend a neighbor had for newspapers there subscriber they afford newspapers sitting at\nThe foot of their driveway and you know they were already starting to turn yellow a couple of them I mean that's a into a bird or come on in we're gone out have added\nExactly yeah well I I appreciate it ...

have a question about my daughter is traveling to Italy on a school trip and\nHow lucky is she she gets half the fun you get to pay for it you stay home that doesn't sound like a deal to me\nIt doesn't sound fair I'm\nSo her question is how ... what is the best way to bring spending money to Italy is 'cause she's kind of shying away from using a debit card because of um identity theft issues\nHow old is your daughter she's twenty okay does she have any major credit card yet\nNo not yet she's tried to get a store credit card but she doesn't make enough money according to them to qualify for a credit card\nSo what I Would recommend in this case she very responsible as a person she is All right you know what I Would recommend that you with your cards see which of your credit cards does not charge of foreign currency\nTransaction junk the yup and do you know if any of yours or the free for foreign travel\nI'm not sure no I'd have to look into\nThe how many cars do you have I have to any chance one of them are capital one\nOne is the capital one where my odds that he would say yes capital one was the pioneer in issuing cars that don't charge foreign currency junk fees yep just make sure that the capital one car do you have doesn't charge those chunk phase okay\nThen get her and authorized user card you can get that like just a few days\nEr card you can get that like just a few days\nAnd she travels with that and with the beauty of that is that she can use it all across the Italy\nAnd she will be able to purchase things at once those bankers buying rate which is the actual real rate of transaction that we'd go on between the U.S dollar and the euro\nOkay now as far as ATMs\nDoes she have a a a credit union account or bank account or whatever\nYes a bank account regular savings account a checking account at a federal savings back\nOh and in a federal savings bank you don't hear about those much anymore now so the ah federal savings bank those are those are kind of like almost like wise I credit unions\nSo they may not charge or big fee for her using an ATM card to withdraw euros she needs them in Italy\nOkay yeah she was going to check into her back to see if what the fees were\nSo normally that's the best combination that you have a major credit card that charges no foreign currency drunk fees\nAnd you have an ATM card that doesn't hit you up with a bunch of junk fees that an ATM give you a comparison most of the big banks charge a ten dollar per transaction fee when you withdraw money at an ATM outside the United states\nWow that's the law is huge and so a lot of credit unions a usa as an example of a bank that doesn't charge a fee when used the ATM overseas oh in Charles Schwab the stock brokerage she have any investments or do you have any investments for her\nNo no we don't\nOkay for them for other people I mentioned Charles Schwab has a ATM card that allows I'm limited withdrawals fee free in the United states and overseas\nRuled taxes have not found your returns the IRS will get you they can pick your property take you to court even put you in jail with one called to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS

H. I.

West and calling out as mental illnesses and saying he's the token and all that stuff\nI don't know why nobody is asking why are you saying the same things about Mr Jim Brown who is also a supporter of the president who also is going to be at the White House\nOr you say he's an educated needs to read a book that he's a token I'm just curious why the liberal media would never say something like that about Mr Jim Brown because I think we all know the answer Brian you would probably show up in person and ... that and he's a pretty intimidating or even at the age he is he's an awesome and very intelligent\nHe supports our president and you notice the liberal media is not say anything and I wish the conservative side of things we're kind of point that out that they they pick and choose why\nOwens Jerry represented I I like I like your come back but you can just know that is the way they're going after Jim Brown they say well he's gotten older\nAnd they're going after number two they say you know in the sixties and seventies he had some clashes with women I have no idea the details of it but they do well you know back then it was big news 'cause he was not only a Hollywood star he was only sports stories a Hollywood star\nNow they're coming back and saying oh wait a second we don't like the way he treated women in the sixties and seventies and he had an incident with this current wife with their with their car now the black community that was saying back off Jim Brown they don't like his message now they're saying well he had problem with women and this may to where he's not politically correct that twice lashing out\nSo just be ready for it especially if he comes out and says positive things today after lunch\nDavid Lucy on the Fox is ready lap in San Antonio Hey David\n[noise] very very good ... good morning what's on your mind\nWell I'm very concerned about the vocal minority in this country that gets much more attention than they deserve a thought it was a majority rule kind of thing but I don't know the press is so much account at two of us very small group of people that influences\nMillions that are listening to Fox News from other media stations\nWhile I mean Ninety two percent of the coverage is negative it was it up from Ninety so now Ninety two percent of the coverage is is negative on the ... the United states so why I mean even surprised she has forty one percent approval rating or forty four percent whatever it is of late I think that's the average now\nGet the second longest period with no major hurricane striking the United states so so you look at things like that and what they do is take a short period of time and confused that uh what they need to do really as alarm the population a list what I\nA man called imaginary ... of alarm with which they need to frighten the population to get otherwise onerous regulations like the Paris climate accord an act I mean who who in their right mind and why would they not\nAnd a quarter an act I mean who who in their right mind and why would the United states and act just harmful in economically crippling legislation like a carbon taxes or the Paris climate accord so unless there was not imminent catastrophe that we need to prevent a and that's why they're doing is they're painting\nEvery natural calamity and like I mentioned before things like tornadoes which had been in the long term decline and believe it or not forest fires are also long term decline\nEven though the way he seems like all of California is burning all the time\nRight there are localized increases in in California and we can that that's actually an interesting story Cal Fire\nHere I'm getting off on a different subject but the Cal Fire ministers almost twenty five million acres of the lower lying non mountainous training and their forest fires are actually declining over the last several decades in California's a high mountainous areas controlled by the U.S Forest Service\nWe have seen an increase there but it's probably due to different a forest management practices were how they have not\nPreviously they had control burns that cleared outlawed of the brush in fact the head of Cal fire's said there were four to five times as many trees in that area controlled\nBy the U.S Forest Service than what a healthy forest wouldn't wouldn't normally have just imagine you got all these trees competing for the little bit of moisture there\nWell I mean when you had the other scientists is I Believe in climate change because I Believe in science would not tell them\nWhy of course that's a misnomer of course climate is changing of course there's there's I don't I Know of\nNo one who disputes that uh it's pretty clear we've been warming but the warming started three hundred plus years ago it started in the ear sixteen Ninety five in the depths of the little ice age and we've been warming ever sense there's really not much in the last hundred and fifty years that looks\nA different for the first hundred and fifty years of the three hundred year warming so\nSure that that's what I hear as old as the climate change deniers and none of my I'm a climate skeptic at in terms of I'm skeptical of a human link that's leading to catastrophic\nClimate change ah I see the same natural forces in in place\nDriving temperatures up and down and up and down ever since it has since the dawn of time and those\nAre what Michael Mann and Al Gore want your listeners to believe is that those those same natural forces that have been driving temperatures up and down suddenly seized at the beginning of the twentieth century really really that's not how science works and your listeners know that\nSo those same ... Hussein natural forces are that have caused a temperatures to increase in I'll I'll remind your listeners that historically going back forty five hundred years or so\nUm is the rise and fall of temperatures and clearly relate to the rise and fall of civilizations when it's warming period like we're in right now you can grow crops you can be great harvests and it's the cold\nPeriods really are bad each cold\nPeriod is corresponds to famine a death mass the population is just the opposite of what we're being told that he used to be before climate science became politicized these warming periods recalled climatic optimal and why were they called that because\nFor the earth and humanity worm has historically been\nReally really good and the cold periods like coming out of out of the little ice age have been really really bad\nAnd we should be we should all be thankful that you know we're in a warming warming period we can grow more food CEO twos fertilizing the plants are growing more crops\nUm humanity and if the news and climate I went to the audience you you were in September twenty eight year in St Louis Missouri and you would not treated well let's listen to\nClimate models over predict warming and climate models used by the inter governmental panel on climate change they over predict warming by two two and a half times too much three times [noise]\nBank that perpetuates the lie and create the apathy so you you as you get interrupted by people that don't agree with you\nYeah it's it's really [noise] Brian as a scientist it's it it's disheartening to me to see what's\nGoing on with that was really a dummy nation of of the scientific process they used to be that that the scientific process welcomed people with counter counter views and and they would test those views but today we have to be shouted down the true science\nThere's views but today we have to be shouted down the true science deniers or those on the left that are the ... on the ayatollah of alarm is there they cannot allow any science\nOr any information and the fact that might dispute their their their notion of manmade catastrophic warming because if you get that in there and you start they accept one thing it's kind of like the camel's nose under the tenth and\nUh they're almost admitting that they they can't admit that there is a debate\nAnd there is a myth that would mean that the sciences and settle\nWhich I did a lot of places Greg since you do have a point of view and that people like Al Gore overstaying is\nShort or just for ... well I spoke at a recent scientific conferences uh in Houston where I was a greatly received there I I just got out of a conference in Pittsburgh my home base here this week\nUh there was ... I'm I'm hated by some but I accept that uh\nAnd uh but I'm Out there I'm trying to preach preach the gospel of of scientific facts in the scientific process and and getting the inconvenient tracks out there are so I'm being welcomed actually by a large number of scientists who so far have been\nSilenced rather it's tougher even scientists that believe is I Do to come forward um\nBecause there's like you take a lot of heat yeah ... not everyone can do it by a\n... a ... day so much she or pick up his book in inconvenient fact the science that Al Gore doesn't want you to know Greg thanks thanks brought\nA that was a that was great so meanwhile what do you think when they take take for all eight seven six six nine you know the big three things we're talking about what we just discussed as well as Eric Holder or joining with Hillary Clinton on one theme is okay to get violent and act to an simply because you lose elections\nAnd Donald Trump or talks to us for forty five minutes on television and does a touch on is big meeting on race relations with Jim Brown and Kanye West at noon\nAnd ...

I don't remember that at all that maybe she wouldn't have come forward because she must have known\nThat she has a zero back up the you know that the only ... supposedly have told people but it was Twenty years after the fact\nAh when she told her therapist or some of her friends at the beach she had no contemporaneous backup whatsoever and meanwhile haven't had a variety of people\nBut everybody she named said that never happened now ... you know who knows who knows the reality but the fact is that that are under any definition of due process\nThey got to process and he was a you

I'm not saying do anything inappropriate he followed up\nWith it because it clearly when you say something like that you know it's going to be incendiary the question I have is how do we get to the other side of these issues which you over so many different issues all the time and I don't see that these leaders are ... and and it can be true as well for for conservative leaders and Republican leaders that\nWe have the same kind of conversations about civility but no one gets the other side\nOf that you know we don't end Vance them in any way and I'm really listening for the person that's going to bring us the next level make us think differently and\nFor their President Trump has a lot of positives to have a lot of fault so what are the things that we do it's for news is that we are completely non party than I like covering the news an unbiased way but he has challenged people to think differently about issues rightly or wrongly and I think that that's really important for\nStrongly and I think that that's really important for the civil discourse today whoever you\nAre ... are born in Saudi Arabia but work has contributed the Washington Post seems to have been lured into a ... or the Turkish embassy and killed a there was word is we think he's dead they picked up ... and it was a big set up to ... the men\nAre Saudi teams may have arrived to get them out we're trying to get to the bottom of it oh\nWhat is at stake here I mean we asked the president that here's what he said cut a cook thirty for\nMy children are going on there and you can be killing more earnest has everything that we ever know sir is in jeopardy now I I really don't know how\nTo find out what happened I mean I Do I have no doubt and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out what I\nMean he's extremely tight with Saudi Arabians a crown prince who's really running things did you not take too long my right Jonah\nWell listen and he asked if he wants that pastor out of turkey as well so the relationship with turkey is also tense right now\nTo think about this story number one is a journalist it's operating freely in America I think it should be a lesson to all journalists and all consumers of news there are so many people here stateside that complain about the treatment of journalists you want to know what when bad treatment of journalists go anywhere else other than America and that's what you're going experience\nI mean it's interesting that this happened in Turkey one of the\nPlaces that has the most journalists in prison than anywhere else in the world and yet this is this you know the Turks\nAre coming on and saying you know Turkish government's coming on and and trying to take a stand because they're they're not happy with Saudi Arabia\nSo there's a lot of different undercurrents here I don't know how big of a stand the president can take on this issue I mean obviously clearly it's bad I mean what happened to this journalists you see some of the graphic reports it's frightening\nUm but there's a lot I mean they're just a lot ten packed are really looking forward to your conversation with Senator Corker I just don't I don't know what the I don't know what the right call is for the president I think it offers a lot of perspective for those of us who value freedom and the press and really\nWant other journalists to be able to operate freely so we can all have an idea of what's accurately happening in the far flung places in the world I mean we really important for us would assume you're talk stories do you run\nThe ... you know one of the big stories that was sort of I mean because it's listen it's not the most exciting has been about ... you know gas prices that's been a really big and you know the gas prices are in your for your highest we haven't seen the levels and oils and all of a long time and some I think this is an interesting fact right every recession in the last five recessions has been\nPredated with a spike in oil prices so there you know you see what's happening with the markets and you see what's happening\nWith stocks and questions about interest rates and inflation oil as part of that so we're really taking a look at that and the president had an interesting announcement about wanting to make the fuel that's more a mixed with ethanol corn byproduct\nAvailable year round and they're you know there's a lot of strong feelings about that\nIt can actually damage your car Brian I don't know if you knew that but some cars can actually take that blends and um so it's really it's kind of I think that destroyed it happening with fuel and the economy is a really big one it's one that we're really covering this week I was wondering if because it affects every part of our life even if you don't drive so that's definitely one of our watching\nAnd we'll see what's going on or economy doing good tank yesterday losing eight hundred points to say because the bedrooms interest rates 'cause every little panicky or it's weird to help you you are as an economy the more the interest rates go up ... to go down\nThat makes people nervous 'cause it's a it's a way that makes them more expensive for us to borrow money you know but let's see it's hard to watch the markets every every other day you know you got to take\nIt in a month period and see what's happening but it definitely scarce and people and when people start throwing around the world word recession I think we have to be careful you have to do it responsibly and we were nowhere clear that near that were near full employment but you know we've been on a ride for a little while everyone's wondering when they'll be a little bit of a breather and I think that that's a fair question to debate\nDo Kanye West is going to lunch with Jim Brown and the president did you go to a prominent African American wanted you to know when I bleed activists who was the president's agenda should be or who should be their agenda and there were two black communities agenda on looking back\nAt a at the black vote over the last three ... three Republicans all are under twenty percent McCain Romney in Trump and now the three ... more than the other two\nDo you ever see their rebalancing yeah back to a party that actually freed the slaves Nineteen sixty and had the black vote up until Nineteen sixty\nI think when it comes to vote for anyone whether to try and block voters women's vote or Hispanic voters I think there's a tendency to try to think about all of them in the you know get these very specific groups that have very specific needs and and a lot of ways divide all of us I think there's some very you know there's some interesting analysis and you've\nGot to dig into the way people registered to vote and whether or not\nThey vote but at the end of the day I think it's really about the economy for everyone and I'll be really curious what the what the\nI think it's really about the economy for everyone and I'll be really curious what the what the um the results in the mid term election are when it comes to a different category of race and ethnicity and then moving forward I just I I tend to believe that people are kind of affected equally when it comes to some of these major issues with the economy like and you can I get a John\nCan I take care of my kids in my face and those are really basic questions that everyone needs answered so\nYeah I I don't I think all of that it can change is it a long way is short short answer I think all and it's going to be changing and I don't think I'm\nJust like we've

percent\nInstead of talking terror or the senator from California wanted to talk only about Kavanaugh when are the Democrats are going to let it go what do you hope comes out of this meeting\nWould ride it probably saying I have a lot of African American support a lot has developed over the last little while with Kanye coming out and he came out a long time ago for me but it was much less fashionable frankly\nA that was a Donald Trump joining us on Fox and friends today talking about race relations in the White House's Kanye West and the great Jim Brown will be joining him for lunch do do the Democrats actually fear the Republicans making inroads in the black community because they just seem to mock anybody that does\nThem or one that was really says that you know when they go low we all know [laughter]\nThe alternative is not to go back to Iran\nBecause if you read Saudi Arabia decided America's Best interest to leave all the Sunni sections of the middle east out we don't want to turn Yemen over to the who the rebels supported by the Iranians because of this or would could be a murder of that Americans\nAre a naturalized American citizen so what do we do with the right thing to do\nWhile the first thing to do courses to to let this uh you know play out over the next short period\nOf time unless let's get additional facts and let's see if we can figure out exactly what has happened not what we think as happened but to to know what has happened um look they they they still are going to be a country as you know it's very wealthy they they have a you know they've had we've had an alliance with them but\nLook it's a it's going to be hugely damaged and uh I Know that Congress there at the lowest point with Congress that they've ever ban since I've been hearing them I've been up by the way of\nA friend of Saudi Arabia is okay I've tried I've tried to ... keep a arms sales from\nBeing blocked by Congress and have been successful up until this point I Would not be successful in that on the floor to die and I don't know that I Would even attempt\nTo be successful I probably am now moving in another direction with them but look we we we still going to have to have a relationship we got relationship with other countries that\nI'm On certain things that we disagree with strongly and so you know look Turkey's a NATO ally and yet we've got significant conflicts with them and northern Syria so so\nAnd it conflicts with them and northern Syria so [noise]\nSo uh it just will change the relationship the warmth all dissipate uh it'll be far more businesslike and certainly there are going to be put at at arm's length on many issues that we deal with them all and there's an arrogance that has developed with them over the last year and a half\nA an entitlement there's just something about the way they deal with us now that is very very different you got this young leader whose phenomenal from the standpoint of his vision and intelligence on TALK about the crown\nFrance I mean what he wants to do in Saudi Arabia\nBrian as you know is is nothing short of breath taking in a positive way but if you don't nip it in the bud you know we know that torture chamber set up and and the Ritz Carlton he's consolidated power power\nHe's arrested his own family but if you don't nip and the but the fact that you can't go around the world killing\nAmerican citizens then who knows where next they go so we got to have\nA very serious response to this and nip it now he could be around for another forty or fifty years\nThe U.S Senator

N. I. S. was there's especially that one looks like it might be on Fox Nation one of these three will be that to the newer books or to begin to seven\nThirty and get the tickets and get personalized book of Andrew Jackson every other word every ticket to get the paperback version with the brand new afterward\nAnd in Nashville, Tennessee on the twentieth ... on the on the twenty first that'll be seven thirty I'll be able to talk about oh three books America great from the start is what we call it and therefore I took about three books how we got to the point where all these books were written\nGeorge Washington secret six Thomas Jefferson the Tripoli pirates in Andrew Jackson America New Orleans you also find out uh what is in the works and has been for the last year should be done in about seven months or the other project to a gym extremely excited about\nSo there's more that over a right after those three events the book comes out on the twenty third and on friday I Will be in St Louis hopefully get everybody here from Ninety seven one listeners at seven o'clock to beat the St Louis library then it's off the next day Saturday the twenty seven to Baton Rouge the great American lecture series\nThen I'll go to New Orleans I just get a lot of emails saying hey Brian you do the battle of New Orleans but you don't go to New Orleans I'm doing it now for the paperback away there or one o'clock in the afternoon Octavia Octavia books so be there now if you didn't write this down it'd be driving right now don't worry about to go to Brian kill me dot com it's all there don't forget will be in Grand Rapids Michigan\nHere is would you talked about Hillary Clinton in the lead the charge and ... which were all college who's into something else that I think I totally plowed over and there was no follow up question from Christine on on the poor ...\nThe Republicans have systematically suppressed voters and probably as many as twelve million voters were purged by Republicans governments in states between twenty twelve and twenty sixteen [noise]\nSo we know that Democrats have to turn out an even bigger numbers and a lot of congressional districts and states to be successful because they're\nBeing you know pushback by a headwind that is trying to prevent them or discourage them from voting\nWe wish you get there for well\nI don't know all of the statistics and people that are on the right would be able to argue that point by point number by number with her go through each state and explain why actions were taken too I mean take dumped on people who were double registered off the rules are people who had passed away off the rolls things like that\nUm she's speaking to something that the left truly beliefs um voter suppression\nAs I call it is something that they think is happening as it is not even a conspiracy theory for them it is just the fact that Republicans are are trying to suppress people from voting Republicans would say no we want more people to vote\nBut we want people to register to vote and to do so legally and therefore that's why they're trying to like for example Nikki Haley in South Carolina when she was governor said a voter id actually\nWill encourage more people to vote it will get more people into the system [noise] um anyway what Hillary is saying is a talking point that they use\nThat it might sound a little crazy to conservatives but Brian they truly believe that that's a good topic actually for me to do with Tucker next week\nThey ready for that yeah I just don't I don't mind you starting their conversation going I was talking to Brian on the radio with that so I can tell me on the radio you as we used ... I don't want them to use think us like some other Brian\nThere you as we use my legs I don't want them to use think us like some other Brian right like I don't know who else ... possibly be a pretty much don't even need a good idea actually because the electoral\nCollege want is something that people talk about but they don't have a lot of they don't have a lot of the statistics behind them on the history behind them so that's what I tried to do with that and voter suppression and the issue of it I'll do that next week\nSo there's a big story out today people making a big deal of Eric Holder saying what he said on top of would Hillary Clinton said there's no time for civility basically as long as we keep losing elections until we get the house or the Senate so do you have a problem with this\nYou just time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are going to be dedicated as they are to be committed to say on\nThe you know when they go low we all know that\nThey go low we can read\n\nWas the Democratic warnings about\nThe president on Fox and friends said this\nTo better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're discussing safe but for him to make for him to make a statement of like that is a very dangerous state but you know they talk about\nUs we are exactly opposite you know the rally is where they show the people I I heard somebody yesterday on your show actually talking about my rallies\nThat my rallies or really calm and and well run and and packed with people we don't have problems that arose and I would say this but it wasn't so successful for those protesters\nBut they have to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous what older shows\nSo I play that for Chris Wallace and he says I'm totally blown outta proportion that it is not a big deal with Eric Holder said Dana Perino way and you could use\nYour server I I'm ... and and looking at it so regardless of what I think Michelle Obama didn't like it right he was using her language and she said no no no that's not that's not what I meant that's not that's not what I'm born she's trying to be the leader that she wants to be and that she would like to have for the country\nI I didn't know that Michelle Obama weighed in on whatever and yeah and I only got on Twitter so I didn't see a lot but she was basically like oh now\nThat's not that's not where I Am I'm\nHowever I also think that there is a way you can blow things out of proportion for example when at all of the rallies Trump starts to chanting lock her up or or somebody starts at lock her up and and he's not that the president does it but\nAnd it's it's a a laugh line if you look at what Eric Holder's doing he was trying to rally up a crowd small crowd and a little room but they all laughed and so\nI can I don't want to blow anything out of proportion I Am concerned do more about the deeds\nRight because Brian you know personally like it's not so much to say oh go harass people and let's say nothing happened no but they're actually harassing people so for me when it turned those from words ... that's a huge\nHuge concern so everybody's talking about a disposition which has got a new procedure because of prison United States or put them on the nurse who Security Council\nAnd that is open chair now ... at the un and a lot of people have their candidates you I mean we've heard our Ryan Zinke he was in the air for for an interview uh people are brought up senator Ayotte I've thought Joe Lieberman might be fine for this\nBut also deleting Kennedy just go out to be Dina Powell I Want you you would deal with talk recall ...\nPowell seems like a nice person wants people why Kurt she the right person for the job that's the question\nWas she's worked on behalf of virtually every idea that President Trump ran against in his two thousand sixteen campaign from people remember said it was time for America to act on its own behalf for one's internationally and to avoid pointless and counterproductive wars I Lived in the ...\nThey are not before joining the Trump Administration she was a partner at Goldman Sachs she was president of the Goldman Sachs foundation that's the nonprofit arm of the investment pack\nWhile they're short extensively with another ... famous foundation the Clinton Foundation and they work together on various goals that most voters would find repugnant\nShow me your thoughts on this well so um\nI I get I'm agnostic as to who the president supports um I hadn't heard that Joe Lieberman one that's interesting but I think the president is going to want some of that he knows and trust that is really important to him\nSo the Ryan Zinke he uh pick would make sense to me Dina power for him and I think that ... that he just had something wrong here like she didn't work for the Clinton Foundation and actually the program that she worked on she created was called ten thousand women and it was a way to help\nYoung women entrepreneurs from around the world to figure out a way to become entrepreneur self sufficient they did not use a dime of government money I'm pretty sure President Trump would like that there was no government money\nPlus Dina Powell at the national Security Council actually wrote President Trump's national security strategy when that document came out it was widely praised\nBy most except for on the far left and one of the things that she focused on most is or what the president is concerned about and because I watch soccer I Know he's concerned\nAh what the president is concerned about and because I watched Tucker I Know he's concerned about the number one enemy the United states identified as China\nAnd not the middle east um she was in Russia and she was really strong about pulling out of the Iran deal right supported the president on that so I think that um criticism about her on those things are probably a probably on his ... way back when when I first met her she worked for Newt Gingrich\nWow uh I Do get to be the main thing saying that she would be the best person for that job so and I don't think it's it's a it's it's I I don't think it's a small back to the Nikki Haley was woman and I think that he could have more women and more minorities in his\nCat on he knows her and she's worked for him on foreign policy\nAnd so he could trust her right now I think that that's really important I don't think that he could go with like a as an outsider like a Joe Lieberman because or even Kelly Ayotte who I think he knows that because of the Gorsuch shepherding during the Supreme Court nomination but doesn't know her as well as he would know Edina pal he used to brief him every day well and by the way\nKelly Ayotte at first after the Access Hollywood tape came out she says I Would not want him as a role model yeah I Know he got over the Nikki Haley a snob but maybe that might be an issue I Hope it's not\nMeanwhile about your issue about Mrs Obama coming out you're a hundred percent right the Daily Caller right to they'll take the quote from there it was Obama said she stands by her motto when things holders alternative is not a proper message for children\nAbsolutely here's a quote beer is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised I Want them to think about life in their opportunities do you want them to be a breed of their neighbors do you want them angry do you want them vengeful which model do you want them to live by and I have to think about that as a mother wow\nYeah that's pretty that's a really strong ... pitch that's better that's a better word a ever ever ever view of the comments but the thing is Brian\nAfter the Democrats are just they're so frustrated because they can't find a message that's working they're always on defense and the base the progressive base things that they're not fighting enough they think they should be more cynical meaner and\nNot a great way to win elections even though they might be able to win back the house I don't think it sets them up while the wind back the Senate and I think they're in a real deficit going into twenty twenty\nSo a Bob Corker who's juice on and I never even though he's always been pretty candid especially now that he's leaving he came out and said that he was offered a few weeks ago a opportunity joined the Trump Administration I Want to share the soundbite with the ... would you ever except for the Trump Administration\n[noise] you know who knows um\nAh you know they they discuss something with my three or four months ago and [noise] and ah it was a it was a you know certainly an honor\nUm it wasn't a particularly tough assignment and you know as you know I mean yes of to me this is all about public service if the white tough assignment came up where you felt like you were making a difference or certainly I Would never say never\nEven though the message got lost in

[laughter] and I\n\nI always had to arrange with pre loaded max but it's amazing how fast you can go through all those rounds there's nothing more aggravating and having to stop and reload everything when you get into a good read them you know when you find your focus and concentration and you're\nYou're just really on top of acquiring your target and you want to get right back into it instead of having to stop\nAnd reload max the administrative work is what I call it\nTake a look at your old speed letters and be honest about it they will go lane compared to the ... this was literally the fast this letter in the world and if you doubt me for even a second you got to go to ... dot com\nThis comes from this was one of the things that was it was disgusting to the Lacey Act if you received an odd package and um there were a couple of hundred and make sure I guess this this correctly um policy Mike and wrote about this as well\nSo here's an example\nSay you own a small business that you important fish from another country and then you distributed to restaurants one day you're expecting your usual shipment arrives but not in court cardboard boxes the way it usually does this time it's in plastic\nAnd it turns out that the originated in country bands the shipment of fish and plastic so you've just violated a foreign law or the Lacey Act the least yet by the way is what they tried to get gives them guitar with\nYou remember that Gibson guitar was completely fine when it was importing rose would for its front boards and they argument under the previous administration was that they were in violation of the Lacey Act which they were not and it was trying to pack them with a number of felonies\nThis was when I first heard about this book because it was like this sounds like they're really trying to drum up something and that's when I started looking into ... I'm like how the hell is that a felony and I went in and started looking at the um so ... so anyway you own a small business you're importing fish is safe to seafood restaurant\nSo you got 'em your shipment and it comes it comes in plastic instead of cardboard boxes so that\nThat violated a foreign law for other country of origin\nSo as a result that ... under that act it's unlawful to import export cell acquire a purchase fish wildlife are plants that are taken possess transported are sold in violation of us are Indian law in interstate commerce involving fish wildlife are planes taking possessed are sold in violation of state or foreign law that's the actual word and\nThis actually happened to three American seafood dealers\nAs a that had no prior records they were this was back in two thousand and one they were trying to pack them for importing lobster tails that were the wrong size and packaged and clear past plastic bags rather than cardboard boxes and they sentence them too I'm In total uh ten years in prison\nBy the way do you know if you take a fake sick day that could be actionable [noise] you know that\nOkay so yeah uh this was the Supreme Court actually had to go back in ... end of the statute\nBecause it was so big so for instance say that you would you would never do because we're all responsible people\nBut say that you you know you've got two tickets to you know playoffs or something and you you if you want to be able to take the day off work because the seats are amazing you know you're not going to be able to get the chance again so you just called and you say you're sick um but apparently that is described as quote a scheme or artifice to fraud\nAnd the ... the company of their quote intangible right to your honest services which can be arguably arguably a federal crime and the statute\nSo you called and you say you're sick um but apparently that is described as quote a scheme or artifice to fraud\nAnd the ... the company of their quote intangible right to your honest services which can be arguably arguably a federal crime and the statute was so unbelievably vague that a couple of years ago the Supreme Court how to get involved and actually mended to apply only to bribes or kickbacks\nBecause it was show and that's not the only one that's that statute that's insanely vague like that\nUh it was so ambiguous even Justice Scalia who was a a still on the bench when this was when they were a remedy in this said that criminalizes equipped criminalizes a salaried employees funding in sick to go to a ball game\nRight there was um for instance back in Nineteen Ninety six here's another one there was a a well known automobile racer Bobby answer he got lost in the woods essential he got convicted of a federal crime he was sentenced to six months in prison because he got lost in a blizzard in Colorado for two days ... while snowmobile and\n... and he was guilty of quote unlawful operation of a snowmobile within a national forests wilderness area and he didn't know who was in the wilderness area because he had gotten lost in the middle of the flipping blizzard\nThat's a felony\nDo you understand what I'm saying how did that the classification of felonies has been expanded to the point where you can't even keep track of it anymore\nWhich was the basis beyond you know that book you could even get into the media like for instance James Rosen a friend of mine who were there is James rising who reports from New York Times and James Rosen who reports for Fox stupid progressive don't understand the difference than they've conflate them and think that the same person whenever this comes up\nSo if you will ... this was under the espionage and censorship act which is because it's it's vague\nUm in terms of\nHow it can be enforced and this was when the Obama administration and the holder department of justice went after Eric Holder because he had several contacts within the state department\nAnd he wrote a story and it wasn't actually like a scoop or anything it was just about how North Korea was testing nuclear or whatever and he wrote a story about it and ... and it loosely pertains to national security\nAnd so as a result the administration didn't like it so they persecuted him under the espionage and censorship act because he was protecting his source\nAnd so um they said that he violated espionage laws and it even judgment ... tunnel had said quote this is the first time that the federal government has moved to this level of taking ordinary reasonable traditional lawful reporter skills and claiming they constitute criminal behavior [noise]\nNow do you want to know something else that can be considered\nA felony because we're talking about how you know here you have ... who's at the White House and he's talking with the president and one of the things he's discussing this criminal justice which this administration has done more than the previous on criminal justice and I hope that I we need to do more for instance\nAnd I'm giving you an example of how so many ridiculous things are classified as felonies now I think felonies should be limited to certain awful crimes because now everything's a damn felony and when you think a forfeiture of your rights\nFelony I mean you're talking about one of the things that constitutes that ... that that classification is if you know the the penalty is imprisonment of a year or more well then that's a forfeiture writes your prohibitive possessed her so for instance check this out\nIf you um switched jobs or you leave your old your place of employment if you tell your friends and family to not use them that could be a phony\nNot even getting Computer Fraud and abuse law\nThat's actually happen before a and two thousand Brett McDaniel surf sixteen months in prison because he alerted customers of his old company tornado development about a software problem that was never fixed he explained that the company's email system had a flaw that could allow an attacker to gain access to users email records\nProsecutors argue that he had damage their system wired magazine said he was quote ... that the jailing was uh uh that they wrongly jailed a security whistle blower\n[noise] I mean this is crazy I could sit here and go on and on and on and on and on and on\nAre there are so many ways that little Biddy things I mean it isn't over criminalization epidemic\nAnd this is why we need criminal justice reform like for instance did you know Twenty one USC section for sixty one a ... a subsection three eighty one a point one seven one do you make it a crime to sell turkey him as ham turkey or with the words turkey and ham and different font\nThere's a whole crime there's a whole Twitter account out there called a crime a day that lists all the insane felonies this is what I'm Talking about when I say we death we got to have criminal justice reform\nBecause and this is just one example by the way I could get into you know I could we could talk about in prison that we could talk about white collar crimes we could talk about drug why we could get into a whole bunch of it but I'm just giving you this overview oh do you know\nReview oh do you know\nI'm at sixteen USC sick as section ... uh five fifty one subsection to sixty one point sixteen\nThe make it a crime to wash official Fawcett if it's not a fish washing faucet international for us\nTo know that ...\nThese are all felonies the ... the department of justice back in the eighties attempted to count the total number of federal crimes and they can't yeah yeah or for instance did you know it's a felony Eighteen USC section Eighteenth sixty five subsection seven point nine six be a free make it a federal crime to harass a golfer at any national park in Washington DC\nMhm yeah how 'bout that\nHere's what about this said that you want to go on vacation how many people live on a vacation and and if you have a dog you take your dog with you on vacation\nWhere am I one of the things I Would love to do is go to our national parks but I Want to get my whole my my whole uh a family so and dogs included well I Would have to be careful that I didn't violate any a federal laws I Would have to make sure\nThat I didn't commit a felony with my pet you want to know how so\nEighteen USC Eighteen sixty five subsection to point Fifteen a for making a federal crime to let your ... your pet making noise that scares the wildlife and a national park\nUh-huh mhm\nHow about this said that you are saying that you visit your going to White House store\nHow amazing right you get to go on a White House chore you go you know maybe you tour the Capitol Grounds you get to go and you're you're going around taking

now we know it's a joke you know why this is my problem you know I I've known people who've had Mr since I don't know if you guys have but I've I've known people that my life\nAnd it turns out after about a year\nYou start having the same problems with your mistress that you have with your wife\nSo why in the world would you just double that uh we all know marriage is wonderful but it comes with a little baggage you think of distress doesn't come with the same baggage now you got double baggage so the sex robot I Believe is the answer but I just went off on a Kanye like rent there I'm sure there's an\nActual story behind this I\nI don't really know if there's a story behind this but there's a man he's an advocate for the sex robots I don't know if I can say his a fake name know goes by you know I Know I Can't because I Know this is the family show people gather on the radio and listen to it together that's right but he's an advocate and he believes in these robots so much that he thinks that the robots are going to be the ones\nThat save NASA and colonize Mars\nNow here's the thing when you go to Mars what did he can never come back and what if you're a guy and now but what if I told you\nAnd now what what if I told you that before you got there three years ago we set up a colony of sex robots [noise]\nNow the deal is the sound as bad as it so I I don't know just the way the guy meant it and also by the way sex robots can go both ways I'm not being such and this year if you're a female astronaut\nOr do you want to go to Mars but this could be a way to incentivize people to actually go spend the rest of their life on Mars because I think that's the way it's going to be a woman a round trip B here's went to Mars kind of stepped down like we did with the moon got back inside the ship what is it still take like three years\nFrom ... to getting back to earth so it's a very it's a long way to go and I think everyone here will agree with me\nThat ah when did this a long way to go a sex robot\nCan't hurt [laughter] not going to make things worse adults are especially in zero gravity\nWow this guys fantasize over here I like to apologize to be a live audience but a Tim addresses a little bit strange that I Am you got another story for me from\nI Do what I Want to talk about that one for a second a little bit more because they're oh see what happens is is because I went last night to see first man so now Neil Armstrong so my mind well by the way I recommend there is that there was that phony outrage going around 'cause there's not a scene in the movie of them planting the American flag on them\nYes that was the big money I think there's some I don't believe in Maryland and\nWell there's plenty of American flags in the film and it wouldn't actually makes sense you see the movie it's about him and when she's on the moon nails very introspective it it just wouldn't even fit the narrative so pleased to see it\nBut because of that someone like Neil Armstrong I don't think he will be thinking about sex going to Mars he would do it for the mission alone so you know you put it out there that's not necessarily a lower Buzz Aldrin yes that would get him out there\nYou know not everybody's a deal Armstrong you have to have sex robots with a Buzz Aldrin says in the world can we agree on that yes that is that sums up review of first man\nThat didn't come out of it I mean the shoe hoarding it in there it just said no no no I I probably watch last night I loved it\nI ... I've heard really good things about the movie so I Know that was that controversy and I think the controversy Greg wasn't so much what's good and what's not in the movie it's what a Ryan Gosling right he's the one who plays Neil Armstrong\nIt was what he said about it that it was a a a global achievement if if the director just would have said you know it just wasn't it didn't work in the movie I think people have been fired it was the explanation that uh this wasn't an achievement for Americans there was a cheap it for the world that's what bothers people that story\nNext door that detects a bar owner who has made a beer for dogs but it's not alcoholic it's just a a a\nConcoction they put together a lot of them that well they had ... dogs digestion and has ginger which is good for their fur coat shining eyes and this man says and this man says everyone liked the idea of having a beer with the dog you know so why not do it\nThat's your first baby yeah it does everybody well first of all ... that makes no sense because even if you thought it was your for maybe not many people think about having a beer with their baby\nSteps out my back I'm\nGonna get out of here we've got to get

knock all of this off like who cares\nI got an idea we can go back to an old fashioned idea we don't judge people by their words we judge them by their deeds how about that that work out and I don't get out I have some sick and tired of half the stories about oh did you hear what so and so said\nThe entire country is like seventh grade in the cafeteria now some of you know what they said oh I don't like them anymore we're not going to hang out with them anymore so you hear what she said about Mary oh for heaven's sakes\nI just it's just it's growing old\nHopefully it's growing old I Know that my crunchy horrible ... here but [laughter] I Know that you want to uh continually parse everyone's words\nWill act if we didn't get back and judge people by things they said twenty to Thirty years ago then we're not doing\nRight by the rest of the country I mean they're not new deal is if it's not due diligence I think if you wrote like something down or you said something somewhere and it ends up being problematic and twenty teens and you need to be called for it that's right and then you\nNeed to be canceled right oh well yeah I mean definitely I mean you got to be ...\nI don't know I I I'm just so sick and I mean I don't care about the fall but he's a good actor he's a fool when it comes to his regular life he's a good actor but I just like to get out of this whole thing of did you hear what so and so sad who cares who cares next door\nHi Jamie Lee Curtis is swinging back at Fox News because they said that she wasn't for all the second amendment because she's yeah she's firing guns into Halloween movie but then she says there needs to be stricter gun laws\nFirst of all first of all the new Halloween movie I don't know what do you Tim Andrews you'd be somebody would know about this yeah I think it looks like a social justice warriors go after Mike Myers\nSo there's a couple of things going on in this film first of all you have to think Okay John carpenter gave it to seal of approval John Carpenter created Halloween is he dead no he's not okay [laughter]\nSo the old he is very old I have I've looked into this and I know that the director and the writers have put in some elements of strong empowered woman and the me too movement but\nGiven the fact that John Carpenter is involved I don't think it's going to be heavy handed ... I think you're going to be able to enjoy it as a Halloween movie of the whole thing is that yes that's in it\nShe comes back to to ah she takes on ... Mike\nMyers Laurie Strode is back in her home town every other sequel is just eliminated from the last time I don't understand so we're supposed to pretend none of the other sequels happened yeah even the ones with her that were made in the two thousands gone\n[laughter] so what we're we're supposed to believe that all the years these years have gone by a British picking her up now right or not been any other sequels right nothing to see her first hit the reset button Eric I guess but it's like you're treating it like a like a marvel movie or something yeah yeah and I usually sort of uh what do you call that ... not ... rebooting afraid\nZoning as well no it's not going to even be a redo because they've all said this is the last one\nWell let's see how much money it makes [laughter]\nI Know you can ... milking milk at all and milk like everybody else\nI'm not going to put up with is a very shaming that you're doing back there but you hear what was next said oh yeah you said milk\nIt I think I did grow up on a dairy farm out the right to say though that is true yeah this\nGuy is milked cows arises real the real thing All right that story\nAlright the latest news from the Harvey ... or Weinstein as you say judge dismissed as one of the charges against him\nWell there is ... that's got to be good news there is only like Seventy one more cases against that I think sixty nine sixty nine more in one one of the time we get rid of one\nYeah I guess the witness gave two different stories and so therefore I'm going to have\nYeah I don't know which one this was when I read about this and you've got to wonder how many how many of those I Believe that the other story that came out was she was telling people that uh you know she was doing it because she wanted to get parts are and are you\nYou're silly if you don't think that that sort of thing does go on out there I Know it's a whole different world out there but a Weinstein as a dirt ball but there were plenty of people that were willing to play his game I\nDon't think for a second that that's not true that's the reality of the world and so there's probably out to be Seventy two cases that are lived up against them ah there's got to be\nCases that are lived up against them uh there's got to be at least three that are real rice\n[laughter] David innocent I put my foot down even\nAs you say you use it as yeah what a treat to go just didn't realize he's got so much money he just could have said because you know this is talk of that situation he's such a handsome fellow [laughter]\nForced\nPeople to anything that she'll be told me George Clooney had to do such things [laughter] All right well he's a dirt bag and he's got one last a speck of dirt on one less speck of dirt on him next outrage\nAlright junior robots Julia Roberts ah feelings were hurt by social media reaction to a photo with her niece Emma Roberts they said you like a man and she's getting older\n[laughter]\nIt's not a flattering picture now he's with her daughter having lunch somewhere they're playing cards playing cards All right and the pictures not that flattering uh but that's just the way the world is you know I mean we all take\nPictures that are that flattering the problem for a for Julia Roberts and this is something I just what I was thinking about this last night on it's not a mission I'm not trying to convince anybody to start a movement or anything like that I'm just going to tell you\nHow much better your life is when you are not on social media [noise]\nI I if I could just skip the word across\nTo a few people who will pick\nMe up on it I mean just drop it for two or three months and you will not believe how happy you become Julia Roberts the only reason this her feelings were hurt was because she posted it and be them she went and looked at the comments [laughter]\nHere's an idea okay this is what I said all the people on our show because there are people who don't like the show and they commented everything which does have some perspective in life as I tell the other people on the bottom has their doctor and there are people who hate the Beatles\nIf the Beatles didn't get everybody we don't get a chance of getting everybody\nUnique fifty plus one Julia Roberts has had a a good career she continues to have a good career\nSo just don't look at the comments if you don't look at the

your landscape\nBlood artificial sweet why did prod official sweetener vaccine again because you don't want sugar or say you want to keep the kids than right you\nKnow let me just let me just now on the important things though this is Suzie I'm saying the important things the communicable diseases it's a good idea to be vaccinated don't you think and also it's really kind of not fair because if you are not vaccinated\nI really kind of protecting you because I Am back say to a great point there is a certain percentage\nAnd it sounds to me what I worry about is that people may actually if if it's one in how many one in five one of the war to point to live down there yeah okay but if some percentage\nEverybody doesn't get coverage right because of the number of people who are actually I actually needed now that's a real problem right call herd immunity actually heard immunity run in the rye because I'm responsible it allows you to be irresponsible well join wanting served I don't really know the one you know as an example\n... near yeah but it's to point two percent or not being vaccinated so if vaccines actually work as well as we say they do the two point two percent should be safe\nOr unless everybody in one school is doing it like what happens is sometimes a a particular ethnic groups will be more suspicious\nOf that sort of trend than others uh-huh and if you're in a in a school it's mostly made up of that community then you look around the halls and almost nobody's vaccinated one kid brings it in and you know what was it was breaking out at Disneyland a couple of years ago it was measles James ... things that just shouldn't be\nBrings out at how many people blame you might call\nHad the ... and I want them to Disney World I\nWant you to I mean you look you can't be against all that\nI'm not against all vaccines against the way they're administered in such volume they're not tested the way that I feel they should be on the edge of ants worry me 'cause like mercury they zero need for mercury in your life and yet some vaccines still have mercury and um\nYeah but you know is it really hurt ya market but don't brain damage or whatever and they're\nLiving longer than they've ever lived before these problems everybody's living longer gotta alright we did we did not agree on All right we we\nActually bought on that one you know while you might you might spur on this one or the human race spaces extinction if males sperm counts continue to fall worldwide wow\nWe might guys I always thought we had too many people in the world you know nature's way of\nGetting weeding out the herd I bet\nYou'll tell me that it's some kind of reason our diet is the reason they're spread\nOut and it's a chemical or do you do that Sally and perfume and hairspray and plastics and\nWell he doesn't this means for the people who think that climate change is real and people are going to go to the earth no it's not there are still just shake us off like adult chicken awfully do we need so we don't have if we were not bigger than the earth so if you if so what so we'll go through a period where there aren't a bunch of people and then we'll come back to another\nI'm not saying I agree with you on that I absolutely would just I don't need any more kids you're done right okay\nYeah no absolutely were just ... I don't need any more kids you're done right okay yeah I I read my sperm count out your find it directly you're young you don't have it like Jared over here I Am a I'm a ...\nAt one is a little yeah he was tested and he only has to last\nA good thing about all of it is you can go to a bank and get some someone else Dr Joe ... park [laughter]\nWe're not looking for the sheriff man solution so I uh do these things just kind of coming away what ... what\nWell we've never measured I don't think sperm heartland becoming a less manly yeah oh I didn't think twice about testosterone yes how\nI Wonder if we can go over there yeah\nThere's a whole cottage industry now on men boobs yeah surgery plastic surgery actually building cottages on demand so that's how big they are making problem we're so what's the cottage industry of reducing\n... meant testosterone is dropping estrogen levels are going up in a developing breast\nNow I see in the old days\nPeople you're attracted to which shame you into losing those you know I mean I don't think I don't think women are suddenly in love with that so you would think that you guys want to be with somebody who you are going to get rid of the man booths right are you saying it's not a better if I couldn't get rid of them if I wanted to if I was one of these low testosterone people\nOr you could but then you have to worry about your testosterone testosterone not just about boots it's about your heart your liver your spleen all the organs knee testosterone your biceps your triceps your other a lot of\nPhony stuff about the testosterone thing I've known three people who told me oh I'm low T and they'd probably on drugs like I kind of scary\nTo me I wrote the on that because what they do I got my test and they said we're awfully low yeah off into your slightly law and you should be taking testosterone I said and I looked at the scale and they measured me for forty one year old man yeah well I'm not forty one year old man I'm much older than that right so my testosterone would be lower and it's just a scale use I said but it's our own scale\nYou take it anyway I don't worry about it\nAnd and people get weird I I Know a couple of people who are on the low T drugs and uh they got weird or maybe a change their personal\nAnd then it was like aggressive or a or a depressed oh I Would say not and I really themselves and if you take hormone I'm right outside taking that nobody cares when you're not\nProducing it from the inside of you take you from the outside your body shut down its production\nWhat happens if you blow to what happened\nWell testosterone you not to you know well that's what I don't\nKnow I I I\nHave yes but it affects your heart your ... your all the muscles in your\nBody back and I have no heart and that's why\nI like the old\nAdage right yeah they're everywhere it's either today\nOr effects that all the muscles in your body so the money like a couple a week and if the testosterone is too low you can actually just get weaker and weaker\nI think you're not going to say okay I think people ... to say now is they've always been ... yeah well\nWe're we're pampered because we live in a time with a lot of technology and we're not out every day plow in the fields and all of that and so there's an effect from that and I suppose there are more chemicals and things like that at all but I don't think that we're I don't think there's anything drastically different except that we're all lazier because we have technology that will do stuff for yes\nBut the chemicals are definitely lowering the hormones and I take it they want to sit down on your couch all night with the hot laptop right where it shouldn't be a matter of all that sure\nThat we have airtight [laughter] some\nPut some real common sense to this conversation you've given me so we have a low sperm counts and what was the first story the first\nOr vaccines vaccine yes apparently we got no come on\nSoaring anti depressant drug use just turning our waters in the drug soup in a changing marine life civility to me feed and move so\nFun you know they got openly for Dr Joe there they haven't you heard in the Bronx\nGay [laughter]\nI always shows since Dr Joe is a crisis actor than dramatic even real or not real [laughter]\nSo this idea here is there's so many ended the press in so many people to them I take it that when we go to the bathroom or whatever that comes out and then it gets into the system and then it ends up the oceans and the turtles can't make\nIt right ... yes well Texas has had to present all the drugs we take we can filter out\nUh chemicals from ... oh you mean the school systems we all have filters to filter out the drugs right you take anything you birth control pills but anyone take birth but you ... see there you go about\nAnything you cholesterol medication or steroids hormones chemicals it comes out in your waist we don't filter it out and I mean it's the water and now you're drinking\nBut if I'm a turtle I get I I got like free Ambien\nA Happy Meal a lot of happy turtles alley totally don't here\nA lot of happy that we totally\nDon't here's my question yes okay oh there's no going out there but it's going into the ocean I don't know if you've noticed the ocean is put a big\nYes when it gets soldiers burst but it doesn't matter yes if it if you injected a turtle that where you know an antidepressant but don't they get there's so little of this broke it up which parts per billion all that up but it's it's the cumulative now a lot of drug that I Can't say\nThat's really hard at ... billion I no longer do you know it does build up over time to get a cumulative and that's the concern is that in places like the Chattahoochee River not as big as the ocean yeah chemicals are being dumped in there and now we're seeing you know what three I'd fish or whatever it is you're catching a cat who is you know\nAre you are so I I don't know I made a loan or

individuals and I tend to align myself that way simply because I'm a constitutional is that heart\nI'm going to go for the person and the policies that support the way our founding fathers wanted this country run the way that you're supposed to look at the laws about the division and the checks and balances and how things are supposed to work and operate\nYou realize for the longest time but the the the Supreme Court nominee wasn't something that we were going to have televise it wasn't something that became a show circus like it has been in since literally since Bork I mean we thanks to that we've got that term they ... him\nAnd did you realize for hundreds of years ... hundreds makes them for a hundred and ... plus years after the signing of the constitution there was no popular vote for your state senators why because the constitution was specifically set up that the state would pick their own two representatives\nBut the state legislature would decide who would be the representative to be sent to the U.S Senate because the senators are supposed to represent the state\nAnd so that's all changed in return everything into like a show circuit so\nI don't want to put any one person as sort of like this pedestal like Kanye West but I Will look for ... where do we see more freedom I'm going to look to see where are we getting more individuality when are we going to get more people being able to do more on their own without being told what to do how to feel or what to think\nAnd so when I brought up Kanye yesterday it was in no way a way of saying he's the new face of the Republican Party that's not it\nWhat I wanted to bring that up for it to see what the left truly is\nWhen you choose to step out of line when you choose to walk off\nThe Democrat plantation as they say it themselves black Americans that have become conservative use that exact phrase that they were shocked to see how quickly those on the left that would embrace them in any others in any other setting\nThe minute they turned around and said hey I've got a question where I Want to say or why is that better why is that wrong or why is what Trump's policies why are those bad immediately find people turning on people like Maxine Waters get back in line and learn learn your place\nFor all for a seven to zero seven fifty one eight hundred WSBIU when we come back does that bother you especially if you're on the left\n[laughter]\nThey the Abrams is a big spending tax raising radical liberal Abrams doesn't just tap socialist ideas when he campaigned with socialists manned socialist party endorsed her\nAbrams will raise taxes on families like thirty thousand dollars a year and he wants state government run health care even from Georgia law enforcement [noise]\nEra even [laughter] know radical she'll make Nancy Pelosi Formica moderate Abrams will make Georgia functionally rules for\nNine sixty nine degrees at five thirty nine I'm Chris channel and use Ninety five five AM seven fifty doubled us be depend on it\n\nWell maybe that's the right kind of music playing with the way somebody you guys are driving home a little Metallica there to get your home on a friday\nAlexander's in for Eric Ericson and I've got\nA story that I'm ... and I said I Know I was going to talk about you know why the left feel somehow on some moral superior\nHigh ground to be able to act the way they act in say the things they say but we had somebody who was actually kind of not doing the ship all in on it is friday so before I get to our callers let me go ahead and set up another topic we can talk about both simultaneously 'cause they sort of go together\nWe've got a sort of a brouhaha Stacey Abrams campaign is leveling some suit against Brian Kemp in his role currently as secretary of state I don't think this isn't a ploy but let's see what is it I'm going to give you a soundbite here I've got a Christian clerks group\nLawyers committee for civil rights under law suing\nBrian Kemp and his official capacity as the secretary of state\nThe reality is minority votes\nThe reality is minority voters are often the ones with unusual names that are sometimes harder for state officials to capture accurately and the state's database and they're being penalized for that hour angle our\nEnd objective with this lawsuit is making sure that there's a level playing field where everyone's point can be hurting Georgia\n[noise] and then of course uh Stacey Abrams believes Kemp has worked to specifically suppress the minority vote\nWe live in a nation that has spent centuries denying the right to vote and spent decades creating barriers that right to vote and I have an opponent who is a remarkable architect of suppression\n\nThanks for playing but you would be wrong wrong you're absolutely one hundred percent\nUndeniably categorically wrong and why are you wrong because Brian Kemp\nSecretary of state last I checked didn't write law\nLast I checked Brian Kemp didn't submit law or bills to be turned into law last I checked Brian Kemp as secretary of state can only follow the law ... law are we talking about a bipartisan for those of you who are\nMaybe from a different area and they don't know the big muscle Arabic words bipartisan simply means both the left and the right work together and pass legislation to helped tighten up\nThe voter fraud possibilities in the state of Georgia you know we've got one of the best and the Supreme Court repeated Supreme Court tested laws for voter id in the state of Georgia which a lot of other states did what we did here in Georgia\nWhen you have the voter rolls ... swelled up through mass\nVoter registration the way the law works is if you submit\nA a registration maybe because you moved because you just moved here when you move to a different district and you have to re register or maybe you're a first time registering\nThose registrations are checked against the net the statewide databases for driver's license or whatever other existing confirmed and verified ID that you have\nAnd if your registration has an error whether it's a spelling error and address era a city or what ever the error is that shows that there is not a match in who you say you are or where you say you live your registration request gets put into a pending status\nAnd hold that thought because we can't we keep you guys on whole let's check how traffic is pending right now Doug [noise]\nTrying to get a better here and usually a group of little bit earlier the friday we drive but it still ugly right now by born agreed on us over the west side I don't know what it is all a volume started to\nWatch out for nobody knew what I Want you to was pretty much all the airport you to go five and then\nWe got him when he was one of the lady that I think Seventy five I don't really know but I Wonder you know when he was a good alternative fuel over an hour or two hundred and forty one Allen\nSo they started off technically Tuesday this past week fifty three thousand voter registration applications on hold after failing to meet the state's exact match law the law not policy not\nOn a whim not something you've thrown together at the last minute or ... some kind of secrets sort of process behind closed doors law\nA crafted bill that had to go from house to the Senate and back was bipartisan and signed by the governor that says we don't just willy nilly let applications and requests for voter id go through without a check\nAnd if you like that idea that it should go through without a check then you're part of the problem because we have tightened up a lot of voter fraud in this state we've got some of the best voter ID laws as I said anywhere in the nation\nSo all Brian Kemp is doing is saying look\nThese are all marked as pending\nAccording to the law you got twenty six months to fix that to prove who you are or to correct the typos the errors the whatever the whatever information doesn't match you have up to twenty six months to correct now you can correct that\nAll the way up until the voting day if you'd like you could choose not to and you don't get to vote well technically you do get to vote with your vote may not count\nNow you can still go vote\nRight there was nothing saying these individuals can't go to the polls\nWhat it's saying though is you will probably be put into a um a a different bucket and if you haven't resolved the error than your vote will not be counted\nThat is up to you if you can't figure out how to fill out a ballot form if you don't have the correct spelling of your name you don't have the correct location you don't have the correct city\nI'm Sorry I Want to have some sympathy but these folks bringing this lawsuit shows me that Stacey Abrams recognizes that regardless of any current poll\nThe Abrams recognizes that regardless of any current polls she's not winning this race right now and needs to throw some some smoke in there and she needs to caught fire where none exists\nAll right let's see what are we have too much against the clock so hey I got a couple of folks on standby I Want you to hang on because we've got a quick break coming up but I Will try to get to your calls we'll talk about all of this and more plus hey go dogs this weekend we'll be right back\n[noise] Erick Erickson and his land has a B making us the topic was this guy got
