[noise] but uh I just wanted to let you know so at the end of the year Nikky will be leaving and they will be in constant touch I Know that whenever you out of there there is you're going to go this\nAll the players and that was really the the guy I think she did best of the United nations you got to know the players [noise] she got to know China Russia\nIndia she knows everybody at our very first day basis or they're like you're just ship for maybe a couple of\nThey do they really like and I think maybe more importantly they respect her so the gear just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss you nevertheless you've done it for the job\nBut I Want to say [noise] well\nI Want to say on first of all\nI Want to thank for just you know allowing us to come out and talk to you to weigh on it has been an honor of a lifetime at you know I said\nLeave the stage that raised me and to serve\nLove so very much has really been a blessing and I want to thank you for that matter most excited look\nAt the two years look at what has happened is who years with the United states on foreign policy now\nThe United states is respected countries may\nWhat we do but they were that's what we\nDo they know that if we say we're going to do something we follow it through when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether it's the trade deal which is an amazing they suggest that the president means that that and\nAt just these two years at the last one\nBillion in the UN but we've made a strong burgers made it more efficient in South Sudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming dream North Korean sanctions um packages which was the largest and generation done in a way that we could really work\nOn the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country needs to understand you can't\nThings they're doing you have to see them for the threat than they are [noise] um I think you look at the anti Israel bias and the strike and courage that the president showed in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we put\nEmbassy where we want to put our and you know all of those things have made a huge difference in the U.S stand any but I can tell you that um\nIt gave us a strong again and the U.S is drawing in a way that should make all\nVery proud and I do want to say that it's not just a frightening\nThe family in general the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me um I Can't say enough good things about Jared Nevada guy Jared is such a\nGenius it no one understands I mean to reduce the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I've done working with him on the middle east peace plan it is so unbelievably well done an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind\nThe scenes that I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because there and um that's administration I also just half a day I'm certainly thank you my family and Michael at the same and um my two little ones I adore than entertain us\nYour little ones I adore than entertaining us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and\nEnergy into it um but and they have a lot of heart and\nReally wanted to make America a proud and so is that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in this lake and um for the next ... to come in but\nIt's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to the gym part of the team now I don't have anything he sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when\nI was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand years lot at church shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then come in\nAnd just hitting years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it than eight years of intent time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be solved let's enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to be in the job so nice to finally finish\nAnd I will say that I'm for all and you that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can tell me she went out to be doing it for this one so I look forward to supporting the president and the next election so good like if you listen to a long list of top ... why would you want to leave the only high is is it is a really personal decision because you've been away from your family members or\nIs very supportive so no there's no personal reasons I think that it's just a very important for government officials to understand when it's time to step aside and\nContinuing team coverage of the announcement for UN ambassador Nikki Haley that she is resigning she's talking here with the president and reporters and go back to how you can\nPower into it and so there really is a lot of people are gonna want to say there's a lot of reading time leaving the truth and I want to make sure that said that the president of France has the person\nIt was a blessing to go into the UN was fired\nEvery day and defend America um and I always knew that I'll never truly stepped aside from fighting for our country but I Will tell you that I can get to a time\nMr President why make natives but\nNick he's going to be stay till the end of the a ... year which will be just about two years and I just think and I was just a says ... speaking I was thinking when we came into office a\nHappened there [noise] that\nSeems to me that was a strange\nI think very strange press conference indeed she's we knew he was resigning and then a Dell they did was I thought he was going to announce that she'd been promoted to some other job or she was going to sell their department but it just hey I just she's great and she's resigning just some of the audio\nTo I just wanted to let you know so the end of the year Nikky will be leaving\nThat we saw a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems\nI noticed in there that he said that she was a really good that she had a she knew a lot of people like China\nShe got to know China Russia\nIndia she knows everybody\nI don't know how this is not even though Tim addresses and here we have our President Trump with us to explain more we just saw a robot Nikki Haley she knew all those people China Russia all those people\nShe was really good friends with ... band with Russia and I knew that she spent a lot of time which\nIs there a Mr China or Russia has no idea\nThat Mr as Russia Mr and Mrs China that check than men just kidding [laughter]\nNo gender is dead is what is that ... that was great I don't\nKnow I Know a lot I thought that that press conference kind of strange I usually what happens is you hear somebody's resigning and the and then the next time you see the president to ask questions about it I think it was the first time my wife I've seen a press conference to announce that at the end of the year Nikki Haley is leaving the United nations I thought that was a little strange\nWhere we thought it would be good to do it as that and when it comes to get the spending the other day with jet and also with Russia in the other day is a really really very very great yeah and I know that should be spending time with an accent West Germany I still go to\nI get I get it I guess she spent more time with her rural friends I'm Wondering how your share their lives and we share we're not covering something up here what well she just suddenly resigns even when she was asked about her family she said no that's fine and my family supportive\nShe claimed she just wants to step away because she thinks government officials should step down from time to time that's a little strange to me\nBut she did it two years right she did her and she's a she's got an insurance to do maybe she wants to go back to it that that maybe she wants to give it look I don't know what you what if it was a great one of the best\nGreat what are the best Jewish people out there yeah I put it right up there with the others [laughter]\nWhat do you have to say Mr President I mean normally when you're excited about something you use exclamation marks when you tweet I noticed that when you said oh your tweet earlier you said big announcement with my friend a bathroom Nikki Haley in the oval office at ten thirty AM you just put a period on there I mean you weren't you were that into it\nWell it it was it your image any which way to get your to your to assist\nUs I Do yes of course we do\nAbout it looked it up and it's like in a step that\nNikki Haley will do it and that gets sessions was stepped up its will be that it is and Nikki Haley will be my daughter is she looking at it as they go\nYou know what I'll tell you what that makes more sense to me then the concept of that press conference I just saw which made no sense to me thank you for clearing that up Mr very well could you say hello to Mr China\nAnd I will miss the first time you see it [noise]\nMore begins every day you know you asked me anytime other do you ask the radio I

some old stories that'll have it on the Internet you'll put it in somebody's name and you get an old story but these are still new stories brewing about the fact that she was taking private planes\nAnd perhaps not representing the true value of those uh but watching that press conference it didn't seem like that was the reason why but it was an odd press conference to me\nThat somebody resigns and you have a press conference\nJust to say I'm accepting her resignation and she did a great job I don't know I don't know that I've seen that before so it was\nHer reasoning was that uh\nShe just thinks every once in a while she believes in term limits which doesn't really apply 'cause she's got an elected office right now as the ambassador to the United nations and she believes the people in government should know when to step aside but she didn't tell us\nWhat it was the tips are often now there's something missing here I don't know what it is I don't even know that it's scandalous or all that interesting but I don't feel like we got the whole story there\nAre perhaps Trump answered it when he said this\nThere was a lot of problems one of the process of selling a lot of problems\nAnd I guess and during this press conference where I'm living you know that she's only going to be here for I don't know a ten more weeks eight more weekly till the end of the year how many more weeks to the you know I can do something like that I'm not even\nSo I just uh just a little bit odd I guess he's going to work everything else out I wouldn't be surprised to find out something else down the line it may not even be scandalous either she's not telling us what she's aspiring to but I found her reasoning to be a little weird\nI just think people in government should step down from time to time\nOkay maybe next story\nOr Al Gore is back in the headlines thank goodness and he's warning people that it's something to do with the climate and ... you know one trick pony disguised\nAs well he's warning all of us that time is running out after the release of that special un report that is saying that basically there's twelve years to stop climate change is you see that\nStory I'm going to look for it now and this can be boring as I Try to look for the story but I saw that the gas masks to somebody broke down so the un\nIs saying we have twelve years if we don't do something uh twelve years I Swear I remember that around the year two thousand they were saying ten years but now they're saying twelve years and if we don't do something in the next twelve years that's it the planets corrupt it's over which I find to be\nCompletely absurd I was talking about this yesterday I did a good job of getting across this idea about the planet being four point five billion years old\nAnd the absurdity of somebody saying you have twelve years to do something with the what I meant by that was all of civilization around ten thousand years of people getting together and societies right\nInside a four point five billion years\nThat's an I blink ten thousand years inside a four point five billion years\nYears inside a four point five billion years is a blink of vi\nSo twelve years on a planet but his four point five billion years old is way less than a blink of an eye so you have to believe that we have the ability to stop this and turn it around and save the planet in the life of a planet\nWhat would add up to a nanosecond\nWell if we pay a two hundred and forty dollars for a gallon gas tax that will probably help\nSomebody do the analysis on what they were talking about we had to do is ex twelve years and that's what they came up\nWith that two hundred and forty dollars per gallon gas tax yeah and that'll needed to fight global warming so so so so\nIf this is true the arts goodbye nobody's going to pay that two hundred and forty per ... per gallon gas tax and I think just having nothing to do with science or the climate just in terms of logic twelve years in the life of this planet is less\nThan that it's so much less than a nanosecond\nBut I Can't even convey that social for somebody to say it will be like saying look we have less than a nanosecond and we don't turn it around in that time that we missed it yet we just like that's the point I'm trying to get across if we if if if if if it's twelve years left turns around we already haven't turned it around\nSo I don't believe the logic of this I throw the whole thing out\nBecause it's not it's presented as we need to do this and we can do this\nIt's not even possible\nThis does not fit into logic\nThat you would have twelve years to not only save the planet but turned the dancing around and pointed to the drinking and the proper this this is you would have to believe\nThat this is the most important twelve years\nOf the four point five billion years and oh what a and you happen to be alive during it one of\nThose odd what an exciting time it's just really sad you crying over the earth again\nNot to me it's like they're\nGoing down the garbage or whatever and then like ray thing they're becoming president\nWhile that way I don't know what you're talking about not president and he's not a rapist oh what did he [laughter] he was in Congress or is that he is very not notice something and it was\nCool [laughter] you know you really need to stop crime I think\nThat and you're like I don't care about the future I Will be here well like I don't want a strong choking and\n[laughter]\nI think you're going to be All right I'm not going to have kids because\nYeah you can have you know\nWill [laughter] will you know I\nLove the grievances and everybody I really feel like in a secular world\nThat because people have had been saying throughout the time beginning of mankind or societies there have been people have been saying it's the end of the world\nThe end of the world is not you know for most of history that was from a religious point of view right ... ... is the end of the world where we're at the uh the the revelations but now there's less religion and the world is more secular but still people will find a reason to tell you\nThat the end of the world is not I think that's maybe just something inside of human\nHands it maybe it gives us purpose\nYeah like they were important like we're we're the people on the planet who've ever been here who are most important because we have to save it yeah we have to save the place\nWhere it was like we sacrifice a virgin or something yeah you know now it's I don't know what don't the ban strong well\nThat's the that's that's the twenty Eighteen equivalent of sacrificing\nSure why they gage doing his part of them I think I saw a brown bag over there the way when he

sakes I don't know who these people are I think that that we should the friend the planet\nI don't want to be friendly interesting things like that if an alien came and was observed observing us it

[noise]\nSo the bigger problem shell to come out of again we were busy last week with the cabinet issue but the bigger bomb that come out of the testimony of James Baker memory is the top legal counsel at the FBI has to do\nWith the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment anyway it turns out\nThat not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicle by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her\nShe was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago\nHe sent out word through intermediaries that they didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you\nKnow that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and I said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there like I did last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you why is it going to New Orleans or is it going to a Catholic or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw him once we got to last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with court and Alberto\nWe hit off to the east over there with or this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's hitting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm goes through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the northeast from it but\nIt is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe ... hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nThat is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nAnd you folks over there you ... you got you got remembered the way the northeast at fighter Florida shape\nEven though to the east Appalachia cola or they won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge in there because all that water that's to the east of the storm is piling up\nAnd heading in there and to that by to Florida I think Tallahassee probably going to get wind gusts eighty Ninety miles an hour and they're not the power out\nIn Tallahassee during hurricane Kate which went very close to the Ninety percent of the power was knocked out in Tallahassee and I think you're going to see Ninety a hundred percent power outage or with this there I'm now I'm just saying the when should be higher in Tallahassee at least that Gus with this and we'll have severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon demonic possibilities tornadoes\nOf severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon demonic possibilities tornadoes are from Florida and then prove southern Georgia coastal South Carolina North Carolina or during the day Thursday as this moves up rapidly northeast\nIt's a scary All right so when do we get landfall and know what would you recommend that people I Know a lot of people live on that coast I've been down there a number of times it's actually it's so beautiful um and it's but there are a lot of homes right on the water so\nHow between four three nine PM tomorrow thinks one we're going to have landfall and I think things are really going to deteriorate\nVery very rapidly um it appears tomorrow morning midday and afternoon and there you just gotta get out I mean you know again what sports you know we had a hundred hundred and ten mile an hour winds it was a bad storm it was spread out\nThis is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing where it's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour winds and a lot of folks you can see what's going on with this you saw with Florence Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the photograph the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter\nAnd that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast does it look there's nothing magical about it and I we I wrote\nI wrote on this weekend I I Know that sounds pompous but you've got people saying we've never seen anything like this it's already started with the climate ambulance chaser this has been telegraph so far in advance and even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem\nComing up into the Gulf of Mexico and that was going to be what we call rapid rapid development feedback we see that happen every now and then and we were fortunate with uh Florence said it was you know it was ... this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do and given the ideal situation that is what is it so\nIt really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at my own but your website actually so you have a hitting land it's really going to start getting rough about noon tomorrow we'll little before right\nAnd that and then the the landfall I think sometime between three and nine PM it Panama City will get that down in ...

O. J.\nAll to destroy your duly elected president President Trump and last week the that of course we have the FBI general counsel Baker reporting directly to former FBI Director called me telling congressional investigators that an attorney from ... law firm gave him materials remember that's the law firm that she funneled money to\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton the FBI knew he was a go between and this particular instance now the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it\nWhy did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI I've sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D OJ knew anything about the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Denver\nCommittee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding in applying for Pfizer warrants and permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications John Solomon and write Jared continue with us anything I'm saying here that is wrong\nHere you got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the D O D J knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian collusion two people\nAre on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now a second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection and conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nThey doubled down and they continue to spy on an associate of the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller\nTo drive Trump from office why haven't Andrew McCabe memos evidence seen this soft coup attempt by Rod Rosenstein being given to Congress they've been given to of all people Robert Mueller Rosenstein\nIs Mueller's boss you monitor is going to be investigating Rosenstein\nFor illegal lisette activity he can't how we must still the boss in this case and the timing of this tells us everything ... was revenge for the firing James Comey this is part of the illicit scheme to frame Donald Trump\nGood title for a book I guess that's why it's number one that John Solomon I Want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure I missed some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the bluster and be asking Washington and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misused for a political opposition research project to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nThey sustain investigation that was designed to hamper his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part\nThat Baker developed as in the middle of my stories I Want him to stop because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg Fay media has been complicit in this well sky a\nFake or gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after Trump with the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of a ... copy it's different from the one the FBI has from steel and gives it to Baker and the Baker turns out to be a counter intelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job a reporter to be getting evidence if what we're supposed to report back not become snitches\nBut more importantly the timing of it is so important the FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking um I I like the existence of the investigation and all that dirty\nHat on Trump just before the election with he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using them and hear it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor to continue to receive information for Christopher Steele this is not how the fights that process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think they ... give us several key revelations\nOr one of the challenges the credibility of roses theme one that shows the media\nUh uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three of the direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer and turning on evidence pressuring the yeah yeah I\nThink of what happened in that time front Christopher Steele July twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and your he gets turned down they don't act on it right away they is that they're not excited about it a few days later he goes to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department\nResort puts pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it a month later you've got a the DNC is water coming into the FBI again putting pressure on to the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI find something uncomfortable or I'll let you and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed like Donald Trump out of this\nAny candidate any Americans who have been treated this way it really raises civil liberty concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns that we should all be concerned by the body of evidence that our firms what rape dirt has written in his book\nIt is so scary that when you put it all together and now the pieces seemed to be ... literally it but for those the puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start feeling in the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is\nThat we had a group of people\nLiterally set up an entire phony Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her the very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud\nAt all based on information she had provided by committing fraud to Pfizer cords and the very same people that after they lost that an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is by any means necessary\nWe're going to get Donald Trump in the way we're going to do it is a we're going to eat and secretly recorded and we're going to surreptitiously get him to say something that we think we could use against them on top of a pony investigation that they\nThey initiated through a media release strategy again of the ...\nYou know one of the things that really ticked me off if there was a plot\nTo frame Donald Trump again the title of my book is I went through meticulously the FBI guidelines and the department of justice regulations on winning how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American citizen and when I discovered\nIs that the FBI violated every single solitary provision of their own guidelines they had no credible evidence of crimes no plausible intelligence to\nJustify a counterintelligence probe importantly they had no probable cause and yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen they officially\nA launch this investigation Peter Struck\nSigned the papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele and in fact the same day the James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the long ... his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had composed this phony don't see that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with this Diaa leading investigation to damage Trump and then\nThey violated other federal regulations that say you may never use on verified information\nTo gain a vice a wiretap warrant on an American citizen and they never had it verified Rosenstein signed off on the final renewal application and he had no new evidence no gay they're all behind them back\nTo the ...
