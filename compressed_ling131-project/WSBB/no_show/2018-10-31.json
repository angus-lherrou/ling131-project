Republicans want you to die Republicans want dirty or water dirty air they want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist or sexist massage sticking Xena

synagogue is hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts get in the way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only the\nIn your body weight Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also\nDirect primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to state so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of of new innovative\nMedicine and they'll turn over every penny because there are political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors or it can be a lot different and a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nAnd that it would be your only count you manage every year and set of eyes a yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money but when you get older you really get sick that money that account is built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic hair fairly inexpensive\nDepending on what you had to duck to bowl is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack cancer\nOr have a bad accident but anyway the health care cooperatives of Dr Josh ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years and he joined us atlas MD Wichita, Kansas he joins us with Dr Lee as gross and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us\nDr Robert just to remind people I I Lived in Wichita I could walk into your office pay you fifty bucks a month I get unlimited care twenty four seven I get a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get unlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true\nThat is right or every American could have ... level direct care just like you know how important people like Sean Hannity um yeah I don't think people under stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting there is ... and we don't want those people managing our health care\nEvery American deserves Affordable Care and the director model cars\nManager for a penny a pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no co pays brief procedures we can fix is we can um work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease savings their premiums by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in office\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back towards a and Affordable Care act style\nMedicare for all it would decrease our ability to really you know innovate in a way that is meaningful for patient\nAnd more importantly shock you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled socialized medicine or you're going to inserts that government between patients and doctors\nAre I think of the cabin out here you know that's how the ... at the same government that's going to control your health care or you have a another position that his health care for each of the freedom of choice between you and your physician\nAre worth your decisions are not being made by the ...\nBy the government and so in a while direct primary care is is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been\nGraced by most Republicans that are running quitting or the Sanders who's running for governor in the state of Florida he is a race that is Newt Gingrich has put this in his you know to direct primary care and his platform or so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom this is definitely the visual for him\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be honest but I couldn't pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care and get a doctor's recommendation\nAnd didn't and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to these stock in the box places and I'm not now playing them like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities\nBut I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nAnd everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom\nAnd we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been you're missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care\nSo this really is a crucial step in history\nWhere we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and ... our ten dollars a pill\nWe we weren't freedom and health care we want choice do direct care model allows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly\nA pre existing conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way I'm Sean ... the ... you know it shouldn't be a\nPerson I ... you know in our practice we have not raised our prices in eight years we've heard sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services\nAre X rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so if preexisting no pre existing condition the question is can you actually for it to get the care unique by the doctor you need when you need a and these direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship\nCan actually do that so you need to embrace of the people that are running for office that support freedom in health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with the Republicans 'cause they had promised repeal replace and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit\nHe got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have we're gonna have better health care options for the American people but in many cases that the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare\nWhen you're offering a health care cooperative model you've duplicated down how many practices across the country doctor remember\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get launched but there's over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty ... started last month alone that's a new practice every business day\nOr the ... and then you have any direct access every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor there are no pre existing condition prejudice at all these practices exactly have you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care\nThere is no insurance except he probably would have won a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which is fairly inexpensive honors\nYou have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know the point that goes unmentioned is the fact that the insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent of review and Dr ... and I never raised her prices is is\nKilling the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nMoney trying to be known as he but are you making money at fifty bucks a patient I'm a I'm a make a month are you making any money\nThat's what we're going to be married and has been acquired yeah yeah I mean this has\nNot been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices of floats or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospitals are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's worked out\nVery quickly and same poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out what is the pack and pay above the Z pack\nWas that you know ... ... yeah they should be able to get that extra think about it the poor and ... the more you need a mock like this MIT did a study on Oregon's Medicaid system and only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient\nGoing to lead you to have a functioning car and car insurance and gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are\nAnd how many patients you have\nA we have about six to seven hundred per doctor\nOkay so I'm a liberal Democrat and I'm like most practices and probably most of your patients like me I really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know say let's go fishing together hum\nBecause most people will drive but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice where they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nResults very not a

B. depend on it [noise]\n\n\nIf you're interested in it Ryan's talking about your with Brian kill me [noise]\nWhen you look at that thousands of people somebody said you know now that when they build a down I'm pretty good at figuring out how many people thousands and thousands of people in the bridge when you looked at that range loaded up with maple that's called an invasion of our country\nAnd there's always up to seven thousand there as they make their way into will probably be McAllen, Texas lieutenant colonel Allen West is in Texas his book is now out it's called whole Texas hold the nation victory or death or go cut in tournament lieutenant colonel Allen West welcome back\nIt was going to be with you Brian how are you\nSo colonel five thousand two hundred troops go to the border you you in the military for decades you can't really do much right you got to support the border guard\n[laughter] yeah that's the thing because of ... you cannot out if the federal troops in our military are not allowed to do any of domestic law enforcement operations that's what this would end up\nBeing a you can see this as a visual is still a our military does not have that the jurisdiction and you have the border patrol to do this and that's why I think we need to make sure there are a border\nPatrol or properly you know a quip debate to handle these type of situation\nAnd the good thing I think the president has articulated this before and also a homeland security secretary Nielsen is that we want to bring these troops and so that they can do you know the the backstop they took all the logistical support that is necessary so that you can get more border patrol elite a ages ... to what are called penetration so now\nThey say that is so important to understand the ... uh we need to be looking at the other avenues of approach that the drug cartels or others\nThe other avenues of approach that the drug cartels or other use along our border\nBecause if we you know send a lot of resources to this like Allen sector other things\nAre going to happen elsewhere more drugs for probably try to flow through a more weapons that phase of this nature so we need to make sure we do have a good coverage along the border and maybe that's another way that we can use the military to supplement with some of the intelligence gathering of surveillance a resource platforms there\nI mean the hope is deterrent as the word spreads the central and south Americans are being favorite Mexican stay home they got the message only two percent of the people crossing a Mexican maybe the word is Donald Trump is serious there's five thousand troops we have no hope only a tent so the deterrent has to get down there\nWell I think one of the announcement is a that shouldn't be made right now because when you look at this a flow of individuals it reminds me a lot of low that you saw going into Germany\nThere was an incredible preponderance of single military age males that's why I refer to it as in in a in the military uh you know these are you know Fifteen to thirty five year olds are on the company males you know I\nThink we should say immediately that they will not be allowed to enter it to the United states of America and and we need to say here here's the type of people that we would even consider to to have these asylum interviews with\nA and and they have to be family units or there are you know children that are you know by themselves below the age of thirty\nYou know we will consider them but if you're a single military age males\nYou know we're basically going to take you to the closest military base put you on to see what they are to see several teen\nButterfly right back we're going to find the the the nearest airfield that we could land you in\nAnd uh you you can figure it out\nWhy you you were President Obama said any gestures outlines exactly why I think he's an ineffective added to president cut ten they're trying to convince\nMalnourished refugees thousand\nThing and that is the most important\nSo he's he ... he mocked even to it a greater degree at a different appearance he thinks while we were afraid of malnourished or illegal immigrant yeah to point\nWell obviously has not been watching I mean the folks who didn't say it along the way but then again he was the same person they're locked up President Trump was his plan to bring manufacturing jobs are\nProduction back to the United states of America restore our economy but\nNow of a sudden he wants to take credit for that so President Obama's out of touch him when you listen to that clip you just play it seemed like a a delusional person that was ... it could get his thoughts together this is a very serious thing what people want to breach you or your border when people believe that they have a right to enter your country because\nThey want a better job that's not the whole purpose of having a solver border that's not the purpose of having a ... like the United states of America we want you to come here but there's a front door there is a legal immigration process\nA with a lieutenant colonel Allen West his book is now out whole Texas hold the nation I got to ask you about Texas take cruises lead is down to five points fifty one forty six over Beto O'Rourke that's a Quinnipiac poll kind of reliable Fox subscribes to it is it that close\n[laughter] you know ... of course when I'm Out and about now say some of the early ... I see a little bit of a parity\nBetween Republicans and Democrats and I live with a blue county\nHere in Dallas the Dallas County a there's an enthusiasm that the other side lost and then also you have to take into account that Greg Abbott is the top of the ticket the governor very popular governor he's up there about twenty twenty two point lead I think that's something that we should look at it as far as Ted Cruz a\nGone along those coat tails but you know you can never tell I mean Donald Trump was supposedly got blown away by by Hillary Clinton look what happened on\nOn election day I think Ted Cruz will pull it out I Believe that he will win somewhere between seven to to not going to be a lot closer than people want it to be but I think that there was a very good marketing job of a representative O'Rourke a but his message just not right for taxes he\nIs out but you are right for our show colonel Allen West go pick up his book cold Texas hold the nation victory or death colonel thanks again\nCause applies to take care of aren't\nYou got it uh when we come back Doug we'd president you a story in New York Times bestseller confidant to the bushes was a real\nHere is Donald Trump comparing himself to Reagan in Jackson\nI remember primaries prior to the election they were saying well this is this is something that there's been nothing like this is Ronald Reagan\nAnd then after that they said well we have to go back further than Ronald Reagan [noise] so they talked about Andrew Jackson said let's say the Eighteen thirties that's a long time [noise] and then\nIn ... that's a long time [noise] and then Saturn election that this super ... David Andrew Jackson\nA Doug Williams with us now to comment on that and you know you see ban and tells him a lot of this stuff he also he was a lot of people come in it's not unusual for a president to me with this story and tried to out their term and he gets a lot of he wants to put in perspective what he's going through\nYeah that's right and actually I was the first\nTo write about that comparison between Donald Trump and Andrew Jackson to talk about the New York times picked it up after I did so and after that happened of course manner than many others talked about it but both men are were outsiders are both men were considered too politically experience to be effective president\nBoth men were populist standing up for the forgotten man\nBoth of them were wealthy while publicly taking on the establishment of money interest Andrew Jackson opposing the second national bank for example both men had short tempers some were unpredictable Jackson carry bullets in his body from personal do both men ran against family\nDynasty Jackson took on the John Quincy Adams whose father than President Trump took on Hillary Clinton whose husband\nHas been president I could just go on and on it both mental ward against their own political parties are both men after winning the elections retaliated by appointing businessmen and soldiers key government government positions instead of politician it just I Can't even comparison\nAnd by the way a well obviously Ronald Reagan got shot and they tried to shoot Andrew Jackson twice a one time the gun did not go off it got wet and he ended up being the guy with a cane fright\n[laughter] he actually died with bullet still in his\nBody including one large near as hard that they were never able to operated on a because it was considered so dangerous uh\nYeah Jackson within a dual with an opponent\nAnd who is considered to be a perfect shot and everyone said he's gone or and so Jackson they marched out they turn and Jackson didn't shoot his opponent shop\nAnd they thought how cruel objects and you just kinda does there and and he must have missed and this guy was a perfect shot and then Jackson cool they lowered its pesto aimed and killed the man after it was over they found out he hadn't missed the perfect shot\nHave actually shot jets and then that was the bullet near his heart but he had survived it so very dramatic a very interesting people both of them\nYeah I just love the Andrew Jackson philosophy\nUh is is pretty cool and his mom gave it to him she said this make friends by being honest keep them by being steadfast never tell a lie or take what is not your own newer sue for slander settle the cause of cases yourself he did that his entire life she died when he was fourteen but he held onto that\nThat's true that's true and that uh uh you know I Love your book by the way Bryon just\nCovers the life and your book there were differences\nBetween Trump and Jackson Trump was born into riches Jackson into poverty Trump came from a large family Jackson's father died before he was born and as you point out is mother died when he was young though some say\nThat he ... in his whole life with all the bullets they took to the chance to talk with his life that he was a journey back into his mother's arms because his mother left him as a child\nTo attend a wounded soldiers of the revolutionary war and he wanted to be worthy of being wounded and worthy of his mother's love attention and the\nTheory that so but what fascinating story you wrote and you're making come alive and your book\nYeah so and thank you very much coming from you dug lead that means a lot I Love this wind and they don't want to ask you about the whole war on history he says this uh in his farewell address after his eighth year\nI thank God that my life has been spent to the land of liberty that he has given me a hard to love my country with the affection of his son his son to his country a father\nTo his people this guy wasn't sitting there in English class hanging out with Mark Twain a that was coming from the got he was self taught myself to a lawyer judge congressmen two term President Bush in general\nAnd lastly Doug do you worry about\nThis ... movement to take take gender roles and leaders and Americans and presidents off their pedestal because we're judging them on values that we have today\nYeah it's really a remarkable you know Washington D.

I just wanted to call you and ask your question no I really enjoy your program ... and and I appreciate all that you've done for the country are trying to get the truth out there but I don't understand is why Mr Trump for President Trump would start out with more\nAnd more uh you know I mean we try to make us look like a parent investigation as far as I can start because he hadn't asked the Hillary camp anything or are they didn't break into her a officers or take all our lawyer stuff I mean that'd be some interest\nTake all our lawyer stuff I mean that'd be some interesting reading don't you think\nI think so yeah that would be some interesting reading Glenn just keep my this is just Rudy kind of power in the fields just testing the waters he's in Bloomberg threw it out there that then the president said you know my my answer some questions but it's totally legitimate so I don't\nThink anything certain but he read the last couple of chapters in the Woodward book I did you get a real tone of what mother was after from John Dowd John Dowd regrets cooperating they thought were they going to work on it together and get this thing over with and find out what the Russians did Nixon you know it becomes clear that that Mueller has the agenda for Trump\nAnd trying to set up a big perjury so find out something huge misstated or\nMissed remembered and get them on that it's a big perjury trap ready to get a ready to happen here he is last night on this um cut forty one\nTo should have never been a special counsel my opinion it's an illegal investigation totally a lot of people agree with me a lot of people on your show and another shows agree that there was no collusion there was never any collusion it shouldn't have ever happened but with all of that being said I Do get along\nI Am made everything available you know why because I have nothing to do with Russia\n[laughter] uh and that's how he feels he says I'll make everything available he did but if you don't remember who you talk to and twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen\nAnd they will you know look at Mike Flynn look at bat but apple is a look at look at the uh the other people that got caught up in this Rick Gates\nBut nothing to do with throwing in election by the way now Julian Assange might be exported from London where\nHe said he held up in the Ecuadorian embassy that looked like they got to get rid of him sue might be coming right over here and maybe he's going to a talk and maybe exonerate\nOr implicate the president but we're credibility does he have which is a problem here is more on the president on the other question cut forty to\nMention they kill us that have to do anything because we didn't do anything but we will probably uh\nDo something else will respond to some ...\n... [noise] I don't know can you do that is the first to get Fifteen question do you respond to eight then everyone's going to focus on why\nHe didn't answer those eight I I don't know how you do some of the questions but Democrats a theory is if Democrats get the house they will begin to pressure mother to either step aside conclude this thing because they want to do their own investigation\nAnd so far it's been handled smaller lid Malone he's a professional he's got no agenda he's a Republican appointed by a Republican retained by a Democrat leave him alone\nWell now Democrats will change\nTheir tune because they are going to want to run a lot of these investigations because uh the report they want to a PIN number Republicans down\nFollow up on subpoenas that Devin Nunes want to know part of a that's why so much is at stake especially in ... county and in the state of California where there's still a lot of red areas that they want a foot blow one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine our troops headed to the board of what would they do Jennifer Griffin will tell us next\nSo there are these very uh important legal restrictions to remember and so no matter what uh you know what you may be hearing and what the president may say the lawyers and there are many lawyers here at the Pentagon say otherwise there are limitations to what these troops can do they can free up\nJust like and remember President Bush and President Obama sent the national guard down thousands of troops down to the border at various times\nDuring the presidency because of an immigration to help secure the border a these are active duty troops it's really the first time that we know that active duty troops are being involved but their role is no different\nThan those National Guard troops and they are not repeat not going to be building camps for migrants\nRushed ... deterrent word gets out military on the border but in reality they're going to have to show a lot of restraint and I go to support\nI think that's exactly true this is designed to get maximum publicity to be broadcast down into Central America and to deter people from making that dangerous thousand miles\nPlus journey paying a paying those uh those people who are preying on their misery charging them seven thousand dollars a person to make that journey those are what the the coyotes and the people who are involved in human trafficking charged to these poor migrants um and\nSo so yes I Believe a lot of what we're seeing right now is they're using the U.S military as a symbolic deterrent but they are not going to be standing guarding the border per se and I it's just important to keep a and understanding of what they are allowed to\nDo and what they're not yeah I understand but I also do we does all this money for defense and you know I was hollowed out you do the special about how you are how to take apart vehicles in order to be able to get on the goals\nOf a century a strip them out because we are so out of money you know we finally get money to those department and they were putting it on our border\nWell that's the real concern is that remember when\nIt on a border well that's the real concern\nIs that remember when you have a defense budget even when it's as large as the Pentagon's budget and you know seven hundred and fifty or so billion dollars\nThat money is all allocated by Congress to very specific programs and to reprogram that money in the past when President Bush and President Obama sent a National Guard to the board are typically a D O D Pentagon would be reimbursed by da chess\nThis time I'm told they will not be reimbursed and it will come out of that large defense budget but that's not a slush fund that money has all been allocated so right now the controller here at the Pentagon is scrambling because they're going to be asked by Congress where this money is coming from they don't just keep a budget of I mean this could be\nUp to one point two billion dollars that will be for sending these troops down on temporary assignment\nThe ... when President Bush sent six\nThousand troops down to the border it cost one point two billion dollars so that money is not just sitting around in the Pentagon budget it has all been allocated and as you mentioned it was supposed to be used for things like reading is improving the planes that were falling out of the sky that we described or being ... in the bone yards\nOr two after Seventeen years of war to to improve the military readiness it was a not designated to send us troops to the border so now they're scrambling trying to figure out where to find that money in the in the defense budget\nI guess so and do things are true of defense Mattis had to be convinced to do this\nLook I'm not going to speculate on that\nI certainly know that a Secretary Mattis\nHad to consult with lawyers and and that's what they do anytime us troops are are sent anywhere and there have to be a they still have not determined the rules of engagement and exactly how a that has not been defined on paper I read the order that mad assigned on friday and it is talking about support capabilities that the\nUS military can provide to the border patrol but\nIt is a complicated legal dance whenever you send us troops and we have had a law in this country a tradition in this country since Eighteen Seventy eight that unless uh that that innocence us troops are not supposed to be armed on us soil and used in a law enforcement capacity\nI mean we still have we have border patrol we have um local law enforcement uh the it is very hard not\nTo see how this is not time to coincide with the election next week the reason that they're using active\nDuty troops as they can deploy a lot faster we're told than the national guard last night the president made some remarks in his interview with Laura Ingraham is getting some attention here at the Pentagon in which he uh was perceived to have a suggested that the national guard were not\nAble to be used in this circumstance and that that suggesting they don't move quickly enough of that the\nReason that you're seeing active duty troops used is because they can deploy quickly but it is an unusual use of them in terms of the traditional role that they've had run the Pentagon and hear it on us soil\nWho Jennifer how was been dealing with the modest events forms of compared to others were the pluses and minuses pretty well it's\nIt's complicated because certainly the biggest change is that we don't have very many a press briefings anymore we have to a ... there are not as many briefings and the briefing room there is a briefing taking place right now that to be fair\nFrom Baghdad with the um the public affairs officer of who is stationed out there tell updating us on the ISIS fight so we do get those weekly briefings but\nHe used to be that every few weeks we would have uh the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chief seated side by side taking our questions from the professional Pentagon press corps which is about you know twenty to thirty people who are here every day in the briefing room that doesn't happen anymore the last time that the\nPentagon I think if I remember correctly the last time that the Pentagon had a press conference in the briefing room with a spokesman or an official from the Pentagon was in may so that's quite some time and so that's a real change from the past um and you know what can I say that that is a change\nYou got it uh Jennifer thanks so much interesting times thank you Jennifer Griffin from a Washington we come back from your phone calls retro take one now John listened W. N. I. S. Norfolk, Virginia hey John\nAre good soldiers will show ...\nOh okay well we're talking about the border and the ... so I think Trump will do well president will do well if you would call an emergency session of this because I think it really is I don't think it's going to be taken lightly\nAnd I don't mind him sending troops as long as we just want something to try and put a stop to it I'm throwing them around or send a message or like for him to grow up and like you couldn't stream of promote the White House live or and bought the networks over also show up and he needs to\nIt works or whoever wants to show up and he needs to ask every senator point blank on camera and knowing\nWhat they would like to do about this and have their expressions I mean I don't ... don't let them get out of it and keep them on that camera ... answer the question and if they refuse to show up make sure that salt camera to let the American voter see what they are voting for\nBecause enough is enough I mean\nIt's it's horrible I I got a you know I got compassion for people\nThat do but after a while the welcome mat is nothing but a doormat you get a brand new home he got the welcome mat people walk over to a few years now a doormat that's maybe that's what would become\nYeah maybe John good point I Love your analogies we'll be back in the moment with your calls this is the bright killing each other and let me just remind you can go Andrew Jackson miracle New Orleans data paperback now I'm going to be in a Grand Rapids this weekend over to Indiana to I Hope to see everybody go to Brian kill me dot com and find out where a beat where I'm going\nTo have this he's the Brian kill me show [noise]\nNews Ninety five five AM seventh empty you asked me\n\nMinute John right big buildup boxing dot com pre\nIs the new streaming subscription service that will add to the Daily Show\nDocumentary on demand from\nFor every ... o'clock Nick dot com reorder now get one of a kite exclusive merchandise\nDon't miss your chance to become a founding\nOf the nation dot com and pre order\nRight now if you're like most of us you have a balance in your credit card in higher interest rate than you would like why not turn those balances into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate and start saving money\nLife's dream offers credit card consolidation loans from six point one four percent a PR with auto pay you gonna get a loan for I don't know five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars you can even get your funds as soon as the day you apply why streams really cool it believes it people with good credit deserve a great interest rate with no fees can you imagine that\nMy listeners out because he had been more with an additional interest rate discount on top of ice creams already low rates\nThe only way to get this discount is to go to light streamed dot com slash kill me to\nThat light stream L.

and he says that\nHe was looking at is an executive order that would remove birthright citizenship that citizenship for baby is born in the United states of non citizens and on authorized or people who are illegal immigrants born in the United\nA full citizenship as he should have been granted is that because of the racist or gun control laws of the day because he could not possess firearms due

it propelled the argument forward does it elevate the argument at all does it does it grant anyone who was watching what is being discussed further insight into the issues on a deeper level does it do any of these things\nNo no all it does is it makes people clapped like seals because the particular part is that they prefer I Know you're like all that they they just they they get some red meat that's all it is it's charming water never push back on it either this is also by the way the same network that says Fox is dividing us\nThat the network that you just heard all of this on is mad because they say Fox is dividing us\nIn fact CNN Business had a tweet earlier today it says quote the Pittsburgh suspect I've got a talking point that dominated Fox News airwaves and discussing the

just this all crazy I Want to um this is Brian ... by the way in discussing\nAnd trying to blame all of this and I remember that comment which the president was responding was on CNN this is Ryan ...

when are you going to start well\nI don't know your network ... you're the president of CNN blamed him for\nA ... uh the the bombings Dave de de ... said that they were quote attacks on Trump's

same\nReaction when it was a Bernie broke who shot up a ball field or people who are on the left who decided that they were going to send rice and out or I Love by the way to spend that I saw from CNN recently when they said that the gunshots into all the ... county Republican office we're just quote vandalism in quote\nUm I don't see that being treated that particular way um but I Do find it ironic that a network that wants to lecture everyone else about tone held a town hall where people were screaming burn her\nAnd we're trying to get up on the stage and a network where are they allowed everyone to de de did everything that they could to inflame pass and pass it passions to the breaking point purposefully\nSo that they could get the most viewers which is why I had very harsh words for that network pointedly and other networks that would behave in such a fashion the day after a this is a network that day routinely\nUse the ... the guise of journalism to go after and try to settle scores with people politically and I'm\nNot saying that any network is free from it but what bothers me is that they pretend to be objective while they do it and that's the thing that I find most concerning no one believes that you're being objective at least one people on Fox or auditory ... they come out and they say that they're conservatives and they really don't leave any\nAny ... any space Adel whatsoever to assume otherwise but the problem is that there are so many people on\nA with CNN that take effect and I know because I used to work there or they take offense\nTo the assumption that they are editorializing or that they are part is an or that they do have an opinion either way\nThey believed that they believe the lie that they are somehow bipartisan an air presenting things and it completely objective manner and that just simply isn't the case\nNow no one expects people to not have any opinion out all whatsoever about the news\nBut when you accuse other individuals namely your competitors of editorializing things and they've always been up front and honest about it\nWhile simultaneously denying that you yourself do the same thing while also presenting this lie of objective is to readers and to viewers as a way to get them to think that what you're doing his actual objective journalism when in fact it's no better than editorial position\nThan we have a problem we have a problem with with ... with with being disingenuous we have a problem with honesty we have a problem with consistency\nThat's what this is now\nAnd it's not just CNN audio somebody twenty six Mika Brzezinski goodness she also chimes in on this listen\nStock that you were holding\nActually has it puts you in ownership with a media company that is spreading white nationalist wise lies about leprosy lies about small pox lies about the others invading the\n... to take a look Arab ally white nationalism you can invest in some of these Fox News programs and the fog his house\nOh my goodness that is so crazy so this really over money\nWhat ... what what place are they in by the way I don't know it was like Thirteen plus I I don't know I um [noise] oh goodness I and again they were just lecturing about tone\nIt isn't substantive to say well I simply dislike what you're saying because you are a\nWell you would go because you're a racist and a white nationalist this doesn't this doesn't work well for the laugh when they do when they engage in things like this this doesn't\nWhen they do when they engage and things like this\nThis doesn't this doesn't help anybody and by the way there's even more uh the Washington Post Max Boot blamed right wing media for domestic terrorism Oh yes Oh yes oh there's more but wait there's more Florida Senator

... you know he was a socialist right\nAnd it just gets it gets more and these are all people who are simultaneously lecturing about tone their lecture and about tone over and over and over\nWhile

American Psychological Association report on stress in America great report by the way oh yeah did you read the whole thing down from that I Know what\nHe texted me last night he said this uh this this is this reports on page Turner [laughter] what are the things that I saw on the order a jeans ears are stressed about issues in the news\nBut they're the least likely to vote you sounded like you said ... ... ... the earth yes this is the\nGeneration after millennia that's right people who are about Twenty years old now somewhere in twenty like you're not as if you have to have a I have a millennial and I have a ... year old boys as things go crazy when those two get together they should make a sitcom among money on a Gen Z or try to\nBe roommates and uh [laughter] ones politically correct\nAnd the other one wants to make money that's basically how I Would see that sitcom going I think that uh\nThis is anecdotal but I think that the Generation Z first of all young people usually don't vote they have opinions and they don't vote so that's nothing new my anecdotal evidence is that a Jens ears are a lot different than millennials\nThink they're now when I say they are more conservative I don't mean that there I mean the fiscal either more conservative I don't think socially they're necessarily more conservative but I think they're more conservative when it comes to I think there are certainly more open\nTo Republican ideas on the economy and things along those lines gyms ears may be the first actual libertarians I think that they are for the most part socially liberal and\nEconomically a conservative fiscally conservative\nAnd where's the millennials are just wishy washy on everything it's all about feelings I think that a Gen Z\nAnd millennials are on a collision course\nAnd it's going to be I'll probably be dead by the time it really ... but it's going to be something that plays out over the years ahead 'cause I remember the millennials were told by Obama they are they came to the economy had crashed they were living in that world right\nAnd they were told by Obama oh don't even think about ever getting that economy your parents talk about that's that's that's gone you need to get used to uh the New America where America knows its place it's just another country\nAnd we go through kind of relatively good times and bad times but we'll never have that booming economy American economy\nThat you hear about from your parents and grandparents and it seemed pretty obvious to them because as they came into their own for years and years and years there were part of a very bad economy uh\nThe gyms ears very early on in their\nEarly adulthood have tasted a good economy\nAnd I probably most of them find the president to be vulgar as a a lot of young people do but they've tasted a good economy and they know that it's possible very early on in their adulthood they're a part of not only just a good economy but a booming economy so ...\nAnd only just a good economy but a booming economy so Tommy's go up and down and we have Democrats and Republicans who are president and governors and all that\nSo it's these two generations get older and older and the older you get the more likely you are to vote\nI see a collision course here happening where the gyms ears are going to become the uh the conservative check on the millennial progressive as they get into their forties and fifties and there's going to be real hatred\nBecause the millennials first of all just the fact that they're actually going to find themselves older\nWill really disturb knock it because they think old people are just creeping so the fact that they could actually age themselves they'll already be grumpy is generation because they didn't think that would happen to them but then as they try to change the world and turn it into a college professors I deal country\nThey're going to have these Jens ears behind them who are going to be voting for a good and booming economy because they actually tasted it\nThe first time they went out to vote the first time that they went out to the first couple of times and I'm not saying that manifest itself now because I think most young people still are\nBeing young and being liberal go to go together hand in hand you're idealistic you don't have a whole lot of experience in the real world it's easy to tax people who are you when you're not in the workplace and it's not coming out of your wallet uh but I think as\nThe to get older\nAh I look to the gyms ears to be the place where we can maybe at least keep a halfway\nDecent economy going ah hopefully again and league it'll be a here's another thing I could absolutely predict\nThe Libertarian Party the so called Libertarian Party will screw it up and not and not get in as well they'll allow the Democrats and Republicans to pull but these the gyms ears are the closest thing to I think the libertarian spirit as\nThey come out of their teens going into their twenties is the Libertarian Party there with a structure to pull them in and become a real not just third but second party no it won't happen so what'll happen is they'll become swing voters\nWho are socially liberal fiscally conservative and a check on the idealistic millennials want nothing more than two gift they're old college professors would the world that they wished for

fighting fellow Democrats so she's calling in ads crazy and the Democrats are mad about that and I'll get to that in a second but now with a poll numbers tagging going into the last week of the campaign now Claire McCaskill getting more desperate\nNow she's begging Missouri voters to believe her when she says\nI support President Trump a hundred percent on securing the border\nWell that's odd because I don't think I've ever heard Claire McCaskill ever chant or talk about building that wall even once\nAnyway she told the fake news CNN that she supports the president a hundred percent do

you don't count because you have a language all of your own which is called them as Lauren will just call Philly street talk you know with an added flavor of New York and welcome 'em I support them in a hundred percent oh that desperation\nThat's really desperation I'm I'm I Can't wait to see what the what you might say tomorrow the president's right on everything I just happened to vote the wrong way every single time for the last two years\nAre very very close looking much better on the Senate side for Republicans forty five retirements is a lot that means a lot of new faces Southern California later on we'll check in with a congresswoman Mimi Walters of California's forty fifth\nCongressional district or they've got literally between Dana Rohrabacher and and these satellites as old seat you know former New York city mayor\nMayor Bloomberg just spent what nine million dollars in Southern California alone also have a tough battle going on in Washington state in the eighth district Dino Rossi will step in and check in with us a little bit later or in Iowa's third district we gotta fight going on there a lot of outside money coming in as well against David Young\nAnd he joins us now apparently and I love these people in the Democratic side they're all saying the same thing healthcare healthcare while we welcome to the program David Young appreciate your being with us but they have people that gave us what did they give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa shots\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about\nTheir they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we asked us protection sport layers of it in our Republican health care bill\nA lot of pent listen lying is just a part of the playbook of the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse you know look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but out they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support\nFor Israel including moving the capital to\nJerusalem wearable along so well it's interesting so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I assume you're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you\nAnd we're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you and how the people of Iowa reacting to\nOh yeah I'm getting out spin about four to one for my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's message versus money my opponent on her money is coming from from the east and left the and the west coast a message over money and results right results look what we have done with this economy\nOn a national international stages well with the president when it comes to sitting down with North Korea\nHad it for ... ah we would help or making sure that yeah we did move that embassy from Tel Aviv Israel prompts has kept and being a shining light on the hill or were there was a lot of doctors for a long time still is but at least try and bite or we lead in the world others will follow a more prosperity and peace uh\nYou'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nI think it's not a lot of things that are voting\nLook I took a vote for any Democrat in any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs it was a vote proposed because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi and vote with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings\nA look at the the agenda Democrats is it's it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back they want to limit their eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just\nThe definition of just or destiny considering they look how many there are counties I read in Iowa that I've seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors and plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that's\nIt yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high\nThey can't even ... they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right my opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue with that could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp\nFor hopefully not Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes\nBorders doubling down on government run health care and of course what they tried to keep on of the rock shot and you do this and our listeners in on this impeachment\nMhm now that an endless investigation but not into the deep state um which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file\nA Justice Department and intelligence people but\nThey do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon well listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy racist if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now\nAnd one week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a hope all the best you and six days a it's tough out there nobody can predict what certain say but I Will tell you know I I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me and I never you never really have a feel for how the house is going to go twenty hen might be an exception\nWhere I mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans have been out of power for forty years that Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nAnd also if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against that forty five retirement and a headwind of history that usually the party in power loses a lot of seats\nThe first term but then like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving of Clinton because things got better because Newt Gingrich force Clinton into what led to balance budgets and serious reforms in Washington\nAnd I think the same thing you know you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty ten ... especially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats are that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating to me there is a brass museum poll out today I had to go back and double check it showing that African American support for the president is now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement if you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey\nTrump's approval ratings than he is at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range and I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not before and\nAnd all the media likes to go after asking me a ... I don't know why he's a great guy in a smart poster but you know they say oh he's a right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that rats museum was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have\nSixteen so if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact on the midterm elections but again it's all up to now interesting developments as it relates to the issue of the caravan\nUm and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico\nAnd uh now you have and I look this is how I see most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey hoping opportunity and the American dream\nAnd when you live in poverty and countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that care of and want a better life and that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen\nThe president's been very clear um the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants\nAnd from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage point two percent\nOr you know last source our quarter reporting the cheap identified him as Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away um but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking that people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not gonna let them in ... he but there's there'll be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty or nation built on a on a constitutional\nRepublic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked the people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border officials telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan\nA that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer telling the examiner", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "31"}
