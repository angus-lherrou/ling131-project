what you make\nA lot of people got ripped off in illegal payday loans\nAnd certainly not all payday lungs are illegal but there is now half a billion dollars in refund checks being mailed out to people I'll tell you about in today's car courageous moment and who should be looking at their mailbox and later\nWindsor family not a family when you're on a family plan for some kind of digital streaming I'm going to tell you what you need to know how the rules of the road\nAre changing and speaking of change big changes\nGoing on with the how we're being verified there's a significant problem I've shared with you on several occasions as different instances of arisen with people's vehicles being stolen now\nAnd the problems with the modern ...\nAnd how criminals are able to use a little ... to steal your signal to your key fob as you're walking away from your car and a parking lot and you come back to your vehicle and it's gone there and now people selling\nThese cases you're starting to see him and more and more places they protect the signal of your key fob\nSo you need to actually get in your car but\nWill likely future and the first people ever to do this to my knowledge was Mercedes several years ago where you will start your car with your fingerprint\nAnd that will lemonade the problem of people being able to steal your car by stealing the signal from your key\nBut do you know in Europe already\nMore and more people are having credit card transactions verified with\nFacial scans fingerprints various forms of biometrics because the credit card system and the and the world not just here has had such a hard time stamping out fraud\nGood time to start something like that\nIt under today I Am not a yes around and I just remember when I\nTried to tried to start this when I was young is you know you start with no credit and it was just kind of frustrating 'cause nobody would even look at you with\nCredit exactly well that's why it just kinda and they told me back then the best way to get credit was to use a credit card responsibly and then go from there\nAnd that advice is still is sound when you were told it then is it is today but by the time your kids are older I'm not sure that will be the advice\nOh also freezing their credit today you've got a lot of paperwork to do to freeze the child's credit but it sure is peace of mind for them because children are so much more likely to have their identities stolen than an adult\nWall and never even crossed my mind until you said you know somebody could use it without you even knowing it which is totally true I just thought well you know they'll assume that it's a nine year old child they're down by a car but for the call so [laughter]\nI I'm Sorry about that I Wish that the credit reporting industry did a better job and didn't make it so easy for people to steal the identity of a child but it would cost the industry more money\nFor the software that would that would actually prevent all the children's in any theft incidents that doesn't really hurt them it just hurts you and your kids they're not putting any effort into that\nSo that is why doing their child credit freeze is such a great idea and the better solution would be if the credit bureaus did their jobs more thoroughly and more conscientiously than they do today and we would be able to stop a lot of the rampant identity theft that goes on\nBe able to stop the rampant identity theft that goes on across America you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nOne red carrier W F the twenty four hour traffic

follows your similar commuting pattern and we'll do a match game and you get paid for driving that person as someone in your car pool\nSo the advantage in metro areas where there are carpool lanes where you need to three or four people in the car to ride in the carpool lane\nAnd that could save me an enormous amount of time being able to find somebody through the ways car pool lab which is a separate app of ways\nYou could kill two birds with one stone ... some of the cost of your commute because they're paying you to ride with you only reimbursing you up the IRS legal max so fifty some odd cents a mile\nAnd so it helps you reduce your costs and if there is the car pool thing gets you in the carpool lane and gets you through traffic much quicker it's not like\nHaving a UFO getting your car though because\nRazors are in fact track so thoroughly you're not going to have somebody who could be an ax murderer who suddenly is in your vehicle\n'cause it's tough to drive with somebody trying to swing an ax at you or whatever so not good for you or the axe murderer trying to do that so this is\nPotentially I think about how many cities around the country\nThat have extremely difficult suburban to suburban commutes or suburban to entering suburb or central city commutes where being able to have people car pool with you\nCould take away a lot of the time suck of your current commute and so if you're looking for a way maybe\nTo ride with somebody else at a very low cost or you're looking for a way to defray your costs of operating a motor vehicle or you're looking

though I have a question of police yes\nA lot less than ... and uh I was just wondering what kind of like a show is out there\nI was just wondering what kind of like his show is out there for them to just\nIt is not easy for people in their seventies to find affordable life insurance because usually by the time somebody's in their seventies they've got something wrong with them some form of pre existing condition that insurers are afraid of\nTell me specifically what is the insurance need for your parents\nTo tell it to a show that that have off or whatever\nOkay so the older\nAll right so when somebody dies and less debt is jointly held in most states the survivors are not responsible for the debt\nSo you don't normally have to have life insurance to deal with a let's say with a husband and wife only and trying to remember is that six states are eight states that are known as community property states\nUm everywhere else the debts of one state as the debts of that one and do not become debts of the other\nOkay\nSo life insurance is not something normally you would have to worry about um one thing I recommend with people who are getting up and ... years like your parents\nIs that it's not a good idea to have joint credit cards okay because with joint credit cards what happens is the one dies\nThe other is responsible and like uh if there's a car loan you don't want to have the car loan necessarily in both names also so having debts that are separate as someone reaches\nUm the later stages of life is something that is a better plan\nSo do your parents have a great deal of debts though\nA lot too much is just a but allowed ... to make sure they all left and\nRight right so I'm so speaking of leaving this earth ... ... talk through review\nWhat they want to have happened at time if they're passing if they want to have a traditional funeral they want to have traditional burial do they want to be cremated like it has it been a family conversation since it sounds like you're the one who's going to\nUh be response won't be helping out [noise] have you had those kind of conversations are not yes okay now working on it\nAll right so that's a conversation I'd really like you to have\nBecause nobody really seems to want to address the subject and you may be surprised that one or both your parents really do want to talk about it but nobody has gotten around to asking them\nOkay because that makes a difference as well you know if somebody says oh no we don't want anything fancy don't go spend a lot of money on a funeral and this is what we want or whatever it gives you some peace of mind and understanding and also you know\nHow they feel about spending a lot or a little or whatever on final arrangement some people\nWant very very specific and want really fancy funerals was special things in them and whatever but the more you know the more you understand about that the better\nOne other thing about that is there's a website I'd like you to look at coal funerals dot org\nAnd they're in much of the country there are these co ops that you can join for like almost no money they give you access to much cheaper funerals much cheaper burials if somebody chooses cremation and much cheaper cremation\nAnd so I you know when when someone asked me about how it what should we\nBe doing with our parents and their expenses and worried about that one of the things that your parents tend to ask me about his this kind of stuff and that's why the more you know when you go to talk to them about what they want you're able to give advice and guidance and suggestions but\nI don't know that life insurance at this point really sounds like a big priority\nSteve is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Steve\nHey how ya doing great thank you Steve how can I be of service to you\nOh I've got to retirement planning question I'm sixty one my wife is sixty to our house which is how you buy an online service said just a little less than four hundred thousand dollars is completely paid a combined need and you will\nIt's just completely paid off our combined annual income now it's about a hundred and sixty thousand kids are grown they're on

definition of Taipei as a personal trainer and she's also working at a daycare center has a blast there is no stress and she loves that\nThat's neat okay 'cause\nI work fulltime but I'd like to retire soon um we do keep track of of networks on one of the ... and I met with I checked but this one is just about one quiet for a million that includes the value of the helps\nHow'd you know that was my next question [laughter] so you can listen to the I wasn't too too much\nFor the house cannot generate income for you but the million dollars you have the way you figure that is you figure the million dollars will generate a and grow to cover inflation about forty thousand dollars a year\nSo if you base that that at this point would generate forty grand and your wife has a pension generating so much and at some point you'll one or both of you will be eligible for Social Security\nWill if she has um she's eligible now for the minimum I Believe but I think we'd like to wait until\nYou want to wait and you want to wait as long as you possibly can for both of you so the question ultimately is can you live on a ... theoretically forty grand coming from what you've saved\nThe money she has her pension money both of you would have from Social Security and whatever part time stuff she and you do for a fine like she's doing it or because you want to supplement income if you can live on that

S. had been at loggerheads really for the last year or so we don't like the direction of that country there are good comedy is crashing\nSo they want to keep their pride at the same time they want to rekindle relations have not economic relations have everything else so do you think that they would benefit from a crashing of a Saturday American relationship\nI think they probably would feel they would benefit but I don't think that sense of benefit or could even possibly explain a the notion that they have cooked all this up I think that is really a in the er never never land a fear right now\nI think we have to believe what they have provided\nA their intelligence services are among the bashed in the region um\nWe have a many contacts with them and despite the fact of relationship is not perfect with them right now we're still have a a major airbase at ... uh they're still a NATO ally a and I think we have every reason to believe that they are coming forward here or with the troops\nSo I Want to you Bob Corker said yesterday cutting Nineteen\nIt just will change the relationship the warmth all dissipate uh it'll be far more business like and certainly there are going to be put at\nAt arm's length on many issues that we deal with them all and there's an arrogance that has developed with them over the last year and a half a an entitlement there's just something about the way they deal with us now that is very very different\nAnd by ambassador to explain the city because his crime print state is American Tour trying to tell everybody that women are going to be able to drive going to try to give people additional freedom try to be more tolerant tried to allow more demonstrations why go give us that toy dog and pony above pony show but yet you haven't changed\nThe crown princes anxious for foreign direct investment foreign direct investment since the uh\nIn prison his cousins and uncles that rich Carlton a year ago a has dropped off of cliffs or it has a gone from a seventh day and a two one billion dollars so he is anxious for foreign direct investment\nOr he is trying to put a happy face on it but bear in mind that at the same time he is allowing women to drive is imprisoning women who had a demonstrated or agitated for that right he's making it clear\nThat every privilege they receive in Saudi Arabia comes from him and not from any kind of stunned or mineral rights and that's a very important distinction so yes she can it can point to\nWhat's happening in my ...\nSo she was just referring to I guess the immigration policies so it's happening they said do you think people might take to take that wrong\nI I think that I think first of all that's going to be the most telling commercial where she's going to have to face the rest of the campaign those remarks will\nBe amplified the that was was a times over and over again that commercial I'm sure you've or if\nIt was simply stupid she said you don't compare when you're representing a state any other state a strictly was little rivalry between Texas and Arizona so my sense is twice\nWhat's that little rivalry between Texas and Arizona so my sense is one of those was steaks you should have known about but a long time ago because she'll have to live with the rest away and that could be very very critical of groceries\nUm overall but let's go over to Texas now a call ... was talking about Texas He said ... she just stopped saying ... his name is Robert\nHe's got a lot of charisma he's very good on his feet had some guy looks like Robert F Kennedy but he's a Democrat he talked about the epidemic of of police violence against minorities\nYou know he talks about health care for all universal Medicare so does that something should be resonating with Texans as he takes on Ted Cruz I mean he was within a few points and now he Ted Cruz beginning to pull away here's what Karl Rove said cut thirty seven\nPeople are waking up to the fact that Beto O'Rourke\nRobert Francis O'Rourke is a very liberal guy in favor of impeachment once a government run health care\nAre in favor of free college universal job thinks that the ... said that he can think of nothing more American he said then take him and then decided to take a knee or at the plate of the national anthem that's not a very the Texas guy the more he gets known as a liberal the less as a moderate\nOr the the stronger in his but people have strong opinions about Bedouin strong opinions about that but at the end of the day it's gonna be a red victory\nYou ... do you think to cause right there\nAnd no one knows ... no one knows the country better than Carl and certainly Texas a which is where he lives in where he basically built a reputation Ted Cruz is a very strong candidate people forget that he actually had a\nVery very strong campaign against Trump last time that probably the best campaign operation I'm going and he's got all those people are there again any themselves very strong candidate he's very articulate and I think a certain extent he's going to have the one that the one that fairly easily\nI think what they say it reminds me of little Bush forty one he when he was a successful businessman made the transition into politics he lost a couple of races including a Senate race but they said while in a democratic state of Texas\nThis Bush guy did very well and he was tapped by the Nixon administration somebody they could join there and and begin to make his name known and they're seeing the same thing in beta O'Rourke even if he loses am I correct\nYeah ... they they see him as a future a national candidate a you know he's a ... he's attractive the raised a lot of money on the Internet or you know Democrats are desperately looking for young candidates are they're very old very outdated party\nA and clearly their message a which is higher taxes more spending uh is is meant totally rejected by the Trump\nPeople and I think to a certain extent will be rejected again\nBut you know the trend uh and you've tried to push against the trend when you were with Reagan the trend is a go back and push back on the party in power and so that's what the uh Donald Trump is fighting against what did the cabin or a ... confirmation do for this race\nBut I think I think it was such an outrageous attack a man of great the credibility and great a great reputation that I think we realize a ruthless and without discipline or the Democrats will be I mean there's there's no no and what they will do\nAnd I like [noise] we now know that uh I think what we're going to beat them as people don't realize is is we have an extraordinary ground game of the congressional committee that National Committee or some of the super PACs could ordinary people on the ground the races the competitive races so I think if you don't\nSee that you know national report that Democrats have done very little of that and I think a certain extent they're going to pay a very\nInteresting and Florida you're actually going to earn the wind or not it ain't governor Rick Scott is chief strong\nWhich he always seems to be very organized guy and Ford and knows how to do hurricanes\nThat would boost to Senate prospects and then somehow Rhonda Santas has the congressmen who wants to be a governor show himself competent in this situation how would you invite advised the Republican or running against a Gillum\nWho has got a lot of support and even though he seems to be a failed mayor in Tallahassee how well how would you tell them\nI think the key thing here is don't don't over in don't miss represent Gilligan's record just talk about what he's done and what your stance for because he is a socialist uh\nUh and I think the reality is that he he is not a\nCredible candidate but if you go try and go overboard I have a reaction to ... ... that I Would probably not ever on dissenters just sort of stumbled out of\nOut of the box up he's got a good campaign manager there ... or\n... comes campaign has used to work with me in the White House many years ago and she is as good as anybody in Florida a you know as I Am very confident the Scots gonna land Scott has a very strong candidate he does very well in national crisis and this is a big crisis down there is\nThis is going to clear to give him some advantage is no such as very tired\nOr his underestimate in the past week\nNo so that was very tired or his underestimate in the past when people try to beat him I was just on that he's called leagues yeah very optimistic\nOr is it do anything but I guess we'll put it this way when you have Rick Scott as governor who did so well for two years in won reelection and has that state growing in in the black\nUh besides the red tide which he has no control over this would be a Republican to lose so far we have to say that the census has not done enough to win I mean a ... any such a low profile right now I don't get it\nI don't get it either you know he was a guy who basically built a very strong reputation being on Fox ah each not doing much ... this point in time you down they run a different kind of a campaign and I think there's some disappointment a\nYou know there's still time to go a key thing there is a very aggressive at the ballot program 'cause that's a very important at upstate people are already voting down there and he just hasn't quite caught fire or I Hope he does ah I like him and and I but I think the key thing here is just exposing them for what he is what he wants to\nRaise taxes uh he's he's very socialistic because it's this approach a being mayor Tallahassee is not what\nIt takes to be mayor or governor state so I think that race will come back and again Scott Scott I think what is the ... but the Senate race and and if he dies myself to that race get a ...\nA and Fitch got does when he'll be like the one of these Lindsey Graham senators he'll be part of almost every issue he's not going to be quiet and it's just not why he doesn't\nListen these ... you see a very strong candidate a also has the resources\nTo attend and media markets data to tell a lot about organizations all about the your message on television and Scott is always run a very effective campaign sent those are all\nAround is with us now Lou Dobbs allowed me to talk to you I Know your own me anytime hurry into I'm very jealous of but I'll tell you I mean I knew what they do and uh but I'm I'm fascinated by what's emerged and that is healthcare number one the through the entire process the controversy that Michael Cohen situation\nThe Russian situation now the cabinet situation when you ask the American people what matters most is healthcare it's a mess right now and outcomes Bernie care Bernie comes out and writes a column where he says we have to get Medicare for all\nAnd guess what they're worth thirty nine states that rely on a ... will will go along with Bernie care but you know in ten years is going to cost thirty three billion dollars do you know they tried that in Vermont they had to bail out of it right away because it was on a on obtain a unsustainable do you know that doctors will get less reimbursement\nSo you're talking about a lower quality care spread out through taxpayer dollars no longer have it off from the offered from the job\nAnd the Donald Trump or to calm or somebody on this Trump staffer to say do you realize what everyone's proposing which leads Donald Trump to do something I think they'd Ed Rollins would support tell Democrats you can vote for him listen\nI think a lot of Democrats are going to vote Republican because I have many friends and the Democrats the main base of the Democrats get this far\nLeft that will end up being Venezuela would end up being Venezuela I think a lot of

show they may terms that are beyond important I don't understand why they aren't making a major advertising dollars to just show a split screen\nIt as an adult now you're going to feel great Laurie we had an ad today that is out\nThere shows all the outrageous behavior from the Ted Cruz conference too young to the Christian Nielsen confrontation or to the words of Eric Holder it out the orange she just wrote it out today\nSo Brian I mean you can appreciate where I'm coming from the the cabin on scanning their infant being sworn in by his previous mentor and thought and I think to myself the American dream is alive and well look this is one generation\nHanding at the time to another well deserved generation that can be trusted and I think to myself are you kidding me they're not split screen in that I with these crazy people and the things that they are joined between\nGuarantee what they're talking about they're going to go around and trash Trump what did what that is a that's just not what you do when you lose a presidential campaign is not a good luck and be it's not good politically for the Democratic party to still be led by the Clintons\nA couple of things are as Mark Penn said you know more than it is very smart guy and I guess he's on the ... of the Democratic party after Hillary lost the nomination away in a way but he's still a Democrat\nHe was with me today and he said I Can't believe she is doing this and he is doing this and it's seven hundred bucks a ticket the high end and nothing's going to charity here they don't need money they don't need money why would you charge seven hundred bucks to see people who don't like each other the couple doesn't like each other\nThey're probably never together they're going to be on together and\nWhy would you pay seven hundred bucks for that why wouldn't I wouldn't be seven or a Democrat or want to pay that reminds me of somebody who has a problem with the way they act in the White House to me too movement sidelines marginalize him in a hurry ineffectiveness marginalize her\nNow that's that's the best that exactly right I and I actually think a lot of democratic candidates don't want Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton's for driving around the country this fall they want this election view about the future they want us to be about the next generation of democratic leaders instead the party is continue to be dominated\nLeaders instead the party's continue to be dominated by people like Dianne Feinstein who why she's still running for reelection is beyond me Nancy Pelosi why she wants to be speaker of the house again is beyond me all the Democratic party is being held back by this senior\nOld school generation of losers people who have lost over and over again but refused to leave the scene\nOr I Want you to hear what Hillary Clinton said a couple of days ago well thought out sits down with Christine on the poor to promote this new tour that she's doing cut thirty one\nWe're not the civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse band or the fat that ... can start again I\nDon't even know what that means I mean first of all I don't think that if they win back the house this fall which I'm not confident that they will at all but if they if they did win back the house I don't think there's a a meaning civil about it I think you're going to mention Walters in charge of the banking committee and the first thing she is going to do it starts to painting everything Donald Trump is doing including his tax returns this isn't about\nBringing the country back together and forging bipartisan legislation this is about taking out Trump and Hillary Clinton just as much\nAnd by the way a niche blows he said that simple we are going to try to get his tax returns and we know too that ... Harris and others are going to lead the charge to do another investigation on Brett\nKavanaugh that's unprecedented as feeding Supreme Court justice they got confirmation now we're going to do an investigation and\nUltimately they want to impeach Brett Kavanaugh let's not forget that\nWhich is not going to happen in two thirds of the Senate which that I have the majority and so what about Eric Holder doing this Katrina and\nHe just time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are going to be dedicated as they are to be committed as they are\nReally says that you know when they go

live by\nHearst go high right if you think Republicans will do that's fine but you go hide that was her whole point and she's we view of former her body family friend and attorney general look\nThe Democratic base is really angry I mean they thought they were going to win and twenty sixteen the media told them they were gonna win and twenty sixteen and said they didn't they lost badly and Donald Trump\nWho they don't like I understand that I didn't like Brock Obama and when he won in two thousand nine and there were a lot of Republicans and we had the Tea Party movement fortune in part because people were so it it they didn't like Donald Trump they didn't or excuse me ... they didn't like the direction\nHe was taking the country\nThe Democrats think that they're going to win the nomination next year and twenty twenty by being angry by tapping into that anger and Eric Holder unbelievably wants to run for president in twenty twenty and therefore he's trying to channel some of that anger\nI think Michelle Obama is is right I I don't think they're gonna be Trump by being angry I think the only way Democrats have a shot is if they offer some hope and optimism but that is not where the Democratic party is right and\nWhen we come back out his tone it before we get you one lucky guy get your on your way I Want to talk about individual Senate races cars you know that will

within Martin here on to a former and see if they show a best selling author and I got to get your take on health care so the administration didn't really do much with health care the Republican Party led the whole country down by not having a plan ready to go\nBut I Am and Vince unless they come up a plane with a plan with both parties and uh like give with their sleeves up in both parties working on it nothing's ever going to get done\nBut I Know one thing burning care is never going to get done he's talking about Medicare for all supposed to be for seniors he's endorsed by sixteen senators including almost all the ... planning twenty twenty presidential candidates a hundred and twenty cosponsors so game plan this out\nDo you do your opponent wants Bernie care\nYeah well but let let's let's put the blame in both places grind you're well done I'd say that's Bernie says things that he doesn't mean he knows it can't happen he knows that are bankrupt the country and they think that the American people fall for it and Republicans for seven years said\nWill ... will come in and repeal Obamacare they didn't get it done right so and maybe everybody needs a reset but I won't points I agree with you on this Bryant that\nHealth care is too important to too many people to not realize that it's an issue that we have to face right eye you and I I think would prefer a technology competition more opportunities we don't want a single payer even sliding towards expanded Medicaid or anything but we got to have something\nRight and we got to use we got to leverage technology I think Trump will be game for trying this you know try to leverage technology competition\nAnd and what we can do but you're right we got to face it and and the Republicans haven't done it and by the way it's a one thing the Democrats no they're running on that a little bit they're running and saying hey those guys are supposed to do something they didn't do it so it is a problem it's got to be faced I Hope that the president knows that\nSo Bernie Sanders tries to roll this out and twenty four teen in his state of Vermont He tries to roll out of the ...\nBut in twenty fourteen in his state of Vermont\nHe tries to roll out at eleven point five percent payroll tax plus a nine point five percent income tax\nAnd with more increases coming even progressive couldn't get single payer up and running for only six hundred and twenty five thousand people there to abandon it by twenty six million voters rejected the referendum to set up a sign go pay or in Colorado so what is going on the Republicans\nMight not have the answer would they have to find a way to underline what Democrats thinks the answer is it doesn't help anybody doctors get paid less are all going to leave the profession\nRight well and the problem though is Brian is voters\nVote on what they see right\nThey see Trump and Kanye they see the economy and they see healthcare is a mess so I you know I well I agree you got to try to explain how crazy Bernie is and how men more importantly how bankrupting his vision is you know as you point out one of the things people don't realize yes it would cost trillions of dollars but\nIt would also take out of your hands decisions about healthcare you want to see people write tell them they can't go to their doctor\nThey have to go to the doctor over there I mean people so this is and that's the thing that's really damning about this socialism or that they're doing is they take away from the individual control you have to give up control of things you care about\nBut I I got to tell you I I look I I think it's just pure politics the Democrats know that got an issue that's kind of a wedge the Republicans don't have a good\nAnswer to that you could explain in one sentence or one\nUh one image and so we got to get through this election and they'd better step up and do something about it\nYeah so the president so when you look at the numbers and talk to your people yeah what percentage would you I Know what you want you want to Republican control everything but what percentage do you give the Republicans were holding on to the house first\nWell I look I've been somebody uh Brian you you maybe you won't be too surprised I've been saying it's going to be a truck red wave since January and the reason why is because I I'm from Missouri right in Missouri they told me the polls told me on the day before election\nTrump it was going to win Missouri by four percent he won by Ninety percent I see nothing that has taken away from the coalition Republicans and I see a lot that's taken away from the Democrats so I look I think they hold the house\nI might be honest I think the whole house a hundred percent I actually think they're going to hold the house with exactly what they have or maybe more I Know people think I'm Crazy but I don't think anybody understands how the bottom look the other thing Phyllis Schlafly my old boss who's to say the late Phyllis Schlafly one of the best thing she ever did was run for Congress twice\nAnd lose and I ran twice and lost myself you learn how campaigns go at this point in the campaign you can't really change the trajectory of the race you just got to kind of tweak it and the bottom is going out on the Democrats because of not because of Kavanaugh\nBecause of the economy plus Kavanaugh plus just know attraction and they get to do it I tell people give me one reason I Do the old ah Tracy Chapman's I'll give me one reason to be a Democrat\nTell me one reason maybe healthcare that's what they say but not really so I think it's about a hundred percent they hold the house to be honest\nI Want you to re me Walter said in the from the cook Political Report says listen the way we are right now no one's listening to each other we're on a separate corners cut forty two\nThis becomes about which team are you on are going to be on the red maggots had team or you're going to be on the other team and the entire a Trump presidency has been basically about picking your side taking your pain and\nFor ... to put the red hat on then he literally and saying I'm going against my team and there is a backlash to that in the same way that\nRepublicans who said or people who were normally read going to the team they get the criticism for doing that there is nothing left there is no middle there is not going to be a middle and this election is just going to I think burned or get into these beep beep beep polar polarized tomorrow\nAnd let you know it'll is the party in power holds power but if it's split it's going to be accusations and uh and interrogations\nYeah well but Brian I Amy's missing the good a political revolution it's happening because the Republican Party is as dramatically changed I mean we chased off some of the never Trump hers who were sort of global is she wanted a different don't you know not\nNot social conservative not conservative and much we've added a bunch of\nPeople that are working class looked for Missouri for Thirty years we had Democrats say they ran for president on it they're going to get part right for presidents get rid of NAFTA it was Republican got written after I got rid of TPP got us out of Paris I mean the party that the Republican Party and the Democratic party\nOr trance transforming the problem for Amy Walter she doesn't\nSee it but the problem for Democrats they're transforming to a party of women and anti men they're not even attracting African American what's the message that Nancy Pelosi has to an African American about his future her future right now\nThey don't have a message that doesn't last long politically so I think Amy's wrong I think she was wrong and the twenty sixteen I think we're in a political revolution we're in a mass movement moments that people lot of people don't recognize that what's happening\nBut that's why it's going to be so interesting after
