house window shopping Hi this is Tina some explanations and I got a tip for you we make window shopping\nYou know the he was accidentally killed\nDuring an interrogation\nNow let's remember this okay if you don't know Saudi Arabia and journalist who used to be in good with the royal family but then started doing some reporting that they didn't like\nUh ended up out of the country eventually ended up here in America where he's been living and he's been writing for Washington Post than a reporter for Washington Post for a little bit he was in Turkey\nHis fiance was Turkish he was going into the consulate the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey\nIt's done bowl ticket paperwork done so that he could get married that's the that's the way he was alert in there so when you hear the ... first of all the concept of we accidentally killed him\nReally you accidentally killed him that seems difficult to do to me first of all you have to be doing something that allows that as an accent and now I'm assuming\nThere wasn't a some sort of construction going on and oh my goodness we didn't know they were alive wires in the hallway I doubt something like that happens in the accidentally came in contact with a live electric wire that would be accidentally killing somebody\nThe fact that you are interrogating somebody just such a degree an accidental deaths as possible when they walked in to get paperwork to get married\nSo the question is and why or how did you accidentally kill this guy why was he ever in a position well getting paperwork to get married to accidentally be killed during a terrorist groups\nAnd they accidentally take 'em out and a bunch of different suitcases way\nAccidentally dismembered demand right ... and removed him piece by piece from the consulate\nNow thinking you have to understand\nSaudi Arabia are an ally they're not friends you're not be taken in by this young prince and his propaganda and believe me they pay a lot of money a lot of PR firms in this country to convince you they're changing\nWe're going to let women drive oh who celebrates that in the year twenty Seventeen\nThe response should have been it's about time but you're getting no celebration that's phoney baloney and behind the scenes they've got a young lady there are about to be had she's twenty four years old was she violent no well she's speaking up against the country yes\nThem another young lady who is still in detention after a year or two was she violent no\nDid she say things against the government yes Saudi Arabia is still just as backward as they as as they've ever been you have to ask yourself the question how do you accidentally kill a journalist who comes in to get paperwork to get married\nNow a lot of people think the reason Trump is tiptoeing around all of this is simply because we make a lot of money selling jets and other military stuff to the Saudi Arabians and that's true\nAnd it's but it's only part of the reason we could take the hit\nWe could God Forbid give up some do and actually be principled in this world we could do that\nBut it comes a little more a little more difficult right now the real reason that Trump is tiptoeing around all of this is because in about a month or so we're going to take the next and final step\nWith the sanctions on Iran\nAnd it's going to hit them in the oil industry and it's going to take a couple of million barrels of oil off the world market\nBarrels of oil off the world market in an order for everything we're dealing with Iran is working were squeezing member killing their economy and once we take this final step\nIt's going to be really really tough for Iran\nBut the way we keep that final step from turning into four dollars and fifty cents a gallon gas is that our friends the Saudis released a couple of more million barrels of oil they make up for the shore to make up for the shortage\nAnd if they don't\nWhat we do is going to still hurt Iran as much as it would have heard before but it's also going to hurt here and people generally get upset with the government here in America when they're spending above four dollars\nGallon for gas and so with all of that ad jeopardy that's the real reason you have to understand is Saudi Arabia is an ally in the middle east because we both hate Iran and that's important\nAnd you have to be mature enough politically to understand that and not by for one nanosecond\nThis idiot prints and his propaganda campaign things aren't true that cost you millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars to convince people\nOf\nBut they spend millions and millions and millions of dollars big propaganda we let women drive now oh wow\nThey may still have to ask permission of their husbands or fathers are brothers whether or not they get the license of young we let women drive now not great\nYeah we're going to be head of twenty four year old a gal 'cause see what was she violent no she said things about the government by the way again just to go back to a scene from earlier which not one single feminist in this country I can hear talking about this\n\nFeminist what is that just to keep dropping and grousing about what you don't have the United states of America the freest country for women in the history of the world\nAnd you know hang on hang [laughter] no skill\nTo sweating doesn't get paid as much as Tom Cruise missiles to care God Forbid a feminist stand up for one sister in the middle East that never happens\nBut\nIt is true that we are allies with Saudi Arabia in terms of Iran and that's important it is the way that it should be is the best policy for this country but we were we fought Hitler with the Soviet Union\nAnd we never believed the Soviet Union was like America ... politics makes strange bedfellows that's the way that it is but this idea that this young prince is liberal icing the kingdom that's BS\nThat's BS and I'm not a Wall Street guy but I must tell you what I Know right now if you put one penny in there you're an idiot\nYou're an idiot if you invest money in Saudi Arabia because you believe they're opening up they're not opening up\nThat royal family is it is costing horrible every bit as bad as Iran except that they're not a threat to us and the world of geopolitics that's about as good as you can get some times and that's what we're dealing with all I'm asking a view is that you have open eyes yes\nYes and my question for you as if that's the case why is it that Germany Britain and France have all agreed 'em to basically sanctions Saudi Arabia because they should know I I I agree I'm debating like they don't\nThey don't have to worry about too much with the military stuff like we do and remember they're not out of the agreement that Obama and Kerry made with Iran we are gotcha we did that on our on our own they're still trying to figure out a way it's not possible but they're still trying to figure out a way to salvage that saying we're not going to be able to do it\nBut we're the ones we're on our own putting the sanctions back on and doing what we're doing\nAnd it's important that this work with Iran and we need Saudi Arabia as an ally on that but you can do that with your eyes open\nThis young prince is a wolf in sheep's clothing\nThere is nothing different about this guy others and the fact that he's smart enough to understand that they will run out of oil somewhere down the line\nAnd if they're going to be able to keep on living the way they're living they have to diversify their economy and that's why he's getting all these businesses will businesses aren't going to come in unless you make them feel as if you're liberal ... and that's all this is to make you feel it's not real\nAnd this is the this is the tough thing\nSay the millennials and old people and everybody this is the tough thing about politics we\nWhen everybody this is the tough thing about politics we we're allies with the Soviet Union to be back Hitler politics makes strange bedfellows there's nothing you can do about that except you can understand what's going on you don't have to buy into BS\nI mean it sounds like a little kid who stole cookies out of the cookie jar\nFor two weeks Saudi Arabia says we know nothing about this and now we hear a report where they're going to admit that he was\nKilled accidentally and she'll be go further and ask well why is he being interrogated for wanting to get paperwork to get married in reality\nIn the future it's more for my idea that I presented here a couple of weeks ago which is after\nNow is the Cold War is over we need a league of democracies [noise]\nWhen it comes to sell you a mattress most retailers are handing you will live a long line of

way the individual mandate would tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution

as gross president of doctors were patient care I'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing out called this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it at our phones will start bringing and we've got regular patient [laughter] failed you'll have a lot of them too right\nWe have a a A R own pan over there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but now you nailed it\nWell I mean so and you have all these ... now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors of you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well all which has happened occasionally in my life and these guys you know I ...\nI mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as more of a friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah and touched plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style\nOr Netflix or Amazon Prime of people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork that headache the hassles of middle man so that now medicines are pity a pill now you can call ticks email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nI so this is now ... implement how many places did you get this finally\nUp and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail in off year explain exactly what the service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and it's a flat membership rate based on age if insurance free for\nUnlimited visits work visits offices it's free tele medicine's so you can call tax email your doctor we have no co pay for anything any procedure we can do it in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies doing ... ultrasounds heart monitors long monitors um and then hope so medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and left her doctor's note that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this grow so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nThat it's working everyone you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between\nThe former correct I mean we want to go down there to try to cut down the path of socialized total government controlled healthcare now at a time where people are able to choose their health care decisions based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump anymore than Republicans while their healthcare chosen Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we in certain politicians into health care with it that the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nNot leaving this was the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more and you get far\nIn theory or care because it never really was about the patient was always about redistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth than American top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nYou present the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven percent so what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr member\nYeah this is a one size fits none model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand how'd you criticize I had a blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents so the big box retailers will say Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality and and lower their prices are just like Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd there are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government mentally All right well that's true how do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know\nFor example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do with themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand and didn't even greater level\nNow health care is local I mean that's the important thing you know health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear is a calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now from ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our\nYou know well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but as it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the health care after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr ... grows the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think that Democrats are actually going to help them and that's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number and you want to be a part
