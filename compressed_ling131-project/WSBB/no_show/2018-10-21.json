of the state of Tennessee and now he's running for the open Senate seat of Bob Corker Corker but thank goodness Marsha Blackburn is now pulled out of fourteen point lead in the latest polls she was

to do something very differently\nBut where do you see the tape that we have tonight as it relates to Claire McCaskill another important red state Democrats Senate race that's going on member you vote

being lazy well that's a half a vote for ...\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he is dispatches secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the second now the allegation has banned up the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi his team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today has been hero some reports claiming that could show these murder was recorded but did they know audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently beauty with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because show was killed by anyone they can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal ... show ... this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalist killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analysts former U.S treasury attached shape to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nOr she along with ... former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon\nYou lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking this has been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nThat yes I Lived there for ... that I needed something like this breaking and the reason I did it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary on ... to Saudi Arabia that made the secretary of state when it did these people in the world\nCertainly in the government had cancelled all the plants defy halfway around the world um I I knew was incredibly theory than not to say\nOh we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if they are required to keep it believed and we're still going to have to because if if the records out there and what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for that looks like they're not going to they're going to claim the senior leadership is not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nHow was your ... there's no until now because uh how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat just didn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that I happen to this report we'll see what happens to the secretary\nAnd pay a need for them and let the readout as it did not only need to to come clean on their front and satisfy President Trump the secretary um pail you know they have an audience and the and the Congress and the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you this massive I feel is a memorandum of understanding it has not been find that a president that bipartisan consensus ... sanction\nUnderstanding it has not been signed that President there's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually the very locally um I'm supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into why I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin says to me that we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening stake here yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the\nPower of their oil of impact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S stand bonds you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how does somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely she'll never really to aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened\nIn a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well I mean aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said way back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing though shocked I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you\nKnow we were they had to be responded to there was not you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah to yeah just\nTo say that the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they like the president on this\nYou know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince had called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we don't know about it look like they have like the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul\nYou spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia and well okay you're going to happen I mean the the women\nI chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving et cetera and being told how to dress\nA being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up if you left if you went out in public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under surreal there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWas modernization and Saturday we saw when then being able to drive we saw the ... what the ... the garment that I had to where it's called the ... or that you were at sort of looks like a high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major us teammates and people\nSeem people dress up differently but it's such a great point and

you ever talk about the a ... a lot of man you got me make made reservations\nOh yeah you should have a have you ever had the pleasure of going down the Appalachian coal ...\nOh abs latch yes I've fished in Appalachia many many times I've never faced with a guide and apple latch\nOn to say well my my great all you\nLoad up me and my brother and we used to go down that alleged ... probably once a year and the and I tell you what it is just like you were saying the drop of cooking all you got your limit and\nAbout an hour and a half an hour but they would you know that clean your fish you ... your ... name on it so at dinnertime ... your fish for in a way you are oh boy that that it was awful\nBut I might check out the cage invest the laws that song called like when I'm Out here work but uh that's all about\nA good deal glad you called good luck to you let me know if you ever make it down there\nOh yeah absolutely\nYou bet I love love for you to go I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself now Rick is calling from uh Rick is calling from Roswell go more\nThan ... let's say let me too and this thing in their yard list talked to recall it from Roswell good morning Rick\nHi Hi Neal how are you\nFrom Roswell good morning Rick Hi Neal how are you good um so I have four quick things I wanted to talk with you about okay\nFirst of all I ordered the double pack of fire raid and got the cap\nGood that you're right that cap is really nice cap and last year for a long time yeah it looks\nNice to it it it fits me while I I like it a lot but the question I have is a there's the fiery have a shelf life to it\nA minimum is five years okay and we had last longer than that but the ... they allow it for five years\nOkay now the other the other three things although I'm not a hunter I listen to your program on a regular basis and I'm not a hundred but I'm a calculus in physics a tutor for high school students okay and what I wanted to mention to us are you aware that and calculus we do a um\nA fishing problem and in physics we do a hunting problem among the items that we do\nI did not I love this I'd love to to be able to see the substance of those problems\nSo I'll give you the scenario for the calculus problem okay so you're sitting in a boat\nOr you've looked at fish\nAnd uh you know how high above the water the tip of your fishing rod is ... and you know how fast you're really in the fish\nUm we can figure out using differential calculus in some ... or the staggering in the er um we can figure out how fast the angle is changing between your line and the water and we can also figure out how fast that fish is coming toward the\nBoat I ah using calculus and either I'm ... I'm a tree ... or the and the ...\nOr ... river ... [laughter] I Can't even see it and I tutor battery unfair um is so that you have an aerial sit out\nThe some of the squares of the two opposite side equals the summer the square\nOf the right angle yeah or somebody like that does\nSo it it applies to a rice triangle and it's\nA it's a as you said that some of the squares of the two legs has the equal the square of the high pot and right\nThere you are and so hey listen Rick it's been a long long time\n[laughter] so so anyway you got to write try and go with the tip of your ... a fishing rod coming down to the water and then going out to the fish and then your line foreign ... news and you can do all kinds of a mathematical calculations based on that right triangle\nUm so that's the scenario with calculus for physics it's a hunting scenario suppose that your target is like\nOh I don't know three hundred yards away although Isaac's we used to the metric we'd say three hundred meters away right and I'm supposed to ensure your firing your weapon on a in a level level with the ground\nAnd um suppose that um\nHow how do you have to aim above your target if you know your muscle velocity of the arrived\nMe twenty four hour drive et cetera green forty five and the great barrier to help us being twenty four hours traveling in a red alert bill\nIn effect in Clayton County I Do any five westbound being her we before I

Clayton County ... before I Seventy five extra fifty eight ... block traffic being diverted off onto Jonesboro road exit fifty five\nI'm Mike shields W out to be\nThe barrel and the the the ground in front of you is perfectly flat when that bullet exits the barrel if you dropped to boom it from that position it exactly the same time both bonus will hit the ground at the same time\nYou've had some physics how 'bout that\nYou've had some physics training because that's one of the things that they teach you in physics is that exactly what you said\nWell I'm impressed with myself\nYeah I'm impressed with you too that I Am not a lot of people know that\n[laughter] yeah velocity does it change gravity\nRight gravity that that that the two are forced vectors if you will\nAre independent of each other you've got to the vector of\nOf its horizontal velocity and you have the vector of as a vertical velocity which initially is zero coming out of the barrel but then gravity starts acting on it as soon as it exits the barrel ... and it starts coming down and gravity doesn't care whether the bullets moving or not if you know it's going to act on the bullet\nOr regardless and so is just as you said\n...\n... here's the question I got though around\nWrote here's the question I got though around\nThat physics question is I was ...\nWanted to ask you a question do you happen to know what the muzzle velocity of your muscle loader is\nNot offhand because it would change according to the powder that ... a barrel\nYeah yeah that makes sense\nBecause you can use anywhere from ... grains to a hundred and fifty grains whether it's a maximum a muzzle older they can handle a maximum load\nSo you have the ability to change how much powder is uh is is behind the bullet\nYes in a Muslim over you do yes and why do you think are going to have much to get in pardon me say again Rick I'm Sorry\nHow do you just how do you make the decision as to how much a powder to put in it\nWell it's the size of the animal\nThe anticipated distance to the shot or and what you're used to and all that is solved on the range\nAnd you do this on the fly is your as your hunting\nNo you do that prior okay no one once you're\nIn the woods once you are loaded once you are in this than whether it's ... or hogs are dear muti or a or whatever there is no mystery there is no decision to be made\nSo let me ask this question is and on\nSo let's let's say you're in the stands or have you already decided when you're in the stand what you're going after or do you have like a fifty different\nBullets all the different grains so that she knows the bullet you need based on what you're saying no\nI I experienced dictates those choices prior to getting him to stay in and getting inside the hunt\nOK\nBecause and of course in each case if you're using a combination of a hundred and fifty grains of powder\nAnd I was three hundred and forty eight grain bullet you know because you visited the range you know the range that that will it's going to carry and what the drop is going to be wow no that already\nSo you're telling me ... you don't need ...\nOur Karen is plugged in every day seven pm until nine

dehumanizing content comments hasn't yet gone into effect that's so stupid just take the stupid video down the Facebook took it down\nAnd I I Can't even believe it has to be like the big thing which is our heck seemed Brett Kavanaugh's today did you guys know this apparently that is a thing up which is in Brooklyn are inviting practitioners to place a tax on Brett Kavanaugh entity patriarchy cats\nLand and it's sad [noise]\nAn establishment that does not have cast there's not actual Catholic [noise]\nBrooklyn premier a cult bookshop and spiritual community's faith than us [laughter] sounds like a as a visitor port land DEA issued an invitation on Facebook that says please join us for Republican tax on Kavanaugh and rapists and the patriarchy which apparently are all the same thing a blah blah blah witchcraft [noise]\nIsn't like the whole rule like what you put out you'll get back to the old isn't that kind of how it works yeah there's some sort of metrics or but it's not good for the people sending up yeah that's like bad on you write\nBlue McGovern us all a Lena Dunham website isn't up anymore I didn't even know if there was the thing with it nobody Carol safer now and nobody\nWe've got to look up as they didn't care [noise] judicial watch filed a complaint against Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer for violating the rules of professional responsibility\nJudicial watch they're taking legal action they filed a complaint with the board of professional responsibility\nA ... of D.C court on attorneys Deborah cats Lisa Banks and Michael Brown which they said they violated the rules of professional responsibility and their representation of Dr Ford\nBy not informing a doctor for that Senator Grassley offered to quote fly female staff investigators to meet Dr Ford in California or anywhere else to obtain her testimony in quotes and might not sharing it with her they say her attorneys violated those rules coming up Louie Gohmert joins us\nTo discuss the migrant caravan working its way up to the U.S border stay with us [laughter]\nYou ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and surprise your hit with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty you're paying out of your own pocket to fix that\nThis is why I recommend extended vehicle protection from car shield if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand miles car shield can save you from paying for high repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousands when you're protected by car shield you can have your favorite mechanic or the dealership fix your car it's your choice\nThen candidate Donald Trump two years ago about this uh and then the fact that actually\nWoodrow Wilson one of my least favorite presidents he actually did one thing and right after\nSome punch Ovie is Danny Kaye more cross into the United states and killed a bunch of families are age that general pushing down or they get they put military and this new thing go National Guard a and I asked the the\n... a political nonpartisan congrats\nAsk to be a political nonpartisan congressional Research Service for report on that and they said we can't say for sure but in essence a probably Seventy five thousand back\nUS military National Guard were put on our border I could have been as many as a hundred and fifty thousand and then pushing led some actually into Mexico chasing the bad guys but you know what when he put the military on the border nobody\nNobody Jamie and we did not want to come in and uh you know they this president knows that\nAnd he's willing to do what's necessary\nTo not only protect America but it protects others who might be tempted to take a caravan and\nLose their lives are being raped or be subjected to sex trafficking human trafficking uh it's it's the best thing we can do for both sides of the border it really is and thank goodness Trump is going to do that\nYeah I definitely and I mean I wouldn't I think they're going to have the same problem even if they may get say they do end up making it all the way to Mexico because from what I understand Mexico told them well if you're I mean you can't just enter legally you can apply for asylum well then they're going to have the same problem that we would have\nAnd I would think that they would want that word before these people got their border\nWell and and actually Mexico in the past ah with Obama a they would let people like that can prove\nKnowing that when they ... they say you jump through Mexico as long as you don't stop here so in other words they just wouldn't enforce Mexican law and okay you can pass through just you know make sure you go into the\nInto the United states but they knew the law that if they come into the United states from Central America come through Mexico and then get into the United states you do that they don't have and it's a legitimate asylum claim because your right hand there are going\nTo states from Honduras or El Salvador or ... or Guatemala and say\nI Need to claim asylum because our country\nWas jak right out legitimate just subject to the poverty because that's in every country [noise] but uh to say I was being tortured or ... well if that's true and you made it a silo for your Central American country\nThen you should have claimed that women in the next\nCountry who came to her [noise] so right you got to the United states you already gone through ... so you could attack claimed just dial up there\nSo he legitimately cannot claim asylum in the United states 'cause you could have stayed in Mexico without being persecuted [noise] so I was\nYounger when I tell ya I just thought to this point I just saw a video that is just on that as being like little video clips that are being released by that and there was a stand off and on the Guatemalan side right at the Mexican gay and apparently\nThe caravan is on video breaking through all of the security forces that Guatemala had while right there in front of that a bridge and they broke through the fence and they got into Mexico\nI'm not saying that I'm not saying that well it's they're claiming asylum they need to stop right there Mexico and claim it ends and\nThen let's see what a Mexico does for them uh but if they weigh them on\nThe President Trump and he is serious about cutting all financial aid and that if we have to close the southern border that that would drive Mexico crazy but we got to start asserting\nOur sovereignty and the United states before our enemies uh take advantage of what Obama did just overwhelm us we can't keep doing that\nYeah yeah and I'm I'm looking at the video starting to make its way around on social media as well 'cause the previous video I saw was deaf people sort of being deterred from doing some of the security for our but now they put a nurse and they're all like\nYet for all that I hear of I'm I'm a ... it it being all women and children 'cause that's what you hear from a lot of advocates for amnesty they sell it only women and children while I'm I'm In all the pictures that I've seen there are a lot of men there\nYep yep and and uh that's also true that when we were being\nTold it's just women and children well it turns out to there were more men as they were ... this was claiming ... out of this you know omit yeah women and children fleeting well ... and and they were sold her age and we had no business of bringing them clear to the United states\nWhen with regard to refugees from the middle east or as President Trump or\nWe could we could help twelve refugees if we go after them\nWe could we could help ... refugees if we left over

again my life is more dot com artist I pitched the website enough use it as a resource friends\nBut let's talk about the market now last week the whole show was devoted to what was going on in the market because last week\nI said last week a week ago show because that week leading up to that show a last Sunday had been a rough right if you remember we had six days in a row that the market drop and and things were looking intense and a lot of questions were being thrown out is this the end of the longest bull market in history or are we headed towards a cliff\nThat were you know who knows what's going to have people were feeling a lot of anxiety\nYou couple that with hurricane that Michael coming through and there was a lot going on around a lot of folks are reading a lot of worry and so we talked the whole show about that and if you missed that again use that website in my life is more dot com go listen to last\nWeek's show 'cause the whole show is about how do you manage when the market starts to drop what does it look like how do you make sure you're invested right so let me ask you one follow up question to that did you go back and check your portfolio and if you've never heard the show before you didn't hear that that that's the number one action because last week\nWasn't way better now we didn't see the drops that we saw the week before but we still end of the week lower than we started and that's been the case now for weeks in a row we've seen the market dropping\nAnd like I regularly say on the show the market is not good or bad\nIt's just up or down the market being down is not necessarily bad for you in fact it could be great for you depending on the way you invest depending on the way you respond\nOkay so the marketing ... down as I'm not a bad thing\nBut for weeks in a row it's been down so have you pause in the midst of all this and checked your portfolio that's the number one follow up\nHow is your portfolio responding 'cause we've had so many years of incredible growth and last year was just stupid the growth right every single day\nWas a new record broken and that makes us complacent it makes us feel like we must be investment experts we must be\nGeniuses that our portfolios keep going up up up I've had so many clients come in and tell me well you know I don't really need help with investing I got that covered I mean I've got four or five years of great returns were of course you have four or five years of great returns everyone does\nBecause it's been up don't let the market being up trick you into thinking that you have this all figured out use the market dropping as a template for am I in a healthy place with my portfolio now's the time to check it it's okay if it's dropping a loss it just tells you how aggressive you are\nAnd some people listening right now can't afford to be and should be very aggressive\nBecause you've got decades until retirement so go for it be super aggressive because if you stick with that you're going to win but other people listening a lot of folks listening you're more aggressive than you realize and your plan can't handle that\nYour plan could not handle a twenty five percent drop right now I've told this story a dozen times but I had a client he was not my client back\nIn two thousand Seventy thousand eight but he is now and back then he was told he could retire and two thousand seven because he had what seemed like plenty of money and he was aggressive with it 'cause he was naturally an aggressive person and the two thousand that he lost forty percent ouch\nAnd he had to come back and start working again he had the money to retire but he was more aggressive than his plan can handle please if you hear nothing else today do not let yourself be in a position where your plan\nOr you're too aggressive for your plant because of that so fixable right you can't control the market you shirt can control how aggressive you are\nWho let's be honest let's just pause for a moment who bought a mega millions tickets last week\nOkay mega millions jackpot so I never I'll be straight with you never in my life have I played the lottery ever I did get a ticket because it was it was just fun can I say that am I allowed to say it's fun I grew up being taught the lottery was\nYou know like Satan friend like it was the worst thing ever was a lottery my parents were glad\nTo have me have the HOPE Scholarship in Georgia if I wanted to do that a which was funded by the lottery but but the lottery was terrible um but I just never had an interest in look up a financial planner admit it's it's a little bland right like I I Know the numbers behind it and you're not going to win didn't win\nFraud and let me guess you didn't win either okay if you did give me a call now just getting okay uh but but you didn't okay because the odds of one\nWell no just getting okay uh but but you didn't okay because the odds of winning are one in three hundred and three million\nWhich he let that sink in for a minute\nI Love this there's always comparisons I was reading all these stories about the lottery you have a better chance of getting eaten by a shark you'd better chance of getting killed by a swarm of bees which is one of the pause and go why are all comparisons like linked to terrible deaths like you'll get a chance\nBeing struck by lightning and dying in flames than you do winning the lottery okay can we make comparisons not tied to a grisly terrible death but anyway\nIt's you're not gonna win right that's the goal if you did happen to win though I Love this CNN put this out you'd be worse to Taylor Swift well there you have it if you suddenly be worth\nTo tell her Swiss for having done nothing but spent two dollars on your lottery ticket so I did about the ticket because it was fun it was fun or whole office bought one um and none of us one of course but but what does the lottery teach us\nAbout ourselves and before you turn off the radio thinking this is the lemons concept you've ever heard in your life actually kind of interesting okay let me tell you why so there is a guy that works at the angles near my house there's an angles near my house\nAnd I've become friends with this guy will call Andrew Andrew plays the lottery every single night that he can I mean I Know the only the lottery drawings a few nights a week but he every possible drawing he can do he does\nEvery single time and we developed this whole dialog he knows I'm a financial planner so we just laugh about this and we talked about it every time I met him\nBecause he truly believes that eventually if he keeps added hard enough he's going to win All right and here's the key he's looking for a way out\nHe's looking for a while he works two jobs he's a very hard working man but he just sees this as this one day this will be me\nAnd he keeps going and you can tell you the stories I mean immediately tells you the stories of\nWell this time I had I had this many numbers and I was only off by like you know these tiny little bit I almost won this much money\nIt's so close in his mind now before you say that's not me I don't do that I Would never do that pause for a minute because I have a lot of clients come in and they don't do this usually they're not playing the lottery every chance they can get a dog on their fall in the same philosophy the looking for a way out\nWhere do I see this maybe pause and before you become too critical of Andrew look at this in yourself for a second you see any of this I'll tell you where I see I see it and people for instance who are late with they're investing maybe you're in your fifties right now\nMaybe you haven't invested like you want it to you didn't ... I mean you just made different decisions are life happened or whatever it was you haven't said much money and now here you sit ten years from retirement whatever and you go I've got to catch up what am I going to do in the panic starts to set in and you're looking for a way out so what do you do\nYou become super aggressive this is on believable common\nA significant amount of people that walk into our office sit down with us are literally living this out right now where they go I\nI feel like I have to be aggressive now the flip side of that is you have just as much of a chance of ruining any possibility of retirement because the market drops in fact if we're sitting on the longest bull market in history\nIs now the best time and again we're not gonna get that well now I'm falling in the market timing shame on me well let's just put a practical perspective this isn't going to go forever so do you really think that you can sit right now is a great time there is no great time to do this but now is the time that you're going to become super aggressive in the market and hope\nThat we have what we just had we just had ten years of the market blowing up right and you should never\nFall this philosophy but if you have followed this philosophy starting in two thousand nine you would have made a lot of money if you were super aggressive right\nThat's dangerous because what people do is they look at that and go holy cow if that just if I could just have that happen again now that I can look back and see ten years of this happening if I could just happen again then I Would be okay if we just had three hundred and thirty percent growth one more decade if it works like that again\nThat maybe I could catch up\nBut then we don't there's zero guarantee of that there is just as much of a chance that you ruin your ability to retire if you fall that methodology but you're looking for a way out you become kind of desperate so doggone I don't care what the odds are I don't care what the risk is I'm going to do it is now to Andrew\nDoggone if I keep on playing maybe this will work\nIs anybody else doing that\nYou picking the hottest new stock constantly I met with a client recently they told me I'm doing really well in my investments and looked at their statement they were unbelievably aggressive okay they're taking out loans against their investments something called trading on margin okay you're taking loans against you're investing on their personal account\nAnd reinvest it into super risky stock\nAnd reinvest it into super risky stock and guess what happens if that stock drops and you have loans against it you are now required immediately to pay a certain percentage of that because you've got to have a certain buffer zone\nAnd he's saying how excited he is about this and I'm looking at the market and going you're in a terrible risk well guess what most of the stuff you'd been betting against was tech stocks how have tech stocks been doing the last few weeks they have tanked\nTanked but he's looking for a way out he's hoping it works problem is when it doesn't work like the last four weeks when tech stocks have been the most to it than suddenly he has to bring to the table cash to cover all these loans he's taken in his hopes of finding a way out have you done this before\nA lot of people do this a lot of us do this and here's the hard truth there is no easy fix it's the one and three hundred and three million possibility but we have something in our brains and go but maybe that would be me\nThe person that finds out they had an Harrington so they didn't realize right the person that wins the lottery the person that the ... was was best friends with uh the Google founders and decided to invest early that exists but it does exist on such a small scale that's not\nGoing to be your story if it is your story it should just be icing on the cake because you already have a plan that works without that nonsense\nSure we would all love to be the first person to invest in Google pride to be friends with Steve Jobs brought his he was starting out or ... that would be great\nBut for most of us never going to happen and if it was going to happen it should be again ... ... just some crazy amazing thing that's on top of all the wonderful stuff\nYou've already done to make a plan that works for guard was if your plan only works by some random trick of fate that isn't good enough for you you're worth more than that your dreams are worth more than that they're worth planning and this was coming from someone me who tends to be pretty ADD\nOkay I get that it's hard to sit down sometimes and the thought for some of you listening is to sit down and make a plan sounds terrible first of all I promise it's not a promise it's more exciting than you think but secondly I Can't even begin to tell you the piece you can have\nWhen you trade dreams that are unrealistic like well maybe I'll win the lottery\nWas an actual plan that's built to work even if things go against you even if your health isn't what you hoped it is even if the market doesn't grow like you think it should even if inflation is worse than we think right taxes all these things that could happen what is your plan was built to whether those things and still work what would that be like\nThat is what I Do with people every day\nHow do you create a plan is flexible and can change\nDon't please don't whether it's something extreme like the lottery or the more subtle sneaking but just as dangerous philosophies of\nBeing hyper aggressive going after the latest thing hoping for that thing that will suddenly in a flash of an eye change everything that's not how it works but you can't have peace\nYou can have a plan that will work\nIf you sit down and you're intentional if you want that jump on my website it's my life is more dot com that's what I Do every day with clients that's\nWhat our team does every day I Can't tell you the difference it makes to sit down with people to go through a process and to see them walk out feeling truly feeling piece\nThat's what that's what gets us out of bed in the morning it's what's exciting to see if you want that again sign up for a free consultation on that website it's my life is more dot com or in a little bit or nothing you can do on that website is ask any question you have and we're going to answer those questions and a little bit and our lightning round\nBefore that we're going to dig into open enrollment which again I Know some of you hear that and you go that sounds about as much fun as watching paint dry talking about open enrollment your least\nForever until I Do have a health issue down the line and not only that it gets compound interest so if I Do get cancer in ten years I now have this big pile of tax free medical money waiting for me that's awesome that is the bedrock again\nOf solid planning is flexibility so that's why mathematically that age essay plan almost always the best fit\nNow let me tell you why don't do one is it a little ridiculous but it's true I Want to be honest with you all you need to know what's actually going on here I don't do on because it became a pain we have three kids we have major\nRegularly medical things right not major things regularly have reasons with three kids to go to the doctor we have lots of doctors visits and it became a real plant pain with insurance I'll be honest\nMy wife and I would sit and try to figure out the bills we wouldn't be a ... we were charged all sorts of different things from different doctors depending on the doctor he went to we had to pay more out of pocket and even though I Know mathematically it would work out better to do the H essay and if I was just a single guy I probably wouldn't do that or just it was just me and my wife\nBut with three kids we my wife and I had an honest discussion and said you know what it's actually worth it just not to have the headache it's one more massive administrative headache and so if you go holy cow you're a financial planner it should be all about the money well it's not always all about the money\nLike it would have saved us some money and I love the flexibility\nLike it would have said there's some money and I love the flexibility of the I just said but it was the ministry of leaves driving us crazy\nSo that's why we chose to do a a regular traditional plant instead of a high deductible plan so you need to know yourself here when it comes to health plans you need to know am I the kind of person that is totally administratively on I'm a detailed person I'm On every single every piece of mail that comes in has a cat or have a folder for whatever that is\nThen you're probably a great fit for a high deductible plan or if you're just a single person who is never going to the doctor take that cheaper plan take the extra money put it in the just say you're storing it up for a bad time it's a great idea but if you know yourself\nAnd you know that you get overwhelmed if you get six different bills from the doctor and the insurance and you're trying to figure out what's going on and I honestly sometimes that to me\nThat maybe it's not a good fit for him even though you'd save some money if you get so stressed out that it ruins your here but you save some money that might not be a good trade off and that's the way financial decisions are sometimes sometimes the cheapest or best value quote unquote isn't always the best fit for your personality you have to know yourself\nBut if you're someone that wants to save some money and you you in and you're in a place where you can do that\nAnd that ... that could be a great fit for you okay that's a great option let's talk about a few other types of things on your opening roaming the other thing would be life insurance a lot of companies offer life insurance through work and whether that's a good thing for you to take her and I almost everybody usually through work\nThey give you a set amount of insurance right you get X amount of basic life insurance but you usually have the option of buying additional insurance\nAnd a lot of people just jump in and take all the additional they can that that's not necessarily a terrible thing but I'll tell you this when it comes to life insurance it depends on your health okay because the basic insurance they give you is fine but the older you get that group extra insurance you can buy actually\nSometimes more expensive than private insurance\nWhich is crazy but here's the reason because they don't know your health so if you're twenty and usually these are age banded which means that they they'd they'd price them based on your age so if you're twenty five it's super cheap to get life insurance or your company like extra life insurance but if you're sixty five the price per thousand dollars of insurance has gone up and up and up\nAnd they don't know your health so they're just basing it on the general health of sixty five year olds which means you might have paying a lot more for insurance then if you went up the street to a private insurance company\nAnd bought private life insurance and what is private life insurance give you portability at the problem with buying insurance through your company is if you get fired or you leave your company you lose the insurance but friends I Can't tell you how many people want to ask them do you have a life insurance that you\nHave to my company yeah but here's the problem you might go to another company who doesn't offer life insurance\nOr you might have a health issue pop up you leave your company and you go you know and you'll get private insurance but now you're not healthy enough to get it so again the core issue here is flexibility group life insurance is not that flexible so take the basic insurance but if you're pretty healthy person go out and get private life insurance so that when you leave your company\nYour insurance doesn't stop and then you have a health issue can anticipate you still have the insurance already now\nDoes that make sense to do with the flexibility option now the flip side of this is if you're in really bad health and if you went to a private insurance company for underwriting and you know they might say no because of major health issues you have\nNow that's a time when group insurance is awesome because now they're not going to ask\nYou this underwriting questions you don't have to go through\nMedical records and the you know physical and all this kinda stuff like you have to on the private side so it's somewhat based on your situation\nIf you're healthy enough private insurance is often a much better pick it's cheaper often and it is portable a and you can get a higher amount usually a again for for for a reasonable price it's it's a good thing but if you're not in great health right now\nWithin the group can be great and then this is a good example of what we talk about all the time which is that there is no black or white here it really depends on your situation\nBut don't just take the extra insurance and go I guess I'm OK because that is limiting stuff\nWhen you know the the you leave the company you lose the insurance from a life insurance side that's not good ideally so if you're healthy enough to get private insurance often that's a better option one other thing here because I Know your eyes are blazing over but this is important you'll remember this when you get your papers okay one of the thing is\nI usually don't take things or recommend my clients take things like the accidental death and dismembered meant policies and my brother was in a it's eighty Indy right my brother was in a at a bad car accident he's fine so I can talk about this

B.\nIs because they know the ...\nIn his because they know the odds of that happening are so low it's kind of goes to the lottery conversation we had\nEarlier okay\nSo it's just probably not going to happen far better to take every dollar you have\nAnd instead of putting it into random things like a cancer policy or an eighty and the policy that your work brings up put them into that private life insurance policy and buy a higher amount and know that it's going to go with you that's way more flexible its way better coverage so the key is when you look at all of your benefit of options\nThat you go what is the most flexible option and is it best to do this to the company where it's going to be tied to my company or is this something that I can take with me and supported oil place where that is not the case usually is disability insurance\nBecause private disability insurance can be super expensive so usually ... long term disability better to get through your company and if you go this is super confusing well it is insurance world is super confusing but it's important okay so you want to get your long term disability through your company you want to get your life insurance ideally privately\nAnd when it comes to health insurance\nThe best thing is to go no yourself you could probably save some money and have some great flexibility if you go with that high deductible plan but\nIf you're overwhelmed by details you might want to go with the traditional plant and by the way if you hear all this and you go holy cow how do I do this that's what we exist for that is the reason that I started the financial planning company because we want to do plan and you want to help people figure out this stuff and feel confident so jump on the phone if you're going through open enrollment\nGo on our website it's my life is more dot com we can do a phone call with you we can do a Skype and talk about this with you and give you some ideas and if you want a total planning process\nTo say all of this lines up the way I invest the risk like take the insurance benefits that I have that at all lines up to take me towards the dreams I have for the future towards the retirement I desire that\nNow you're speaking my language that's what I get excited about you can sign up for that free consultation with me Chris Burns or a member of my team at my life is more dot com All right we're going to transition into our lightning round and this is the time in the show where I answer the questions you've sent in throughout the week so if you've been listening and you go I\nHad a very important question about my disability insurance with work 'cause we just talked about that will jump on the website it's my life is more dot com you can ask anything we get back to directly\nAgain my life is more dot com so joining me on our lightning round the day is uh the head of our advisory team cliff hit cliff how're you doing very well I wanted to bring clipping because he's a genius I always tell people and they laugh about it as they come in and say I want to meet with Chris and I say I'm willing to meet with you\nBut you'd probably be better off meeting someone from my team 'cause we only hire people that are better than me that is the goal everyone that we hires better so cliff ... is a stellar example of that how are you today sir I'm doing very well say half it we're going to test your brain he is not seen these questions or at least very briefly before we even did this or we're going to start reading off questions\nAnd I love you to get your thoughts on them and then I'll jump in if I have any any very important thing behind to hear\nA feeling good yes all\nRight let's do it first question is from Carl Carl writes my\nHouse closes on October thirtieth congratulations Carl I have about two hundred thousand dollars in equity from the home I'm about three years from retirement with a little over a million and an IRA and four O. one K.

details W S P radio dot com\nIn thirty days given me some ...\nThe fall and winter coming on I'm excited about being able to where she use other than flip flops [laughter]\nWell I've had these on than eight o'clock this morning\nAny discomfort in my food at all so\nI'm excited to you know go all day\nBe wearing normal she's [laughter]\nI could not go barefoot it at all and with shoes on I Would be careful not to put too much weight\nBecause it would be uncomfortable so\nI kinda got used to walk and without putting weight on their butt trying not to limp so that it looked unusual when I walked well I also\nThe ivy a stem cell treatments\nUh I feel like I have a little more energy than I had\nIn the last month I've lost three pounds which means I'm moving around more my diet hasn't changed I I've been on a good organic died anyway but I feel like I'm moving around more because my toes not hurting me\nI also had some internal damage from cancer treatment from four years ago\nI I feel like that I'm getting some healing\nInternally also because some things are changing for made for the better and I'm\nI'm excited about that also I have had reduced energy for about the past four years because of the side effects of the um [noise] cancer treatment or I'm cancer free now\nDid take a toll on my body and\nUm [noise]\nUm [noise] I've been feeling better and better all the time said fan\nBut I wanted to start exercising more er which I haven't been able to do and recently I have to have to start walking\nOutside where before I just couldn't do that\nI couldn't go shopping because I couldn't stand being on my foot and walking around\nJust a for something that all women love to do which is to go shopping\nI'm I'm looking forward to start\nWalking uh to get in better shape you know I'm doing everything I can\nI'm eating and Nick\nNick ... nutritional wise but uh I Do need to exercise\nWhere you skeptical about getting your treatment and why\nOr why I'm\nIt just sounded too good to be true and but my husband um who is very good at doing research has been researching death I've probably for about\nHe had read he felt confident that there were no side effects that it was something that I should try as um [noise] I'm\nTrying to do more natural approach to my body and take care of my cell and\nI did not look forward to any type of surgery\nOr any other cases treatment\nHe was confident that that's what hale\nTo you and you look at my tries and said I'm sure we can help is ours I okay no side effects let's try Beth\nWith the results so far\nDoctorate so miss boy came into you her husband had heard you hear on the radio had been doing research prior to perhaps hearing you on the radio and thought this would be a solution for his wife because it sounds as if\nShe was doing all kinds of things to compensate for her pain other than getting the treatment\nRight she was she was miserable she um she'd seen a orthopedic surgeons and different doctors about her her problem her pain\nAnd um you know she was getting any relief from the treatments that she was getting in so uh fortunately her husband did hear some of the radio and came to infer consultation and we were able to to um go ahead and treat her and\nYou know already within a month or pain is almost gone and now she's wearing shoes again which is a miracle for her because\nNobody wants to wear a flip flops when it's cold outside when it's thirty degrees or [laughter] anything like that\nSo she came in and her other physicians had said that there was bone on bones so there was you know she truly had a proud arthritis yeah they're really added writers and then how is it is you able to treat her what did you do again\nAnd we did a a localized injection of some stem cells in in ... in the tow area there that she was having the problem so um when when we do in ... the stumps also so much on the climate tore property to them that people sometimes feel relief within hours or days of the treatment\nUm but the healing process actually takes three to nine months so she's on her way she's you know a month or or more out now um silver bodies slowly healing not to issue but I'm In the meantime she's being free which is fantastic so\nThat is great doctor ripped off and there are new listeners to your program who may not be familiar with you or familiar with the stem cell therapy treatment that you provide your patients why don't you reset Forrest how you found this interest in doing this kind of work as opposed to what you were doing before and how the stem cell therapy weren't\nSure sure well for the past Twenty years I've been I'm interested in anti aging in stem cells and um you know I've researched every type of a stem cells that were out on the market in what was available for for patients and what we could do in our country\nAnd um you know unfortunately for the last Twenty years we didn't have really good treatments available we\nI'm the only stem cells that we were able to use were from our own bodies and there's three problems with that as the the number one problem is it's a painful procedure you have to have a either a bone marrow biopsy or bone marrow treatment from the hip bone to get the bone marrow stem cells\nOr ... or the other source in our own bodies is fat so you'd have to have like a liposuction or surgery procedure to get the ... the fat cells um the other problem is that there's very few cells that were able to obtain with these benefits maybe five or ten thousand\nAnd that sounds like a big number but our bodies have billions of cells in them so um it's really very few so that that we're able to treat people with and then finally I'm In the most important thing is that the older we get the stem cells in our body are very active they're not very effective they don't feel like they did when we were like little boys\nVery active they're not very effective they don't feel like they did when we were like little boys and girls so I'm all those factors made me these treatments not desirable that they were maybe one two three five people would get benefit\nUm and you know I'm I as a physician is exciting that that people were getting some benefit by the other hand there's all these people that weren't so um what we with the advent of the umbilical cords themselves that we use or the war and jellies themselves\nUm it's really change things dramatically um instead of having thousands of cells to deal with we have millions now let me do a treatment and um the cells because they're from day one right when babies are born there super active and all they want to do is find areas of inflammation and damage and start feeling\nAnd so whether that's a toe whether that's a wrist whether that's a hand whether that's a shoulder any back you name it the cells are attracted to these areas a damaging information and get started feeling\nAnd so it's a it's really been a miraculous a wonderful treatment I've never seen anything like it where people can be basically crippled and in a matter of months they they get their life back they're able to do things that they haven't been able to do because of their pain\nBack to ... what are some of the most common misperceptions about stem cell therapy [noise]\nUm well there's several uh lose some times when people think about stem cell therapy they think Twenty years ago there was quite a bit of controversy about them because I'm researchers and and some hospitals were were messing with um embryonic stem cells which came from a boarded babies and so there's a whole\nUm ethical issue with that right from the off it's off the top of the half the fruit from the from the get go\nAnd I'm so I'm back in two thousand for George W. Bush when he was president he passed a law banning the for those themselves in our country so\nUm then they're not used we've never use them in my clinics and never have and never will but I'm a lot of people when they hear stem cells that's what they kind of think about it I think about oh you're dealing with these aboard the babies and we're not [laughter]\nThat's the last thing that we do you know we we we work with healthy moms and healthy babies and um the moms donate their umbilical cords after the healthy bombing and baby babies born\nAnd then they tested for all kinds of diseases and problems but ah what's ... what's really amazing about the war in this jelly is because it's not a blood product\nThere's no risk of disease or an allergy that you can get from these cells so it's um is truly the best source I've ever seen or heard of for stem cells in the world and I were very fortunate to be able to offer that at our clinic\nOr clinics and um and along with the other protocols that I've developed over the last few years we've been able to have amazing success with our patients\nNow how do you acquire the stem cells that are for cure it from the ...\nUm well we work with a lab or in ... gets the cells or they they have a padded process and that it cost a fifty million dollars to develop this technology so they invested a lot of money but it's um it's was money well spent because we're able to get these wonderful stem cells now that I'm\nI started with my hearing and college tuition became offering it was hard for me to tell my friends about my hearing\nPeople in the country\nOne is not teenagers\nFrom Iraq and Afghanistan have that many human and on with your help me to restore\nHope my hearing off a thing of the past we are just some of the many faces of hearing loss hearing held foundation is working to restore hearing\nMore about the research for your visit here and go ... or a public service from ...\nTo be a battle doorbell are carts media group station [noise]\nTwenty four hour news weather and\nVolleyball and am\nMe to [noise]\nNow your morning at seven\nAM I'm Robin ... live in the ws be twenty four hour news center with our top story this hour an urgent search is on for a cop killer detectives on the hunt for an Eighteen year old man who police say shot and killed ... county police officer his name ...

S. B. depend on it\nAsk a direct question without getting a direct answer\nBut anyone who ask questions has learned and sometimes you get an answer and sometimes you don't [noise]\nAnd sometimes an indirect answer is what most appropriate and haven't been times when non and the did more good\nThan a direct answer that's Reverend Joe ever with a challenging messaging titled where were you feed her well as in this\n[noise]\nWelcome today the weekly\n... and things we just from America's historic Protestant share\nSharing and I thought it\nNow here's your host Peter ... to introduce today's speaker\nThanks Sherry we're delighted to welcome back today one today the Reverend Joseph Duffy Evans who just over a year ago became the senior pastor of first Presbyterian Church in Marietta, Georgia\nWere six years before that he was senior pastor of first Presbyterian Church in Columbia, Tennessee [noise] just graduate of Presbyterian College in Clinton South Carolina and oranges master of divinity had full embassy illogical seminary Decatur, Georgia Joe it's great to have you with us yeah I'm so honored to be your\nLast week you introduced us to the church you know surfers Presbyterian Church of Marietta, Georgia and I understand it's been fun watching your own kids running around the\nChurch you grew up in film in but how did you manage the transition of leaving first Presbyterian in Columbia, Tennessee and moving to marry at us first Presbyterian had to be hard\nHad to be turned off in the dorm by ten o'clock at night the only light that can stay on with the ones in the ladies bathroom\nSo she would study they're sitting on those cold tiles\nReading on the night before a test and after graduating she began a fifty year career in nursing\nNow that's perspective the kind of perspective\nThat only my grandmother could have provided and every time I'd be tempted to complain about studying hard at imagine her there on that bathroom floor and she didn't seem so far away nor did my law seems so pitiful\nShe\nMy own flesh and blood had made it through worse\nThe perspective of grandparents so they'll tell you that they walked up hill to school both ways but nothing can help let's see the sufferings of this president age clearly like the experience of those who made it through worse\nAnd if the perspective of a grandparent is beneficial imagine how helpful is the perspective of God where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth the lord ass job\nTell me if you have understanding who determine its measurements surely you know or who stretch the line upon it on what words bases son or who latest cornerstone\nWhen the mornings stars sang together and all of the heavenly being shouted for\nJoy the lord answers Joe this way\nAnd in one sense this stands up of God's poetic non answer makes job and all his problems seem so very small\nThe death of his family the destruction of his home like a blip in a cosmic timeline\nBut this account of creation and the thirty eighth chapter of job\nIs more than that\nFor in this testimony is the account of the guards who laid the foundation of\nEarth determined it's measurements and stretched align upon it it is the story of how God has been in the business of building up\nIt is the story of how God has been in the business of building a beauty out of nothing since the beginning of\nTime the homeless\nMass of that nothingness that existed before creation was the Lord's building blocks\nAnd when there was darkness before they were even lights to turn out\nThe lord laid the cornerstone in the morning stars were born\nTo sing together just as my grandmother helped me to see that I could study I\nCouldn't be successful in college so the lord is helping job just see that you can make a life out of nothing you can rebuild but I Am with you and I have done that and much greater things before\nNow this isn't a direct answer to a job this question of suffering but there is value in God's perspective there was always value in perspective\n\nBack in twenty Thirteen researchers from Boston College analyzed data from a long term study called the longitudinal study of generations\nThe study gathered data from three hundred and Seventy six grandparents and three hundred and forty grand children and concluded\nThat an emotionally close grandparent adult grandchild relationship was associated with fewer symptoms of depression for both generations the greater emotional support grandparents an adult grandchildren received from one another\nTo better their psychological health\nAnd you can already imagine what that is the case that grandchildren benefit from the perspective their grandparents provide because they teach you to appreciate the restrooms that every gas station on the interstate when you travel with them\nBut you also value those restrooms because you hear about your young grandfather who as a boy drive to relieve himself out of an old model a while it was still moving the story goes that the windows were down back\nWhere his sisters were sitting and unfortunately the wind was blowing the wrong way and you hear this story and you remember one who has made it through hard times all ready\nTo pass through the rough waters of the great depression\nWorld War two unemployment and still maintain his sense of\nHumor\nHis perspective alone gives me strength to overcome obstacles that live before me he is one who has gone before\nBut my grandfather's perspective is dwarfed by that of my God I think of the stormy sees of life\nAnd then consider the lord who shot in the sea with doors when a burst out from the ... the lord and gives an account from the memory of one who is in finance and remembers the sea when she was a little baby\nI made the clouds it's garment and thick dark miss it's wobbling band and prescribed balance for it and set bars indoors and said the U.S for show you calm and not farther and here shout you're proud waves ... stop ...\nCan you hear the lord and say the same was like chaos but I grab that great chaos up and change the diaper\nSo even now the chaos that your face the victimization the sadness the despair and the heartache just as I tame the sea so while I bring order to your life once more\nPerspective\nThere's some comfort in that\nBecause when you are facing hardship for the first time it feels like the end of the world\nAnd fifth grade\nMy nose started bleeding right there in the middle class some kid called me a boo gr picker and the rumor spread I went home that afternoon and made the bold announcement to my mother I Know you like it here mom but we're going to have to move I Can't go back to that school ever again\nI can hear her now you think they're mean now Joe just wait but I can hear her just as well saying I've\nMade it through worse and I'm here to tell you this is going to be okay\nWho\nCut a channel for the Torrance of rain and the way for the thunder bolt to bring rain on land where no one lives on the desert which is empty of human life the saddest\nOne lives on the desert which is empty of human life to satisfy the waste and desolate landed to make the ground put forth grass there was such a great benefit to knowing the ones who have seen the desert put forth grass\nOne who has been a witness to such a miracle is a great\nCs Lewis who among other books also wrote one about mourning the death of his wife it's called a grief observed\nIt begins with a description no one ever told me that grief felt so much like fear\nI'm not afraid but the sensation is like being afraid\nThe same flooded during in the stomach the same restlessness the yawning I keep on swallowing and there are moments he writes most unexpectedly\nWhen something inside me tries to assure me that I don't really mind so much not so very much\nAfter all love is not the whole of a man's life\nThen comes the sudden\nJob of red hot memory and all this common sense vanish is like an aunt in the mouth of\nThe book is valuable but it can't tell you why\nI Can't tell you why the lord would create a world in which the innocent suffer why the law would create a world where the guilty go free I Can't tell you why there is so much evil\nAnd pain and hatred why there would be men in God's creation who abuse their own mother's parents who forsake their children diseases that afflict all bodies and ... with no thought in our minds beyond pain\nYou can look\nBut neither in the Bible nor anywhere else have I found a satisfying answer to the question why there would be cancer\nWhy death and why grief would be so deep and so bottomless\nAnd the book of job is this can you\nCauses of America's resurgent tribalism are many they include seismic demographic change\nWhich has led to predictions that whites will lose their majority status within a few decades declining social mobility and a growing class divide and media that reward expressions of outrage all of this has contributed to a\nClimate in which every group in America\nMinorities and white conservatives and liberals the working class and elites everyone feels under attack\nPitted against\nThe others not just for jobs in spoils but for the right to define the nation's identity [noise] I Am struck by that last sentence for who does\nHave the right\nWho does have the privilege\nTo define\nThe nation's identity\nWho gets to decide our\nIdentity\nI mean it's a really appreciate this inquiry I think we have to acknowledge the fact that we are reaping the fruit of philosophical liberalism which for the past century or so has undermined the ideas of essential ism and foundational is on them and I'm going to say something about those in just a moment but starting\nWith Plato and up until about the end of the nineteenth century in church that's a really long time\nFor that period of time religion and politics and the whole of society\nNormalized and codified the dominant cultural and political forces of the day they codified and they normalize those cultural and political forces understanding of what true human existence actually looks like\nThey tried to answer the question for the world's\nWhat is the essence of human is what is essential in human identity\nAnd until a little over a century ago these dominant forces and cultural powers had definitive answers for that question\nWhiteness was unquestionably normal Protestantism was unquestionably normal western educational economics\nYou know believe normal western educational economic and political structures and institutions were unquestionably\nNormal heterosexuality was unquestionably normal gender roles were unquestionably normal male illness was unquestionably normal as an aside is not lost on me that I fit in most of these categories\nAnd that which was deemed normal\nThat was codified and that was promoted\nAs essential\nTo human\nIdentity\nI'd be remiss if I didn't say that I Believe the fruit of philosophical liberalism is not sour\nThe political and societal freedoms empowerment and inclusion that isn't Curtis especially in our nation over the years that which still needs to occur and involved in time in my opinion I think only unknown C. H. the accent of God's creativity\n\nThe creativity that by intent promotes a plurality of witness a plurality of of experience\nSo her out of the of human expression\nThat I sincerely believe I Believe that's the uh logically that is by God's very designed by God's intention I Believe that plurality and I believe that diversity brings glory to God's because God created\nEverything everything\nEven so we live in this post foundational age and they come to any sort of agreement on what is essential identity for our nation\nLet alone the entire planet\nSeems to be an impossible task right\n'cause then all of our diversity and all of our God intended and gone to God designed plurality in the welcomed the construction of what was normalized and then the lord over people who didn't fit all of those categories is there actually\nSomething we can say that is foundational to human existence that Sunday ... to human\nIdentity well church this morning I Believe that there is something to be said here\nI think the scriptures prophetic Lee and pass really speak to this very question\nI think they speak in such a way\nPromote promote a particular essential Islam\nAnd essential isn't at all I Believe shape our ethical lives that shape how we interact with other human beings and every sphere of our existence not just in our religious existence but in our politics in in our economy and the environment and our social settings in our schools and every place I Believe this word\nThat comes to us today speaks to every sphere\nOf our lives when it pertains to this question of essential identity\nEssential humanness for in our text from some aid so worthwhile that the writer fevers repeats then again\nSome aid speaks to this question and says this what are human beings that you are mindful of them\nMortals\nThat you care for them to get us made them a little lower than God you're crown them says the writer with glory and honor we get cute\nAnd call it the

most heinous of centers even those who live and act like the anti Christ right before our eyes\nEven those who don't believe or reject the notion of the existence of God sill by God's Grace just design has put this imprint on every human being says the ... every human being carries\nThis essence\nThe notion of being crowded with glory an honors or turn of phrase that they made something like this that God has a high opinion of what God creates God has a high opinion of what God creates even those we have a low opinion of and I have a list of those people\nOnes that I have a low opinion of the ones we hold in low regard God attributes\nIn scandal\nAttributes high esteem\nHighest theme\nLeave today believing anything less than this\nDon't leave today believing anything less than this that you and why and every human being on this planet\nIs created\nCared for and crowned\nBy God\nHe moved to the book of ...\nThe writer digs deep and begins to invite us to think about the work of Jesus said play and there's some and the and the writer says a Jesus actually takes on this for\nLeaving his status above the angels for a human status and he demonstrates God's love for the whole world not just our corner of the world but the whole world and he lives in he dies and he's he's raised for the world\nAnd what is the outcome of this sacrificial act I mean\nThe logically speaking we could name several of several things several components in terms of the advocacy of Jesus' life death in his resurrection what are the outcomes of that for human history but not just for human history

I found for myself that I just wasn't nearly as well informed but I was also struggling with how do I become better informed\nI'm so clearly if you read the AJC and you read it you know cover to cover you're gonna get pick up information\nI no longer really AJC I mostly read you know on line and national uh news outlets and so but but how should the citizens of the state\nWho we are going to the polls get informed before they go and I a depth of information not just kind of the talking points to hear from their favorite you know radio or TV show but really get into the meat what's the issue what are the opinions around the issue what are the experts say about the pros and the cards\n[noise] you know it it takes a little work I have to say there's no central place in ... you know as we've heard over and over again you know the Internet's not a safe place these days you really got to be critical about what you're looking at him thinking about where the information is coming from\nI Want to give a shout out to the Georgia budget and Policy Institute they're a nonprofit they're non partisan and they do great research about Georgia policies and they've got a lot of information about health care policy and and the real numbers about how it impacts Georgia\nSo you can look at some of those issues and then start testing ... we're politician stand on those issues and health care policy is the number one issue in Georgia right now people want health insurance they don't want their hospitals to close\nThey want access to health care and and they want to be healthy um so I you know if you only thought about voting for a politician based on their position on expanding\nA Medicaid or or you know other health policies that you may\nTake an interest in I think spending medicate and making sure the Affordable CARE Act is intact in it not expanded um that's a darn good way to start here in Georgia\nAll right so so again what is ... on line on on line is it is\nThe Georgia a budget and Policy Institute gee B.

far afield so but I Do want to get into if you had to nuts it and you know at\nNot just this election and not just not just this mid term and not just with the you know the the current people running and the current ballot issues but but in general do you think of one of the five biggest issues\nThat we're facing as a community and and brought her as a nation um what would they be because obviously\nIf it may not it may not directly affected office\nBut it in the big picture probably it probably does it's you know who's governing as a lot to do with what eventually happened right\nWell uh guys you could go many many different ways I'm just going to tell you about some things that are on my mind uh you know number one climate change you know we've seen farms in southwest Georgia\nChange you know we've seen farms in southwest Georgia devastated by the last hurricane hurricane Michael which nobody ever you know thought hurricane would reach that far and in inland it's indisputable that that's happening because the the the the oceans are heating up so\nWell I Wish we could just do is get over it's not the climate change is real ... you can debate all you want what is what how much man has contributed to it I don't think there's anyone who's challenging the climate change so if it if it's some kind of natural cycle of activity because clearly we've had ice ages before\nI'm as well as heating periods whether it is or not even though all ... you know I Would say All right let's say nearly all Ninety nine plus percent of all the Evans says that man's contribution is significant to it but even respective of that\nWe have climate changes and the climate changes are such that they are there's a certain predictability and why are we not doing everything within our power\nTo do something about it and that's the point I just don't get I get the fact if you want to argue the ability 'cause it's a tough science to prove\nBut no one's challenging no one should be challenging that it's happening and if it's happening and the question is what can we do if anything\nYeah and and so you know right here this year we've got elections for the public service commission and there are people who have different points of view about energy usage and the state and had to pay for it and\nWhere we should get it from and so you know those are you know if you care about that issue you might want to look down ballot and and see where the candidates stand on something like that\nUm you know public transportation you know look and see like how we eat more cars won't fix the traffic we have and it certainly won't add anything to clean air uh you know it in the state or in\nThat we do have cars we took away all the incentive than the electric\nYep so you know look at that those those are state policies are federal policies you look at people who are running for Congress you can look at who's running for governor um and and see where they stand on on those kinds of policies\nUm you know one thing that I think is is really important is here in Georgia we have to close the gun show loophole\nThere are no requirements for background checks if you buy a gun at a gun show\nThat is ridiculous you can totally bypassed the background check I I didn't realize that was a state controlled I was so there was a federal issue well it shouldn't be a federally she ... federal issues are important in my mind the federal government and the Congress should deal with this issue so that you can't go to Georgia\nWhere there's a gun show loophole and buy guns and then shipped them to a state where there's not a gun show loophole\nRight you know but nevertheless we need to close it down here so we don't have people who are you know are mentally ill who are criminal who are you know too young to own guns buying guns and\nGun show well I again I ... I've never heard of a a a coherent argument as to why the loophole should exist on so the argument I always hear is that if everything else was done it wouldn't make a difference but it's not a defense of the loop all well yeah\nIt yeah and it you know many many guns that are using crimes in other states emanates from Georgia because of the gun show loophole so you know there's there's facts there and people need to check out the facts\nAll right so that's to give me to climate change one central loopholes to um\nEducation funding right we talk about how we are talking about you know are we going to fund a physical education are we going to make sure kids are getting have healthy meals in schools you know what are we doing about uh you know the curriculum that kids will learn about health and wellness and and and um [noise]\n... you know so I think education is tremendously important and that is at the local and state\nLevel and the national level I I I struggle because you know we all have this image of was certainly people my age have an image that our education system wasn't so screwed up when we were kids right um so I'm a product of public you know public education and I mean to it\nAnd you know yes my classes were probably too large but you know certainly you know ... ... ... my parents couldn't afford private school and so it wasn't an option um but\nBut this notion that I that I really struggle with and it's not just teachers although it was interesting to see the number of strikes by teachers in different states this year and and the amount and what they go through and the lack of funding but we don't we don't we don't value I grew up on the street where\nOn my street there were doctors and dentists but they're also small businessmen there were teachers there were CPAs it's kind of you know post World war two everybody was living together and the income that that income gap wasn't that great\nAnd we don't seem to value the civic servants we don't value civic server service working government we don't value it with police and firefighters we certainly don't value it and teachers giving the wages um and that to me it starts with who's going to do that job and and if the best and the brightest\nAren't helping our ... our children learn and become educated we're digging a hole\nOr digging a hole and and you know we're we're destroying our democracy from the inside out right if you don't have literate citizenry people who can evaluate things we talked earlier about you know the ... the the Internet is\nPeople who can evaluate things we talked earlier about you know the ... the the Internet is not we think it is right and people can't think critically about information that they're receiving you know ... and everything else sort of diminishes from there\nSo it seems to me that you know so it gets on some of these issues become really big issues what do we value as a society and and I you know I Would love to think that you know if it if all we value is making money that how much is left and\nRight and you know that could go on and on about political gerrymandering and and the and really the the terrible impact that that had on our country and that that's a that's a bipartisan right\nViolent right at both parties have done it right it's just gotten more and more extreme ... you know every year just seems to get worse and worse over you believe\nChallenges to it in Pennsylvania and North Carolina do you see that as a trend do you think that and and and there is a citizenry are they aware did they understand the impact today\nGoes back to education and civics right don't understand how government works and how different levels of government work than you know you're probably not likely to be very I don't\nTeach for America people don't know what food you know how to what we measurements are and they think a bowl of cereal is actually for serving right right I'm Mike because we don't teach it yep I'm All right so I'm climate change gun show loophole we've got into a lot of stuff on the third world but it started with education\nRight and and I you know you've been talking about it a lot but the preservation and expansion of the Affordable CARE Act to me is just number one right people have to have health insurance and then at the state level here in Georgia expanding Medicaid critical\nIt's just such a struggle for me as a physician to think that this notion that that that health care is not a right it's a privilege and that somehow to argue that yeah but everybody can loan emergency room so everybody has that same right where it's mess on healthcare an emergency room as a health care\nIt's not and and here in Georgia there are places you know we've lost six hospitals already there like fifty that are on the edge I'm not everybody can even show up in an emergency room\nKnowing and what about if you're going to have a baby were at you know you could either be fifty a hundred miles from the closest Senate and we\nYou know not a neonatal labor number one in uh in um maternal mortality not too long ago I think we might be ... I'm sure we're still on the top two or three and um but you know what a scary thing that you can't have a baby in the state without running the risk of\nDying which gets back into you know that part of that you know our values when did we not care but everybody else when did that happen that we just think about ourselves which is that you mentioned that Wall Street mentality we just focus on the court\nYou know used to be there was a big picture yeah and and are we that far from World war two and it was at it you know but there was that we're all in it together and it's not that any more if it doesn't seem based on [noise] you know how we see the policies developing well and I think that some of the energy or seeing around the elections people are really really\nTrying to get a message across the politicians to do something you know not just talk about something that\nMy my sister in law says she wants them all out anybody has any ... you know we're we're so broken if you're in now you need to come out yet again but we got to start over yeah I think a lot of people are thinking that\nWe're going to break we'll be back for a little close\nGame [noise]\nFor forty eight and a cool rain carrier W.
