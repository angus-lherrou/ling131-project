calls a show\nOr some more interesting items that current crossed my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning week pass for that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras in thermostats routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the smart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack\nPasswords for example many routers and Web cams I have a default admin password like admitting or password so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always change the default pass for\nMaking something strong that the cameras won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers in scammers alright so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nTo said week default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made and the state\nThe problem is that in books to those Internet connected devices I just mentioned they're made in China\nSo the new law is going to require manufacturers to said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place that forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but how effective is it really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew new pixel phones because they had a major security breach\nWell they said it was a bug well that's what they always say it's a bug actually nobody was paying attention they expose the private information of about a half a million people for about three years thank you Google\nGoogle has its own social media site called Google Plus they announce between twenty Fifteen and march with twenty Eighteen\nNo one was paying attention a security flaw as they like to say lifted personal information of five hundred thousand people up for grabs email addresses gender occupation you get the draft\n\nAre and so we started talking about smart TV [laughter] the thing that makes a TV smart is that what it connects up to the Internet\nWell once you can make something up to the Internet guess what else can happen yeah the hackers in scammers and the bad things can go on well this past week a big security alert for certain brand of television\nThat they had to listen they had to they had to run down and install these for updates but the problem is that\nThey want you to install the former update so if you don't know about this update then you're sitting there just fat dumb and happy watching TV and actors can be doing whatever they want\nGetting onto your TV and then on to the network so that's coming up and just a few moments but first the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once

and save me several times looking at the menus saying\nWhat is it that I can actually eat on this menu and I was able to with my phone be able to figure it all out Susan once again thank you for your call up\nLet's talk a little bit about the ... and ... my favorite printer my printer of choice you can learn more right now at ... dot com slash ego tank him as the model number is a forty seven fifty and I think in the box print 'em to eleven thousand color pages\nLearn more epson dot com slash ego tank Kim epson exceed your vision\nRight having a smart TV is one of the great benefits of modern technology\nBut when your TV can next to the Internet it becomes vulnerable\nWell news out this past week that if you if a Stony Brook via television you really need to get into the settings and do a system update because there are now three critical bugs but that means is that hackers can come in\nAnd they can come in and take over the the television and the ones that are in the television they can take over the entire network\nAnd anything else that may be connected to anything else that may be connected to it rather so to learn more about it and links that you might need and to check to see if you're probably is on the list look no further than commando dot com that's K. O. M. A. N. D. O. dot com and winter there hit that show picks button stay right where you are\nYou're still on Facebook some three D. photos are coming your way here on the ... commando show [noise]\nFrom coast to coast under your source for\nAs a business owner I rely on del small business technology advisors I'm Kim commando now you and I both know there's nothing small about our businesses are reputation is always on the line and that's where the Dell small business technology advisors come in\nOkay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish the other thing you\nCan do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this then health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business\nYou'll have more tools available to you\nYou'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore so\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you to be for you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay\nIn to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results that well right\nAll right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now and it's not going to cost you a lot of money because you can do a cost per click campaign\nSo somebody types in whatever your medical profession is in your town within the ZIP codes you maybe pay ten cents for every click\nBut you're not going to be at the bottom of page you're not going to be on page too so you start thinking of different ways that you can market your business instead of putting that money and depending upon somebody else to quote unquote get rid of the bad stuff on line\nOkay does that make sense\nFor us to say um I I Do promote like customers try to ask them to go on and put on a positive review forest is just to get them to do it as like a should I Try to\nAt a pet or something and\nTry to at a pet or something yes that's right and then they then you're doing here now\nYeah you put a pet right there exactly uh that's really smart and\nNumber you know and you could have a forum where they fill out you know positive and then they check a box that says this this can you know this goes up to health grades or whatever it may\nBe but the other thing too is you can have a basket there a gift basket and every thirty days we pick a winner from that gift basket okay\nSo we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left in great review for us\nAnd so and that's that can beyond that little card or that can be on the printed receipt\nThat can be part of the email confirmation or the text that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start so you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive you know maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make itself better but ... and you start telling them what you\nWant and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good\nNature but they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times 'cause the average person has to hear something four times before they act\nAs that hopefully they'll get in there and do that now if for some reason this doesn't work and thirty days\nAnd want you to give me a call back and we'll go to the next level but I think you'll find that people will give you that review as long as you ask for and thank you for your call or let's talk about one of our great sponsors I drive dot com and I

perspective show where an examination of how many differences often shows us\nHow much we have in common I'm Hondas Presley and on the show today I don't think we got a whole lot in common with some of the folks were going to learn about today why you ask it's because our guest is the author\nDr Ian Smith now you know in because you've seen him on television you seen him on how oh come on and tell me the show Richard re yeah I mean more than ... ... ... that's right because you are a health and fitness and the lifestyle expert\nAnd you've been on the show with this before but also you are an acclaimed\nWriter you have written a number of bestsellers on the New York times best selling list including the number one shred super shred blast the sugar out and then I think we talked about your novel the black bird paper as well\nYou've taken a break from the shreds series and you are back with the ancient nine\nAnd into the number one New York times best seller all ready with great blurbs from Michael Eric Dyson Publishers Weekly said this and enticing thriller those seeking an inside look at I at an Ivy League secret society\nWill definitely get their money's worth and you\nDoctor in case Smith were a member of one of these Ivy League secret society's just set the table for us and ... before we get into this really really good book so this is something that you want to read 'em or whatever yeah\nFor having me I appreciate it you know I have been writing this book for over twenty five years I started when I was a senior in college or because I knew at the time though I was not a writer I knew that this story was so unique\nAnd so intriguing I wanted to share some of my experiences in one of these secret inside of these uh with the world at large it was a difficult decision actually to write this book because I didn't want to write an ... on these clubs these calls have been around since the Seventeen hundreds\nUm they are called final clubs or an hour Harvard's version of six societies and they had been populated\nAnd remembered by some of the who's who in America both Roosevelt president teddy and Franklin Roosevelt were members of one of the final clubs or President Kennedy his brother's Robert and I'm and Ted Kennedy remembers\nThe great poet TS Eliot was a member Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes junior was a member so you get the picture and very powerful wealthy people have been members and for a long time these clubs or we're basically comprised of all male all white male because that's what Harvard was at the time\nUh and it wasn't really until about sixties uh when women and minorities were more mentioned university that pressure came on these clubs to admit\nWomen and to admit or African Americans and other ethnic minorities are but this book the ancient nine basically is the first book that's ever\nBeen written that extensively delves behind the walls of one of these clubs now you know I was a member um and I was elected in a very mysterious way or the way you get the way it begins it's called the punch by the way as in like what'd you drink and hitting someone they called the punch and the way it works is\nTalk about taking their fathers playing to the ... bombers for the weekend\nFirst of all I didn't know there there are private plane [laughter] and these kids are saying yeah dads using as plain as we can go to the Bahamas this is how these people live um and so it was my first experience of experiencing that\nUm and so it was my first experience of experiencing this and I think that it opened my\nEyes open my eyes that there's a whole world out there of connections that you don't know about and that you should be aware of you may not be able to join that world but you should know that it exists and you know the playing field is not always level for all kinds of reasons and you should just be aware of that\nSo walk us through the story that you're telling in the ancient nine\nIn Nineteen twenty seven to get a trying to break into the ... mansion on Halloween Night one kid gets in and disappears\nFast forward to the eighties when I was there a this young black student is mysteriously punched or invited to begin the process of joining this club\nAnd his best friend ironically is the legacy his best friend is a white guy who's a Boston Brahmin whose family's been at Harvard for three generations\nWho is irreverent he will not joining one of these clubs justice by his father he does not like his father his father's very upper crust and he wants to be everything that his father is not so you have this black kid who comes from nothing who's being invited Mr as he's run this club\nAnd you have a best friend who was this white guy who knows all about these clubs because of his family but refuses to join in but what the white guy does know his name was dealt with don't does know\nIs that the ancient nine had been rumored to exist for a long time and even he is curious to see if it exists so the two of them work to discover\nWho the ... is and what is the secret that they're trying to hide oh\nThat's very intriguing as very very strong teeth [laughter] so uh how long before I mean we've seen we've seen similar types of stories the skulls Joe White people that had a network yeah social network that had ... of course I'm\nExplored these final clubs you think this is going to you know I'd be able to option this one out of all I just got an offer [laughter] see I Love making news on the show the book\nHas been out ah for less than a week and a big time producer has already asked the option to make it into a movie now I mean you know you never know what happens but I'm honored that she felt the story was so compelling that he said cinematography from a cinematic standpoint he could see it on the screen\nYou talk about these multi million dollar mansions and hidden spaces and dark places in secret society is all guys and and you can figure I can see the conflict in in there and and I'm sure there's conflict in your story where it's a tease us with a twist\nThe character is conflicted to be a guy from the other side of the tracks and joined us worlds he also feels guilty\nSo there's also that level and there's a little love story in there of course which I Love he falls in love with a a very beautiful girl who works in the dining hall who doesn't have anything to do with him because he's a Harvard guy and he got he has to try to win her over\nAh [laughter] there you go all the elements are there so what did you learn about yourself after finishing the ancient nine\nWell I've always been writing fiction um since the blackbird papers back in two thousand four it's just that my diet books and health books\nHave been so successful and I'm grateful I don't want to sound and grateful about that but the problem with that success has is that your publisher want you to write more of them right so um so for years I've been saying to my publisher we got to publish to ensure nine this was a great story it's got to get out and no one's written like this with about these clubs\nUm and so what I learned about myself is that um I have to continue to be tenacious and persistent\nUm and I have to continue to follow my dreams and passionate passionate about fiction I Love fiction and I can do both I can do nonfiction and fiction like you don't have to be right side or left side you can be dual sided\nAbsolutely in case you're just joining us we're talking to after Ian Smith Tucker in case Smith again you know I'm from the ... and super shreds you've seen him on television on Rachel Ray the view and other shows his new book out just more than a week\nIs a novel the ancient mind about the final clubs the secret societies and America's Ivy League schools written\nFiction but as a member of one of these final clubs you've got a little behind the scenes experience where you conflicted in your experience back in the eighties with once you were punched and got to the process where you say yes or no does anybody ever actually say now\nRarely because you go to the whole process to get in and what I thought well what what bothered me mostly at the time was I didn't want to be the kind of member that came from a group that typically doesn't get in and then forget that everyone else on the outside\nIt's easy by the way when when you come from a group that is typically not allowed or excluded and you happen to pass through the doors and anything this is not just as clubs but it's easy to get through those doors and be like oh I made it everything's great with the world but it's not because look we left behind\nAnd so I was conflicted a you know as a student because I was friends with all kinds of ...\nAnd so I was conflicted a you know as a student because I was friends with all kinds of people all different levels of income and race and religion so I was conflicted that you know what does it say about me that I'm joining us this club and that's part of the reason why I wrote the story because I felt like I should tell the story um and and have it get out there and not by the way to\nPunish my club I had a great experience but just to say this world exists and maybe these doors should be open to more people\nBut right now they're not do you think they ever will\nYes I think to have to I think that the younger generation\n... the younger generation has taken over these clubs and the graduate members or be or younger now that the ... and I think that eventually they're going to have to vote ... women in and out the vote more diversity and they should I mean it's this is the world we live and and I think these clubs\nAs interesting as they are our anachronism there from a an era gone by and they should open up\nThe question the question also is whether or not women want to be in these clubs\nYou know that's another question you have to ask they should still have the right to but I don't think everyone wants to join his clubs\nYou know because guys are being guys and there's certain things that college guys do that nobody needs to know about yet and women are probably did not interested in but I Do think that women and other people don't don't get and they do miss out on that that networking they really do a because\nWe have dinners when the ... come back for dinners were rubbing shoulders with people who are running the running the country which\nBrings us to a current event Brett Kavanaugh now by Kevin I didn't go to Harvard but he did go to Gail where likely a member of one of the secret society these final clubs who end up as you say leaders in the country and in in ... I don't know what are you what are your thoughts on all of\nThat well I think that you know um Bush was a member to a father a Bush when he was a member of of of skull and bones and so you also has the ... society is a Princeton\nHas eating clubs they used to be secret society but they actually voted to go coed so women can go into the printing clubs but you know these secret society these clubs are relics\nYou know they are of a time when um it was believed that exclusivity was the way to remain on top\nOkay and um there was a lot of inbreeding in the sense of we went to eggs are together we went to Deerfield all these places that the average person doesn't even know exist by the way all these prep schools\nOr or I Would I say like you know it's the first time I learned that you could use winter as a verb\nYou know we winter in Florida [laughter] so [laughter] so this is the this is a lot that you're talking about and and um I think that you know I don't know cabinet opposite personally but I but what I see him though my first thought when I saw him\nAnd I heard he went to Yale\nI could see him being in one of their secret society's just because they see societies actually produce and breed people who attained very lofty positions\nWhat are your obligations to the club as an alum\nWell it's pretty much you know it's elective so there are some members who read members who are very involved\nThere are some who are occasion involving there's someone every involved again and and the way you get involved as you donate like I say these clubs are owned by the club's not the university there self funded\nI'm so you raise money um you host and the book Spencer Collins the young character he goes through a series of events and one of them is in New York dinner\nWhere they fly them down to New York for dinner and someone alone will host a dinner like that so it's so the alum stay involved in different ways\nHow do you think your life would be different had you've not been punched into your final club I\nI think my life actually would have been the same to be honest with you but I think that the things I learned in observed in the final clubs\nOr were able to broaden my horizons and it gave me a better understanding of the nuances of differences and and where we all come from\nA and how we're able to reach our destinations you know I'd have to work my whole life very hard [laughter] you know as you have a and so and I'm not afraid of I Love hard work I was taught that\nBut there are some people in this world\nUm where the work does not have to be as hard because of who they are and what their name is that's just kind of and I'm not whining about it that's just the way it works you know my kids are going to have an easier time than I had because you know dad and mom and worked hard and have a achieve some level success so that's how it works but\nIt was good for me to learn that then so that if I was up for example I make this up up for a job and didn't get it I wouldn't think I didn't get it 'cause I'm no good and they're all kinds of reasons why you may lose out on something that you don't even know about\nI'm the same type of of second guessing the same type of muscular just I'm almost a immobilizing wow those same types of physical ... ashes happen when you get excited about success as well as when you get\nIrritated and traumatized [noise] so when you have that same dynamic going on and you don't realize there is a subtle difference you will get caught and stuck in that place\nA little difference you will get caught and stuck in that place so that made me kind of kind of confirmed okay we got to deal with this issue so why ... why do we fear success less this get there first and then we'll talk about some things to overcome that paradigm\nMhm one\nYou can't have success without changing something in your life oh\nMargaret [laughter]\nIf you do the same thing you've always done you always get the same result to think otherwise is the is the definition of insanity let's be real ... in order for you to be successful at anything that you're trying to do you're going to have to change\nAnd guess what change is scary\nYeah it is changed and cites a feeling of fear\nAnd a lot of us just get comfortable and the status quo Mm weather than rather than break it outside of my local coon\n'cause I don't know was outside of this ... let me just stay here you know I got a job I got to the gym and we talk about this often to want to go to jail be\nI'm getting a paycheck right I got a house I got a roof over my head quite upset the apple cart\nMm [noise] but is that status quo where you want to die or\nDo you want something a little better than that right but that's number one number two is\nFear of not coping with the outcomes if you're a success if I Am successful\nCan't deal with the change that is going to come because there's going to be change right if I'm successful what ifs Comey mhm well what if this happens and what if that happens and what if this happened\nI don't know if I can deal with that goes I've never had to do it before\nRight we watch much t._v. so we think or oh you bet and they think that our success is going to be like what we see on television and it may I ask that\nExactly yeah\nAnd that's the third one they see all these images of what other successful people look like ... and then there's always this well they they came from this and now they're here they were like this and now that you fear becoming someone else\nAnd if you do that what what other people think wow\nWhat my family they would they be what they support me what I still have my friends what would the what what would this segment of my my my my circle think if I'm successful if I achieved this success will I become someone that might not like\nYeah yeah but who's in charge of that you are you really are yeah\nBut the reality is it holds people back because then you start dealing with a little bit of self sabotage inning\nMaking excuses those things come for the fourth one is what what people expect of me\nI succeed\nNow you know we've seen all these movies where you know this person gets wealthy they get rich and all of them could names coming out of ...\n[laughter] ... [laughter] yeah it just sounds like you're getting in a bar live on the phone and then have something some oh yeah so\nNow I'm In a place where I haven't got everybody's pulling on me everybody wants something from me well I'd be seen as selfish if I don't\nWell this change how opera see other people will I become a miser will I become will out because again the what ifs but\nYou don't do what senior spirit to do what if you stay where you are and you never achieve your destiny ugly so don't be stuck in the foot is\nOn the negatives you got to look at those foot is on the positives as well [noise] number five what if I become the center of attention for some people that's the draw right there they want to be the center of attention but then again what does the center of attention ...\nRight and is it a three ring circus\nExactly yeah yeah so it's a quiet\nPerson that is scary adult you know I I Want to succeed in this I Want to start my business I Want to stop my ministry I Want to step out and get my degree so I can I can be the head of something I Would love to be the director or something what does that look like I Can't give 'em successful this at that\nI was in a a music ... last week and you know just a was the producer of the wars show and I heard about our reservation\nSure of the war show and I heard about it our reservations I was quiet and this young lady came and she says I've been watching you are you okay you're so quiet\n[laughter]\nAnd I just started laughing I say a man I talked for a living [laughter] and when I can be quiet I'm quiet and and I say I really truly a more this person then the person that you see when I'm doing the job wow\nAnd so she because she was like I spend watching you and you just so quiet and so laid back and I just thought that was just so what what is\nBut that that that fit though people watched you Bob successful I may be the center of it and you didn't even know she was watching you not at all not at all but all those little watching you mhm Mm because of where you word who you were right so it's almost as though your private life become such a thing in the past\nWhile you're when you're in public or private life as a thing of the past but exactly you can make it what you want it to me a yes things up post certain things I don't post a when I'm at home I'm at home and I don't invite too many people into my house\nCome on now you you know what I'm saying so you said those parameters you got to do that\nBut what do you call you draw the line in the same mhm if you don't draw the line and say you're right you will have a private life will not let\nYou define how your success looks mhm then you don't have to be so scared of being successful [noise] six\nThe demands on my time [laughter] [noise]\nIf I'm successful in order to keep up this level of success will I have any time to myself wow what about my family what about my wife if I'm a villa ... what about my husband if I'm a woman what about my children if\nI'm six at right now I might work hard mhm but my weekends on my own my nicer miles right I don't have to constantly be gone and thinking and trying to figure things out\nIf I'm successful what's that going to look like\nAgain you have to draw the parameters and make your own time I know for me I had to learn how to say no very by God yep yep nope can't do it I was missing time with my husband and my children my mother\nMy personal time so you have to draw that line as well you don't have ... you don't have to be everywhere when you begin to start building that that's a whole different thing so um you have to know that I'm not required to be it everything\nThat's right yeah you say that I can you do you decide that you're not required ... knock you open yourself up to be run racket yeah\nThat's a choice it can happen that mhm and it will probably be easy to do if you don't set those parameters right\n'cause people will use you for their stuff they want your your shine your intelligence they want you greedy they just want you to be at my event I Want this I Want that and um sometimes you do have to say no\nAnd you're getting pulled up because I see you all the time to get him pulled is so many different directions but you get pulled as far as you want to get\nIt there you go [laughter] that when I was younger\nIt was a different story I was I was running around but now\nYou know I I Do the things that I Need to do and what God tells me to do and besides that I'm at home and I'm enjoying my time\nAnd you put your foot down and it hadn't gotten chopped off yet nope not at all you've got both the\nNobody ... let me I'm good [laughter]\nBut see that the paradigm view controlling your destiny you teach people how to treat you through\nSo if you go with the flow and let people pull us thousand different directions and they just become to expect that if you ... you might have a ... few people who do it ... ... with you when you start saying no yeah but guess what once you say the parameters if you have not yet done so\nAnd you set the guidelines I'm available to do this I'm available to do that in ... I'm going to say no then when you do say no and when you said those guidelines you put your foot down\nPeople know how to respect your no mhm mhm but you have to teach people how to do that so that that that that demand on your time that your call mhm that's your decision that your vision for your\nFollowed by the U.S be rendered the moon but\nGoing to say about Herman dreams daily your came perspective every week they limited to say on it news weather and traffic station is about five and a um seven fifty W.

days at the hands on his hands\nOn Jamie de phrase\nIf a bank's database gets completely wiped out it is long term no real problem short term there are potential hassles so it's still a long term one of the things that has been implemented I don't remember how many years ago this was\nBanks and credit unions work under a buddy system where they all have and nobody really talks about this 'cause it's doomed to the doomsday scenario kinds of stuff but there is a\nCompanion bank\nA competitor that has a database backup that's never more than twenty four hours old from their competitor and in the event that something happens we're foreign actors able to completely disable\nThe computer operations at a bank or credit union\nPeople will still be able to use their accounts with the other financial institution acting is host\nAnd for you and me\nA cut over it should be somewhat pretty much business as usual I guess\nYou somewhat pretty much business as usual I guess records who would be there'd be like a twenty four hour window of a missing data potentially\nSo which again is not normally the end of the world but two things come to mind with us if we were to receive a serious attack\nFrom the Russians the Chinese another foreign actor Iran look in our list of potential enemies that would do this\nCould be North Korea I mean we've got a lot of potential suspects\nWhine a lot of people never have any cash anymore cash for a very short window would become valuable having a small amount of cash available stored in a place in your home\nSmall I mean for a lot of people just for walking around money under a hundred dollars let's say\nHaving that available particularly if you're somebody you've never carries any cash at all you should have it when I travel you know I travel a roughly thirty weeks a year\nI carry even though I never use it I have a supply of cash with me not a huge amount but I have some cash that if ever I had a serious problem where I could not access accounts that I still have some cash to function with\nThe second thing is and this is all Boy Scouts stuff right be prepared\nAnd let's go on the assumption that nothing terrible is going to happen even if it does everything will be okay after a while\nBecause of the redundant systems have been put into place\nSo the other thing is if you have turned off paper statements from a banker brokerage\nAnd you are receiving electronic ones you need to print those out\nOr store them in your own backup hard drive or in the cloud although that wouldn't be as good as in your own hard drive you need to have some kind of record that if a bank database ever got wiped clean\nYou have documentation at least going back to the last statement\nShowing what you had\nAgain that's doomsday kind of stuff\nBut I Want you to be prepared for me everybody I Do business with wants me to go to electronic statements\nAnd I know this sounds so antiquated and so David but I'm thinking analog if

saying you just wouldn't be able to get away with it in this environment\nHe says you couldn't get away with it in some yeah\nBecause there's so many comedians lately who are saying you know what we realize now that we're making jokes that were hurting people's feelings and we can't do that anymore which means ... humor because good humor usually hurt somebody's feelings just a little bit

because he went after everybody so I'm a little annoyed I'm a little annoyed with the comedians\nOf the of the world right now what do you deal with that kind of annoyance I have no idea I just complain about it I think people should make jokes about whatever they want to make jokes about and I certainly don't think that the weakest people who are easily offended should be the ones who decide what jokes can be done and what jokes can be done\nSo I think bring back the office and make it worse than ever\n[laughter] put it in people's faces make the guy just a career because the thing about the office for me it was a it was like an Archie\nBunker kind of thing you knew the guy had a heart of gold inside of that idiot you know my dad is and that's what got it through and that should always get stuff through but I say now get rid of the heart of gold just bring it back as a racist massaging is sexist I just have to go after everybody because people need it\nWe have time for one

Centers for millennia Trump is firstly going down on trying to let you\nFinish the sentence for me I Love these reporters mad lips basically is the way they're doing the reporting cylinder sentence for me I I'd be she'll be asked about everything but the accomplishments of her husband right\nBringing guns to sentence for millennia Trump is first lady Melania Trump you did agree the center of your credit freezing to show that there would be some some questions asked me to make us ...\nAnd when they find the means to us for ... for no no he's off you're not the first first lady to\nTo deal with her husband is a wish he was put a strain on your marriage exclusively about the jacket\nWhere was the first thing to me is misconception Russia\nBeing alone you know that these special training ended and control on one of\nThose ah this is one of those interviews where the most important or the most interesting thing is what are the questions because that's where you find out what someone in that position that reporter what he thinks are the most important things that people want her to answer first of all first ladies\nInterviews are usually very boring because they just don't really say much and they talk about how they want more people to read who's against that everybody here that wants to less literacy and the country\n[laughter] oh you got a guy back ...\nToo many people are reading so usually it's boring but I mean there's going to be all\nWill they leave some excerpts of it already in one of the things that came out earlier this morning was that she says she's one of the most bully people in the White House\nCould say I'm the most ... percent of Hong Kong all around the world was bullied for so long line of ...\nNow you see what's what he's doing their first of all what does she speak like five languages English is one of the language is she right she's going to get know pass\nFor the fact that she's a ... English as a second or third language to her\nAnd so what they're going to do is they're going to drill in on oh really your rich you're the first lady you're you're privileged and now you're going to say that you're the most bully person what in reality she's tried to just get the point across that uh I'm it's happening to me as much as it's happening to other people on line\nAnd this is what's gonna happen it doesn't matter what she says tonight\nEverybody that doesn't like are already is going to tell you give you a reason why she's just stuck up or whatever she can't win on that one that she'll get no pass for the fact that English is not her first language even me Eric bond has made a snarky joke\nAbout her saying she is the most bully person on the world [laughter]\n\nThat's just the fact that she doesn't speak the language is second or third language to her right\nWell I Know it's it's kind of funny I was checking Twitter late last night and it's a after that clip came out the the laughter is now circulating this thing where she was going after Obama and his birth certificate on I guess she had a couple of interviews where she brought that up at you like and the the lap this were saying how in the world could she be the most bully person the world which he said\nThis about President Obama bashing the birther as well I Know that he was ... she was more or less defending Trump\nWon that during the end it all day [laughter] you know all the research and I had no idea that they wouldn't let a guy and then it is in America right but now\nShe and other documents fool me she was the driving force behind birther as an\nAdult either and I argued with their guns and leave it at you know she she sold it [laughter]\nShe she tricked you into thinking that ah he was not born in America Kenya [laughter]\nIs that where he's like All right next door to\nA former first lady Michelle Obama was not happy ... lady our this is a lot of first ladies a\nGood thing that Michelle Obama do you go to about a refuting Hillary Clinton\nYeah she has a little upset when Hillary said this a couple of days ago actually I've got a although I pull up the audio here a Hillary Clinton at\nThe at least shared messed up watching Jared cover for the fact that he messed\nUp wait what are you talking to here's Hillary or not the civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again I like that\nWill burn it down but after that we're going to be nice [laughter] uh so what are we sell them to\nHang out with\nMind\nAt least here is not a not a motivator [laughter]\nAnd if you think about how you want you to be re how you want to think about life in their opportunity you want to train your neighbors want them angry you want them to use them and try to promote our children of anti your mother [laughter]\nWhen you have to think about what you're telling her when she modeling me want to leave I Believe\nThat she was also refuting was Eric Holder yeah got\nEric Holder's saying this from yesterday as well\nBush of always answers from all over the are you my wife white really high ...\nOh by the way the hope the bragging there are a you know like just so you know ah my wife and I hang out with Michelle\nOh ah my wife and I hang out with Michelle and the ... and then you know ... million broccoli go well you know we we worry about the latest is I mean\nEven that's not what I'm Talking about here I don't I'm not letting you know that I hang out with ex president he has been a little fast and furious with that [laughter]\nDo you like Eric Holder to just put up with it it's kind of a jackass [laughter]\nShallow is there to show 'em all over my wife white really high slowly scare me and\nShe always says that you know when they go low\nThey go low we\nNow uh I I think are actually Eric Holder said he didn't mean violence in Iraq back and correct it the same\nI think what he meant was a you know we gotta fight we gotta fight hard everybody believes that but what Hillary Clinton said was outrageous or somebody who was that close to being president basically saying it's I mean she was basically saying it's okay to get violent\nOr in order to get your point across and that was highly irresponsible that Michelle Obama came out and said it was the wrong way to go a but we'll see I think we're in a world now where uh it's just all or nothing\nI think that's what it's going to be for the next few years a civility has I mean we've gotten to the point now and honestly did you ever see we get to a point where conservatives there'll be cheering a guy who's drop in ... in the oval office [laughter]\n[laughter]\n'cause I've got to kind of weird I remember that story about Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan would never ... he would he would he would never be in the oval office\nWithout having a suit jacket on because he had such respect to the oval office cable Bill Clinton he sell eat it up a little bit\n[noise] but now I read about how we have rappers freestyle M.

this guy is such a criminal their banks will show so I think he pleaded guilty so they went right past the whole trial yeah he's he pleaded guilty or pled guilty if I Want to use the English language he put\nHe pled guilty and then he there were months went by where he knew I'm just going to appear in front of the judge again and he's going to decide what the sentence is going to be what's going to be anything from like one year the Fifteen Years so while he's waiting\nTo be sentenced for being a criminal a con man he creates another shell company a phoney baloney scare they get busted for

S.\nRich people Eric too many rich shameful\nThis is one of those stupid stupid surveys you disagree with Bloomberg I disagree with Bloomberg in this case yes I Do\nThe entire no the reason that this happens is because we have so much wealth correctly so you you get into a situation where oh yeah well maybe you go to another city and there's not that much of a gap\nBut overall there's not much wealth they're either that's why there isn't a gap in capitalism there's always going to be a gap\nBut it's also the best system for you to get from where you were to where you're going and making that possible and as long as you have what you want is something called\nDynamism does that make it as something to think we know that that's not the food for your pets that we always play during Rush Limbaugh has\nThat title fight you know was skin was scanning correct or given that code is clean to me that's I Know by ... he\nTalking about I missed the bullets that\nThat means that in your system\nTalking about nine of Mrs ... what's that\nThat means that in your system what's important is that you got people going up and you got people coming down and it's dynamic and things are moving around and in that situation if you take a snapshot at any one moment\nYou're going to find people up and people down but that's not really the story the story is are people moving up from down our our people on the top losing a bunch of money in rolling back down\nThat's the most important thing so a survey like that says that it lands ... is a great city because it means you can move to Atlanta you can be an enterprising person and you've got a chance to move up the reason other cities aren't in there and maybe considered better\nIt's because there's not enough of wealth to create the gap between the rich and the poor that's what you want in your city you know it reminds me of a survey that was done I read this years ago where they said uh the the most uh the the the most peaceful nations in the world\nAnd one of the things that they would go by one of the metrics was how much money you spend on the military was one of the things that put in there so America because we have all this money in about six hundred and thirty five billion dollars or something a year so we weren't peaceful at all\nBut Canada was right at the top of the list there in the top five most peaceful country now you could looked at and say oh Canada must be more peaceful oh no wait a minute candidate doesn't need to spend money on their military why\nBecause our military is their military so in reality if anybody invading Canada are we going to sit on our hands no so they don't have to worry about it we actually are protecting them\nAnd you're up and basically the whole world now and that's why we spend so much money on the military were creating peace\nBut if you go by that survey where one of the least peaceful countries in the world somebody real point is\nDon't believe any surveys ever about anything that's really when I was getting a because it all depends on if it's a it's an editorial wrapped up in numbers this happens a lot where\nPeople feel like well if I just wrote an editorial\nIt would just be a point of view but if I put numbers behind it and say it was a survey it'll seem like a fact but it's not a fact Atlanta's a great city and the fact that you want more of a gap between the rich and the poor\nYou want to be as wide as possible that's the most that's the best indication that you live in a wealthy city and also that if you're not wealthy you can move up\nHow about that I like it and I was thinking of the ... around fire [noise]\nYeah [noise] I watch like become a means drunk wire two people voting for libertarians [noise] balance not matter whether\nYou catch that says the past ...
