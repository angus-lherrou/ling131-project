Heitkamp\nWell actually I'm not saying that uh a prominent North Dakota lawmaker that'll rock the mid term elections you know it's amazing what these tapes are showing\nIt showing Democrats cannot be honest with who they are what they believe what they will support what they will do and they are with contempt and hatred\nTheir teams them in their teams are behind the scenes thinking the people that vote for them are ignorant\nThinking that they can be manipulated and that they're just saying things to get elected that would be reticent in Tennessee that's McCaskill in Missouri that's Kristin cinema in Arizona\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and by the way they're just the ones that got caught\nBut you know think of what I think of what Democrats have said a Peter Struck I we can smell the smelly Walmart voters and what did what did the Joe Biden said recently about Trump voters amount of number of these people are the drag this society and then Obama bitter people\nAnd know that if the Democrat wins for the house that that's a vote for ... staying home with a half a vote for ... and then every important Senate race be at Florida\nOr be at Tennessee or be Missouri or be Nevada or be at Arizona or Montana or North Dakota or New Jersey even or Indiana that they're all winnable\nYou know there's no scenario would unfold one week two weeks from tonight that I could be

dollar judgment yesterday\nAnd ever since he tried to insert himself into the Capitol confirmation with that is the one that came up with the Julie sweat we claim that oh it was almost like on a weekend basis they would you know these boys would\nWould spike the punch and and get these girls all drugged up and they line up in halls and take turns to go in and gang rape these teenage girls\nAnyway first the last ... defamation suit that he filed for stormy against the president the judge ordering stormy to pay Trump's legal fees that means having these legal you know he lost that case\nNow he wants to five million or nearly five million dollar judgment now he's been evicted apparently from his LA office for non payment of rent out a good week for him and he wants to run for president\nOne of their success you won't hear in your hate Trump media Wall Street journal today media continues obsessing over whatever they want to talk about but\nChancellor Angela Merkel the president referred to this last night at the rally with Ted Cruz has now offered government support or to efforts to open up Germany to us gas which was a key concession\nTo President Trump is each you know the president right where paint Seventy two cents of every dollar for NATO\nThe western alliance that we have the our Western European friends you know worry the most about the\nThe power of Russia the military threat of Russia the hospital regime of Russia\nYou know and we're paying all this money and what is Angela Merkel do but she makes Russia and putting rich again by giving them billions of dollars in energy contracts which is the life blood of not just Germany but of all of Western Europe\nAnd meanwhile we've got the largest supplies of natural gas energy in the entire world and what you ought to be doing is working with an allied nation that is helping to pay for part of their defense\nSo that in fact they don't have to worry about black ... no but she decided she wanted to go to make Russia rich again um during a debate that was held the other night and a Pennsylvania synagogue a Democratic House candidates drop to the pump [laughter] if\nYou can't make this stuff up democratic Pennsylvania congressional candidate Scott while those had to apologize for using an expletive during a debate with Republican Brian Fitzpatrick at a synagogue in ah Pennsylvania on Sunday and but it's Patrick was cross examining Wallace on a on a\nThey invest Patrick was cross examining Wallace on a on a ... attack ad when the Pennsylvania Democrat came out with the expletive he dropped the phone in a in a televised debate in a synagogue great job congressmen want to be good luck with that ... that's going to take you for your career\nAnecdotally what does the president thirty thousand inside another thirty thousand outside a hundred thousand plus our as BP's yeah because so many people were watching rock Obama less than two thousand people it's the five hundred watching crazy uncle Joe Biden oh the president look in the economy\nYou know this this this shouldn't be about yes immigration you know if we get stuck with a confrontation at our border precipitated by the people from Honduras that are coming across the border and God Forbid and if we're going to protect our borders we have to\nAlso is going to be a hundred thousand five hundred that's never going to stop but if we had that wall up guess what wouldn't be happening today that caravan would be non existent nobody wants to people on either side of this to get hurt Mexico needs to do their job and turn the people around and say go back to your home country\nWe'll see what happens I don't even one Democrat talking about what the answer is there\nAnd everyone gets worked out the president says I'm not a global is I'm a national what isn't national ... means America First I Believe not ... not that America pays the bills and security and spreads the well for the entire world we're going to take care of our people our country our way of using our constitutional republic\nAnd the media hates the president showing hate\nIt's funny to watch all these Democrats now beginning to lower expectations on the blue wave that's interesting I guess they don't have as much confidence Republicans debating Democrats and early voting in some states don't take a lot of solace and that just look at it as anecdotally just know that your vote is going to matter here\nYou know we put up the fifty top racist that we think are going to be the balance of power Democrats only need a net gain of twenty three states that's not a lot\nOut what if we only when the Senate and picked up Senate seat so it's not the best case scenario and I'd like I'd rather when everything I like to win it off so let's fight like we want to win it all\nLooks like Heidi Heitkamp is pretty much suspended her campaign after outing of sexual assault victims were actually victims plural it might be hearing a little bit something about her tonight on hand and it was guessing it might be her\nEarly a prominent North Dakota politician caught on tape but project very posh and it will be shown exclusively on Hannity might gases that's Heidi Heitkamp just guess\nI don't know for sure you've seen the take Linda yes you maybe don't lie to the audience have you seen in St lender I got a preview no I'm vandals did you see this and other top Republicans has become the target of violence\nKevin McCarthy the house majority leader's office in Bakersfield Bakersfield is a peaceful town vandalized by two men actually I think they caught him on video they picked up a Boulder and throw it through his window\nUnbelievable does anyone know these two got bolder through his office window and ah this is the third Republican office now hit with vandalism and less than two months\nUnbelievable scary by the way on the other side of it let me just say this apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported in a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity and he has a lot of groups do love the show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\n... you know we we can settle out differences at the ballot box\nI've had my wins over the years and I've had my losses believe me wasn't fun to hear Fox News projects Brock Obama's going to be the forty fourth president of the United states not once but twice you know what you go out and then you fight the next day for the things you believe that\nIt just happens there's an episode of political science because I just hate to stop the momentum that we got\nA lot of Obama when you hear the economy's improving remember who started it and then goes on to mention himself what Ninety two times in thirty eight minutes that's a record\nEven for him\nAnd you imagine if the Republicans when everything what's gonna happen in the media I think they're not going to they're going to be able to contain themselves they're gonna lose it\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI don't know what\nJonathan Alter over at conspiracy TV MSNBC you can kiss democracy ... by of geo peak keeps Congress um where a Democratic Republic side note then you've got a the producer of the Ellen program one more and more ... in the U.S was worse than the entire migrant caravan\nI I you know the picking on the women is just got to stop what is a lovely person great first lady what do you know stop\nAnd for these things were done and set about Michelle Obama criticized a show about for the first time in my adult life I'm proud of what you mean for the first time in your adult life um oh by the way Cory Booker has a plan for to fight poverty\nAnd oh by the way Cory Booker has a plan for to fight poverty he wanted to give kids in low income areas lower income kids fifty thousand dollars in some cases [laughter] okay go out and earn a car you can give them all your money\nOn believable it looks like the vice president saying the illegal caravan is being finance he said the president of Honduras told him that that this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras and being financed by Venezuela\nYou know I Know that we're watching but as you know anywhere between seven uh fourteen thousand in growing\nIn this caravan Washington Examiner rightly points out there's been over five hundred and Twenty one thousand people apprehended at America's southern border and other ports of entry from October first twenty Seventeen\nThrough September thirtieth twenty Eighteen half of them over half a million people build the wall\nSat recorder is are reporting visa vague gate would a gateway pundit\nYou know that um apparently Guatemalan intelligence she says I've discovered people from India Bangladesh Africa also joined the caravan and I bumped into a number of MS Thirteen gang members\nJudicial watches Chris feral and Guatemalans secretary a strategic intelligence we're on the border with me\nSo you know we'll follow that report the president of Guatemala confirms according to CNN the caravan has been infiltrated by ISIS there's all day the fake news media does this CNN fake news by the way\nCNN is saying that ISIS reports some from ah the president of Guatemala no one has really mentioned this\nAnyway the report

but on the freeway when he was really not too bad ... do you bring trouble the fabric all afternoon here W a\nFormer speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is with us\nThey don't need silver didn't have a very good year in twenty sixteen but he had predicted both of Obama's victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast pollster in twenty uh sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the house\nEighty two percent chance that Republicans picked up seats in the Senate I don't have a feel on the house but I Do believe\nRepublicans could actually win Florida Tennessee\nMissouri Nevada Arizona for sure North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but they got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\nMothers for best right but I think eighty eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle and rose going ... um you know the most recent survey indicates that in fact\nYou have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually are within about two points on the generic ballot\nWell if if the contest districts now we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not spending much money and then we're not campaigning on them we're not making our case a but but in the swing seats that matter a we actually are basically tied the generic about\nAnd and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter ... two things happening you see this a little bit was Stacey Abrams or in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit he never do any good if you make a profit um\nAnd and she is just very left wing cinema the Democrat and in Arizona for the U.S Senate\nRefuses to apologize\nFor urging Americans ... saying it's okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban\nUm what's happened in Minnesota now where I think Keith Ellison may drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship a because she thought I was just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around\nAt these patterns and I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where\nThe ... billion for example\nWhen we were talking about ten days ago you and I were that this was a race between jobs and mobs well\nIf you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob and if you watch the Democrat\nI ask you can you know they had to stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out of there because it's important where fourteen days out of an election two weeks from today you'll be voting and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets\nOr and if we don't trust me it will be a lot of people willing to come\nWell I think I Know exactly what they're going to head to straight to California the sanctuary stayed and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as is offering to provide for them that's where I go\nWell and remember me we we shouldn't have to have a showdown about this there is no such thing as essential state to state you have to decide your state can in fact imposed on the federal government activities\nHave to decide to your state can in fact you imposed on the federal government activities which cannot possibly in post and at some point we're going to be collusion with centuries and centuries stage there's a fundamental violation of the constitution\nWell I think that this is I I Do agree with you um I have a pretty good feeling about the Senate I think that the way events and art and the debate has moved I think there's been a dramatic shift or certainly the cabinet case you\nKnow it's amazing to watch how the you know the other news channels of covering the president's speech last night or the president actually fake news seeing an actually says president wise tries to gin up division\nAnd they've never recovered what Maxine Waters has been saying\nThey've never recovered a single thing of saying you know create a crowd followed them in a grocery store and follow them in the department stores gas stations and you tell them then I Want to hear anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or secretary Nielsen of Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and now Mitch McConnell and Henry Kissinger and you know obviously\nThis is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or\nOr elaborate on any one issue or program they're offering\nThat will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they are running on\nNo no guys I well they do run on a government run health care for everybody which they can't defend which which when you examine that collapses because it's totally unsustainable financially and would be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing they've come to a big idea and it's a really bad idea\nI agree totally alright hum we'll be checking in regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by\nThis Georgia gubernatorial candidate that she burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWell I don't think that doesn't change the race for those the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registrations for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about the more trouble she gets to be\nAll right but I appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's get smart phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big time AJ Houston, Texas he was the star at the at the town hall I was in we had a wonderful time down in Texas I saw big time AJ I saw\nA Rick Perry I saw Ted Cruz and there was a Jay came up on stage with me and uh you know I I don't know why I had a different mental picture of view and I mean you have this big huge massive powerful voice and you know what you like the same size as me\n[laughter] how are you enjoyed meeting you big time what's going on maybe\nA baby boy I tell you I like I go there but I taught rally last night yeah I was like oh my gosh\nI'm like I said about that uh everybody though that may be mad at that time and I wound up going to a Trump rally whether it\nWas voted out this world it was unbelievable ... being there is on I Know you've been sort of you know I go but actually be in there just that\nThey show up on me I I ...\nI mean ... everybody was night everybody was beautiful I've got to buy a ...\nYou up on stage and everybody knew big time AJ from Houston everybody in the crowd went nuts it was like you know I don't want to start your running for office which by the way it may not be a bad idea at some point that you run\nOr not they are probably not me out the bucks but it's funny you say that they're trying to get into it but\nYeah I saw you signing autographs it and I said I [laughter] I think Clinton's signing autographs and then we brought Linda on the stage\nAnd she said I said Lyndon say New York I said I think New York and she goes to New York and I said said talk talk and say single poor single poor um that was pretty funny I was one of my mind is\nOh she was so glad to meet her off I filled out about it or is it it's all of which John\nI use it here on Sundays ... not as sweet as everyday [laughter]\nHey but at the guy who got when I told him were picked out\nThat they they don't want to hear this John ...\n[laughter]\nAll I Need is this you always have this optimism this love of life this enthusiast some\nYou know I don't know I'm hoping two weeks from now maybe I'm maybe my ex expectations are out of whack I'll deal with whatever the results are not a cry baby Weiner and like these liberals after they lost and plenty sixteen I sucked it up when Obama won two terms you know will survive whatever the country throws at us but\nWouldn't that be nice again to shock the world wouldn't that be nice to say that the Republicans not only are picking up houses in the seats in the Senate ... printing company we can do that but if we also prevent Nancy Pelosi\nBut we can do that but if we also prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker how sweet would that be how great would that be thinking of the feeling you'll have on election night if you spend the time you go out and your boat you do your job especially I put up on my website the top fifty races\nThat this is where the balance of power would tipping point ends up on Hannity dot com\nOh big time that you would say that what we're standing out there you get a date and stay on the big screen what we've answered the twenty sixth ... election and have the ... sorry media faces oh\nOh they're desperate someday Donald Trump liar Trump is fighting you know very victory all it's all over the fake\nNews CNN and conspiracy TV MSNBC I big time I got her on my friend I Love your audience loves you thank you so much for coming the other day I had a great time well you know we have four thousand people a moment in Texas and an air ... airport hangar it was amazing\nUm anyway thank you so much a Robin Gainesville in Florida next to important races down there on the census over Gillum God help Florida if you ever like Gillum your your business atmosphere will collapse in Florida and Rick Scott deserves to go to the U.S Senate he's been an amazing governor how are you what's going on Rob\nHey Sean thank you very much for taking the call I just wanted to say that uh [noise] you know the left I always like to paint the right as being a monsters for a\nA you know sympathizing with their poor the poor people that are coming from other countries that have horrific a\nOppression and those other countries and that very bad situations but we have the exact same stories for people who are on the list doing it legally with the exact same problems that I Do think it's a we should you know highlight those people's stories\nAnd you know get more exposure to those stories that are doing it the right way and say hey listen we draw the line everyone's got the same\nTragedies and where we will probably we will\nUm disrespect the people that are doing it the right way by just letting anyone come in\nYou know that's an ... you cannot allows them to do this\nThey're not going to be allowed to create a mob at the border and rush the border and violent and let me tell you something if we had the wall up it would be\nMore safe and more secure for both sides let me tell you what I don't ever want to have happened and I have no doubt that many of the people in the care of and they want a better life they're good people their government sucks there's no hope no opportunity and the government they get so much aid from from us a lot of these governments that we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt\nAnd it doesn't ever get to the people where we want it to get to but the reality is is we cannot allow we are a sovereign nation we have our country that has built on a constitution and the rule of law this is the law the land we have a process designed to taking people from other countries you got to first follow the law if you want to be in America that's it\nAnd and I know the Democrats are silent on the issue but most Americans agree that you know they would be precipitating a showdown crisis where people are gonna get hurt I don't want anybody on either side to get hurt nobody wants to do some people hurt out we don't know we can't vouch for every person in that crowd\nWe can't say that there are not people that are bad intentions that they want to bring into America\nMaybe it's just the tiniest ... percent of what if it's five people at a fourteen thousand we cannot risk that\nAnd by the way if we allow them to Russia or border bone rushed the border and get in and we were ... reward that behavior will the next one is going to be fifty thousand that was going to be a hundred thousand and then we'll have what Democrats love open borders and then they'll call for amnesty when they think they have no future generations of votes\nWe can't have it and it's got to be stopped at some point I urge Mexico to do the job now in turn these people around that's their job\nListen I Want to remind you off year elections are really about one thing and that's you turning out showing up\nNow

smart of them or to avoid the story the New York times ran the story um I Do well listen I can tell you a big lead with Monica ... found the audio\nOf um of\nAbrams mother talking about Stacy every bird the flag and I reached out to folks in the ... campaign to see if they knew it was legit and they had not heard the audio and they're like um we're not even going to touch those go elsewhere\nThere were like um when we're not even going to touch those go elsewhere\nAre so good for them for avoiding it uh it's it's a cheap shot I think and I'm happy to defend Stacey Abrams on this one here is my problem though when you take the totality of things I Want to play this audio for you again from the other day\n[noise]\n\nThat is ... organizers from Stacey Abrams campaign organizing a protest of her democratic opponent merely for being white\nSo you've got in the hearing now Stacey Abrams campaign\nWeaponized gene race forget Nineteen Ninety to forget burning the flag in the last year her campaign shouted down her political opponent merely for being white\nShe has flip flopped repeatedly on the issue of what to do about Stone Mountain and the monuments around the state the post civil war monuments\nThat speaks volumes to me with or without the flag burning that she's willing to use race as a political weapon the motto was Atlanta has always been the city too busy to hate\nThat the racial grievances that rocked or other places Birmingham Montgomery make in Valdosta savannah didn't happen in Atlanta\nBe we're very proud of it that they didn't happen and when and when it was too busy day we were also busy making money together it didn't matter\nBut there's been a growing class of politician in this city willing to weaponized the racial issue for political gain\nAnd when you take the totality of all these things together I think we see that Stacey Abrams is one of those politicians I don't have a problem with her burning the like I Do have a problem with her and her campaign seemingly being willing to use race as a way to divide people\nHave a real problem with that I have a real problem with her campaign staff organizing a protest of a candidate because they can and does his white can you imagine the media reaction if Brian Kemp organized a protest against a politician for being black\nWe would never hear the end of it and yet the entire media has been willing to give her a pass for people on her campaign staff doing this that she's turned a blind eye to she's kept them employed I've got a real problem with that\nAnd it just that pattern that I have a problem with the weaponized scene of race issues at a time the country's already divided and beat okay with that you actually do see Brian Kemp doing this\nYou see the Democrats doing this and then I think is a real problem that's what I have a problem with its too radical for Georgia now what's also radicals traffic we need to go check\nMarginally not radical cleric or at least right now by more to me but it had been up in Marietta already by north of vehicle going on over to happen to them out in a bar to lay out what what good are you\nGoing to be one of the biggest distraction if he still joke earlier about forty minutes to make that maybe forty five to go from I don't know what you're forty five minutes\nBefore trouble I think it would be five or Seventy eight thirty nine I gotta\nThank you very much let's go to the phones you Kim in peach street corners you are up first tonight welcome\nHi thanks for taking my call sure I'm\nJust wondering if you knew either a has anybody pointed out to stay shaver that show that's a good example of how a how national health care would look also has to do is look around Claremont at the gate medical center that just got one out of five star ratings\nUm I mean the system is just a microcosm of watch national health care would be an ... it's an absolute failure and I helped by and kept points out to her in the debates\nYeah you know it it it really is fascinating to me to hear Democrats say we need more government healthcare when the VA is the ultimate model in this country of government healthcare in it as an abject failure 'em to turn your back on the free market a is a little and listen\nNot to say the government doesn't have a role in in rural hill in rural Georgia where you'd there is no hospital anywhere around I think the government can play a role but it's absolute nonsense\nThe government can play a role but it's absolute nonsense to think that we need total government control of healthcare um the free market vastly outperformed the government on these issues are\n... there is no strong demand for Americans to rush to socialist healthcare countries and yet there is a huge demand in socialist healthcare countries for their citizens to come to this country for medicine\nMeans do weights in Canada and Great Britain for ... for gall bladder surgery for you name it are outrageous\nYou do not want more government healthcare in Georgia and that's what's Stacey Abrams wants\nThat's a bad thing she also wants to get rid of all the free market incentives governor deal has put into education and roll that back and\nLook at their school systems are already even with all those reforms still not as good as they could be and she wants to roll back all those reforms that's a real problem I Do not trust you and you know why I'm a conservative by the way\nThe reason I'm a conservative is because I Believe we're all sinners\nAnd I want us few centers in charge of me as possible\nAnd the more centers you have in charge the more you're going to have corruption and waste and fraud and abuse\nAnd government control is all of those things from the V. A. or elsewhere the free market works better and for Abrams to attack it in Georgia when we're trying as a state to be more competitive economically is a real problem voters to pay attention to\nThis evening news with Harry Gary\nUser militias factors have your federal five day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes don't you ask me [noise]\nWell us visa card games here to help you save more spend less than a void getting ripped off\n... real estate [noise] with the national economy doing that steadily better more and more people are buying brand\nName good in fact so much so that manufactures of brand name goods feel like hey people want our stuff we're gonna run those prices up\nProctor and gamble which make so many consumer products that you and I can choose from in stores is pushing through its second large increases so second largest series of increases if you will on a variety of consumer products\nAnd I want you to know there has never been a time that I can recall\nBetter for you to look at the store brands instead of these brand name a lot of people bought store brands during the recession and the years following when the economy was so sluggish\nAnd now you may have gone back to the old ways of buying brand names but you know from buying those store brands how good they are\nAnd you're not doing yourself any favor by spending money particularly with these manufacturers of brand name goods running the prices up all you're doing is getting less value for every hard earned dollar that you're spending\nSo think about that look at the store brands look at the price difference between the brand names in the store brands and save your money\nMarket lock our and every ... every thirty minutes during it this morning when you asked me [noise]\nMy forty nine ... guy guy but I Want to go to the capital are definitely doubting and thank God I never did find it dumbed down all of them are playing football and I don't want anyone from doing a lot more on the other thing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "23"}
