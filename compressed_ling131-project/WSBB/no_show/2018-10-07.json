show itself we have our lightning round every week where I answer questions that have been sit ins to use that resource again it's my life is more dot com\nAnd while you're on there you can listen to past shows we've done we have a massive extensive list of blogs about a number of different topics\nUm and you can also sign up for something I Love talking about this because so many folks\nYou might listen right now to the radio but you're not listening all day to the radio every day we do a a one minute updates Monday through friday it goes out on WSBIU it goes I don't know the point five and a Ninety seven when the rivers are all these stations carry it but what if you're not listening to those stations if you want that up to it's a one minute\nKind of what's going on in the world what's the top news that matters to you to your wallet for you to make progress\nUh we send that out as an email every day as well and you can sign up for that email updates on the website so again even if you're not listening to the radio you can get that up to date daily presence of what matters here to your life and your finances again is that my life is more dot com alright\nLet's jump into day so it was a rough in to the week for your four one K. now you might not be the kind of person\nThat checks this stuff all the time but if you had any sort of ear to the ground listening to financial news headlines or if you happen to pull up that four one K. or IRA you noticed probably there was a drop in your account\nAnd the reason for that is is somewhat complex we're gonna talk about it in a second but here's the deal when you see a drop in your account that immediately correlates for most of us to a bad thing happening right\nWhen something drops we go something bad is going on right something is a bad signal in the market I should be worried something bad is happening here and that's understandable but but here's the deal and I want to drill this sense a great opportunity to do it the market is not good or bad\nOkay going to say it again the market is not good or bad it's just\nIs not good or bad it's just up or down in either one of those could be good for you up or down based on how you respond please hear this success in the market over time means getting away from the mindset that a drop in the markets a bad thing\nAnd it means getting away from the mindset that the market going up is a great wonderful thing\nEither of those could be good for you based on what you do and we know this because you can look back historically many people that I work with that are doing really well today and have a whole lot of money today and feel confident about their retirements\nMade that money in the great recession because of how they responded to a dropping market a market that was going down\nBut that wasn't a bad thing for them why because they chose to stay in it they chose to buy the decisions they made\nOne for them and think about this that was the best thing that's ever happened to them financially so how can a dropping market be a great thing based on how you respond\nAnd it's subjective it can be terrible for one person in a wonderful for another person if you're if it's a year you retire if two thousand eight is the year you retire\nAnd you see the market dropped tremendously it could be a terrible thing\nBut it's not because the market dropped because it's because you weren't ready for that you haven't made decisions to prepare for it\nYou didn't respond well maybe you got out and you lost a lot of money when you got out\nThere's all sorts of factors beyond just the fact that the market was up or down so it's overly simplistic\nAnd honestly it hurts you to think about it as all the market's up that's great the markets down that's bad no your response to it down market could be a wonderful thing for you it could make your money over time they can secure a down ... down markets secure your retirement if you treat it in the right way\nRight an up market can be terrible for you if you get complacent and you put too much money into a equities into stocks cause you think everything's going to be find the world's gonna be great the market is up I'm fine and then it crashes that up market might have destroyed you\nBut again it's not because it's actually up or down it's because of the choices you made so here's the deal you need to take responsibility you need to be educated because it's really not your success is really not about whether the market went down last week or goes up next week it's about the way that you respond to it\nThat is the key\nSo let's look for a minute what happened this last week very briefly on Thursday and friday the market dropped\nStrongly and the reason for that was because we saw bond yields the U.S treasury yields shoot up and bonds overall the yield shoot up the reason for that is because the cost of bonds\nWas dropping and the cost of bonds was dropping because people are selling them and they're selling them because they think interest rates are going to be going up and wire interest rates are going to be going up because the economy looks so darn strong here is the deal\nIn the end you're four one K. dropped last week because the economy look so good and we don't need to dig into the weeds of all that but isn't that counter intuitive\nYou'd look at the market and see it's dropping ... must be wrong what is dropping because it looks so good the economy overall look so good that's not a bad thing okay but it has that impact on the market so it's not about just oh it's good or it's bad it's about how\nYou and I respond to that and that's counter intuitive that goes against the way we tend to think so I Want to give you a few quick examples of this and why I think this honestly could it could change the way you think about investing if you begin making decisions\nAgain based on not the market being good or bad but responding to it being up or down taking advantage having a plan that says I'm going to win regardless of whether the market is up or down and I don't mean by that having some sort of risk free\nInsurance product that says you wear and even if things go down I don't mean that\nI don't mean shortening the market and buying funds\nAre but the hope that the market drop so that you when that that is not what I'm Talking about those are strategies people use but that's not something you need to get into\nLike we talked about last week what if it is in October is just a bad month\nThe boogie man's coming for my investments in essence Rikers it's just bad\nAnd here we go everything's going down if that's the cycle you're living in that anxiety will never give you success overtime success comes from\nCreating a plan that's outside of your emotion that's outside of how your guts feels about the market that says we can succeed no matter what the market does if it goes up we're going to win if it goes down we're ready to win as well ready to capture growth\nThat is what you need to be successful I'd done that with hundreds of clients are team does that every single day it is such a freeing thing to get off that treadmill of anxiety and market timing and up is good and down as bad just leave that thing behind your friends would wander one world happened\nWhy do you have such peace\nBecause we're going to build a plan that wins regardless if you don't know how to do that please take a moment go to my website it's my life\nThat please take a moment go to my website it's my life is more dot com get to know is there ask questions read stuff we've written listen to past shows and then when you feel comfortable sign up for a free consultation with me Chris Burns\nWith another expert from my team so that you can feel this level of confidence again it's my life is more dot com but do not live focused on what the market's going to do tomorrow\nOr how good or bad it is when it goes up or down is just not the right path art in a little bit we're going to answer those questions you've sent and throughout the week but first\nUnemployment is at its lowest level in fifty years since Nineteen sixty nine okay why does this matter to you and me and some of you when you hear this and you go over and talk about unemployment it's just like well I'm unemployed\nI mean I Am so why does that matter great I'm happy there is not a lot of people unemployed that's wonderful what does that matter to me it matters a lot to you now some of you listening are unemployed right now\nOr you're interested in picking up an extra side hustle\nWriter or there's different people in all different circumstances so this matters to people across the board but it matters to you especially if you're sitting at a job right now you're gainfully employed you've been there for a while I Want to talk about why it matters first of all it's it's a pretty remarkable time okay wages are starting to go up now we've when wondering about this\nBecause men are unemployment has been dropping for a while you expect the economists expect that when unemployment drops we have what's called a tight labor market\nThat it's going to drive wages up right because it's your ... skilled people are more in demand and we just haven't seen that and honestly most economists don't really know why we haven't seen that\nI'm Janet Yellen when she was chairwoman of the Federal Reserve\nActually came out and said that we really don't understand why unemployment is so low and wages aren't rising okay\nUm it was kind of an anomaly but we're starting to slowly see wages creep up and that's actually been pushed along recently Amazon just came out you know we talked about this before\nAnd announced that they are raising the minimum wage for all of their us employees the Fifteen dollars an hour this is pushing groups like target and Walmart and Costco to match that and so we're seeing I'm certainly hourly wages increasing because of that will be interesting to see the impact of that over time that just happened\nSo obviously for the person listening right now that is sitting making less than that I had a client come in who works at another company is similar to a target\nUm that's making a few dollars an hour less than this and this was really hopeful for her and her husband works fulltime she is working part time but for her it's an opportunity to go I can probably continue working part time but either change companies are my company's gonna have to respond to this and get more dollars and so for those of you\nThat may not be the primary breadwinner for your household but you work part time and you're working you're making less than Fifteen dollars an hour there's some hope here\nAnd there was a change in the industry happening okay but here's the deal if if you're someone who is working at a larger company you're making more money than that there have been a slow increase in wages but if you're hoping that low unemployment is going to suddenly drive your wage up significantly in your current position\nYou're probably misleading yourself here\nOkay there is some growth in more skilled position of wages there is some increase\nBut we all know this even in job markets that are like this one okay but in general once you get into a position you kind of trudging along and you make that three percent growth hopefully sometimes during the financial crisis that was two percent of one percent or no growth and your salary\nOkay but you just get kind of cost of living increases rarely are you ever going to see a significant jump in your income once you're inside a specific job unless you move within the company to a higher position that's option one so you move up the ranks inside of a company or\nYou move to different company and it's kind of a unique thing about the job market today my grandparents when they were hunting for jobs when they graduate from school years and years ago\nThey really planned on being in one place in one career for decades and that was not abnormal back then but today that's totally via an anomaly right and most people\nAre changing jobs pretty regularly and one of the main reasons for that is that's one of the primary tools for increasing your salary significantly 'cause you're not going to get that when he stayed at the same company normally\nSo here's the key with this okay not only is unemployment at the lowest point it's been ... for many of us since we've been working okay um we also see a record level of job openings right now\nThey're truly is a demand right now for skilled employees that's really hard for companies to fill in what does that mean for you my friend it means opportunity okay if you have been sitting at a company for a while earning about the same amount of money\nThere is probably there is a good chance that if it ever there was a time that you could find that competitive position with another company and see that pain\nAnd that you could find a competitive position with another company\nAnd see that paid bump will now is that time okay so that unemployment level being low should equal in your mind there's an opportunity here and that's not for everybody but for a lot of you right now if you're not exploring if you haven't been watching trends here it might be time to check it out it might be time to dust off the resume\nBecause in terms of getting of having opportunity now is the time that companies are looking and it won't always be this way we're going to talk about this in a few minutes but this will change so don't miss this opportunity okay but this expands even farther one of the main fears that I hear from clients and from friends in the business world\nIs I'm worried I'm going to age out of this position and I've seen this happen with clients or they've been working in the same company for a while or and they're getting close to retirement they're not ready to retire yet but the company starts finding ways to suddenly pushed them towards retirement I was talking candidly with a friend recently he's younger\nI use in his forties but he said on the number one thing I'm concerned about is that won't be able to work as long as I Need to and he didn't mean physically be able to work he met he wouldn't find a company that would be able to continue paying him as long as he thought he would need to work to retire\nSomeone you have that fear you know you need to work till you're Seventy perhaps to be okay to retire will and you're worried your company is not going to be on board for that\nOkay well this same tight labor market right now that benefits you as well\nBecause if you're getting on in years you're close to retirement but you want to work a few more years\nThat means your company is looking for an desiring the skills that you have so I Would say it's a it's a window of time\nWhere there really is a desire for that skill and it might allow you to work a little longer or without that fear of whether there's an apple labor labor force are going to bring in somebody else because they need the skills you bring it also means you might be able to negotiate maybe you're the place close to retirement\nYou want to continue working on some level but you don't want to work as you're working right now maybe you're exhausted\nOkay because companies are looking for skilled people and you have that skill you have those decades of experience market that\nTalk to your company talked to other companies in your field\nMaybe you could consult part time and still make a really great hourly wage for that are all the amount for that but work less maybe you could pull back but still earn some extra money\nThat will benefit your retirement and the major way the point is this you are in demand right now if you have experience so whether you're a person that says I Need to bump my salary so I'm going to start marketing my experience because companies are looking for someone or whether you're someone who says I'm older but I still want to continue working in some capacity at some level\nAnd these companies could really benefit from what I bring to the table market that now is an opportunity to do that and again as well talk about in a minute it's not always going to be that way so now is a great time to do this\nNow if you hear me talking about that and you go\nI don't even really know maybe you're in your sixties right now you're sixty three sixty four and you go I don't know when I Want to retire I don't know how long I Need to keep working fulltime I'd like to pull back\nI'd love to do more of a consulting thing maybe work a little bit less but I just I'm not sure well that's normal but that's what I Do with people every day so if you're looking for a resource to sit down and go I Would love to actually have a clear plan about how long I Need to work\nShould only be finding a new job should I be looking to continue on with this company as long as I can or cannot start pulling back what would that look like\nIt's such a difference maker when you have a plan for that when you have actual data supporting him when you can look at an income plan and say if I can work two more years I think we're going to be okay or maybe I Need to work longer maybe I can stop before I thought I could write there's\nThere's so much peace with that plan if you're looking for that and you don't have it\nJump on my website it's my life is more dot com that's what my team and I do eat coach people we help them make a plan for clarity here for for peace about the retirement they want to have the dreams they have for the future again\nAnd when the overall environment is one of plenty we say yeah let's go spend that extra dollars extra dollars even if nothing's actually change about our situations that listen please hear this I'm not about to tell you so therefore what you should be doing is living under this incredibly tight restrictive terrible environment right now that is not what I'm saying in fact\nIf you listen to the last show we did I talked about the importance of having what I call an opportunity sun and opportunity fund or something that is literally a guilt free spending account okay it's a ... it's so important in my mind for for you to have a long term success\nWith financial planning that you not said every dollar that you not be so restrictive at the world is miserable I'm never forget the client that came in he and his wife were sitting there they were in a great place for retirement I showed them how great it was I showed them how their income was going to be fine\nAnd she turned to him and said well can we finally go out to eat every once in a while\nAnd on the one hand that very a very conservative personality thrifty personality had gotten into a place where they were okay on the other hand it clearly went over the top sometimes we're even if they have the funds she never felt the freedom to spend them so it's important that you have what I call in operates\nSo it's important that you have what I call an opportunity fund to to actually make saving for fun things part of your plan and if you've never heard anything like that before\nThat that is so critical it is it's just like Benge dieting let me say well I'm never going to eat a desert again yeah okay well how long is that going to work for you brother so you gotta have balance and you got to have fun built into your plan but often we go to the extreme\nAnd often when things are good we don't sit and how can we store aside and there's two facets to this one is actually making the decision to say OK so one is is the thing I think you're already thinking about which is me saying hey maybe you need to make sure you are putting some stuff aside\nThat you're putting enough aside we're talking about that the second is saving in a smart way is not just putting dollars away it's putting dollars away in an intelligent way this is probably the area I see people struggle with the most\nA lot of people understand they should be saving a lot of people do have a good amount of money but very few people save it intelligently and I don't mean they're not intelligent I mean they don't have a strategy a plan to say every dollar is put in an intentional way so that if and when things turn around\nAnd the economy is not killing it\nAnd maybe you lose your job or you have a health issue that you've said intelligently and you can respond in the best way possible that you're ready for that so we're going to talk about that if you're just joining us this is Chris Burns you're listening to more than money and we're talking about the economy is so strong right now\nUntil it isn't right until the time comes when this turns around how do you make sure you're in a position that when the economy turns around and things aren't so great that you're still doing well that is very doable we're going to talk about how to do it in a smart way OK so first of all [noise]\nArgue saving I had a a a client in recently and he and his wife are sitting there and they were good savers but they asked a question that that I hear from a lot of people\nAnd it was we just don't know if we're doing enough\nLike yes we're saving both of us they both worked fulltime both of us are putting money into four one K. is both of us are are you know we have a we have money in the bank for if something were to happen like we've got fun sitting out and we're funding all these things but we have no clue if we're saving enough\nWe have no clue for doing the kind of saving we need to be doing most people feel that way that's been my experience most people feel like I'm putting money aside it but I have no idea that the right amount of money for me to be okay and this is we're planning is so important okay ... planning is different than just investing\nA there's a misconception out there I told this couple this I said they were working with a financial advisor right now and I said well have you done like an income plan with this financial advisor have you actually looked at were this is all going to take you over time they said no\nThey said he they just to help us figure out what what what mutual funds to be in like they helped us investing and said that is investing advice that is not financial planning and there's a misconception that that's the same thing\nOkay helping you know where to invest is a critical part it's a piece of financial planning its investment a wisdom is great but\nIt doesn't tell you if you're saving enough\nIt doesn't factor in what is it actually look like for us over time to have the kind of life we want to have\nThat is critical because we don't want to throw money out and say we're saving we're saving or saving we want to know are we actually hitting the target here I told the story of so I said it's all the time that people are one of the things I remember from my past are growing up as he would always say\nHey look you don't just take a bow and arrow and shoot it and then draw a target around wherever it hits that's not particularly helpful because you don't know where you're going to land than\nThe goal is to have a target and then once you have a target you can tell if you're actually aiming for that correctly direction making progress towards it with friends you have to have a career target\nFor us to define for you have or we actually making progress argue saving enough and that's what planning helps you do as you're able to sit down and go okay we know we're going towards that\nThat is the thing that we want and once we defined that then we can say are we making the right progress needed you need to increase the savings are doing or\nOr you already said in plenty for that right but now you can answer confidently in so many people are walking around not feeling confident because they have no idea what their target is and if they're making progress towards it\nSo they're just going yeah I mean we're saving worth putting money in but but I Hope it's going to be OK do that for decades like that\nLet's pause here if you're living like that right now if you go we're doing everything they can you know we're putting everything side that we can and and it's not perfect but I just always worry that it's not going to be okay we can solve that\nWe can stop the worry there you don't have to live like that come in sit down and walk through a financial planning process with us and you will walk out feeling confidence about where you're at and if you're ...\nAnd you will walk out feeling confidence about where you're at and if you're making progress it's an incredible shift in your quality of life\nBecause it defines for you are we going towards this goal are we going to reach it\nIf you want to do that job I'm a website it's my life is more dot com you can sign up for a free consultation with a member of my team to actually set that target and defined where you're at in that process and give you a feeling of peace and confidence and not only that none of them to tell you where you're at it releases you to enjoy your money\nBecause it tells you hey if you're saving this much then you can put money in an opportunity fun you can go on vacation you can do have a nice dinner you can give to that thing you care about because it's a set defined target and you're doing what you need to reach it\nIt doesn't have to be that every single dollar is holy cow I guess we better save it just in case because now you know if you're doing what you need again it's my life is more dot com for that free consultation to do something maybe you've never done before it actually make a plan and actually feel confident about where you're going\nOkay so the first step is argue saving enough and the only way to know that\nIs again to define that to create that plan to define where you're going but the second step is now making those savings intelligent and this is where I see there's lots of people that are saving enough they might not know it but they're saving enough but there's very few people that are saving intelligently\nAnd I again I don't mean that was a knock on them I mean that there's very strategically thinking about where those dollars go and here's why because in our culture there is such a strong push for the four one K. and that's understandable it's needed\nI'm actually not an anti four one K. person I think for one case are amazing but you've got to understand what they are and how they work\nSo you can save intelligently because we're in a very strong economy right now but that could change it will change\nAnd when it does where are you at risk if you're sitting right now and every extra dollar of saving your savings you're accomplishing point a which is putting money aside right but all those dollars are going into your four one K. and you're forty years old or forty five or fifty right now\nIn something happens and you lose your job how accessible is that four one K. how easily can you get that money if you have a crisis I've told this story before but I've had clients come in before with a very strong four one K. and tens of thousands of dollars in consumer debt because\nThey hit crisis in their life\nAnd they had no liquid funds accessible so here is what I Want you to remember if nothing else if you want to be ready for the economy turning around which you need is layers of liquidity okay here this again layers of liquidity\nYou need to know a strong financial plan a financial plan that is built to handle the economy turning around the market dropping um you losing your job you having an unexpected sickness somebody dying in the family these all these things that could happen and nobody wants to talk about\nBut if you want to your piece about those things and truly build a financial reality that's able to handle those you have to have layers of liquidity so let me ask you right now\nDo you have that\nIn your plan if you go I don't quite know what you mean let me describe that do you have the ability right now to access a large amount of money if you need it with no penalties no questions asked you can get right to the money to solve an issue that comes up do you have that\nIf you don't and by the way most people don't you can keep\nAgain you've heard me talk about flexibility I Love retaining flexibility\nMost likely it's better to keep the money in the four fifty seven so you can pull dollars from it without that ten percent penalty\nInstead of locking it up and an IRA but that's certainly dependent on the rest of your situation because that's all the time we have to thank you so much for listening and if you have any questions or if you want to sit down for a free consultation just go to my website it's my life is more dot com\nYou can ask anything sign up for that consultation\nListen to past shows again it's a resource\nMy life is more dot com hey this is Chris Burns you've been listening to more than money employees remember your life\nAnd your future are so much more than money and we'll see you next

I've had that I Want to say it would be by used to teach before that I've done so much but there's still so much more work to do and I wanted to put that all in one place you know Twitter is normally\nHave these conversations but that doesn't always allow us to tell a pollster and actually listen to this term in a that was titled don't tell your story too soon and I remember being like that they really do title but what does that mean and what he said is that sometimes you can tell your story so soon all you see the pain not the purpose and I got to a point where it was like actually understood the purpose behind I'm\nLike so many of the things I've been through and I wanted to share their stories I write about what it was like to be in the room with President Obama went to mean to to be in some of those meetings what was the behind the scenes of being in the street or my mother left when I was three came back when I was thirty like what does it mean to shop as a whole person in the species every day so I wanted to share those in a set of essays\nHow easy it was it for you to do\nHow easy it was it for you to do\nA you know writing is hard if anybody is ever going to write a book and it's hard uh it was a lot of work but some of the stories I felt like I've been writing for five years six years and some story there was just about putting pen to paper thought I'd make about my mother is asking a lot I just hadn't written about it so that was sort of interesting to find the words to put on paper\nYou know I talk about the protests all the time so that was hard because I had to choose the stories to tell you know I was in jail in Baton Rouge for Seventeen hours there was a long\nTime I didn't plan to get arrested it ... it made a lot of news I've been ... by five officers in two states and you have gotten death threats and the first person ever permanently banned from Twitter was banned for trying to raise money to give me killed two they're all of those things and it's like picking and choosing which are the stories can I town in a way that will make sense\nIf taught\nAnd really emerged as as an activist when did you know that that what you're calling you\nKnow the first uh my friend got killed in August and I I went to St Louis on August sixteenth to Ferguson and the second out in St Louis is the first night that I was tear gas and that was\nA I'll never forget that because it was like\nThis should never happen to anybody we shouldn't live in a while and like that's not real what I learned there were so many things and there's a whole chapter in the book a chapter three about the police there's so many things that I didn't know then that I Know now Rey so we know that a third of all the people killed by strangers killed\nBy police officer we know that a woman a loving God homicides in California is actually committed by an officer there just so many things\nThat I didn't know and I've been obsessed with the with the behind the scenes or what the kind of mass incarceration become math I put you on the spot\nIs it tell me something you could buy for three hundred dollars\nLast night in a phone not as you by phone for three hundred dollars I wouldn't be an iPhone\nAnd we wouldn't be on but you might find so in Florida to this day that's over three hundred dollars is a felony and when you become a falling you permanently we as a right to vote in Florida\nAnd I say that because if I asked you like what is a felony most people are like murder there like a bunch of building but it's like imagine stealing a heating a TV as an Eighteen year old and permanently these in the right to vote so this isn't to say that that does okay this is to say that like the way we thought about consequences and punishment is just off\nAnd that's how mass incarceration becomes math some obsessed with other things in my book I talk about things that goes along California that are there any investigation of an off to the last more than a year can never read on discipline regardless of the outcome\nThat just as you can love the policemen that don't make sense right so how do we start to to give public conversation and public light to these issues\nSo let me ask you this because there have been so many\nIssues with respect to race and police in the news in recent weeks I'm thinking back to\nThe funeral services for the queen of soul Aretha Franklin and the Reverend Jasper Williams who is from Atlanta was invited by the family to do the eulogy and in the aftermath of the eulogy he's been nothing but criticized because he talked about single moms not being able to raise young black men\nAnd he also talked about you know black lives ... don't matter he said until we stop killing each other in our communities and I was interested in your thoughts on that\n[noise] yeah so you know I'm mindful that the things that he spoke about are the result of systemic failures so what does it mean you you think about the wealth gap right into by twenty four degree it's protected that the media muscle black people are going to be zero dollars which is wild the media wants her black people white people at the same town will be over a hundred thousand\nAnd the question is like well how did how do you why people gain wealth right like ... where the white wealth come from and it's not like all white people just worked really hard it's not like that just didn't happen what will happen is is that\nAnd I think I Hope somebody who's figured out how to talk about how in a way that also makes sense to\nMe the ... election was a rebuke of the Obama presidency\n[noise] you know\nIn some ways yes but I'm also mindful of the ways that voter suppression just works in the country right so the Trump didn't win the popular like more people did not vote for Trump to that is true right though like we won the popular vote\nBut the way we've set up the system either one based on like equity or just that you think about the voting rights act getting gutted right there like this election came on the heels of all these protections around equity injustice and race being stripped away so I think some of it was definitely like a\nThere's a set of America that it's like we're tired of all this talk about race injustice and the police and they were like making their voices heard\n'em but part of this too is that you know the the right words for decades to build an infrastructure that will weaken voting you think about Wisconsin people talking about low voter turnout with confidence like well yeah they've gerrymander the entire state so it's not like people didn't want to vote that they couldn't really you think about in your you think about in Georgia I read\nThat like if not for the random reporter who wrote about closing those polling places like none of us would have ever known to think about all of that that's happening across the country that like\nA broadcaster doesn't know about and a reporter doesn't know about it and nobody treated their boat and not to experience the\nWe just had polling some of the first polling going into the midterm elections right after Labor Day anti here the different analysts discuss what's going on state by state by and large the conservative analyst will argue that\nThe Democrats always pull higher in ... right at right around Labor Day because all the people who really vote go away on vacation for the Labor Day holiday and therefore they are not\nOh go away on vacation for the Labor Day holiday and therefore they are not at home to answer their phones and so it looks like a candidate like Stacey Abrams here in Georgia or the Democratic candidates who are running for statewide office or national office in their communities are looking really strong against their Republican counterparts and yet\nThe thought processes and maybe this is the the the\nVoter suppression that you discuss it still ends up you know fifty two forty eight after November yeah I think that what\nWe've seen with a set of races you think about ... by on a press in Boston you think about Gillum in Florida and you think about the the here in Georgia\nIs that conventional wisdom would have said you can't do it at all you don't have the money you don't have the infrastructure the polls on on your side\nAnd what we know to be with these four races have helped us the is that\nWe don't need those old tools to ... to us or us into a New America right that like we can walk into a new version of this America with the things that we know are true with their vision with the connection with the people and what the plan\nAnd when you think about Stacy there is a vision that connection with the people and there's a plan and we've seen that mobilized people all across the state with eye on them with all kinds of ... what does she has she had a vision that connection with the people in a plane you know as soon as\nI said you know some people criticize you for being a part of the party like why didn't you runs independent that enough or like do you have a good relationship with the party leadership is she said to re\nWhen I knock on doors I'm reminded I have a perfect relationship with the party because the party at all those people's doors are not doing the party is not somebody sitting in Washington the party as a single mother the party as a person working two jobs the party of the person who believes injustice and I think that will we see with Stacy I on Gillum and\nAll kinds of protests that they understand that as long as the people running for office have a deep relationship with the heart of the party there'll be good so I'm not worried about the polls she got this far I think it's just about taking home now\nWhat are you to be doing what you've done traveling the country talking about this book\nSo we still do so much work around uh the untold story about police filing so\nYou think about things like you know we're as more people for weeds and all violent crimes combined which is sort of wild right so we do a lot of studies to help activist and organize all around the country think about like how do you take down the system from within so in the book there's a lot of the data that we've done we're doing some other projects that we have been publicly announcing that the battle there'll be continuing\nUm and then trying to amplify the voice of other people so even at the book tour stop\nAt tonight there'll be a local activists to talk about some of their work so that we can make sure that as we go across the country we're trying to build the biggest choir as possible\nYou're just so impressive I might get a loss for words this is just so this is just so good so much work to do for a keeping it stopped in the best I take it or is that you're still just kind of\nOne best one but I've been wearing the same vestments to protest and twenty fourteen the best uh you know we were in the street for four hundred days and I see them because if you've ever signed marching it wasn't that we are watching was cool it was illegal to do in August September October twenty four teams if we used to tell her more than ... seconds we were arrested\nWho either she for a long time when it got cold I needed something I could wear that I Would never have to pack\nAnd the best became that the reason I still where it is because it reminds me that to happen trait that I can be an enough interesting faces I can do you really do interviews like this and be with a really great people like you\nAnd I and I can get far away from that time that we were like sleeping on the side of the road and do some things I never want to forget that that was real because that reminds me every single day how fragile freedom is\nAnd so few people recognize that don't that\nSo few people to and they were you know like the reason why it's called the case or hope is that you know when we say the system is broken and people say no it's it's working exactly like it was designed\nMy take away from that day was designed by somebody made this up and because people made it up we can make some of the different and they can rewrite the tax code in the back of scrap paper napkins we can actually do all this stuff in a generation so don't let people tell you got to wait\nTo generate or like I said in the foundation for the next three hundred years from when no I'm planning to win in this lifetime and like we can do it for the question for me it's like how do we build power into story that allow us to win in this lifetime\nAnd how do you fight back against folks who don't take you and people your age seriously\nYeah you know I'm looking for a partner's not parents right and I'm looking for ... years and our parents and they are a lot of people in the space um who still think about the world and Mike one sort of way that like the older you are means ... and let me just tell you I've been a lot of rooms and\nThat's not true and the other you know I think about when I Would if every day and I were in the White House and people like how dare you not where students like if you did make me smarter right like sound like I like ... feet on today\nIt's a gorgeous committed to the working with these with is welcoming is that there are a lot of space to cross the country where people are like ready to do the work was true about the protests in St Louis and the protests and many cities is that\nIt was a range of ages that came out and said like let's do it right some interested in that and I'm and I'm less interested today in trying to\nConvert the non believers I'm more interested in creating space so that people believe but don't yet feel invited so like how do I like\nBelieve but don't yet feel invited to like how do I like you know you want to do work done on what to do like I'm ready to like take you in and like try and build the biggest tent or to be able to you in the right place you can do work wherever you are\nI did I think we actually spent too much time trying to figure out what to do with the people who don't want to do anything and I think that they actually way more of us who want to do something and just don't know what to do how do people connect with you\nSo do you go to ... dot com to buy the book or to to be at a tour stop 'em and it's just during DARE while Twitter and most especially yeah All right [noise]\nPerspective as a half hour we produce in mind\nIf there's something you think we ought to be talking about let\nMean by

S. B. radios Belinda Skelton he was a patient a doctorate Ambrose eggs and Belinda\nHas been treated with stem cell therapy to treat her lupus Belinda you were telling us earlier prior to the stem cell therapy treatment which has worked wonders you said you were on the traditional route where you were continuously getting steroid shots is that what you're saying yes\nYes and what uh cortisone shots\nAnd what was the impact than the impact that with having on on you how's that working for you obviously it wasn't\n... well it was it was temporary and that was the problem it was a it was a temporary fix and you know you steroids are not good for your body um and you can't do that a long term and I knew that this was not going to be a long term checks and I was scared\nUm that I couldn't keep continuing this ah for the rest of my life and it seemed like that\nThat time that it helped got shorter and shorter in between each shot and um I knew that this wasn't my answer and then um you know it was such a blessing\nAnd then um you know it was such a blessing when I came in contact with ... and stem cell therapy and I was talking to my mother and she has several a disability problems and she um she was listening to my show or\nThe other day and her doctor and brothers it on there and thought that he could help her and she literally was in tears\nWhen I told her that there was probably help out there for her because she's lived with chronic pain herself\nWith MS and ... says and other disabilities where she is just almost and ... and ... thinking about her being able to get a piece of her life back and be able to enjoy her family a little better I mean she was she was sobbing on the phone\nIt sounds like Dr if there's somebody else is going to be coming to see you\nToo yeah I Hope so I we were talking about that earlier today and I I Love I Would love to help her mom billing this woman in any other family members or people of anybody we see cars\nAnd it's funny that's probably the most powerful advertising and a half my patients and when they feel well and they started feeling the effects of the stem cells they they tell their brothers and sisters they tell their parents who told her grandparents they tell their friends and then\nYou get a whole slew of people coming in from one person that does have a great experience and then the the rest of the family gets to join in on the phone to the [laughter]\nThey all start feeling so it's it's a wonderful inhaling a it is just a like I said the most amazing a fantastic treatment I've ever come across some just very blessed to be able to offer it to people\nAnd but one of the benefits of the treatment for you of been wide ranging but something as simple as being able to rest comfortably through the night\nHe has to sleep during the night and to just to just hang out on the sofa with my family and watch TV\nI'm was you know it wasn't last fall because that would have to constantly change positions because just hit her and then I have to switch to the other side and then that was that was short lived because that side hurt and that was back and forth and you know ... ...\nThe chronic pain just great to on your nerves and then you start to get a little irritable and then you tend to take that are out on those around you so it just\nIt just snowballs um when you have chronic pain and um it's just it just life changing when it's no longer there\nAnd that can be difficult for a parent with two very active teenage boy is very\nActive teenage boys that while you active in their lives and and I walk nothing more than to be active in their everyday lives\nAnd it and it is so sad when people suffer from chronic pain I've I've seen many patients that come to my office and they've been having pain day after day after day for many weeks months even years\nAnd then they get depressed after a while you know they just waking up every morning knowing that you're going to be hurting all day and suffering from pain and there's really no hope\nUm you know a lot of my patients have been debating pain doctors or they've had pain prescriptions for narcotic bills which and that's a whole other problem\nA right and other things that can be dangerous for your body and then or steroid shots are at the journal shots or the other types of forms of shots and pain shots that are always a temporary fix they never get better so\nUm you know I've even had people that are so depressing that come see me they said if Dr it get this treatment doesn't help me I'm going to kill myself no no you don't want to hear that and I've heard it more than once but thank God I'm you know I've never had that experience where this didn't help someone so\nIt's it's yeah yeah I just love to be able to I Wish we could more people knew about this option because it's really um it's really life changing for people\nThat go down and said that getting those steroid injections it was a temporary fix and the more frequently it happened the more frequently the patient she had to get them is that typically the case that may be the more you do it the more you need it\nWell and the problem with the steroid shot I haven't given one for Fifteen Years and the reason for that is that they're they're actually very damaging to our bodies um you know they were most of the time after you've had a truck you know I've had a few people say they worked first few months or longer but the majority of people told me they don't work very very long\nBut the the real problem lies and that the steroids cause all kinds of problems were part about even not even just local problems but even through your whole body ... uh if you get a shot and your knee or your shoulder\nUm it can tear down or wherever and your body can tear down\nThe tissue that's there so it can cause the muscles to tear the the ... the ligaments to tear and be weakened damaged um and actually can cause the bones to have osteoporosis and fracture we can get broken bones from these shots the other thing is that um the shots do get into your general system and so they can uh\nUm the shots do get into your general system and so they can if if you have diabetes that can make your sugars way out of control and make them go through the roof\nAnd I've even seen people that have never had diabetes before develop it after getting a steroid shots fired from you know they they affect something called the adrenal glands which was one our kidneys as well and so that's a you know there's all kinds of problems these shots do for people and then I have one every time I Do a talker or speak to someone ... shots\nAnd almost every single person has some ... and ... and not only do they get one but they get one every month every three six nine months for years and is it's it's sad 'cause I just know that these shots are not doing any good they're they're actually damaging these people\nThen Belinda had that been your experience that you were getting them every several months as silly\nAs often as the doctor would let me get them why as frequently as the doctor would do it because like I said they would quote wear off\nUm quicker and quicker with every shot so I was getting I'm less results with every every shot I was getting the first one works\nPretty well and I and I was pretty place but then the next one work lurks less and less efficiently and then the next one where it's less and I was getting to the point that I Would get just mild\nUm relief from eight shots and that that would be the only relief I Would get so I was just clamoring to that shot because you can only take so much Advil\nAnd um you know people would pass me in the hall and say are you okay you're walking kind of slow today and you know it made me feel like an eighty year old woman and um that's not how I feel internally\nBut my body was feeling that that um mentally that's not where I was but now mentally and physically are starting to match up\nWell that's wonderful news ... I don't know Dr Rick if we explain to our audience we describe bloopers as an auto immune disorder but is it something that how common is it a impatience being diagnosed as it's something that afflicts women more than it affects men he talked a little bit more about that\nUm it's it's actually quite common um women are affected more than men usually and you're you know can affect people you can have lupus as a teenager but typically it's twenty thirty year old so the fact was started getting affected from ...\nAnd it can affect every part of your body can affect your every long every every organ in your body can be affected by this so it's it's a terrible disease um and it can be quite you know debilitating crippling the people um [noise]\nSo it's a you know um something that I'm very passionate about trying to help people and then when they again when they don't have any other options\nAnd in the traditional medicine world has the treatment of over the counter pain killers or perhaps prescription painkillers and the the the cortisone and steroid shots that's the traditional way it's been treated before folks get to you and find out there really is a different way yeah\nYou all depend on WSBIU traffic came during your daily commute giving yourself one more in line of defense against major traffic problems Portland W.

God for nothing have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has on every side you have bless the work of his hands and his possessions have increased in the land\nBut stretch out your hand now and touch all that he has and he will curse you to your face\nThe reason the book of Joe never answers the question about why good people suffer is because the point of the book is to move us away from that question and toward a more fruitful won\nThe fundamental question behind the book of job is not why do bad things happen to good people but rather why are good people good in the first place\nSatan is claiming that goodness and integrity in human beings are commodities that can be bought and sold he doesn't believe there is any inherent goodness and the human spirit people are simply trading a set of behaviors in return for their own well being\nIt's all pay to play the whole test of the book of job is Satan trying to prove that integrity and faith in God will vanish even from a totally blameless and faithful man once you take away the reward of a happy and healthy life\nWay the reward of a happy and healthy life whether or not Satan is right is the fundamental question of the book\nJob's wife seems to agree with ... assessment of the human condition [noise] do you still persist in your integrity she asks as job sits in the ashes cursed God and die\nAfter all she may not be covered in stores but she's also endured the loss of all her material wealth and the loss of all her children\nThat was enough suffering for her and now she's ready to be done with religion and integrity [noise] it was a system that ultimately failed her and she wants out\n[noise] job's friends have also bought into Satan model is they try to convince him that his suffering is a result of some kind of failed payment he wasn't really blameless they claim if he looks back in his integrity checkbook and really digs into the numbers he'll find him mistake\nSomewhere he must've paid only a hundred dollars when that should've been a thousand or something like that because that's how the system works pay good deeds received blessings if there are no blessings it's because you didn't pay\n[noise] and even jokes question and hours of why do good people suffer is rooted in the same assumption about how the system should work we think good people should not suffer\nA loving God should reward the righteous and punish the wicked not just ultimately in that way too long arc of justice but in the here and now every minute every year every life because why be good if you still land on the trash heap of life\nWe're baffled by the problem and many abandon their faith because of it\nThe book of job offers of forty two chapters smack down of that entire premise good behavior is not a commodity to be traded for protection righteousness is not fire insurance the universe is not built on a pay to play foundation\nGone through job wins the challenge Satan is proven wrong in his assumption and job's friends were so far off base that God tells them job will need to pray for them if they are to have any hope of redemption\nWe're left unsatisfied by the book of job only if we persist in asking the wrong question\nOnce we shift the question away from why to good people suffer too why are good people good the lessons of the book become clear\nOn the one hand we learn that God's promise has never been that we get to avoid tragedy pain and suffering in our lives [noise] no matter how righteous we are we still have to walk through the valley of the shadow faith doesn't get us a ticket to some kind of a zip line high above the valley floor\nAnd in case that wasn't abundantly clear from stories like job\nChristians are told to follow Jesus specifically were told to take up a cross and follow Jesus were invited to become disciples of the simplest blameless man who was mocked beaten abandoned by his closest friends and brutally executed in his prime\nSo there's that\nGenesis one tells us that we are made in God's image to live well is to reflect the image of our creator back out into the world\nLiving with integrity honor and faith is simply being true to ourselves we are good because God is good\nGood news isn't a commodity to sell or trade it's our true with nature\nWhen our observers most impressed and move by our goodness when do the cynics watching our lives really come to understand the loving nature of the gods whose image we reflect\nWhen we do it while sitting in the ashes scraping are sores with a piece of pottery if good people didn't suffer guide post would be out of business\nWhile we're surrounded by blessings on every side faiths detractors say exactly what Satan says at the beginning of the book of job they have an easy they're rich healthy living peace to have a loving family take that away and now Chris you to your face\nIt isn't until we're hanging from across surrounded by thieves and mocked for not being able to help even ourselves that anyone even looks and when they do they fully expect to hear us cursed God went instead we say father forgive them they know not what they do\nThe earth shakes assumptions go dark and the first questions die\nAssumptions go dark and the first questions die and are sealed away in a two\nWhen the ashes around ... blew away and the whirlwind of God's presence the true substance of Joe was revealed he was before during and after his trial are blameless an upright man\nThe story wraps up with God giving twice as much as he had before and it might look on the surface as if nothing has really changed but during the intervening pages there were arguments before the divine court to finally get a ruling on nothing less than the nature of humanity\nIs there anything good and true unholy at the core of the human soul [noise] or is all of our behavior designed to ensure a good life for ourselves why are good people good\nIn the final chapter job response to God's presence by saying I have occurred what I did not understand things too wonderful for me which I did not know I had heard of you by the hearing of the year but now my eye sees you\nThe question why do bad things happen to good people may still ring in our own years but it's no longer relevant question to job by the end in fact he doesn't even have ... question of why are good people good\nBy the end of the book Joe has no more questions at all and ... there's nowhere to be found\nIn the heat of his suffering job still reflected the goodness of his creator and Satan vanished like darkness when a candle is what\nWhat the book of job asks of Christians is what those outside the church walls ask us every single day what is your faith really made off when you engage in acts of service to others is that really about the needs of others\nOr is it some kind of fire insurance for you\nWhen you go to church worship is that an act of love for God or payment toward future benefits\nOr anything you do really about reflecting God's love to the world\nOr is it really all about you [noise]\nOn the daylights hammer falls on us every one of those people is watching and waiting for our answer\nFriends this is a song that we not only saying as individuals but it's a song that we sing corporate Lee I think it's a song that we are supposed to sing\nAs a whole church and not just in the generic sense but the first Presbyterian Church of Atlanta this corporate body gathered here today it's a song that were called\nTo sing together\nBecause first vegetarian church has his face the enemy in some\nWays we're faced floods as a church we have faced snakes [noise]\nThere's some of the most pressing social and theological issues issues that the tour churches apart\nThat led congregations to be at odds with each other and in some cases which led them to eventually close their doors God has kept us church alive and well for a hundred and Seventy\nYears in the choice that many urban churches faced in the Nineteen sixties does the Nineteen eighties as to whether or not they should leave the city for the spacious facilities\nAnd the plethora of parking that the suburbs had to offer them\nGod has kept us alive and well on the corner of sixteen\nAnd Peachtree Street for the past one hundred years and then the places over time where we have not in body the truth that the gospel is good news for all people where we have made enemies\nOr we've caused floods\nWhere we have acted like snakes\nThere as breast in our lungs even now to confess those things and there's room in our hearts to see once again the forgiveness of God in God continues to pour out this grace into our church\nSo that we can be more like Jesus\nThat we can do better that we can and the words of Charles black help somebody in the way of Jesus in Atlanta and for the world church if it hadn't been for God the first Presbyterian Church of Atlanta would not be here\nOur help yesterday or help today or helping to the future is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth\nSet in a moment ago the most obvious aspect of this text might be the most profound no matter what enemy what flood what's snake we're faced\nMatter what enemy what flood what snake we're faced as we gather in the sanctuary this morning with blood pumping through our bodies neurons firing in our brains and breath in our lungs friends of God and and followers of Jesus Christ are invited to sing this song a new\nIf it hadn't been for God if it hadn't been for God our help\nIs in the name of the lord\nThe one who made heaven and earth so how might you sing this song what tune will you carry into the world\nWill you name the victories were you name the rescue will you name the liberation will you name the forgiveness will you name the healing that God has rendered in your life\nWill you sing this song\nNot just any song\nBut this song that are held prison the name of the lord\nThe maker of heaven and earth even as you ponder that question even as perhaps your provoked by that question I think it's appropriate to name one of the hard truth is that like the dark side of the moon only\nComes to be known when we move around them and shine some light on it and and here's what I think we need to name I think here's something that we need to shine some light\nOn there are some people in this world there are some people within the sound of my voice some people here in this sanctuary who just cannot\nSing and I don't mean you can't be in the choir [noise]\nYou just can't sing [noise]\n\nThe enemy has stolen their voice the flood has drowned them out the snakes poison has numb to their lips they just cannot bring themselves to sing\nThe songs of triumph and these songs of success seem incompatible with what they carry perhaps even what they carry into this church right now perhaps the one who is buried a child\nJust can't sing perhaps the one who's human dignity and voice was violently stripped away by someone more powerful and they just can't sing\nPerhaps the one whose faith is teetering on the brink of destruction they just can't sing perhaps\nThe one who has been rejected and denied justice because of their faith because of their gender because of their orientation because of their skin color because of their nationality or their socioeconomic status and they just can't bring themselves to sing and this broken world\nSo what then\nWhat then church what to Christians do\nWhat do we do\nWhen we recognize that some people just cannot sing do we force them into song do we call them to put a smile on their face to fake it until they make it to buck up to get in line to have them count their blessings because they are so very blessed\nKnow what we do as a church\nIs we thing for them\n\nThat's what we do every Sunday when we gather in praise of God we sing for God but we sing for each other\nWe thing for the broken is of the world and our song is so very simple God has overcome the world\nGot his overcome the world for Christ himself\nThe believers treasure here it is for Christ himself his face the enemy he has faced the flood his face the snake and they thought they had won the day as he breeds\nHis last breath on a Roman cross they thought the victory song would be silence forever\nWhen they laid them into two but on the third day [noise]\nChurch he got his smile was may help me here on the third glorious\nDay a day that is I think the hinge of human history on the third day God raised Jesus from the dead amen [noise] that is [noise] that is\nOur treasure that God has swallowed up deaths\nVictory and this victory does not come because we are special Presbyterian 'cause we're fancy first Presbyterian Church of Atlanta members because we are morally superior\nPresbyterian Church of Atlanta members because we are morally superior because we vote the right way we think the right way we live the right way you know this is\nBecause of who God is\nAnd what God has done and let us be clear and remember that Jesus was and is the crucified got Jesus was a victim whose voice and whose song had been silenced but God was on his side\nThat is the song we sing for ourselves as the song we sing for everyone who has been robbed the breath to has been beaten and battered in silence and denied justice by enemies by floods and by snakes and we are on their side church we preached about this not too long ago\nWe are on their side and we're going to keep on singing because God is on their side and God keeps on singing\nAnd we're going to sing some more and choir we're going to sing some more and we're going to sing some more after that until all people in every corner of God's good world find their voice to sing we won't stop singing until everybody\nFinds their voice I close with this you know this theme of singing this is the election airy text for the day this came to us by that cycle of tax that comes every three years in it fits so very well with our Oregon dedication for today\nFor this magnificent magnificent rather instrument this instrument\nWhether it's sixty three hundred plus pipes its principal purpose is not to entertain us\n\nIts principal purpose is not to make us feel good\nAlthough we're feeling pretty good because it is a fine instruments [noise]\nI Know ... feeling pretty good [noise]\nBut the principle of poor purpose of an Oregon and the life in face of a church is what to help the congregation singing to help the congregation sing [noise] each and every week yeah

U. E.\nF. U. E. surgery is where we use tiny one millimeter punches or less to literally extract one single follicle at a time and it doesn't leave any linear starting\nIt does not you know you can cut your hair really short and just really doesn't limit how short you can cut your hair the scars are almost ... you'd have to know you were looking for get out some really ... a bright lights get out of home and look very closely\nYou know what you're looking for and go looking for it to see the scars and uh after an F you eat procedure now up until recently all if you read devices were hand held I started out performing if you you surgery in two thousand three with a little fifty cent disposable punch because there were no instruments Fifteen Years ago to get this done\nNow there were many devices there's the ... device that does a lot of marketing healthier I find that a lot at the smart graph device or there's the artist machine that I that I have I'm there all the marketing but these large for profit companies are putting out there\nIs directly trying to convince consumers that it's the machine that's doing the magic and that it's like a car wash you know just show up stick your head and that machine over there it's going to get it done and presto aren't you know we're going to be sitting back watching it on drinking coffee watch that happen to know that is not at all these machines are like paint Russia's mhm\nYes it's one of many too it's a tool mhm no paintbrush I don't care what it's meant I don't care how much it costs you cannot show me a paint brush that will guarantee you a beautiful painting\nEver it's it's the it's the person you in that so that's what the robot really as you can\nUse that robot it's a a genuine surgical robot just like they used for brain surgery a you know and I use that robot as a tool to extract follicles in a a from a scale it is a quantum leap in technology above any of the handheld devices and really\nAllows us to maximize the U.S wrapped the attraction at the most amount of hair and make the most significant pleasing difference to to our patients\nI think it sounds so reassuring for men and women alike when you're talking about the different regions of scalp and where the thicker hair grows and I mean the thing that that they care that I have at the crowd and my hat at the by that you could have lost thick hair at your forehead at your at your front line there I mean that just sounds like how transformative is that for many people\nIt's amazing it's amazing you know that you mentioned earlier Leonardo da Vinci and the rule of thirds a ...

of thing and you know it's actually kinda nice I'm not in here with another doctor today\nSo let's let's say we're equals Chris Burns up about that you don't have a script you actually well I have to make sure I get all these mentioned and you know like our show is produced by lens Atlanta's healthcare marketing experts\nNow I usually I Would generally know that but it's always good to have it written down with them so you and I don't have a script though you are a number on radio host Chris Burns of more than money heard this very morning Sunday Morning at five AM five to six it was fantastic though on the way we search yeah your I Love it and you're you're back in the daylight so we appreciate you coming back\nSo I Want to talk to you about bringing on new clients and people that have concerns and that kind of thing one has an initial consultation\nWell that have concerns and that kind of thing one is an initial consultation look like with you what should I expect\nOne of the things that drove me crazy about my industry so I worked in a number of firms before a launch my own company and was the just how opaque everything was especially about how advisors got paid\nAnd there was a lot of abuse in our industry you cannot open the newspaper or you know in any month without seeing some sort of large company being fined for some sort of financial abuse so people are right to worry about that\nSo in the first meeting it's it's honestly conversation just like this people sit down a and I give them our whole history I tell some of the story I just told the last segment about my life and why I'm doing this\nAnd then I tell them everything about how we get paid so that when they walk out they know exactly what we offer in every way we could possibly be paid so they feel confident in that because most people again it sounds some people are like why are you talking about you know how they get paid so much and the answer is\nBecause so many people don't know if I work with you if I make this choice you know is that just because you're going to get paid more whatever it is and so we thought we'd talk through that and do you tell 'em and then I hear their story and what what brings you hear a lot of times it is because\nThey they're just to the end to the end about money they're stressed out or maybe they're close to retirement and saying I just don't know if I should pull the lever you talked about stress when someone's right on the edge of retirement\nAnd they say I could go another year another two years or I could actually stopped now but I just don't want to mess that up because once I pull that lover I Can't come back\nAnd I had somebody actually quite recently I was talking with me they had their whole life dreamed of working with a nonprofit there were a successful business person or\nHe told his company he was leaving you had an amazing offer from a nonprofit and then that nonprofit came back and said actually we we were wrong we can't we can't take you know and he couldn't reverse that decision and it was terrifying and he came through it really well but I understand why people are so worried at that point to a lot of folks coming in they just share that\nAnd then I'm able to say well let's let's give you actual data behind this let's show you what a plan looks like so you can feel confident that if it's time for you to stop working or maybe you're younger person if you're saying I I just don't know how to save for the future we have kids when our kids to go to college we argue about it all the time\nWell let me show you what you need to do to make that happen\nAnd then people it's just the peace people feel when they go through an actual planning process instead of just being sold the product which is kind of the norm in my industry to say we're actually going to take you through a process where you have a plan and that's why you're with us that's what you pay us for um it's amazing to see how people come out the other side\nSo any age any stage of life really Chris could have good information for you any of the things you'd like to call about entering into retirement or someone like me mid level you know mid mid time spent in their career what to do and how to save we have Abbey and view for her to calling with a great question about student loan debt\nMaybe budgeting you could ask a simple question about budgeting for Chris savings investment questions we're going to have all of that on the table for at least the next half hour for you for all for eight seven zero seven fifty you're listening to the weekly check out that nationally fast that here on news Ninety five five and I am seven fifty dollar usa [noise]\n\nThat that a cat medical joins solutions center we often hear that patients wish they had done it sooner some people think that joint pain or lots of ability is just a part of getting older but it doesn't have to be take pastor Michael rubber he was living with chronic pain for three years before he found his solution at the cat medical\nMy experience with a surgical center the cab medical and the joint solution center was actually far better than what I expected although I did expect that things would go well although there was just a first class model of care and compassion\nSuch a friendly atmosphere congregations pretty flabbergasted that was back in the pool bit at three weeks since having both of my knees replaced there's not a day that goes by that I'm just not grateful that I don't have the pain and discomfort that I had for three

today\nAre are you interested in becoming your own boss and start flipping houses right now in the Atlanta area if so here's an amazing opportunity for you\nNick ... founder of the envy real estate

fascinated about learning how to find properties that can produce rental money called eight hundred six one five five six six eight now to get your free wholesaling get today\nGet folks across the board um that come in but I tell you there's two main waves that I see it and it's really people that are looking it makes sense or looking towards a massive change of people that are just starting a family\nAnd maybe you know so they're in their late twenties early thirties and they're going holy cow we're worried about saving for college fund we're worried about what is it looked like to support a child they come in a lot because how do we get started and then it's about Twenty years later people they're looking\nA lot because how do we get started and then it's about Twenty years later people are looking seriously at retirement maybe their mid fifties\nUm and again that's that's in general we have folks in their forties if folks in their seventies and eighties sometimes come in but I'm a lot of times it's when people are forced to say I don't know that I have a plan for this I'm not sure what to do next and then that's why but that's what propels him to come in\nSo a lot of people aren't thinking preventative and early on it it's that waiting for that big change in life to then go ... wait I mean he need help with this and I\nTell you one of the neatest thing is when we do have someone come in and who's not in that desperate place when they come in and say hey we're about to get married and we just want to think about this or maybe they're in their forties or late thirties going\nI don't really know what it looks like to save effect to believe but I've got a few decades till retirement how do I do that holy cow there ahead of the curve\nSo it really I mean you're not in a bad place a lot of folks in their fifties that come in I've noticed this\nWill feel like I Am so far behind I don't know what to do have to become super aggressive how in the world am I going to be ready playing catch up almost yeah and the reality is the the same basic foundational principles no matter where you're at can really take you to a good place I've I've met with very few people in over a decade of meeting with people about this stuff\nWho I Would say truly don't have hope and almost everyone that comes in were able to find hey this is what we can do this is the plan we can make for you to actually have a shot at achieving your dreams\nNow for anyone is listening and and you let me know if this is a good example are not let's go ahead and use the example of a household where both spouses it's dual income sure you know both maybe mid stages in their career even if they're early in their career they have a set salary\nDual income are their general guidelines that you would advise people of percentages how much to savor you know how how you should be going at your four one K.\nYeah it's really hard so percentages are really popular and I and they're very popular because it's so easy to go\nIf I just put ten percent aside for this or Eighteen percent for this thing\nUm and that in fact I became a big deal a few years ago something similar to this there was a big advertisement for a massive financial company and it was what's your number and the idea was what does that exact number you have to save for retirement to be okay and I totally understand why that's popular people we just want to have clarity to just tell me what to do right right\nBut the problem is and I and I says and the show a lot and it drives people crazy\nEveryone really is different and let me give you an example I have some clients that come in they have\nMaybe five six hundred thousand dollar saved but because of the way that their life is structured because maybe they have a pension through work\nAnd maybe they inherited some they are going to inherit some money in a decade or something um and when you add in Social Security they don't have a lot of debt they're fine with that five hundred thousand in when we project income they're going to do great their retirement looks wonderful I have other people come in with a few million dollars two or three million dollars and then when you look at their debt\nAnd you look at their lifestyle and what they want to do the dreams they have a traveling and things like that\nYou go this isn't gonna work right so it's so dramatically different I mean and and it ... and if you just stick with what's your number idea of will just put this semester way um I think you miss often the complexity of people going let's look at the whole scope of your life\nAnd I know people hear that and they go that's you know going to come see well yeah and people to come see us because you need to look at the big picture it's not just about how you invest it's not just about how many dollars you put a way it's really about how\nThe entire financial picture you have points towards the future and when you can look at all those things together you'd be amazed sometimes we give people the freedom to spend\nSometimes people are so many people feel worried they feel guilty if they swipe their car 'cause like I should have been saving that money and we help them figure out this is where you're at this is what you need to put away so you can have some guilt free spending wouldn't that be nice\nSo maybe Chris Burns would have that news for you so if you're having these questions if you're having these concerns\nThey welcome you to one hour consultation in the office you can find crafts at my life is more dot com go ahead and get that set up now and you also hear his more than money updates here on WSBIU every day seven thirty am five thirty and so now you'll be recognizing Christmas voice a lot more and if you're up on Sunday Morning five AM that's a good time to\nWhich when everyone should be up on the weekend\n[laughter] for for eight seven to zero seven fifty back to be fair to say Hi to Jane good afternoon James\nHey thank you so much for taking my call really loving the show my my question is uh my wife and I I'm are debating which we should tackle first our home equity line of credit or student loans\n... we have our three months of merging sci fi saved up in cash and savings right now\nAnd got to be expecting a some fairly good income coming in and the next year okay but a five point one for ... student loan interest rate he lock is right around the same mhm and they're both around forty six thousand dollars a each so I Want to try and tackle\nThem both but didn't go I Want to get your thoughts on that\nI may ask you this ah first of all thank you so much for calling in\nLet me ask you this I first of all thank you so much for calling in and and just sharing your situation with this so what uh what is your savings looked like outside of the emergency fund or you both putting money into retirement plans as well or how does that look\nYes so right now um I had about ... or I I put about four percent of my income into a simple IRA okay\nAnd I'm opted not to uh took my wife out of the for three days 'cause it wasn't doing that well okay I'm In we're looking for some other things to put it that my answer\nSure well you're five percent right on that line obviously you want to tackle that obviously you want to knock it out I'm over time though can you make more than five percent over a long period of time in the market uh sure I think that's feasible over over a long period of time so if you're thinking retirement savings then\nI wouldn't want to stop everything it sounds like you're putting money into simple as well which is great\nUm between those two on which one to tackle first ah they're they're very similar in many ways to them the primary difference is that the the hew Locke but you have is is actually has a\nCollateral behind it or which makes it a little bit different I Would probably go after the student is all the student debt government debt or is it private\nIt it is I'm always we rolled over its it's now private it's now prime often\nYeah and I that was kind of follow up question was our income is just over ... I think we might be making too much to have the whole thing paid off ... I mean to have the interest deducted from I'm not sure if you're familiar with that [noise] ah well\nI'm Glad to connect off line in more details about how much you're making and how that would that would impact it but my off the cuff would be that it'd be better to tackle the student debt because it's especially if you brought it into private debt\nUm because you do have the house behind the other one's let's say you for some reason you moved or something\nUh there there's there's actually a collateral there to help pay that off if you had to and it's not ideal ride that's not what you want to do for you wanna pay it off but the student uh that's just going to sit out there on the private side and I don't have to as it is it a fixed a line over time is going to change over time but if it between those two out usually start with a student that's\nFantastic that's exactly what I Want to hear thank you guys so much love the show sure thank you so much\nThank you so much have a great afternoon now we do have Catherine calling from Jasper we may take her in just a moment we also had another caller leaves the question for you Chris we've got about a minute or so here or what is the safest where's the safest place to put money and a four one K. an IRA or stock market is that an easy question\nIt is an easy question so here's a misconception too is that those are different they're all actually the same all their four O. one K. or an IRA is is a shell it's attacked\nShow so it just tells the IRS had attacks it but it doesn't make it any more safer less safe so it's really depending on how you invested within that show that makes sense you could put it in cash in a four O. one K. and it wouldn't grow but it'd be safe right\nI'm the only quote unquote safe money out there truly safest FDIC insured money like at a bank but it's not going to grow you gotta take some interest rates\nAre what they used to be for sure\nYeah you're not making anything really sitting in the bank you could maybe make one percent in a savings account right now you do need to invest the key is figuring out how much risk it can you handle but it's not about the vehicle is not about four one K. R. IRA it's about how you invest that money and that's what we do with people\nGreat thank you All right for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty a few more minutes with Chris Byrne host of more than money here on WSBIU and visit him on line my life is more dot com we'll be right back right after this\n\nFor forty eight and ... carrier W.
