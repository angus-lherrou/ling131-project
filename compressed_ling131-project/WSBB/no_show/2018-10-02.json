we finding now that a free people will eventually\nCensor themselves\nIn a free country where you won't go to jail\nFor saying anything so long as you know call for violence we're living in an age where artist are saying you know what now that I think about it I really shouldn't do that anymore\nThat's amazing makes you wonder does the American experiment work a free people will eventually held themselves what they can't say what they can't do\nYes Gregor us in the corner well how much are they actually censoring themselves because that's what they think they should do or they're censoring themselves because they're scared of the backlash but you have is a mean for people to really shut you down and ruin\nYou well that's ... and there's all that going on which is which is a you know of the whole block captain concept\nThe media quite often now or the block captains in a these societies Mao is um and do the Soviet Union those countries are too big for the central government to keep

Republicans don't go along with every extreme environmental regulation that destroys jobs and businesses and makes America less competitive that means Republicans their plan is dirty air and water rock Obama says those words\nBut we have a decision as a country that we've got to make here are we going to rule war this this systematic slander machine that has been built in this country you know the ... search ... character assassination\nKnow character blood joining machine\nYou got to watch judge Kavanaugh last week you know the witnesses the professor Ford mentioned don't corroborate her story you know that the New York times said that Mrs Ramirez was calling others not sure if it was Brett Kavanaugh and was asking them if they remembered and then you saw\nOr the president now has got new deals with Mexico and Canada\nAnd we find out that it brings trade piece to North America just like we now have results nobody expected in North Korea and we now look at the deal and I was seeing the impact of the deal and to avoid tariffs Seventy five percent of car components have to be made right here in the U.S\nThat's a pretty dramatic Fifteen Percent thirty percent of vehicles must be made by workers earning at least sixteen bucks an hour by twenty twenty forty percent by twenty twenty three Canada agreed to lift their barriers to our farmers\nWisconsin dairy farmers for infant formula skim milk powder milk protein concentrate\nThey'd give us farmers access to about four percent of Canada sixteen billion dollar dairy market according to the dairy farmers of Canada us farmers also got more access to Canada's eggs and poultry markets or maybe it doesn't matter to you but it matters to those that are producing eggs and poultry\nThat have been shut out of Canada because we had an unfair deal us drug companies have ten years to sell their name brand products in Canada before they go generic well that's up two years that's billions of dollars in many cases\nThere's no increase protections on intellectual property there are no changes in US Steel and aluminum tariffs and the deal preserves a trade dispute settlement mechanism that Canada fought hard to maintain to protect their lumber industry and other sectors guess what a better deal better deals don't happen unless you demand better deals\nLike record low unemployment doesn't happen by accident you got to cut taxes and you've got to and burdensome regulation America can never be energy independent unless you're open Anwar unless you get rid of burdensome regulations on the coal industry and and the natural gas industry and you allow drilling and you allow the building a pipeline all of which the president has done\nBut nobody in the media talks about it because it's Russia Russia Russia stormy stormy stormy ... told me you know Michael Cohn is if Paul Manafort it's Robert Mueller Andrew Weissmann\nIs what the country's been talking about thirty five days you get to change all of this every bit of it now we have the senator from Hawaii ... men to shut up now she wants the FBI to investigate and ice throwing incident at a college bar\nYou gotta be kidding me\nWhen he was in you know a young guy and yell and that apparently there was a former classmate said he drew ice at a party at somebody I let me tell you what's going to happen this week Mitch McConnell and the Senate leadership most which I don't have a lot of respect for but\nThey have been good on this I think they've handled it properly but the seriousness of deserves and also the resolve\nThat an injustice has also occurred here we'll see what senator snowflake is running for president yesterday in Massachusetts has to do and say about it\nMcConnell saying earlier today that he wants to vote this week in the Senate and for that to happen Jamie ... pre reminds us the majority leader must file culture by Wednesday that's tomorrow will be here tomorrow in the nation's capital\nCulture by Wednesday that's tomorrow will be here tomorrow in the nation's capital in order to force a final vote by Saturday otherwise\nYou'll vote wouldn't officially be this week I'm so for example if the cloture vote\nIs if you filed cloture on Wednesday the final votes on Saturday if you filed on Thursday it's on Sunday violet on friday the vote would be next Monday if you file culture on Saturday It's Tuesday depending on when the FBI report comes in\nSo that's going to be wide open and whether or not the three Republican senators go along with endless investigations is ultimately I guess going to be up to them Lindsey Graham who's going to join us later was on Hannity last night I thought he had a pretty good idea I said you know what we can turn this whole election and thirty five days into a referendum on Brett capital\nWhat would happen if something really where did occur and we're one vote short here's what I Would tell the press that would appeal the verdict in the Senate to the ballot box [noise]\nThis good man should not be destroyed\nOr if he legitimize this process by one vote short won't be onto the next person\nI'd hate to be the next person nominated\nWith feel horrible that were destroyed cap it off someone would I Do\nI Would nominate him and I would take this case to the American people and I had asked voters in Indiana and Missouri and North Dakota and other places for ... saying who nominated to got to be president and see if they are loners won't to appeal the verdict of their senator\nSo if you were saying who for one vote short here saying how would appeal the case of the American people\nOkay I you know at this point in thirty five days let me tell you what's at stake everything that I've been telling you about why vitamin saying this for six months or longer now this is the most important midterm\nElection in our lifetime if you like the progress that I just described to you then it's going to happen by the way\nDonald Trump is just went up on in red on the Drudge Report\nTrump gain millions from questionable tax strategies according to the New York times I guess the getting off I guess maybe they think they're losing the vote on judge Kavanaugh so President Trump participated in questionable tax strategy is in the Nineteen nineties\nAnd allowed him to recruit millions of dollars in additional wealth from his father's real estate empire according to the New York times newspaper reported that Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation to help the skies otherwise taxable income that came from gifts from their parents\nOkay the IRS has been investigating him I guess for most of his adult life and also I Do a big shock there\nBut this is what's at stake do you want you want to go back because this is the endless investigation and do you want to reward the party of slander and bludgeon 'cause that's the Democratic party you don't think it is five weeks from tonight\nYou're going to tune in to the news midterms big election night big coverage all the networks\nYou have the opportunity to shock the world again if you remember they never thought Donald Trump could when they never believed that can happen now imagine you there's two things that are going to happen\nOn election night five weeks from now one is you're going to turn on your TV set and you're going to see a bunch of guinea liberals happy to announce that Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house and maybe even Senator Chuck Schumer the liberal from New York is going to be the Senate majority leader\nOr you can tune in and watch the results come in\nAnd they have to announce that the U.S house of representatives remains in control of the Republicans and that the Republicans have picked up two three four five seats in the United States Senate\nWhich would render by the way Collins Murkowski and snowflake irrelevant\nAnd that even if they stopped Brett Kavanaugh he could be re nominated and next time he would get a vote up or down and he would become a Supreme Court justice in spite of the slander and the ... and everything else and all of those anchors\nThat had been for two years trying to destroy the president as an extension of all things Democrat you can see them spiral into their state of shock\nAnd denial and depression again that's not going to stop and that is going to ratchet up the next day Donald Trump should be arrested for tax fraud Donald Trump Stormy Daniels ... Russia wants to go back to Russia let's investigate someone else's taxes from Thirty years ago where their loan applications from Thirty years ago\nYou have the power and the ability to do all of that\nFive weeks from tonight you get to decide what kind of TV you get to watch want to see the media crumble want to see them sad on a sea of media freak out want to see CNN acres you know talking about white lashes again and all the other insane commentary that happen\nAnd all the other insane commentary that happen\nLet me tell you the races the states you all know what district you live in because this was a smart audience we have a map up on Hannity dot com that we're we've been putting up a well updated this week we're going to put up to Seventy big race us\nWe're going to let you look at them and if it happens to be your congressional district you might want to plan on voting five weeks from today if you live in Florida Rick Scott has been a great governor and he's not responsible for the red tide\nUm and of course run the scientists would make a great governor there if you live in Indiana Joe Donnelly you know what we can do better than Joe Donnelly supporting\nChuck Schumer if you live in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp we can do better than Heidi Heitkamp supporting everything Schumer if you live in West Virginia you can do better than Joe Manchin\nMostly supporting everything Schumer if you live in Missouri You can do better than Claire McCaskill\nSupporting pretty much everything Schumer and I don't miss it and you know Martha ...

Kavanaugh at a\nShower and I know like a like a rock Obama's was part of the human gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and drinking in excess yeah\nThere you go in and so I just I was always a seeker and I kept\nLooking for answers and and and finally I found the answers that that ah I thought were intellectual obstacles and I don't really think they were openly but there are intellectual answers and reasonable answers and we can give reasonable answers to why we leave and were encouraged by uh the Bible\nPeter that tells us that always be prepared to give the reader that you believe and there are rational reasons to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's consistent with raising so I wanted to share with the game you can make this quick quick I I got on fire for the Bible in

way to store if you're ever going to report it publicly just shouldn't have bought it was given in part a due to the news networks I'm hearing about Michael I have an ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if it was recorded there probably are good correct or at least we can see what I was a parent to a lot of people\nAt least we can see what I think it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre just there was nothing to this story um and when she offered um witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nOn the other was deceased and didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gotten it's damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh from every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like the very close to probably completing their work but\nIf we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens of dozens of people to corroborate they discovered the missile Ramirez was\nCalling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself if it was Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats have declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat next story but on the original story the Christine port a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like T. J. Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're counting the FBI the same thing I told your district committee which they have no memory at all to support this now I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal at this party entry and the Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nUm and it was who was at the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine Ford's account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that I think there are three additional people calm burning and squeeze a who had not been interviewed earlier\nA and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christian ports are allegations so uh I listen I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence to support this and they find out actual real evidence to support it than I change my mind but I don't think it's there\nWell if you go through I I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell\nI'm now she's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her but she pointed out of he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar\nIn as much as there is no cooperation there are big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that that broke Katz says her friends sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly\nConsistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters dear so and so do you know anything please call us do those letters went out\nI Know please some core operation you know ... ... ... right in the time they said they call they talked to dozens of people have to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot\nOf people to look at it on on the Rachel metal thing you know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the way she approached it was not a really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing\nGood way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did you have to be ... every ... minutes but she did\nIt ... hours looking today at her questioning of Ford about her therapist Andrea therapists note and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve\nAnd she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells the therapist about that and she also tells an individual therapist\nAbout that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that at the session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name\nThat is the only evidence that it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so they're probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned it to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in ... you know this is what its primary because\nYou're on the triggers that is what they say\nWell now we have the Democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said to men to just shut up and sit down on Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants an investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ballgame and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about his drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drink too much beer but they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so does he look cool a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here you know objects question ... I go ahead we don't want to get out of\nThe things that he claims yeah I'm from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations to once he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about\nDrinking although he mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today vox published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr they gotta let it go there thank you so much Byron York a widow sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean has or toll free telephone number as we continue from Washington DC we'll get the very latest from Senator Lindsey Graham who's been in the forefront of a literally pointing out the madness that this is now evolved into\nA listen we all have just gotten through summer and a lot of you have you know little sun spots\nAnd skin irritation from the summer\nAll the good friends at ... and Jen you sell while they now have a brand new product it's there's sunspot correct her and you can watch sunspots aged ... red inflamed patches vanish\nRight before your eyes because it works like all day and you sell products and you're going to get the Gen yourself sunspot correct or absolutely free when you\nBuy genius sell to get rid of the bags and puffing on to your eyes\nNow watch all those stubborn sunspots vanish and before you get busy with the holidays are going to look to your best bags and pumping is gone and it's all guaranteed they guarantee it's going to work to your satisfaction or you get your money back\nNo questions asked to just go to Jen you sell dot com they have a toll free number you can call right now it's eight hundred skin five zero nine and if you order right now you'll get the ... micro dorm abrasion\nThat's also free to rejuvenate none club pours\nSo you have instantly radiant baby soft skin all the time and if you order now shipping is free just call eight hundred skin by zero nine go to the website Jen you sell dot com right from the swamp and the sewer it's the Sean Hannity show we'll get to your calls we have Lindsey Graham and much more Hannity tonight\nHassle free no showing\nNo open houses no negotiations it's that simple you simply bypass market choose one you want to move\nAnd close with confidence\nThe team known for your home so guaranteed present Denmark Spain guaranteed offer the mark Spain guaranteed offer program takes are promised to a whole new level know showing\nNo open houses no negotiations it's that simple visit mark Spain dot com slash guaranteed offer that's mark Spain dot com slash guaranteed offer and start packing\nYou asked me about ... er\nCox media group station [noise]\nTwenty four hour news weather man from\nFive and a a\nLot of\nHis five o'clock it after it and I ... a lively W.

letter but she may be culpable for leaking the letter it appears this was the only went to her staff and ... if you go back\nTo Anita Hill the reason we learned about a lot of these allegations are Anita Hill or because the allegations were leaked\nAnd because the allegations were leaked to the Senate hill though the hearing and then after it was over with the Senate launched an investigation into who leaked the information and found the staffers responsible\nI suspect we're going to see the same thing here there's a number of rumbling to the Senate already about having an investigation to see how this information came out Dianne Feinstein has been very defensive about this and has it said she wanted to go along with this which suggests she's hiding something or\nProtecting someone in

numbing thing to me is is you've got liberals who were totally invested in the fact that even though I witnesses are often wrong\nAnd we need DNA evidence to prosecute people and yet here they are believing in eyewitness who has a seriously flawed memory who can't remember anything and has cited literal pseudo science\nScientific nonsense to justify why she remembers his name and nothing else

Murkowski to come out and say she trust him is a pretty big thing in other news Jeff Flake spoke in New Hampshire\nStaying in other news Jeff Flake spoke in New Hampshire last night and he sounded to be critical of Brett Kavanaugh or or at least the anger he displayed at this at the Senate\nAnd when asked about this by reporters he retracted it and said he doesn't blame demand for being angry if he was falsely accused and it sounds like he was falsely accused and he wasn't talking about Brett Kavanaugh anyway he sounds rather positive about Kevin on now to\nOne of the things that Jeff Flake
