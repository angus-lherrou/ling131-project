water deep water no matter what this is a a principal if you're not tuned in to the fish specifically that will help you get more bites and what is that\nUses spell baiting light line house oh what does how does that and I have a ...\nSmall bite and light line allows you to feel the bait and you'll get more by\nHow many more bites I don't know its cage invest the lodge before nine thirty in the morning you've got fifty by\nDoes it matter if you get fifty five instead of fifty it does to me\nDepend on the\nHonor courage and strength of character nice qualities or embodied by the recipients of the medal of honor\nNow let's recognize this week's medal of honor recipients on them Neal outside\nOkay time for the medal of honor this week\nThomas Kim's ...\nBy an army Vietnam February Nineteen sixty eight\nKimmons was serving on a reconnaissance in force mission and asked his company came under intense rocket automatic weapons in small arms fire from a bank Vietnam for the company began\nImmediately beach and began assaulting the enemy bunker complex\nAs they were moving through the heavy enemy fire a enemy through a grenade into the group [noise] Kansas when threw himself on the grenade\nAnd blocked the explosion with his body\nAs a result of his ... he received severe head and chest ...\nThrough his courage complete disregard for his personal safety in concerned for his fellow soldiers ... loss of life an injury to the seven other men in his element\nIs drawing near heroism at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty\nOr in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service [noise] and I picked him because he died\nRecently ... last year two thousand Seventeen the medal of honor tribute five forty one it is now let's talk to Andy he's calling on on the outside\nThe morning Andy you're on the radio but hey what's going on what do you talk to me\nI was just a question on how you talk about the uh catching fish the laws and man you got your ... made a reservation\nOh yeah you should ever have you ever had the pleasure going down the Appalachian coal ...\n... yes I finished an Appalachian many many times I've never faced with a guide and apple latch\nTell you what my my gray all you\nLoad up me and my brother and we got on the Appalachian oh probably once a year and the and I tell you what it is just like you were saying see drop a hook and all you got limited\nOur app set up as they would you know that coin you're ... you're cooler name on it so at dinnertime cook your face\nYou're cooler has your name on it so at dinnertime ... your fish for the way you want it oh boy that that it was often but I'm going to check out the cage invest the laws that song called ... and I'm not at work and stuff but uh that's how old are you to vote\nA good deal glad you called good luck to you and let me know if you've ever make it down there\nOh yeah absolutely you bet I love love for you to go I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself now Rick is calling from uh Rick is calling from Roswell good morning Rick\nLet's say let me to this thing in your there you are let's talk to Rick calling from Roswell good morning Rick\nHi Hi Neal how are you good um so I have four quick\nThings I wanted to talk with you about okay first of all I ordered the double pack of fire aid and got the cap good that you're right that cap is really nice cat\nLast year for a long time\nYeah it looks nice to it it it fits me while I I like it a lot but the question I have is a there's the fiery have a shelf life to it\nA minimum is five years okay and we had last longer than that but the they they allow it for five years\nOkay now the other the other three things although I'm not a hunter I listen to your program on a regular basis and I'm not a hunter but I'm a calculus in physics a tutor for high school students are okay and what I wanted to mention do you ... are you aware that in calculus we do a um\nA fishing problem and in physics we do a hunting problem\nAmong novels that we do\nI did not I love this I'd love to to be able to see the substance of those problems\nSo I'll give you the scenario for the calculus problem okay so you're sitting in a boat\nOr you've cooked a fish\nAnd uh you know how high above the water the tip of your fishing rod is and you know how fast you're really in the fish\nWe can figure out using differential calculus and some ... or the ... we can figure out how fast the angle is changing between your line and the water and we can also figure out how fast that fish is coming toward the boat\nI ah\nUsing calculus and either um ... al ... or the end the ...\nOr ... river ... [laughter] I Can't even say it and I tutor a factory on narrow ms so that you have the ... the ... the some of the squares\nOf the two opposite side equals the summer the square of the ... yeah or something like that does\nSo it it applies to a rice triangle and it's\nA it's a as you said the some of the squares of the two legs has the equal the square of the pot and right\nThere you are and so hey listen Rick it's been a long long time\n[laughter] so so anyway you gotta ride try and go with the tip of your ... a fishing rod coming down to the water and then going out to the fish and then your line forms the hype hot news and you can do all kinds of a mathematical calculations based on that right triangle\nUm so that's the scenario with calculus for physics it's a hunting scenario\nSuppose that your target is like oh I don't know three hundred yards away although Isaac's we used as a metric we'd say three hundred meters away right and I'm supposed to cure your firing your weapon on a in a level level with the ground\nAnd um suppose that I'm\nPaul Hi do you have to aim above your target if you know your muscle velocity of the a rifle how far above your target do you have to Ames that when the bullet arrives it hits where you want it to hit\nOkay that's a ... and you use ah Newton's I'm\nA traditional um\nEquations of of motion to solve that is a fairly simple problem to do\nIt and then I ask you a question of question Rick [noise] if you fired a bullet and perfectly level and you fired a bullet and it weighed a hundred grams alright\nOkay\nAnd you win that bullet exited the barrel and the the the ground in front of us perfectly flat when that bullet exits the barrel if you dropped to boom it\nFrom that position it exactly the same time both bonus will hit the ground at the same time\nYou've had some physics how 'bout that\nYou've had some physics training because that's one of the things that they teach you in physics is that exactly what you said\nWell I'm impressed with myself yeah\nI'm impressed with you too that I I'm not a lot of people know that\nYou have velocity does it change gravity\nYou have velocity does that change gravity\nRight gravity that that that the two are forced vectors if you will\nOr are independent of each other you've got the the vector of of its horizontal philosophy and you have the vector\nIt's a vertical velocity which initially is zero coming out of the barrel but thing gravity starts acting on it as soon as that exits the barrel and it starts coming down and gravity doesn't care whether the bullets moving or not if you know it's going to act on the bullet a regardless and so it's just as you said\nFacet\nRight here's the question that got though or I Know that physics\nQuestion does that was ...\nI wanted to ask you a question do you happen to know what the muzzle velocity of your muscle loader is\nNot offhand because it would change according to the power they learned in the barrel\nYeah yeah that makes sense\nBecause you can use anywhere from ... grains to a hundred and fifty grains whether it's a maximum I'm a Muslim older they can handle a maximum load\nSo you have the ability to change how much powder is that is is behind the bullet\nYes in a Muslim over you do yes and the ... just any gardener and how much they get in it partly say again Rick I'm Sorry\nA highly ... how do you make the decision as to how much a powder to put in it\nWell it's the size of the animal the anticipated distance of the shot or and what you're used to and all that is solved on the range\nAnd you do this on the fly is your as your hunting\nNo you do that prior okay no one once you're in the woods once you are loaded once you are in this than whether it's ... or hogs are dear muti or a or whatever there is no mystery there is no decision to be made\nSo let me ask this question is and on\nSo let's let's say you're in the stand or have you already decided when you're in this than what you're going after or do you have like a fifty different bullets all the different grains\nSo that she knows the bullet you need based on what you're saying\nHunting and take a kid along

just saw a dress rehearsal of water market correction would look\nLike and it could be the best thing that ever happened to you hey this is Chris Burns welcome to more than money hey we're going to dig into that that I normally I give you multiple topics we're going to have all these discussion points today we're going to focus on one thing and that so we just saw\nA dress rehearsal for what a stock market correction would be we saw six days of the market dropping it showed you wear your portfolio laugh it showed you may be a little bit how\nYou respond when the market is dropping it certainly showed you how the media will respond how the politicians will respond and you get a taste for that and that's such a gift because now you have a moment in time now you can actually\nMake an adjustment if you need to\nFriday the market corrected the market came back and correct is not the right word here the market stabilized\nAnd get wasn't some massive game but it stabilized we don't know where it's going next week we don't know Monday Tuesday Wednesday with the market will look like what I tell you what\nIf we come out of this okay without any more drops in the market if the market just keeps going up it would be a terrible loss for you to just go who dodged the bullet\nYes I'm OK because you have an opportunity now you have an opportunity to react\nTo to adjust what is needed to make sure you're going to be okay for the future that is an unbelievable gift\nAnd we don't want a wasted so I'm going to dig into that today as you listen to the show remember one thing the next hour is about you this show is not just about discussing the dynamics of a market dropped or what's going on or why it was caused those things matter will will will dip into that but the point is we talk about these things because we want to know how they filtered down\nTo your specific situation because if it doesn't matter to you practically\nIf what we talk about this and make an impact on you it was a waste okay that's the point of this show more than money is about how you make real traction towards your dreams for the future so as you listen if you have questions today jump on my website it's my life is more dot com and you can ask anything there I Hope there's things today we talk about\nThat hit your specific situation\nThere are things that maybe you think about when you're by yourself and your mind starts wandering things you worried about that keep you up at night things you're excited about dreams you had if you wonder how we're talking about impacts those things\nJump on my website you can ask and I will get back to our team will get back to you we answer a lot of those questions on the show in our lightning round we're going to have that later in the show where I answer the questions that regular listeners of sentence to take advantage of that resource\nAnd while you're on that website my life is more dot com you can also you can listen to past shows you can sign up to receive a daily update that we put out one of my favorite things we do every day\nOn multiple radio stations around Atlanta\nA W speeding on eight point five Ninety seven point one of the river all these stations play or daily update which is a one minute synopsis of whatever the most important\nPiece of news was that day and more importantly what it means for you so that's the goal every day and the update when I'm\nYeah so that's the goal every day and the update when I'm writing it\nAnd if you're not listening to the radio 'cause you have better things to do or you're working or whatever it is you're not in the car or in the morning and afternoon that place you can get that I think there's a website we we sent it to via email every single day it's one of the ... the best things I think that we do\nUm because again it's so concise spaniel just send you that one at that every day you can get that on the website my life is more dot com you can also sign up for a free consultation to have a conversation a discussion with me Chris Burns with someone from my team about your situation so maybe you ask a question\nBut maybe you want to have a long conversation about that we offer a free consultation to anyone who wants that so again we're going to dig deep into what we just experienced the last number of days I Want you to have practical practical action items you can take their whether it's asking question having a conversation please utilize that resource it's there for you again my life is more\nDot com so what are we see I Want to bring this up in a few things first of all\nI Want to talk a little bit about what happened and just step back and look at what happened then again we still in process here you know for all we know the market is going to keep going down next week no one knows\nBut certainly we had a breather on friday where it came back up\nA stabilized and so some of the fears of the anxiety has reduced for a lot of folks and you might be listening right now I'm going had zero fear had zero I didn't even notice that was talking with somebody or Thursday after the worst of this after days of your six days straight by Thursday of the market dropping\nAnd he was like it's going to I have no idea\nThat that's the reality is some people listening to the show you just like it because of my wonderful voice you just excited to be hearing me talk I guess for a while you don't care about finances too much you don't care about the market too much when you care about it but you're not looking at it regularly and so you missed the whole thing that's fine this show is still for you\nBecause there's still something really practical you can do right now today\nTo see where you're at based on what just happened the last few days I'll talk about that in a second but somebody you were watching this like ... some of your close to retirement\nAnd you were watching every day going oh no this is what we've been worried about this is what we saw coming this is it and and boy financial media only fuel that right if you if you happen to be unfortunate enough to regularly be looking at financial media you know you're reading a newspapers and the finance section you're watching a CNBC et cetera\nUm CNBC anyway I'm losing um\nYou would have had a lot more anxiety because whenever the market starts to drop we notice a trend in one of the first thing that happens\nIs media makes it the worst right media is going to point towards is this the end of the bull market is everything going downhill to be only to scream and run for the hills and there's exceptions to that there's some great folks\nDoing media they're not that way but that's that's the norm okay and so I'm regardless of whether you watch this every day you didn't notice it at all ah it was an amazing dress rehearsal because it showed us exactly what's going to happen so we're going to dig into first what did happen how did that work\nUm in why does that matter to you and then I Want to get super practical and talk about what can we learn from this there are I truly think list experience can be one of the best things that ever happened to you and I really mean that the folks here that and go on you're just you know he said that every week no I really don't like\nThe market dropping this last week because of the current climate were in because of where the stock market is that right now could be ... could literally changed the course of your future if you understand how to utilize that and leverage that okay so we're going to this is why this is so important to me is the first of all what happened All right so\nThe market started dropping a over a week ago Thursday of the prior week okay so what is that seven eight nine days ago uh the market beings to drop okay and initially when it drops there's an easy explanation for that bond yields were up that day and so the market starts to drop\n'em and no one really too concerned about it and usually in the first two days of the market dropping people kind of shrug it off it's not a avid alien to the basic explanation everything's okay but once you hit day three\nI've noticed that when there's a turning point if we have three states straight days of continued market draws people start going what's going on\nWe create a cause effect relationship and then we apply that to the future and now that influences the way we think about future investment decisions in them that is going to kill you that is going to destroy your long term investments to this the first thing to see here\nIs that there was no easy root cause for what happened last week\nThere was a whole lot of little things and then a whole lot of group change in group mob mentality and suddenly we saw the market dropping in anyone's going to try to eat offer an easy explanation for that\nHas an agenda and\nOffense to either side the the the Trump folks saying it was a fad\nOr anti Trump folks saying it was China a trade war both of them are just trying to find an easy explanation when that's just not reality is just not reality and some of you were unhappy\nHearing that because I'm offending you politically because either way that's going to offend someone politically Rikers both sides are mentioned here here's the deal this is not political\nSo I mentioned here here's a deal this is not political okay but the market dropping\nIs not usually a political thing certainly government economic decisions influence the market I'm not saying that\nBut what I Am saying is that it's not as clean as just oh this person made this decision so there was a drops now you know what the market is a political the market dropped for all sorts of reasons let's not turn it into a political thing and leverage it as a political weapon to hit our friends with\nThe reality is we need to learn from this because we don't know what's going to happen in the market pleased don't look at\nCurrent policy and assume you can decipher what the market's going to do next\nBecause if you can decipher again what it did in the past and have a nice clean ... explanation that this is why it drops you're going to try to do the same thing and apply that to the future and my friend you're going to fail\nBecause again a month ago we knew about the trade war with China a month ago we knew about interest rates continue to go up and nobody was saying a month ago oh well that's going to lead to this exact thing in fact a month ago we all the economists are saying it's great that we're raising interest rates\nAnd the moment the marketing means of drop oh holy cow or raising interest rates for that's nonsense you got to get off that treadmill so it's moving in something super practical here and that's how do you respond to this the first step of that is how\nHow did your portfolio do here and this is where we get into what I I actually care about okay what I care about is that if this was a test run this was a dress rehearsal of what would happen at the market dropped than all you have to do is look at your portfolio to see how big of an impact that this half\nAnd here's what I Want you to do you can go on line and you can look at how much the U.S will be five hundred dropped\nOkay how much did it drop us just full on a hundred percent American stock or look at the Dow Jones whatever and compare that to how your portfolio dropped\nAnd then you get a feel for when the market drops what is my portfolio do and some of you listening again right now say I I I didn't even notice the market was dropping I don't care look still take a minute today later today when you're not exhausted jump on at your four one K. website your IRA whatever it is\nAnd just glance at an how's it doing\nHow much did it losing the last few days because you need to understand what what happened to my portfolio\nIf we had a full on correction okay if the market had kept going and we don't know my next week we have no idea but at the market keeps dropping if it goes down what happens to my portfolio because so many people listening right now have no clue the level of risk they're taking\nAnd I don't say that in a judgmental way it's a fact and meet with people every single day I sit down and hear their stories intelligent people people that have degrees people that are that no way more than I Do about a range of different things in the world and yet when we look at their portfolios\nThey have no idea the risk they're taking in fact many of them many of you right now would tell me I\nHave hardly any risking my portfolio it's super safe\nI'm pretty darn conservative\nAnd in reality you're incredibly aggressive because your definition of conservative as I only invested in big strong companies guess what big strong companies when the market drops they dropped just as hard\nIt doesn't mean you're not aggressive because you invested in you know coke and Home Depot instead of and penny stocks and in bitcoin\nIs Ninety percent of your portfolio is in stock even if it's a great large companies guess what friend your super aggressive and you need to know that because it has a real tangible practical impact on your dreams and your ability to retire\nOkay and so if you go I have no idea how to tell that well here's how you can tell\nIf you go on to your four one K. and it's dropping as much as the market is dropping overall then that means you have a pretty heavy stock allocation and you can see that when you look at your statement because most statements will tell you the percentage of your money that's in equities\nNow there is a difference and aggressiveness between bitcoin for instance bitcoin turned ten last week something about bitcoin turned ten years old you have for bitcoin down sixty plus percent from last year but it it it it there's a difference in aggressiveness between owning again Home Depot stock in bitcoin\nAnd yet both are still considered aggressive they're just different levels of aggressive\nOkay so when you look at your statement just look for a minute at the percentage of equities you're carrying drop all your conceptions of risk and look at that percentage that percentage is like a ... okay if you've got\nSixty percent of your money fifty percent of your money inequities you're humming along but you're not doing overly fast but of eighty Ninety percent of your money is an equities you have an aggressive portfolio\nThat's not a bad thing but you need to know that because it could be bad for you it's not bad in general it could be terrible for you and you've got to understand it and if you don't and here's the problem that a lot of people don't just have one investment account\nOh don't just have one investment account\nI Can't tell you I was meeting with folks are at a company recently I was doing four one K. training for a company that came in to talk about how did you use your four one K.\nHow do you maximize the effectiveness within the investments you have what does this look like so it's kind of training employees how to do that\nAnd so many people in that room when I started asking them about it had multiple for one case they moved jobs for times they had three old four one K. sitting out they had an IRA sitting out they had maybe an inheritance from a grandparent at all these different accounts spread out well guess what happens when you have six\nDifferent investment accounts between you and your wife is what happens\nYou lose any sense of how much risk you're taking 'cause unless you're some sort of a genius you don't remember exactly how you invested\nFifteen Years ago with an old company but if you never moved your money out\nIt's probably still invest it that way so looking at your four one K. is helpful today it's the first step look at your current investments because you can see\nHow are they doing but what if you have six different accounts and they're all invested differently what if your current four one K. or for three B.\nIs invested pretty conservatively but if I'd go back to the old ones they're super aggressive that means you might be taking a lot more risk than you realize how many of you right now\nHave no clue how much risk you're taking spread across all those different investments if that's where you're sitting right now\nI'm going to pause on this because we come back in the minute I Want to talk about what this means that you're closer to retirement\nVersus if you are right now a younger person 'cause there's two very different responses last week really matters to both of you but if you're someone right now that goes I I really don't know the level of risk taking ... this is the time to figure that out\nBecause when the market drops if you go into your four one K. and you see a loss there and you start going into the other accounts and you see different varying losses one of your accounts dropped three percent in the last week another one dropped eight percent you\nGo holy cow that means you have a risk spread across all different levels you need to know what that is it really matters for your success and that's what we do with our clients\nSomething that they've most of them have never done before we take all of their statements everything from the tiny Roth IRA you started ten years ago because your aunt said it was a good idea all the way the four one K. you left a few months ago now you have a new one and we input all of those investments into one program and tell you from that exactly\nHow much risk you're taking\nSo you can know wow\nI'm actually an aggressive portfolio I had no idea 'cause I I turned it down and my current four one K. but I never changed any of the old ones I'm sitting on an aggressive portfolio and I'm five years from retirement and at the market drop\nI could seriously lose some funds here it could hurt my long term plan\nMany if you have no clue the risk you're actually taking 'cause it's spread out so that is something I Do with people every day we sit and do analysis and are able to tell you this is the risk you're taking and again it's not a good or a bad in general there's nothing wrong with taking a lot of risk\nWhere it's not good is when your plan can't handle it\nSo we can define that clearly objectively for you\nAnd then you know then what action items you need to take which is what we're going to talk about them and how do you respond what do you do but the first thing is understanding how much risk are you taking how did your portfolio respond in the last week so jump on their check it out if you haven't looked at it look at it how much did you lose\nAnd if you don't know or you go I don't know how detailed based on being spread across all these different accounts with Carlos that's what we do jump on my website it's my life is more dot com\nDon't waste this opportunity to know how your portfolio response to risk because the next time when it's not just a few days if it's a full correction you need to be ready for that that is your future\nSo can they afford to be a little more aggressive if they wanted to be sure\nBecause that just really don't need those investments in less than a worst case scenario they can afford to have a little more aggressive but if you have to if you're the majority of people today and most people listening that are close to retirement or in this boat if you uh\nOn having to draw from your investments in order to have income which is the norm okay then you really probably don't have any business being aggressive as you get this close to retirement the five years prior to retirement and that was it was far too moderate I said you really probably no let me take away the moderating words you shouldn't be that aggressive\nIf you have to take income from your investments and you're within five years of retirement you really have no business being invested aggressively and I would put that is really anywhere above about sixty five Seventy percent equities is you don't have business to be there\nNow there are exceptions like I mentioned like my grandparents most people don't have the business to be there but here's the problem\nWe don't realize that because we've been sitting on years and years and years of the market going up now it's snuck up on this case that you need to understand the risk\nAnd if you're close to retirement even if you feel aggressive okay even if you're ...\nAnd if you're close to retirement even if you feel aggressive okay even if you're fine with going after it and you're fine with them to market going down and he didn't even notice\nLast week what was going on I really don't care if you're close to retirement that you personally feel fine with risk I care about what happens to your plan if the market drops I mean I'll be nice about it\nBecomes sit down I'll listen I'll understand why you like aggressiveness but I'm going to tell it to you straight that if you lose twenty or thirty percent\nIt correct your plan even if you're fine with it and that's not okay\nSo you need please don't waste the last few days see the level of risk you're taking and like I said before the break\nIf you're someone who just I just I just don't know because I have so many accounts spread out\nOr I don't know because I never even look at that state and I really don't know how to decipher the risk taking\nThat is where I strongly recommend come and sit down with me sit down or sit down with a plan or that you know and care and trust whatever you need to sit down with somebody to understand in full context how much risk you're taking and what impact that will have on your future\nAnd if you've never done that because a you didn't even think about it you didn't notice you don't care you haven't looked whatever the reason is okay now is the time to do that and there's there's real objective analysis we can do especially based on the droplet just had to tell you where you're at\nAnd that changes the whole picture of our time is if you're close to retirement\nStop everything and make sure you adjusted your risk here's the danger again the danger is that not only have we been sitting on a market that has been up we've been sitting on interest rates that have been down so a lot of people closer to retirement who\nIn the past would have been fined going into a low risk fixed investments\nThat years ago paid pretty well like bonds like CDs that back in the eighties you get double digit returns on your CDs right today interest rates being so low fixed money is just not paying nearly as much that's beginning to change his interest rates increase\nBut it's still not much based on historical context and so a lot of people have said you know what I'm not getting any return on these bombs were not just shift more money into stocks because those are getting great returns and without even realizing it the risk has been going up and up and up\nSo many people I sit down with I Will never forget a gentleman who came in with his wife I asked him how aggressive they were they said we're not very aggressive or moderate investors and when we did all the analysis was able to tell them though you are quite aggressive and you didn't even\nKnow it often is just we don't even know but that doesn't help\nUs if the market drop so if so if you're close to retirement this is a perfect time to look at that and then again if you want that analysis that's what we do with every client that comes in you can go to my website it's my life is more dot com signed up for a free consultation\nWith me Chris Burns or with someone from my team to look at the details of your situation and give your thoughts on this again\nIt's my life is more dot com and I will truly say there is no better time than after the market drops because after the market drops especially especially this is a golden window if it drops but it stabilizes which we don't know next week when it's going to do let's assume it stabilizes\nThen we have this incredible learning experience from the drop without the pain are they true correction and now's the time to make sure your position to do well regardless of what the market does you don't need to risk that kind of loss\nYou need to make sure that your plan is built to handle the next correction we face 'cause it'll happen it will happen All right\nLet's talk about young people for for a little bit here if you're younger and and and and folks that are close to retirement don't to me out here if you have children or grandchildren this is critical and maybe they'll listen to you if you talk about this stuff okay if you're younger I'm Amazed by the number of young people that when the market depths like this\nThey go super conservative\nOften even more than folks that are close to retirement because they they they they know how much it's up there is someone I work with um she faithfully puts money into a rough IRA that that market drops and she sees that balance drop even though she's not planning on touching the money\nFor decades for decades it's still a huge blow because it was a lot of money for her\nPeople forget you know obviously anytime you're saving a lot of money\nOr or saving for the future it's often a sacrifice to save but young people and I mean twenties thirties forties\nWhen you have a family when you don't have much extra you have to make values decisions you have to decide are we going to go on vacation or we're going to say if it's really hard and you know that you're in a minute I've got three kids we have to make those kinds of decisions regularly and it takes sacrifice to choose to save\nRight in the end of a balance but it's not easy\nAnd so I get it when the market goes down if you had the truly sacrifice to put those dollars away I don't want it\nYou've had the truly sacrifice to put those dollars away\nI don't want to downplay that you know if you're twenty five clients\nA few clients in their early twenties and it's incredible to watch them choose to invest money\nAnd all their friends are going out and doing other stuff they choose to save money for the future but if you know the value of that and you've been sacrificing to do it and laboring away and suddenly you see the market drop and you see you know you put in this much money and it's nice that now that is overwhelming and a lot of people go super conservative a lot of young people\nAnd I would just say you've got to change your mindset on investing because this drop in the market is good for you to test your emotions\nAnd getting that there's two sides to this right\nSide one is how do you feel about risk in the second thing we just talked about how does your plan handle risk when we talk about how you feel about risk\nUm it matters a lot more\nFor young people actually hit because young people\nThey're planned the second part of this plant can handle risk look if you're Thirty Years' old right now or forty years old can your plan handle if you're four one K. loses a bunch of money sure even in two thousand eight in a terrible scenario where the market dropped\nForty percent for aggressive investors forty percent drop if you're thirty five years old is your forty years old right now in the market drops by forty percent\nLet me tell you something your plan can handle it in fact not only that\nYour plan will benefit from it because holy cow friends that forty year old listen to me if you were forty in two thousand seven eleven years ago in two thousand eight market dropped forty percent\nOkay where are you sitting now if you were able to if you're again taking your emotion out of it if you stay there and if you kept investing if didn't change anything eleven years later well over three hundred percent growth unbelievable that drop was the best thing ever happened to your portfolio the rebound has made it for you\nYou're on track for retirement because of it\nTalked about this before he did it last week but please don't fall into the trap of thinking a drop in the market is a bad thing it's not a bad thing\nIt just depends on how you respond to it\nIt's the worst thing ever if you pool all your money out in ... lock in those losses it can ruin your future but if you stayed in it and two thousand ain't it could have been the best thing that ever happened to you so your plan can handle the risk but can you and I don't mean that as a challenge\nPeople hear this and go I guess I'm supposed to just be risky I guess I should be okay with it no you're wired a certain way and however you're wired you know whatever your your response to anxiety in the market dropping and how you feel about risk and things like that plays into this and it'd be far better for you to\nReduce some of the risk and be more moderate but stay in the market then to go super aggressive because you hear me talking about it and go on I guess I'm supposed to do that and then you pull everything out that is that is what will kill your portfolio\nFar rather you'd be moderate in your risk but stay in them be super aggressive 'cause you think you're supposed to pull out\nHad a great discussion recently with the younger person about this I said look the market's going to death well here we are right last week it does actually called him during the week is remember that discussion we had um\nAnd he is young so he kind of felt like he should be super risk because all his friends said just go after there'll be aggressive but he kind of told me and quiet well none of his friends were listening I just don't feel great about it I'm just I'm a pretty conservative guy it's like I don't know I don't feel great about the market drop and I said that's great you knowing that is key\nI'm going to guess it's because it's commission account and they want to get paid again and unfortunately that is totally normal in our industry so most likely bill he's paid to be a commissions and that's why you don't see any funds coming out because you already paid a big chunk of money when you bought those funds which just means be very careful\nIf he comes back to you and says we need to move the money soon because there is a dollar tag attached to that for you All right that's all the time we have that they listen if you missed everything else remember this don't waste this week the market dropping this week was a great time for you to evaluate am I ready for the real drop when it happens\nIs my plan going to work ... will be back\nNext week with a whole new show in the meantime this is Chris Burns you've been listening to more than money please remember your life\nAnd your future are so much more than money and we'll see you next week\nW ... er\nCox media group station [noise]\nTwenty four hour news weather and\nFive and am\n\nMorning at six am I'm Robin ... live in this something that's the twenty four

differences often shows us\nHow much we have in common I'm Hondas Presley and on the show today I don't think we got a whole lot in common with some of the folks were going to learn about the day why you asked is because our guest is the author\nDr Ian Smith now you know in because you've seen him on television you seen him on oh oh come on and tell me the show originally yeah I mean we're not married\nOr have really thick glove that's right because you are a health and fitness and lifestyle expert and you've been on the show with us before but it also you are an acclaimed\nWriter you have written a number of bestsellers on the New York times best selling list including the number one shred super shred blessed the sugar out and then I think we talked about your novel the black bird papers well\nYou've taken a break from the shreds series and your back with the ancient nine\nAnd his number one New York times best seller all ready with great blurbs from Michael Eric Dyson Publishers Weekly said this and enticing thriller those seeking an inside look at I at an Ivy League secret society\nWill definitely get their money's worth and you\nDoctor in case Smith were a member of one of these Ivy League secret society's just set the table for us and ... before we get into this really really good book so this is something that you want to read 'em or whatever yeah\nThanks for having me on appreciate it you know I have been writing this book for over twenty five years I started when I was a senior in college uh because I knew at the time though I was not a writer I knew that the story was so unique\nAnd so intriguing that I wanted to share some of my experiences in one of these side is uh with the world at large it was a difficult decision actually to write this book because I didn't want to write an ... on these clubs these calls have been around since the Seventeen hundreds\n... on these clubs these calls have been around since the Seventeen hundreds um they are called final clubs or an hour Harvard's version of six aside is and they had been populated\nAnd remembered by some of the who's who in America both Roosevelt president teddy and Franklin Roosevelt were members of one of the final clubs or President Kennedy his brother's Robert and I'm and Ted Kennedy remembers\nThe great poet TS Eliot was a member Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes junior was a member so you get the picture and very powerful wealthy people have been members and for a long time these clubs or or basically comprised of all male all white male because that's what harbor was at the time\nUh and it wasn't really until about sixties uh when women and minorities were more mentioned university that pressure came on these clubs to admit\nWomen and to admit a African Americans and other ethnic minorities are but this book the ancient nine basically is the first book that's ever\nBeen written that extensively delves behind the walls of one of these clubs now you know I was a member um and I was elected in a very mysterious way or the way you get the way begins it's called the punch by the way as in like what you drink and hitting someone they called the punch and the way it works is\nIn the middle of the night and ... is slipped on your door into your room and when I looked at it there was no postage there was no return address just my name and room number\nAnd I opened it up and it said the president and members of the doubt for club invite you to a cocktail party and here's the location and I had no idea you know I come from a working class family in a small town I didn't know what a cocktail party was by the way uh to be honest with you and so I just figured you know Harvard has so many of these\nKind of do we be intellectual kind of a social organization I just thought it was one of those groups inviting us to like they invited some fairly op or whatever so I just put it to the side\nAnd it wasn't until I was a basketball practice a couple of days later and the guys are changing the lock room and the older guys and the team said this is ... and like and they start talking about this period where these secret societies\nPunch or invite people to begin the process of joining\nOh so you're not immediately in you know get the ladder no\nIf you get the letter that means you're invited to start the process there were nine clubs and each club typically punches about a hundred guys\nAnd then you go through in the book you know you details as then you go through a series of events were after each event\nThe membership holds a meeting and they narrowed down the list so how'd you guys start Seventy five fifty and then between twelve and twenty guys will actually get to the final dinner which is the election of being into the club\nThe sounds a lot like sorority and fraternity rush at most colleges and universities around the United states\nPeople have asked me what's the difference you know final club at Harvard and a sorority and fraternity\nThese clubs have a more formal kind of angle to them or their house and these multi million dollar mansions are that are in Harvard Square in around campus they are owned only by the graduate members and the board so the university doesn't own these clubs\nAnd this is the reason why I mentioned that because these clubs have had come under great fire and the University of has has had problems with them because it can't control the clubs so the university has tried year after year to put pressure to either disband the clubs are open up the clubs in fact last year they've gone to for this ever\nBook has been out a for less than a week and a big time producer has already asked the option to make it into a movie now I mean you know you never know what happens but I'm honored that she felt the story was so compelling that he said cinematography from a cinematic standpoint he could see it on the screen\nYou're talking about these multi million dollar mansions and hidden spaces and dark places in secret society is all guys and and you can figure I can see the conflict in in there and and I'm sure there's conflict in your story what's\nThe latest teases with a twist the characters conflicted\nTo be a guy from the other side of the tracks and joined us worlds he also feels guilty so there is also that level and there's a little love story there of course which I Love he falls in love with a a very beautiful girl who works in the dining hall who doesn't have anything to do with him because he's a Harvard guy and he has he has to try to win her over\nA [laughter] they got all the elements are there so what did you learn about yourself after finishing the ancient nine well\nI've always been writing fiction um since the blackbird papers back in two thousand four it's just that my diet books and health books\nHave been so successful and I'm grateful I don't want to sound on grateful about that but the problem with that success is that your publisher want you to write more of them right so um so for years I've been saying to my publisher we got to publish the engine nine this was a great story it's got to get out and no one's written like this with about these clubs\nUm and so what I learned about myself is that um I have to continue to be tenacious and persistent um and I have to continue to follow my dreams and passionate passionate about\nUm and I have to continue to follow my dreams and passionate passionate about fiction I Love fiction and I can do both I can do nonfiction and fiction like you don't have to be right side or left side you can be dual sided\nAbsolutely in case you're just joining us we're talking to after Ian Smith in case Smith again you know him from the ... and super shreds you've seen them on television on Rachel Ray the view and other shows his new book out just more than a week\nIs a novel the ancient mind about the final clubs the secret societies and America's Ivy League schools written\nIt's fiction but as a member of one of these final clubs you've got a little behind the scenes experience where you conflicted in your experience back in the eighties with once your punched and got to the process where you say yes or no does anybody ever actually say now\nRarely because you go through the whole process to get in and what I thought well what what bothered me mostly at the time was I didn't want to be the kind of member that came from a group that typically doesn't get in and then forget that everyone else on the outside\nIt's easy by the way when when you come from a group that is typically not allowed or excluded and you happen to pass through the doors in anything and this is not just these clubs but it's easy to get through those doors and be like oh I made it everything's great with the world but it's not because luckily left behind\nAnd so I was conflicted a you know as a student because I was friends with all kinds of people all different levels of income and race and religion so I was conflicted that you know what does it say about me that I'm joining us this club and that's part of the reason why I wrote the story because I felt like I should tell the story um and and have it get out there and not by the way to\nPunish my club I had a great experience but just to say this world exists and maybe these doors should be open to more people\nBut right now they're not do you think they ever will\nYes I think they have to I think that the younger generation\n... the younger generation has taken over these clubs and the graduate members or be or younger now that the ... and I think that eventually they're going to have to vote ... women in and they're going out to vote more diversity and they should I mean it's this is the world we live in and I think these clubs\nAs interesting as they are our anachronism there from a an era gone by and they should open up\nThe question the question also is whether or not women want to be in these clubs\nYou know that's another question you have to ask they should still have the right to but I don't think everyone wants to join this clubs\nYou know because guys are being guys and a certain things that college guys do that nobody needs to know about you and women are probably do not interested in but I Do think that women and other people don't don't get and they do miss out on that that networking they really do a because\nWe have dinners when the alarms comeback for dinners were rubbing shoulders with people who are running the running the country which\nBrings us to a current event Brett Kavanaugh now Brett Kavanaugh didn't go to Harvard but he did go to Gail where likely a member of one of the secret society these final clubs who end up as you say leaders in the country and in in ... I don't know what do you what are your thoughts on all of\nThat well I think that you know um Bush was a member to a father a Bush when he was a member of of of skull and bones and so you also has these societies a Princeton\nHas eating clubs they used to be secret society but they actually voted to go coed so women can go into the Princeton clubs but you know these seekers aside as these clubs are relics\nYou know they are of a time when um it was believed that exclusivity was the way to remain on top\nOkay and um there was a lot of inbreeding in the sense of we went to eggs are together and we went to Deerfield all these places that the average person doesn't even know exist by the way all these prep schools\nOr or I Would I say like you know it's the first time I learned that you could use winter as a verb\nYou know we went through in Florida [laughter] so [laughter] so this is the this is a lot that you're talking about and and um I think that you know I don't know Kavanaugh opposite personally but I but\nWhat I see him though my first thought when I saw him and I heard he went to Yale\nI could see him being in one of their secret society's just because they see it as a side is actually produce and breed people who attained very lofty positions\nWhat are your obligations to the club as an alarm\nIt's pretty much you know it's elective so there are some members who grabbed members who are very involved there are some who are occasion involved in his own every involved again and and the way you get involved as you donate like I say these clubs are owned by the club not the university there self funded\nI'm so you raise money um you host in the book Spencer Collins the young character he goes to a series of events and one of them as a New York dinner\nWhere they fly them down to New York for dinner and so on alone will host a dentist\nFly them down to New York for dinner and someone alone will host a dinner like that so it's so the alum stay involved in different ways\nHow do you think your life would be different had you not then punched into your final club\nI I think my life actually would have been the same to be honest with you but I think that the things I learned in observed in the final clubs\nOr were able to broaden my horizons and it gave me a better understanding of the nuances of differences and and where we all come from a and how we're able to reach our destinations\nYou know I'd have to work my whole life very hard you know as you have a and so and I'm not afraid of I Love hard work I was taught that\nBut there are some people in this world\nUm where the work does not have to be as hard because of who they are and what their name and that's just kind of I'm not whining about it that's just the way it works you know my kids are going to have an easier time than I had because you know dad and mom and worked hard and have a a cheese in love with success so that's how it works but\nIt was good for me to learn that then so that if I was up for example I make this up above up for a job and didn't get it\nI wouldn't think I didn't get it 'cause I'm no good and they're all kinds of reasons why you may lose out on something that you don't even know about\nWhat do you want readers to take away from besides just a great thrilling read in a tremendous story from\nReading the ancient nine\nReaders to um take away from it that that there are all kinds of worlds out there um that they are unaware of that exist and sometimes in a vacuum\nAnd they're going to continue to exist that way and I just want we readers to have fun to have a peak\nI wanted to pull back the curtain so you can see inside like I ... I and I want you to feel how I felt when I went through this as a kid who came from nothing\nOn the other side of the tracks I Want you to feel that and I describe you know the scenes and the the geography of Harvard one of the best compliment someone gave me what they said they felt like I was right there on camp I was on campus and I went into that room that you were in and that's the biggest compliment to a to a writer\nIndeed it is the book is the ancient nine the author is the New York times best selling author after in case Smith I always get to see and my friend\nAlways good to see you and found in ... Dr Ian Smith spell the doctor out our [noise]\nPerspective and a half hour we produce in mind\nIf there's something you think we ought to be talking about let\nMay ... condo twenty nine on Twitter\nA

especially if you're on a fixed income it can only spend a certain amount of dollars every month to Sicily to get treated a gift feeling better and actually get your life back in the you know that take care of take care of business and a good example of that is I had a fellow who was\nIn my office in South Georgia he had a backyard tree and he used to work for UPS or these delivery companies and and he couldn't work anymore because of his back and he couldn't afford to have insurance who couldn't afford to get surgery or things done\nSo it's not only was he in pain all the time that could afford to give it didn't treat but I'm no surgery things like that and so he stuck to it was terrible but we were able to help that we're able to do an injection off his back and he was able to get back to work and now he's a\nMaking you know do it while it is\nYou know paid off as a treatment and happy as can be 'cause he was\nPacked with people ask you the question about the stem cell therapy treatment and they ask is it painful does it strike you as odd that someone who was experiencing great pain all the time would worry that getting healthy might hurt as well and actually for the injection how long you're the needle\n[laughter] good question what will people hate needles so that's why they always get that question you know when they know that we use or do you do for an ejection the get concerned about that but um it's a very ... you know it's a short needle in a ditch and a half but the most and we you know depending on where we're jak take\nMy skull at part of that way and um and that that's it it's a\nIt's a little spray called ... or add that to the ... is to provide some anesthesia but a ... ... people do fantastic they are always surprised so simple it out and see the treatment is and it's a quick injection it's not something where you're sitting in their\n... you need for a long period of time so\nFor a long period of time so it's a it's really not bad at all\nAnd as you said during the seminar presentation where you talk about the work that you all are able to do you get a chance to share with with your attendees some stories from real patients who had been through your clinic and Marie is one of those let's listen to what Murray has to say\nTelling me about your um how you felt before you came to see it before I came\nTo see how I was walking on a stick in a Walker I couldn't bend down I was having a lot of difficulty moving and now I was getting worse and worse [noise]\nAnd uh I refused to have a back surgery 'cause everybody I talked to was not happy with the results [noise] so this was a great shot and we hit experimented around talking to a lot of other people in your program sounded the best wonderful so\nTell me what you would you weren't able to do a few months ago that she can do now [noise]\nI couldn't bend down I couldn't walk fast I had to hold on every time I get up and down I had to use a when I go out I got to walk with a cane I couldn't turn past it was just having great ... many issues with movement now is in constant pain [noise]\nAnd when did you when did you start noticing a big change\nWell after about three months I started to notice that the numbness from my hips down seemed to be moving down and now it's just down to my toes agree and I got feeling and that was not normal but it's a whole lot better\nYeah and you had your vaccine what was it before and was that Maliki\nWas like well back then before yeah\nIt was a ten before and now I'm Down between a zero in a one\nWow fantastic and so we're kind of things can you do now you weren't able to do before\nI can do everything now that I used to do Twenty years ago there's nothing I can do that I haven't found anything I can do I walk I Do exercise used to ride a bike repair our bikes but you know there's nothing I feel I can do I'm thinking about trying to go bowling again oh wow see how that does yeah\nBut I you know I feel like I'm up to it now feel like a tough to everything you know I'll be Seventy six shortly and I feel like I'm fifty no problems there\nI'm just ... show me how how well how well you could move before your treatment what kind of limitations had\nI had been down this far I could turn like this [noise]\nAnd when I work at the raw scene where the campaign or a Walker was very difficult getting in and out of a car it was just becoming a real issue for me this was a whole year you'd been for a whole year and it was just getting worse and worse wow\nThe shows how you can move now can you bend down now right now I can get down\nWiped the floor I can jump up and down [laughter]\n[laughter] you know turn I sit down and jump up getting in and out of the car it again and you know more came uh oh so I'm doing great and then you know you said it'll get better and better uh nine months so you're doing a fantastic there's nothing I won't be able to do\nSo Dr Rick obviously our radio audience couldn't see Murray as he was describing what was happening to him but tell me when he said you know before the stem cell therapy he could been like this and then of course we heard him jumping up and down and basically dancing in your office afterwards\nHow how limited was his range of motion\nYeah does he get he was using that chain and the Walker so that gives you that yet that's how you just said well she was a kitten you know walk straight you have to put all his energy it taking one step at a\nWith a walk at a at a severe mad at eight and his back and said well it was just terrible for you couldn't get it out our varies a drive\nUp the street or Jody quick but that ... get baby turned thirty degrees to the last thirty right that was at ... or it might be able to like\nTwenty thirty degree seats it definitely can embed doubt it shoots or do anything like that before that when he\nSaid that after part of the south but he was actually a ... a guy every direction like ... ... to the left all the way to the right it reached out of touch just chose\nA rabbit and he actually was jumping up and down which was that when they say that for the first shuttle style of such a difficult for someone who was a tragedy jumping up and down it is I Believe so\nJumping up and down and violence is unbelievable so those are some of the things he was able to do with it it's a it's just a corrupt Bullock he goes to\n... um that that's the kind of things that we see in my office every day and it's just it's so so ah [noise] ah it's hard to try to put it to where it just says that brings a tear to my job I like about it but it's just heart warming and uh\nIt's why I became a doctor to help people I've never been able to help people so effectively as ... this is just the best most powerful treatment I could after Trey buff muscles basis which is you know so it's impossible to pick up that combination but such dumps out there who makes that happen\nAnd Dr Rick ... and we've had this conversation before but they're always new listeners who will say this to town a little too good to be true how can this be so I ask you your fans too good to be true how can this be\nYeah no ... well that sounds like\nA split that's and that's why we love people coming to seminars so they can actually see this for themselves or they can actually see Mr Kurtz Bert\nJump up and down and do all this is where they do before or any of the other testimonials for people to say that they they got their lifestyle so uh you know it's it's sad powerful that effective treatment so ... you know that's lives is is really the best way for us to show people that is through\nChurch testimonials true you know someone is actually have the treatment or a telling people how much they are now that they're

Evans who just over a year ago became the senior pastor of first for his history in church in Marietta, Georgia\nFor six years before that he was senior pastor of first Presbyterian Church in Columbia, Tennessee Joes a graduate of Presbyterian College and Clinton South Carolina and urges master of divinity at slumber you see a logical seminary indicators Georgia Joelle from day one\nLike you said a tragedy here you've been a regular preacher on day one since twenty eleven but the last time you are with us you were just about to make the move to first first jury in church of myriad of the church you grew up in\nWhat's it been like for you to go back home is the senior pastor\nIt has been incredible [laughter] this Sunday school classroom still smell exactly [laughter]\nAnd a lot of the same folks around Mrs correlate my third grade Sunday school teacher who is still an active member she is in worship every Sunday as is as are several members of the church who I remember very well\nThe church has changed them but the spirit is exactly the same I I felt nurtured there as a child and as a member of the youth group\nIt's really where the foundation of my face was established and to be back there as the pastor is\nTruly an honor every day as a gift\nFirst Presbyterian uh Marietta is an active church with a wide range of ministries to members into the community and to the world what are some of the ways that the church is serving God's kingdom\nA real point of pride in the congregation is at one of the oldest after school programs in the state of Georgia is still active in vibrant in the congregation\nJose ah like our God just won't let the relationship in\nAnd Bible studies on this passage of heard women and men identified with God as the divine takes on even more human or super human attributes and the eleventh chapter\nSeveral years ago a woman named Mrs Jane in words pronouns that this is a mother talking here and Jose ah\nWhen Israel was a child I loved him and out of Egypt I called my son\nBut the more call them the more they went from me yet it was I who taught at frame to walk I took them up in my arms\nHours to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks\nThis does sound like a mother to me or grandmother the God of grandmother who loves her grandson so much that's even love the little greasy hand friends they leave all over her sliding glass doors and won't clean them off because of how much she loves the greasy little hands who put them they're\nThe kind of mother who can't help but by the little cheeks of her daughter\nSmell that little smell that only comes from her baby girl the kind of mother or grandmother or a father and grandfather who remembers lining up the cheerios on the couch cushions so that the baby would pull up and shuffled down step by step\nCheerio to cheerio until little Israel could walk\nAnd the couch is still there years later even in those days when he doesn't come around because he has other people to impress the couch\nIs still there even in those days when the baby now grown seems to think only of himself\nThe couch is still there\nIf he falls farther and farther down the pit of drugs or alcohol crime or indiscretion oh God still looks at that couch and remembers the baby we used to be even if we've forgotten who we ever war and I walk so far away from the light\nEver war and I walk so far away from the light that we can see our way back home\n\nAnd this moment it's easy for us to believe that our God will be lock our sixth grade girl friend\nConsidering all the wrong we've done it's easy to believe that God will just is us a bill of divorce and be done with us\nSo I've known plenty of people who've been to a church their whole lives completely sure that they're going to hell the only question is how soon\nBut we read here in Jose ah God saying something different\nMy people are bent on turning away from me\nBut how can I give you a\nHow can I hand you over my heart recalls within me\nMy compassion grows warm and tender for I Am God and no more though\n\nI Believe that too often we miss understand but love really is\nAnd I say so because I miss understand it all the time last July my mom sent me a birthday card\nAnd on the front of a card as this little boy was his bike helmet on any pushing his little blue bike up a gravel road\nAnd the card says son sometimes I find myself smiling just remembering something you said when you were little and as a big part of\nMe that expected to open that card to read the words but then you became a teenager and you're hurt me again and again and again\nBut instead you know what the carts ed and today\nI just hope you know how very much I Love you and how grateful I Am to call you my son\nNow that's kind of a miraculous card but this kind of miracle isn't so far away\nAnd I say that because I Know there are some of you who have known friends to cut ties with you maybe even friends that you've had to cut ties with\nTheir maybe children who are you still love but you don't ever see parents who you loved at one time and wonder if you still do there may be\nWives listening now who have been issued that certificate of divorce tossed aside like yesterday's news\nAnd that there are husband's listening who have loved in laws didn't want to tell that poet Alfred lord tennis and then he's crazy thinking that it's better to have loved in law so never to have loved\nIt all I Know there are people here are don't feel worthy of the love of God\nBecause they've learned about divine love based on human love but the love of God is more and the guy who wants to lift you up to his cheek who've been down to you and said you can't just walk away\nYou say\nWe're talking here about a lot of that will not let me go of grace greater than all of us in the love of a father who waits at the window praying to see his prodigal son return home\n\nLike Jose yeah here is quoting that great Sam Cooke song when he sings to the woman who treated him bad but still he things if you ever changed your mind\nAbout leaving leaving me behind worrying it to me wearing your sweet love and bring it on home to me\nBecause we're talking here about the love of God who can't just walk away from the baby who learn to walk and heard Dan regardless of the mistakes that he's made or the man he's become\n\nAnd I say that there's a God according to the book of Jose ah\nBut is this you is this me having been love\nLike this by the living God can we love like this while we are living\nCan we begin to forgive the ones who hurt us the most because if God is in the business of giving us what justice would it be for you or me to just go around cutting people off\nYou or me to just go around cutting people off\nAnd we let go of the old her and say we should because for you and me God already has\nBecause of this wondrous love we have to start moving on\nAnd even if there's no going back to the way things used to be remembered those strong words of Dr Martin Luther king junior I have decided to stick with love\nHate is too great a burden to bear so having received the love of God the amazing miraculous divine love of God\nWe must all be so bold to embody the words of collections\nSeeking what is above putting to death whatever in you is earthly loving not as the world\nLoves but loving as God loves we must get rid of anger right\nMalice slander and abusive language from our mouths stripping away our old sales and clothing ourselves with new cells [noise]\nAccording to the image of our creator [noise]\nFor a while some may have treated us like a sixth grade sweetheart\nThe love of God and garage Jesus our lord\nIs I Love that never in [noise]\nOur day one preacher today was the Reverend Joe Evans senior pastor of first Presbyterian Church in Marietta, Georgia for a free printed transcript of his message when Israel was a child colas toll free at one eight eight eight\nFour one one ... one that's eight eight eight four one one three to nine one or write to him I said day one twenty seven Fifteen peach tree road Atlanta Georgia three on three o five\nWho does have the privilege to define\nThe nation's identity\nWho gets to decide our\nIdentity\nI mean it's a really appreciate this inquiry I think we have to acknowledge the fact that we are reaping the fruit of philosophical liberalism which for the past century or so has undermined the ideas of essential ism and foundational is on them and I'm going to say something about those in just a moment but starting\nWith Plato and up until about the end of the nineteenth century in church that's a really long time\nFor that period of time religion\nAnd politics and the whole of society\nNormalized and codified the dominant cultural and political forces of the day they codified in they normalize\nThose cultural and political forces understanding of what true human existence actually looks like\nThey try to answer the question for the world's\nWhat is the essence of human is what is essential in human identity\nAnd until a little over a century ago these dominant forces and cultural powers\nHad definitive answers for that question\nWhiteness was\nUnquestionably normal\nProtestantism was unquestionably normal western educational economic and political structures and institutions were unquestionably\nNormal heterosexuality was unquestionably normal gender roles were unquestionably normal male illness was unquestionably normal as an aside is not lost on me that I fit in most of these categories\nAnd that which was deemed normal\nThat was codified and that was promoted as essential\nTo human\nIdentity I'd\nBe remiss if I didn't say that I Believe the fruit of\nPhilosophical liberalism is not sour\nAnd societal freedoms empowerment and inclusion that isn't Curtis especially in our nation over the years that which\nAnd inclusion that isn't Curtis especially in our nation over the years that was still needs to occur and evolve in time in my opinion I think only unknown see aids the accent of God's creativity\n\nThe creativity that by intent promotes a plurality of witness a plurality of of experience of her out of the of human expression\nThat I sincerely believe I Believe this theologically that is\nBy God's very designed by God's intention I Believe that plurality and I believe that diversity brings glory to God's because God created\nEverything everything\nEven so we live in this post foundational age and it come to any sort of agreement on what is essential identity for our nation\nLet alone the entire planet\nSeems to be an impossible task\nRight 'cause then all of our diversity and all of our God intended and gone to God designed plurality and the welcomed the construction of what was normalized and then lord over people who didn't fit all of those categories is there actually something\nWe can say that is foundational to human existence Sunday ... to human identity will church this morning I Believe that there is something to be said here\nI think the scriptures prophetic Lee and pass surely speak to this very question\nI think they speak in such a way that promote promote a particular essential Islam\nAnd essential isn't that are I Believe shape our ethical\nLives that shape how we interact\nWith other human beings and every sphere of our existence not just in our religious existence but in our politics in in our economy in the environment and our social settings in our schools and every place I Believe this word\nThat comes to us today speaks to every sphere of our lives when it pertains to this question of essential identity\nEssential humanness for in our text from some aid so worthwhile that the writer fevers repeats then again some aid speaks to this question and says this what are human beings that you are mindful of them\nMortals that you care for them to get us made them a little lower than God you're crown them says the writer with glory and honor we get cute and call it the three sees\nRight the three sees according to some at every human being is created by God and every human being is cared for by God and every human being is crowned with\nGlory and honor by God even the most heinous of centers even those who live and act like the anti Christ right before our eyes\nEven those who don't believe or reject the notion of the existence of God still by God's Grace just design has put this imprint on every human being says the ... every human being carries this essence\nThe notion of being crowded with glory and honors the turn of phrase that they mean something like this that God has a high opinion of what God creates God has a high opinion about God creates even though as we have a low opinion of and I have a list of those people\nOnes that I have a low opinion of the ones we hold in low regard God\nAttributes in scandal\nAttributes high esteem\nHighest theme\nDon't leave today believing anything less than this that you and why and every human being on this planet\nIs created\nBy God\nYou moved to the book of Hebrew is that the writer digs deep and begins to invite us to think about the work of Jesus said play and there's some and the and the writer says a Jesus actually takes on this form leaving his status above the angels for a human status and he demonstrates\nGod's love for the whole world not just our corner of the world but the whole world and he lives in he dies and he's he's raised for the world\nWhat is the outcome of this sacrificial act I mean the logically speaking we could name several\nIn fact I mean the logically speaking we could name\nSeveral of several things several components in terms of the advocacy of Jesus' life death in his resurrection what are the outcomes of that for human history but not just for human history but for your life and in my life and and hubris to eleven invites us to think of one of those outcomes and they put it like this\nAll of us the writer says the entire human race our siblings to Christ did you catch that and he brings to\nFive or sorry to eleven\nThat we're all siblings to Christ we're Christ brothers and sisters we are all children of God this is essential for the writer of Hebrew is it is an essential outcome of the cross and the resurrection of Jesus Christ is foundational to who we are\nIt is our essence siblings to Christ himself\nThat the table that has set before us on this world convenience Sunday as a table that is set in many places of worship across the globe\nAnd make no mistake it is a family table\nIt's not a denominational table\nIt's not a political table in terms of uh affiliations it's not a table that is a base on ZIP Code or or your field logical convictions it's based on who God is it's a four taste of God's kingdom\nIt's a picture of what got intense not just to be done in the sanctuary but what God intense for us to do out in the world that in sameness and distinction we come forward together\nBecause we're one family brothers and sisters in the household\nOf God and one of the things we do and this is gonna sound so simple and maybe in some ways try but one of the things that we do to demonstrate something different to the world is that in our distinction and in our sameness we keep showing up at the

and take risk question I Ruth how are you\nHey I'm pretty good thank you for taking my call leisure what we do for you\n[noise] okay so I just got some new contacts and I went to the ... and got new contacts sane once I've been using for years I think their air objects and said oh\nYou're just a one I Can't say I was ...\nWearing them for years and years probably Twenty years now and now I have this thing with my left eye where it is my left eye lid and it and if I wear my contacts to laws both eyelids will start to it they swell up where\nThey get rid of Bijan ophthalmologist an opposite I'm a every eye doctor you could imagine plus a regular doctor been treated for being a guy and nothing seems to help and I'm just wearing glasses now\nAre so you've actually made the decision yourself how you're going to be treated and and yet it right and you would prefer to wear contacts but yeah you just can't get a satisfactory outcome from them because of the symptoms that because you're right and\nThey say it's allergies and so I'm like where did this come from\nThe time they do have to take a few steps back before you can go forward and re around really diving into the ET allergy of it and figuring out of their cause that causes it at at figuring out whether it's allergies whether it is a chronic inflammation whether you have some other underlying\nProblem that may trigger this and it may be worthwhile\nAnd I know you said you'd see a number of ophthalmologist the coming in for another opinion to be able to dive in a little\nThe number of ophthalmologist the coming in for another opinion to be able to ... dive in a little deeper and figure out what the cause of the year specific problem as far as I'm guessing though this is not uncommon\nWith who is going to write I did research it on the Web ...\nHold on I I appreciate your input but I've actually got doctors here so let me let me answer that question now that it's going to say I hate\nThat sometimes I have to be the messenger that you know someone successfully weren't contact lenses for twenty Thirty years and start developing problems\nAnd I think just like give us a looting too that we slowly developed conditions like dry\nAnd believe it or not even though you've lived in the same climate for year after year there can be allergy season for allergy issues ... develop allergies as adults media has lots of good testing for that so the issues you if you're developing some of these other occupy surface problems and plus you're putting on the foreign substance like a contact lens ... some of these additives things together can really caused problems\nWere really the best thing is to take a break I I think it's great you decided to do that and\nHopefully what time do you make you'll up enough where you could try to to reintroduce your contacts and I thought there were actual conditions where contact lens where it's just just lost the ice tolerance to the foreign [noise]\nAbsolutely yeah so there's a a kind of a famous one it used to be a lot more person with a ... foot giant ... is one that the you know we're always going to look on the lookout for yeah just basic ... can happen just was contact lens use\nAnd there are treatments to it also you can be evaluated and figure out the specific cause and I know you said that you've seen a number of doctors but so it's having patience with the patient\nAnd figuring out you know exactly what the trigger is for you that will help guide your individual treatment maybe where you need to go and maybe taking a little bit

Ruth I'm asking the doctors hold on there but I Know\nThere's kind of hear it that we use that are not in the insurance companies and Medicare and the governing body it's allow us to determine whether something is medically necessary or elective\nOkay okay I\nI just want you to know that I have taken some steps I'm switching a\nSailing solution to try it out once a week I wear my contacts and see how they feel and I've switched out or two at hypo allergenic it's supposed to be an article allergenic a solution and then my next step is maybe go to another contact lens\nSo I'm just curious because what I heard from the doctors it might be good to take a break and and it was last week that that as the patients are do you have a break is oh wait a week and doctors [laughter]\nDominant idea like doctors idea of a break in six weeks or three months and I think you may be on a different you know you have thought there so how long it break when would you have suggested if it's really gonna be a bright yeah it's pretty severe or else I'll keep people up\nDid you have to be if it's really going to be a Brit yeah it's pretty severe or else I'll keep people out for two or three months and you know maybe hit him with steroid eye drops for a while to just to calm down information\nAnd at the same time they're looking for the cause of the problems so that we can prevent it and the future and allow them to have successfully used in the future\n[noise] okay All right and so cannot where I make up as well as thrown out my makeup twice no three times now\n[laughter] I was a young man and I remember hearing is that likely to say about make up as a woman it doesn't bother me to answer I\nJust want to where I make that so I you know I definitely think as long as you're saying out of the contact lenses your eyes are coming down in the immediate you know they're not currently swollen I think occasionally I make abuses probably okay as long as you wipe it off as soon as you can yeah I'm\nNot really against China against people wearing makeup I feel like people women it's really important to our daily life wearing makeup and I think that they're great products out there to remove makeup and make sure that the cleaning up there on the pilot is done our\nGroup and they were great I really appreciate the call you and the interactivity uh hopefully have some good food for thought here and we're going to take a break and when we come back with a lot more callers and more to cover with our guest stay with us folks\nThe news [noise]\nThree forty eight in the corporate carrier W like be twenty four hour traffic center a travel advisory continues up in Cobb County ... county actually ... blocked by construction\nNorth south from del ... rode the exits to and from Seventy five north down to the north and south ... those are shut down as well to write lines close Seventy five south down from highway twenty down to exit two eighty three Emerson Altoona road and rightly shutdown somebody by north than on the opposite side\n... to ... mount ... up to highway twenty use highly forty one or the express lengths they're currently heading north bound right now as an alternate to rightly delta block westbound on the outer loop to let planes blocked east on on the in early ... five between cob parkway and Seventy five that's causing heavy delays there as well Jill Nelson W.

eight seven to\nZero seven fifty but worried them back to the calls\nI wanted to take him in it because the reason these redux er here is their ... their respective practices has done something which is\nSomewhat novel and yet also the beginning of a trend that we're going to see more and more of an healthcare and that's that they formed kind of an integrated delivery system for our health and it's called ice shelf partners\nAnd so guys tell me a little bit about it at least what you know about it so who wants to lead us off\nI'll start um I felt partners started with Georgia I partners which is reading his practice and ... had an idea of how can we bring doctors\nWith integrity and build our practice so that we can have growth in Atlanta and be competitive\nHe also brought in a private equity company to help us form this company together and then each of the practices that they've asked to join has helped us to grow into that larger practice but also with the idea that we have goals that are uniform that we can work together\nNow each of the practices\nRetained his identity correct and and none of the practices directly competed against each other but there are ... ... do they do the same they some of the same services but they weren't competing geographically\nRight we're all in different locations around the city and state but they're also all are they also all specialized ophthalmologists practices are awesome algae practices that have specialty care as part of what they do it's a mix it's a mix and and how many practices are part of the ice at partners group as I've right now there's\nHours there's Georgia right now there is and there are multiple groups that are under ally so I think by the end of this year there may be nine to ten practices that become part of the ice south so it's growing rapidly despite the fact that we're still in our in the ... and ... and\nIs there is there a number is there a magic number that you guys would like to see is is is bigger better or is there there is there a sweet spot I think\nThe key is selecting the right practices that have a similar practice philosophy that we do I mean we're looking for a very high quality providers um people are not just interested in and you know perhaps just being more efficient are making more money but you're the integrity of the physician is really the main thing that we're looking for had live and know that\nWe spend a lot of time together and uh you know I could say I mean we research each other quite a bit so we have similar forensic connection\nSo it was on your within your individual practice is they are representative\nYes yes so in each practice there is usually a leader\nAnd the practice that helps reach out to the other doctors and figure out what coming out is that we had and what kind of um types of practice that we have in terms of ethics the way we treat patients and the way we care about our employees and goals for the future so you know I ran a large practice uh\nI didn't I didn't disclose that much I mean I'm thinking about like so when when\nThere's a new entry being proposed um is it coming down to your level Gail arenas are are your are the scene is a senior doctors representative like telling you know all the docks five seven whatever the number is and the practice that here's the list of the groups you know that ... that you know we would like to\nSee added that there are being approached I have a board and so it started to those leaders who are on the board and they are investigating and evaluating the practices and talking with the doctors to find out what the core of that new practice might be for you guys all things this was a good thing actually\nAverage you know this the more you grow the more issues locally that you tend to have and this is an amazing way to consolidate a lot of the behind the scenes administrative work that we just don't have the time 'cause we want to be involved in patient\nCare factors can be doctors we gotta go to break we'll be back and take more of your questions when we come down\nTo argue scared of the ones just before your lights go out who knows how long you'll be

I'm so glad you all are they're spending your youthful Sunday to help all of us\nOh thank you we we do enjoy this do we did have quite a bit of time before we came into the studio shown you have a question for the ducks\nAnd yes I Am a mano vision many in vision person [laughter] I say that because I got them on a vision lenses after my cataract surgery and I love them I I'm\nI second that late each call just before me that it's been in and and\nJust before me that it's been an unbelievable improvement\nGreat us would love to hear absolutely in my doctor was wonderful um heat Dr Crowder I don't know if you know him that he was wonderful creditor\nYes excellent anyway I was aware after my second surgery I'm On the second I that the reason I say ... as I'm One of those people that have that margin thing that appears when you look down or up\nOr too extreme right or left\nA mark anybody know what that is that merging know can you explain that old but more for us for us\nWell if you know the little minions they have that circle around there I and that's kind of what I have\nThe ... movie the despicable me movie return George Guidall like your glasses sometime Diller right\nI have mano menu and vision and I explain this\nTo Dr Crowder and he says well let's let's watch it and see if it gets\nBetter and ... was your cataract surgery a year a year ago\nI have to go back for my one year resistant with him\nSo certainly we're going to address this margin ... Jews being outside the margin or just there's like a a center of clarity and then as you get more peripheral you lose that clarity\nThe only thing I can compare it to end the call screener and I did this comparison 'cause they have some vision issues too and they work context show which you hold the contact up to make sure it's not inside out you can see this little margin around it's like the dish\nAnd it's almost like that's the margin that I see when I Do extreme focusing\nLike looking up I see it right now on both eyes on the lower corner of my I if I look to the right on the run I\nServed soda is we used to have more it's just like a line you just see alone no\nNo it's a circular like a mini in like\nThe circle [laughter] you've done everything you've had to explain it to us this is one of those you know it's difficult when you know you can't share um red wine and\nWhen I ask how these things are just so topsy is and sometimes after cataract surgery that's a really fancy word for funny things that we see after cataract surgery and it's an interesting phenomenon that people do see different from a natural God given lines than they do an artificial lens so there are some things that\nYou we mentioned the word ... adaptation earlier and there are some things that just go away with time and then there are some things that just don't go away with time\nStill live in a way like how would the frequency as at least ... would you come dystopia is not just the tops yeah there there are talks that are reflections off of an artificial ends and plants\nAnd that may be what they like it's often described as a crescent and the periphery and that maybe are minion vision is that it looks like there is an arc or crescent that's in the periphery\nYes and it's dark\nYes and that's not and completely uncommon thing although obviously it's not the most kind of thing we see with post cataract surgery patients\nSo she's a year out and you talk we've talked about ... adaptation and a year would you expect that if she was going to adopt she would have in this would be something that she's going to have\nYes I Would expect that she would have adapted and that sometimes they don't go away but sometimes there are things that you can do to make it better like certain types of glasses especially singer monitor vision it may be neutralizing near I when you're looking at things distance may help for the brain for both ice to work together as opposed to separately\nWell we are not going to do that but we want to do with it [laughter]\nUm I Love I Love my mama vision contacts in the past I'm a singer and all I wanted\nTo do is be able to read my sheet music from arms length away\nBut um and I do have that and my distance is like an eagle so I'm just going to deal with it but um\nI understand after researching it on line that this is an issue and some particular lenses that are used in the process of the anti Russian during the cataract surgery some lenses are more susceptible to this issue\nSome people have even gone and ... seconds surgeries which I'm not going to do\nThere's always a trade off you can trade one problem for another\n... not doing that I like I like exactly I'll be in many an amount of vision person for the rest of my life\nRight to blaze is going to say goodbye because we got a lot of calls holding thanks for sharing that with us root could I have always do that yes I think it's so important that you know we just heard this from brought up this God given ones that we have which I think most was bill is like the perfect Sandra vision you know if we didn't record correction is Fifteen year old twenty year olds\nWe still don't have one single implant wins the can provide the same level of of clarity detail and range of vision is that what we're born with and so all these different ones and plan options we have are still tremendous but they do have a little ...\nSo all these different ones and plan options we have are still tremendous but they do have little nuances are trade offs and to me that's the fun part is kind of figuring out what each person what is the right because ... choice of lens for this one individual\nAnd let them know hey here or the nuances which you could expect what you may or may not see but as long as they're wearing their comfortable you know a lot of times we can deliver happy all comes to them\nAnd I think really the key is setting expectations as he mentioned earlier\nThat guy's\nLasers actually call thank you so much I appreciate your work\nAre moving on and see we got time for one more kind of fits in here let's talk to\nDestruct and Hi Anne\nThank you for taking my call\nYou're very welcome some is getting tight on time can you get your question thirty seconds [noise]\n... um my relatives had cataract surgery on one eye and she never wanted to have it on the other night now she has health issues is there anything that can make our quality of life better\nAbsolutely so there's definitely a lot that can be done to improve vision a and the other eye that hasn't been able to undergo cataract surgery\nYou know a visit to her I'm sure it would definitely help maximize the classes and then you can see as well as she can into this and get a good pair of reading glasses that you can read it that's a cheap you know like to do it\nWould be important to know what are the things that she likes to do so that we can give her the appropriate tools that she can maximize whatever vision she does have until she's able to be well enough to get the cataract surgery\nOkay All right well they don't mind ... lovely\nVersion of call All right so it's interesting because the one the lens has been impaired\nAnd the classic cataract right to even named cataract comes from the white of the water I'm In a rapid ... you know and and and turning water because the lens would go from clear to white like it was like like water is white in that environment at the Latin and Greek root right so um\nAnd so if you've got a white led to the lenses ... then\nSo I understand that it's a progression right yeah but there's not really I mean ... you maximize\nVision because if the ... the lenses also bending the light and if he can't bend the light name or you can do that with glasses you can't let more late in\n... there's a there's a limit to how much you can maximize\nAnd and so it was interesting to me because as we're having a conversation this sounds like it's an outpatient procedure we've had these calls at ...\nLike what ... it seems like you can be pretty impaired and still get a cat and still have a cataract\nSurgery and so and\nYou don't have to have a lens replacement right know every cataract surgery that we do today we always have the ones who played as\nA new lens implanted okay that that's uniform didn't used to be but today it's uniform because if we leave them without a lens they call that a fake yet and they have no ability to focus so without a lens you cannot\nFocus so everybody gets a laugh every one but it can be very simplistic lens just you know to make this the shortest easiest procedure with the lowest risk of post procedure complications of just thinking about the question about\nThat one for a business person that you couldn't undergo this procedure is\nWell he's otherwise line that I did I usually medical issue that would impair them not that I issue [noise]\nSo and we usually will require for people to get medical Clarence from their doctor and they're not getting general ... not getting general it's very light anesthesia and it takes a lot for a doctor to say that they can't have cataract surgery will be back more to come stay with us books\nFor forty eight and ... carrier W.
