has six with news on the hour that happened when it breaks out Michelle right on Atlanta's exclusive twenty four hour news weather and traffic station that is Ninety five by the name centipede ... depend on it [noise]\nIs perspective showing examination of how many different says often shows us how much we have in common I'm ... and in the studio with us today is an activist\nAnd an author his book on the other side of freedom the case for hope the author is the rate\nAnd the cats and they say that right here in\nThe author is ...\nAnd he is in Studio we we're we're just happy to have you to talk about this book you are a civil rights act it as a community organizer and of course you're award winning pod cast this is a live radio shows I shouldn't be pushing people to your pod cast but we're going to anyway ... said\nThe people um we we know you because of how you have spoken up for people of color and now you are making the case in a book tell us tell us about the book and what you're doing\nYeah so you know it's been a long four years since we were in the street in Ferguson I was one of the original protesters in Ferguson emerged in so many cities afterwards and I was trying to think about what are the most important stories what are the most important experiences that I've had that I Want to say it would be but I used to teach before that I've done and it's so much but there's still so much more work to do and I wanted to put that all in one\nPlace you know Twitter is normally have these conversations\nBut that doesn't always allow us to tell a false during actually listen to the sermon a that was in title don't tell your story too soon and I remember being like that's a really do title but what does that mean and what he said is that sometimes you can tell your story so soon all you see the pain not the purpose and I got to a point where it was like actually understood the purpose behind I'm\nLike so many of the things I've been through and I wanted to share their stories I write about what it was like to be in the room with President bomber what does it mean to to be in some of those meetings ... with the behind the scenes of being in the street or my mother left when I was three came back when I was thirty like what does it mean to shop at the whole person in the species every day so I wanted to share those in a set of essays\nHow easy it was it for you to do\nA you know writing is hard if anybody is ever going to write a book and it's hard it was a lot of work but some of the stories I felt like I've been writing for five years six years in some stories it was just about putting pen to paper side I think about my mother's asked me with a lot I just hadn't written about it and that was sort of interesting to find the words to put on paper\nYou know I talk about the protests all the time so that was hard because I had to choose the stories to tell you know I was in jail in Baton Rouge for Seventeen hours is a long\nTime I didn't plan to get arrested it ... it made a lot of news I've been ... by five officers in two states and you know gotten death threats in the first person ever permanently banned from Twitter was banned for trying to raise money\nCan be killed two they're all of those things and it's like picking and choosing which of the stories can I tell in a way that will make sense if taught\nAnd really emerged as as an activist when did you know that that was your calling\nKnow the first uh my friend got killed in August and I I went to St Louis on August sixteen to Ferguson and the second out in St Louis is the first thing that I was tear gas and that was a I'll never forget that because it was like this should never happen to anybody we shouldn't live in a world like that's not real\nThere's a sense and correct me if my perception is interactive that the part of people are certainly much larger on the less than it is on the right but the leaders of the right has more direct control or buy in from that constituency whereas on the left\nOr buy in from that constituency whereas on the left it it's a big tent so everybody's welcome and we don't want to offend anybody so as you said when Cory Booker picked a fight it was like wow I can get behind that if you think the the last in the Democratic party's ever gonna figure it out and get it fixed\nGetting to the difference in the right and left in this respect is is it the right to say the different uh they are employing a different tactic when it comes to telling stories of the right is rooted in the ...\nTo the right there just recall the writes them and make America great again in ... is about recalling memory it's for us it's like you know we've survived that part of America and we don't want to go back to it\nBut what you see Trump ministries known as using all of that imagery the attack on blackout that you'd like he's just using this 'cause the hardest work of it is already done we already know what the symbols mean we already like that's about take us back to a time on the left\nWe are engaged in this deep imagination at the world we're fighting for its own we've never seen before so when you think about this idea that everybody has access to health care you've never seen that I've never seen that before\nWhen you think about every kid being able to read and write you've never seen a I've never read that we are always engaged they make believe and that's how she just like a harder story to tell the harder story to get people behind because I'm trying to convince me of something you never ever felt touched and seen and heard before\nThey may not believing that ever happened right where the ... like we know are like they know or racism looks like we know a racism looks like and they just inflamed that for base everything on time\nSo I think that the the work is just different on each side but I'm hopeful again I think that who runs against Trump who wins\nWill not be somebody who is just running as will not be somebody who's just running to beat him it'll be somebody who's running to like usher in a different version of America and frankly one of the things that people love about Bernie you know I remember meeting with Bernie\nBernie has mastered the what little shake him how great the Bernie can tell you very clearly like what the world would look like if he was in charge like today how we get there you know shaky\nHillary was really good at the how in wasn't as effective at telling the story about the what so her plan about the how was perfect when you heard her talk about like what America can be just like didn't resonate with people like to watch just didn't resonate as much with people and I think that whoever beach Trump will be somebody who is mastered the what\nAnd I think I Hope somebody who's figured out how to talk about the how in a way that also makes sense to\nMe the ... election was a review from the Obama presidency\n[noise] you know and\nIn some ways yes but I'm also mindful of the ways that voter suppression just works in the country right so Trump didn't win the popular like more people did not vote for Trump to that is true right though like we won the popular vote\nBut the way we've set up the system either one based on like equity or just that you think about the voting rights act getting gutted right there like this election came on the heels of all these protections around equity injustice and race being stripped away so I think some of it was definitely like a\nSet of America that is like we're tired of all this talk about race injustice and the police and they were like making their voices heard\nI'm part of this too is that you know the the right words for decades to build an infrastructure that will weaken voting you think about Wisconsin people talking about low voter turnout with confidence like well yeah they gerrymandered the entire state so it's not like people didn't want to vote that they couldn't really you think about in your you\nThink about in Georgia where is that like if not for the random reporter who wrote about closing those polling places like none of us would have ever known to think about all of that that's happening across the country that like a broadcaster doesn't know about and are important to know about it and nobody treated about and that's where experiencing\nWe just had polling some of the first polling going into the midterm elections right after Labor Day and to hear the different analysts discuss what's going on state by state by and large the conservative analyst will argue that\nThe Democrats always pull higher in right at right around Labor Day because all the people who really vote go away on vacation for the Labor Day holiday and therefore\nThey are not at home to answer their phones and so it looks like a candidate like Stacey Abrams here in Georgia or the Democratic candidates who are running for statewide office or national office in their communities are looking really strong against their Republican counterparts and yet\nThe thought processes and maybe this is the the the\nVoter suppression that you discuss it still ends up you know fifty two forty eight after November yeah I think that what\nSeen with the Senate races you think about ... ... as you didn't get by on a ... in Boston you think about Gillum in Florida and they give us the the here in Georgia\nIs that conventional wisdom would have said you can't do it at all you don't have the money you don't have the infrastructure of the polls on your side and what we know to be with these four races have helped I see is that\nWe don't need those old tools to ... to us or us into a New America right that like we can walk into a new version of this America\nWith the things that we know are true with the vision with the connection with the people and what the plan and when you think about the the there's a vision there's a connection with the people and as a plan and we've seen that mobilized people all across the state with eye on them with all kinds of ... like what does she has she had a ...\nToday the ... what does she has a vision that connection with the people in a plane you know I ... as\nI said you know some people criticize you for being a part of the party like why didn't you runs independent or like do you have a good relationship with the party leadership is she said to re\nWhen I knock on doors I'm reminded of perfect relationship with the party because a party at all those people's doors I'm not doing the party is not somebody sitting in Washington the party is a single mother the party as a person working two jobs at a party as a person who believe in justice and I think there will be the with Stacy ion Gillum\nAnd all kinds of protests that they understand that as long as the people running for office have a deep relationship with the heart of the party there'll be good so I'm not worried about the polls she got this far I think it's just about taking home now\nWhat are you to be doing what you're done traveling the country talking about this book\nTo we still do so much work around uh the untold story about police pilot and so you think about things like you know we're as more people for weeds and all violent crimes combined which is sort of wild right so we do a lot of studies to help activists in organized all around the country think about like how do you take down the system from within\nSo in the book there's a lot of the data that we've done we're doing some other projects that we haven't been publicly announced yet so that'll be continuing\nUm and then trying to amplify the voice of other people so even at the book tour I stopped\nA tonight there'll be a local activists to talk about some of their work so that we can make sure that as we go across the country we're trying to build the biggest choirs Boston\nYou're just so impressive I might get a loss for words this is just so this is just so good because we have so much work to do ah keeping you stopped in the best I take it or is that you're still just kind of\nOne best one but I've been wearing the same best in the protest in twenty four team the best uh you know we were in the street for four hundred days and I say that because if you ever talked marching it wasn't that when I was watching was cool it was illegal to do in August September October twenty four teams have we used to tell her more than five seconds we were arrested\nOr we wish she for a long time when it got cold I needed something I could wear that I Would never have to pack\nAnd the best became that the reason I still where it is because it reminds me that to happen trait that I can be an enough interesting spaces I can do you really do interviews like this and be with really great people like you\nAnd I and I can get far away from that time that we were like sleeping on the side of the road and most of the things I never want to forget that that was real because that reminds me every single day how fragile freedom is\nAnd so few people recognize that don't that\nSo few people to and they were you know like the the reason why it's called the case or hope is that you know when we say the system is broken and people say no it's it's working exactly like it was designed\nMy take away from that day was designed by somebody made this up and because people made it up we can make some of the different and they can rewrite the tax code in the back of scrap paper napkins\nWe can actually do all this stuff in the generation so don't let people tell you gotta wait to generate like I'm setting the foundation for the next three hundred years from when no I'm planning to win in this lifetime in like we can do it so the question for me is that how do we build power and tell stories that allow us to win in this lifetime\nAnd how do you fight back against folks who don't take you and people your age seriously\nYeah you know I'm looking for a partner's not parents rate and I'm looking for ... years not parents and there are a lot of people in this space um who still think about the world and make one sort of way that like the older you are means wise you are and let me just tell you I've been a lot of rooms and\nThat's not true and the other you know I think about when I where this every day and I were in the White House and people like how dare you not where students like this you did make me smarter right like another guy like understood Tim more things are today\nIt's a gorgeous committed to the working with these with is welcoming is that there are a lot of space across the country people are like ready to do the work was true about the protests in St Louis and the protests and many cities is that\nIt was a range of ages I came out and said like let's do it right so I'm interested in that and I'm and I'm less interested today in trying to\nConvert the non believers I'm more interested in creating space for the people who believe but don't feel invited so like how do I like you know you want to do work done on what to do like I'm ready to like take you in and like try and build the biggest tent or to pay the UN the right place you can do work wherever you are\nI did I think we actually spent too much time trying to figure out what to do with the people who don't want to do anything and I think that actually way more of us who want to do something and just don't know what to do how do people connect with you\nSo do you go to ... dot com to buy the book or to to be at a tour stop 'em and it's just a re DRA while Twitter and most of us media right [noise]\nPerspective as a half hour we produce in mind\nIf there's something you think we ought to be talking about let\nMean by ... condo twenty nine on Twitter\nWhat we do is we take them through very foundational work so we look at what are your values what\nAre your strength how do we account for those years that you've opted out because\nYou know unless you were sitting at home surfing Netflix you were doing something you were volunteering community\nYou maybe we're managing a family property whatever so we help them create language about what they've done during the opt out years we take them through personality and after two testing because um you know I took the when I started work I kinda did okay what am I dad told me to do ... you know a lot of women took the job that\nAnd I just did okay what are my dad told me to do you know a lot of women took the job that someone told them to ... when they graduated because they'd have a job that isn't necessarily the job you want to have Twenty years later right so we are if you look at the course er about thirty three different exercises in the course it's about I think it's about sixteen hours of video time\nUm I'd say probably at least half of those hours or you know close to half of those areas are just spent on foundational work doing exercises to figure out where should I go and then we help them figure out where can you fit because things have changed their jobs that didn't exist when you left the workplace it takes a long time before we get to the tactics of\nHelping them right there resonate we provided template we coached them through that had an interview those things come on the back end and\nWouldn't most women don't do is all of that front end work which is why they ended up taking something that probably isn't what they really should be doing\nAnd you know for a lot of women are like oh my God I don't even know any of the software I don't know you don't have the skills for those anymore I don't know how to I don't know how to you know a ... or ... I mean it's it's a lot of things have changed in those years that you have so\nDo you suggest a them taking some courses refresher courses before they even begin to get out there\nReally depends on their field and it depends on what they've done some women in their volunteer work have kept their skills so we assess all the way through and then we have and they have to do these on a self assessments and then they say okay now what do we need to do the beauty of being out of work and run into to return to work now is that there's so much free content I\nMean you can YouTube anything yes and find out how do I make a spreadsheet ... how do I can go into into\nLots of real detailed instruction\nOn and there are many free free sources and very low cost online sources I'm a big fan of local town continuing ed ... those are really good courses if you're someone who learns better in a classroom and a structured setting they're very inexpensive\nI'm I'm I'm ... I Lived a very small community suburban community in Connecticut I'm shocked at the resources that are available to me alive for you know sixty nine dollars mhm mhm so a lot so we we do we talk them through the low cost options for getting you know sometimes I Am working with climate right now who's actually coming today\nAnd her homework was to go have her son teacher second and third level XL skills\nAnd basic skills and you know what our kids I don't know about your kids\nGoing to want to know a lot more time\nSo we do so we we point them in the right direction um and we we we empower them to do a lot of the work and then we become kind of their accountability partners and brought them yeah\nThat's good that's good yeah because we we really don't have the confidence to to go and go\nInto the workforce is ... ... you know like I have my hands are right now that's how most moms are when am I going to do how am I going to do this I got a twenty year gap or Tim year gap or a five year gap and nobody's going to understand that\nBut it's not but but I can tell you right now because I've been doing this for twenty three years everyone is high rubble mhm mhm everyone can go back you just have to be able to tell a good story and you sometimes have to make some adjustments of your expectations you may have been a partner at a law firm and then you opted out you may not go back at that level\nUm but we also help you understand your priorities and your preferences because you may have been that partner in the law firm but now that you're going back you may not need that level of prestige you may not want that level of responsibility\nSo again early in the process for helping us sort out what do I really want what are the what is a non negotiable for me what do I need in this next position so that we don't just jumped back into what we were in originally 'cause it may not be the right place and and you know I had a client years\nAgo who had a really wonderful career in human resources at a major retailer national retailer and she was home for twenty maybe Fifteen Years and she came to me and the only work she had done well she was raising her kids was the Brits are in the department store the sports the perfume at you walk in ...\nI think they do that anymore but this was in the late nineties um and you know we were able to you know get a great narrative for her she built their confidence through the process she went in she took a project so sometimes will will will advise people\nJust take a six month project somewhere mhm are doing in term job just kind of get your feet wet their companies also the offer what are called return ships which are internships for women who are returning to work so sometimes you take these baby steps but this woman now Twenty years later\nThe probably number two person in human resources in a major national telecommunications conglomerate as well so she she far eclipse where she was by taking baby steps\nAbsolutely ... absolutely a little bit about the course work and how it works short\nSo of course is totally totally portable you can take it on a laptop on your phone any any ... and the beauty of it as you can take it on your time so we do advise you to create some space and time\nTime so we do advise you to create some space and time dedicated to the course\nBut you can check it into small sections or you may want to do a lot at one time where we're launching it said that we're doing one chunk a week over eight weeks so we are ideally students will take it with us they'll you know hop in once a week and do the exercises that we're doing that week\nAnd then we'll check in on line to see how they're doing and do some face time live and on our own proprietary kind of Facebook page\nI'm so we'll be doing some of that but people if they want to take it quickly they can they own the course for a whole year\nBecause we want them to be able to go back and revisit so we start out as I said with with the foundation of we're kind of understanding who we are now\nThen we move on to understand what we want what's what's my motivation for getting back to work what do I need to get from this work\nWhat am I priorities my preferences and we start kind of building that career plan we do some assessment of what what can I bring to the table what do I need to remedy before ... before I go back and then we start moving through the more I'm focused kind of tactics for work we take you through 'em how to write your resume\nHow to create a linked in page the women don't have them or don't even know what they are\nHow to network we put a whole networking plan together with names and what you're going to say we helped script things we provide lots of samples so for instance I just I was doing the uh activity page for Lincoln profile I showed some and this is an example of a resume statement this is an example of Lincoln statements that people can see\nSo even though we're not physically with you we are cheering you are we are available through social media on a regular basis and we are not just telling you what to do we are showing you live examples of this is how you do it and the horse takes you all the way through how to negotiate it offer\nHow to build a career were wardrobe how to do an inexpensive work make up because even that has changed\nThe look has changed so we want these women to go out there and be extremely\nConfident and throughout the process because we're taking baby steps you're building your confidence along the way um we have tested the course live we are testing it online right now is some data touches the feedback we're getting is is really really positive\nAnd and I don't know what I think if I were to say the one real benefit of the course is that we teed off for you mhm so if you're a mom who wants\nTo go back to work you might know gosh I Need a resume and you know so you might go online and find a resume source and you might say gosh I Would could really use some\nHelp you know practicing my interview skills so you can maybe go on YouTube and find a tutorial\nBut the fact of the matter is most women if they're just getting started they age don't know what they need and be don't have the time and maybe not even the motivation to go searching for it so Kelly and I built this course we know what you need we provided we see it up in a silver platter and all you do as a log in\nIt's all there that is a nominal but to me about the emotional part of it do you guys do with a mom who use kind of unhinged by you know being an empty nester my kids have left to know who I Am ... do you deal with the psychology of that\nAbsolutely I mean there's a big bucks a tissue and are often an enemy because we totally get it I mean we were there\nWe both had that experience of thinking okay I've had kids now I Want to do something what do I do I lost his part of my my identity identity highway reclaim it so Kelly and you're not\nPsychologists but Ninety nine point nine percent of the women we see don't need a psychologist and ... and they're rare occasion that they do we make a referral but most of them are emotional and most of them are emotional because they're feeling like they are they're alone ... the only one going through this which could be further from the truth\nOn a new feeling a real a real crisis of confidence and and I find it ironic to wind up because we need women just stay home and raise children like we need\nChildren right children we need to sustain us you know obviously\nSo that should be valued roll it isn't always in the business world and I don't recommend ever that we will go in and say you know I stayed home for Twenty years and all I did was sort of my children I mean that's a hard thing to watch\nBut I think what we do is help women look at in their service of their families what have they done have they managed a rental property where the president of the PTO within the treasurer of\nA churchgoer did they build a website for their preschool I mean there did they do all of their families books and prepare their taxes you can cook book\nI think we help them mine for the things that they've done during their opt out years to build their confidence so that by the end of the meetings that the Kleenex becomes unnecessary\nProgram thank you so much for joining us

call\nSure you've got a credit freeze question for me\nI Do I took your advice to help protect from identity theft and for my credit and I'm In the process of thinking about applying for another credit card\nAnd before I started to fall on my credit I wondered if if I just need to fall um just for one credit angel food or do I need to fall all three\nThis is a frustration of mind because you should only have to thaw one\nAnd generally when a financial institution is pulling or a credit report to decide whether to grant your credit card or not they are pulling from a single bureau because they have to pay\nThe credit card or not they are pulling from a single bureau because they have to pay for every time they tap into one\nAnd I have repeatedly when I've had to sell on my credit for an application for a new credit card or because I'm getting a new cell phone service or whatever\nI have never\nEver been able to get someone at customer service to tell me what bureau they draw from and which one that I Need to thaw\nAnd so I've had to all three when I opened and account for somewhere where they want to pull your credit or done an application for credit and that's that's silly\nBut I just want to run a pass you first\nI think it's worth it I think it's worth you though Larry giving a call to the credit card company is one of the big issue worse\nYes do you happen to have a card with one of them right now I Do not\nBecause many times you have access to a some equivalent of your credit score now\nFor credit cards that you have and they'll tell you you know this is based on your Equifax reporter Experian are trends union they'll tell you which one and then you know who that bank or have a pretty good idea who that bank is going to draw\nA report from for credit out\nBut without that kind of source information if no one can tell you when you call in you know 'cause sometimes Alvin number you can call in to apply for a car to over the phone there'll be separate than their regular\nCustomer know service call a number and you might have a better chance with one of those people who might well no which bureau they pull from\nAnd give us some pause\nAnd then you'd be able to thaw it just that one\nAbsolutely would receive zero night knowing that I'm Better protected from identity was how much credit for is a\nGood choice to do that and if you want to

exhibit moves that I Do any ... got\nGot in the markets dot com for more information just got antique market this weekend\nI Want to throw I don't want to have to think anymore I'm just going to believe every every single accusation that is out there and also I'm a little amazed at how willingly some people in this country are\nAre well are willing to throw away the concept of innocent until proven guilty I I'm astonished by this I don't know if you are you might be a little more cynical than me because you you play the game a little more than I have as far as politics and inside baseball but as it is it somewhat astonishing to you as it is to me\nOh it is very much is the first principles in this country are innocent until proven guilty and I'm ... is that you got the right to face your accuser and the burden of proof is on the accuser not a leak used in\nDemocrats have seen very willing to throw the way that this new very post modern idea of of you believe all women will you you've got hundreds of women who have no inbred capitals since he was in kindergarten and saying this is Brett Kavanaugh he's gotten female friends who were with him\nAt a number of the parties where he supposedly was a binge drink belligerent blackout drunk and they say never happened and yet now we're not supposed to believe those women but we're still supposed to believe all women do none of it makes sense except for the fact that you understand this is has never been about\nThe accusations the accusations exist because the political left as opposed to break capitals jurisprudence\nAbout roe v Wade yes and I and I'll say this I think that actually I think both sides are planning a bit of a game on rosy weight 'cause it's very interesting to me that Republicans are kinda like oh no don't worry about it [laughter] oh never in a million years will be and I think that's a little bit of a political ploy I think that uh certainly it will be challenged but you know elections have consequences\nAnd you end up the presidents have the right to put who they like up there\nAre now that now we know if if not in an election year you have that you have the right to put up there but it just is really about roe v Wade this is what annoys me is that we should we just have the conversation about roe v Wade tell Democrats go get it passed at the state level you won't have to worry about it\nThey'd tell Democrats go get it passed at the state level you won't have to worry about it\nYou know very much so yes it is there is a corrupting influence your in abortion politics in America this is all about it and we can't have this on his conversation I mean what happens if\nBread capital where to go to the Supreme Court tomorrow and they were to overturn roe v ... way well that means then there would be fifty states in fifty abortion policies as opposed to one national abortion policy and frankly didn't that works against a conservatives who are pro life because frankly a lot of Republicans at the state level have the convenience of saying the pro life when they're really not because they know there's nothing they can do\nRight ah I ... back to cap it all uh specifically he wrote an op ed I Believe it was in the wall Street Journal yeah he defended his a judicial temperament I don't know that was smart I must say I don't think that uh apologies are accepted from Republicans apologies are just seen as admissions of guilt\nYeah Republican I I agree but in that op ed was not written for you and me it was written for Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and they read the wall Street Journal\nOkay that that makes a region are you saying I don't read the wall Street Journal\nAnd listen I read it to the audience to loosen his performance last Thursday was for an audience of one down the street from the capital his performance in the wall Street Journal is for an audience of do inside the Capitol\nOr what is the little wrinkle where uh somebody has a wedding on Saturday\nThe Danes she's the the senator from Montana his daughter's getting married um that in the Saturday Night\nAnd the vote is supposed to be for thirty pm on Saturday So dangerous office confirmed he couldn't be there on Saturday well dangerous now circled back in self [laughter] barely his wife got involved and said no do when the time change you can hop on a private plane and be back in Montana and time for the wedding after the vote\nI how do you feel this is going to play out in the mid term so I'm assuming that he does get on by a bare majority or how do you how do you feel I'm\nI I can tell you anecdotally I've been surprised that I Know it's anecdotal but I'll tell you this most people that are good friends of mine\nKind of disagree with me on politics so I don't have a lot of yes people around me I'm In an anecdotal way I've been surprised at how many women I've spoken to who feel that Kavanaugh's is being smeared and I'm Wondering it seems like all of this what I hear is this is all about trying to get suburban women\nYeah but you know so there's actually really good data on this now the Quinnipiac poll has been pulling specifically suburban women for three months or\nIn in July the generic ballot for Democrats among suburban women was at fourteen percent in August it was an eleven percent there last poll was the very end of September September thirtieth and it was it one percent\nSee there is a reality here there and this is something my wife talks about all the time we have two sons and my my wife's point of view she has two sons\nAnd they're young and they're out there in the world and see we're so it's not always this war between men and women not only men and women are at war and mothers have not only fathers and brothers but sons to worry about and it seems to me that the Democrats are not thinking in those terms at all I don't know how real vis a\nVis image that's been created is in the country as far as the war between men and women\nI it is it is a very real issue inside very liberal existing areas along the coast in urban areas of the problem for the Democrats is that this doesn't exist in suburban areas that are the swing districts in this country\nAnd then they've really gotten themselves into above all it is much easier for a liberal in San Francisco to never encountered other conservative than it is very conservative in Atlanta to avoid encountering a liberal we we don't live in the same bubble that they do\nAnd one more thing to point out about the the uh the prevailing wisdom or from the left that women are so their point of view is women never lie about this yet we have this Keith Ellison case\nAll right well this Keith Ellison before he was running for the attorney general was he was he was involved in this in the power structure of the Democrat Party was he not\nYes she is the number two at the gym or will he was the number two of the Democratic National Committee a first Muslim in Congress and he's running for attorney general in ... Minnesota his ex girlfriend claims he abused her her sons have come out and said it as well she's done it on videotape\nThe Democrats said they had an investigator look into it they won't release the report but it they say there's no they're they're right um but they didn't have a formal police investigation she actually has filed police chargers they won like Christine Blasey\nMount now she does sound so she she says she has a video she won't produce that my point is is just for the Democrats to come back with a report that says there's no there there was that the lives us idea that women never fabricate these stories\nYes it will last week these four Denison in California who were am found not guilty or their charges dismissed against them for sexual assault of a woman because of videotaped evidence proving they didn't do it\n... and by the way I'm I'm not saying I mean I ... I Believe it is time for America to come to this uh I Believe that women have to put up with far too much from men I Believe that there are\nAnd have to put up with far too much from men I Believe that there are plenty of sexual assaults that go on and I think it's time for people to stand up against it but the idea\nThat that age gender\nNever fabricates things is absurd not because they're women because they're human beings we know been amongst all types and flavors of human beings there are good people and bad people and truthful people and liars and this is just a fact\nRight or the ... the University of Virginia case um the we don't have to go back to to kill a mocking bird defied examples of this All right very quickly what's your final prediction what you think's going to happen here\nIt's going to be very close but I think he gets the nod and he was going to happen Saturday or Sunday I think it happens Saturday around for thirty so you think it's going to be a if you think uh the vice president will have to break the tie I I really\nDon't think so because Joe Manchin would love to be the hero here and if it's fifty fifty than he cast fifty first vote and becomes the senator who said Brett Kavanaugh for my first time for a Supreme Court nominees\nWhich helps them in West Virginia yes All right Eric Ericson I asked\nFor clarity I got clarity you'll be on an

my guess here is that a coach Kirby Smart as being very politically correct and telling us what a tough team these uh these kids from ... he's very worried about the quarterback\nCounty has a tremendous receiving corps he's very intelligent\nHe understands the system he plays in he's able to know what coverage or in a really good quarterback that understands the game and one of the many in the SEC now that are grown up really bright you know when you you mess up sometimes quarterbacks miss it he doesn't miss it and you can throw the ball anywhere in the field\nAnd there's no defense through I mean given that he has a thing [laughter] he presents a lot of challenges for us\nThat's what I call political politically correct PC coach smart we're lucky enough to have non PC outsmart tell us how he really feels about the van de quarterback\nBen quarterbacks going to be hit a lot I think he's a terrible pastor I think she's going to hit try to hit his routes and our quarterbacks and inside these are just going to take a take 'em down his name ...\nThe son of the former Brown's coach\nYeah but that no matter how he still thinks no way out\nOf the brown stink so you know by the

you know have a time a party and not really worried about what to the game\n... PC coach smart you said to be you would before the ... that ah you told the kid you told your players this week they don't really even have to chop wood ... what do you know what they need to they could just sit in the forest and look at the trio might now know worries us and we get [laughter]\nSo are there real day blacks a little nervous [laughter]\nWe find out that this is a real James ... of course believes everything the coach smarts that's of course right Oh yes absolutely line and sinker this is the way it's supposed to be it's a good coach he got to keep your kids are like that a lot of hard games coming up after this ... ranked opponents you could look you can look past this house in ... some abilities rank learning the SEC\nIn passing and they have a collage Lipscomb a wide receiver leads the last ... seeing are receiving\nA collage Lipscomb a wide receiver leads the last you see and receiving yard so yeah there is plenty of a building there at quarterback just maybe not the rest of the way\nRound again I think we're looking at a in these games I think Georgia means the largest blowouts possible as far as the one\nOf the college a playoff rankings start like a month

[laughter] if it was very exciting I tell you and I I think my tease this morning was the ... tell you the most important thing that used lesson to be learned from this the one eye opening thing the thing that we should all keeping our heads is that we found out that in fact\nThere is some segment of our population we don't know how big we'll find out during the midterms but there is some segment of our population that believes in certain circumstances it is okay to remove the presumption of innocence\nFrom someone who is being accused that's what we all learned that sent the most important thing I Believe that we learn from this amongst us in America there are people who believe that in certain circumstances it's okay\nTo remove the presumption of innocence\nWhen somebody ... when an allegation has been made from somebody's past to me that's opening I don't care what your issue is I don't care if you're on the hard right the hard left somewhere in the middle I Do not give a damn where you're coming from philosophically politically\nIf you believe there was any instance one one how many people in this country three hundred million plus you have to do just want to tell you the truth\nNot one of those people\nDeserves to have the presumption of innocence removed from them you make an allegation it's on you and the state and everyone else to prove it one hundred percent of the burden is on you to prove it zero percent of the burden is on the accused\nThat's that's the best the bedrock of this country\nI Wish we call sometimes but I'm not going to do that because I think that um\nIf we took calls sometimes but I'm not going to do that because I figured that I'm just not my favorite brand of radio I listen to people call up\nAnd say you know I got this crazy there\nIs a firm Kennesaw Lucy was would sound like\nA Hey Eric I got to take a I got to take a version would you've been saying about giving\nUp on this guy\nI don't want her I don't want a radio show like that but I Will tell you this there is not one good argument not one\nAvailable to you or anyone else not one good argument for removing the presumption of innocence to someone who's been accused there's not one just because you care so much about this issue\nThat's not an argument this country is getting so ignorant it is really frightening you know a Wall Street journal that the Twitter world that I'm not on ignorance run amok everybody with an opinion nobody willing to read\nOh I I heard the opinion that person I'll just retweet that then I'll get high all day and tell people how likely I Am very great so uh the wall Street Journal\nWrote an editorial that said Susan Collins can sense on Twitter that blew up somebody from the New York times jumped in uh the lady from Fox\nAnd the whole Twitter leftist world went crazy because that's obviously a slide raped joke Susan Collins can sense\nIn the constitution of the United states which they used to teach in school when you get to the part about Supreme Court justices the language in the constitution is the Senate's role is to advise\nAnd consent you have these ignorance triggered by the gods as\nWe live in a world where a lot more of our young people are aware of what their sociology professor or the people from the social sciences but now runs how things are said and done on every high school at every college campus in this country our young people are way more attuned\nAnd know the language of the sociology department than they do the language of the constitution of the United states how embarrassing any single one of you that went on Twitter and said that Susan Collins can sense was a sly rape joke\nBecause he didn't read the constitution where it says the Senate shall advise\nAnd tell sly rate jokes tweet every time [laughter]\nI think you know what let's put the founders are dry off there's obviously a sly rape joke in the body of the constitution the United states what a horrible country you know I don't know who's like yeah cost smart enough\nTo get started doing what a horrible ... letter of the country and night that state's constitution consent ... [laughter]\nThat's a sly rape joke apparently in the body of the constitution either that or most people who are mouthing off now are ignorant you choose which one of those is true that stuff\nWe heard from a fellow about Kavanaugh's now according to ... percent we have to play a lady that ballot negative or now there's one radio consultant Clive climbers yeah mega for a judge got they got to nail down as early as of now this is because like if you told me with five climbers and told me that ah the audience is stupid [laughter]\nAnd then you have to manipulate them right come on I mean we don't want to reveal too I was a dumb ass\nAnd there Saturday only pay no closing costs call now to see how you can view this incredible property and save thousands for large acreage lake lots price from only seven thousand nine hundred eight hundred six seven five Eighteen hundred eight hundred six seven five Eighteen hundred eight hundred six Seventy five Eighteen hundred\nMaybe about ... er Cox media group station [noise]\nOne twenty four hour news weather and\nFive and a um ...\n\nKnow if you look at the clock on the ridicule\nThat live in the ws see twenty four hour news center is just in the national Hurricane Center says Michael is now a hurricane and will continue to strengthen as it approaches the U.

I Know what I Know and what I Know is if you call yourself a Republican you're a Republican why because you said so and that damn well better be good enough for everybody\nNow as a party if you want to get things done you better start bringing people from different parts of underneath the tent put it together as a coalition make it happen that's not good enough for you you got the greatest

just tired all the time but it you think oh I've got kids in sports I've got the job he'd just should be tired but really you should you should wake up energetic in the morning and ready to face the day you should not have to nap in the afternoon the other thing we hear especially from guys is\nThat was awesome but a friday Freeman is the man and me I mean just to got to step up and make that happen\nIt's just totally put a stop to this and the players are talking in the locker map or do you know friday friday is a fun loving God not one of those are really gets totally fired up and yelling and screaming when he does something but they they they couldn't believe it\nHow far enough he was when you get that bomb off Alex was in that one was toasted too and it was you know he's the leader of the team and they had to have it there because the wheels are starting to fall off\nAnd he put a stop to it and raise both and get the game right there and got the W.\nI'm a I'm Glad that a Braves fans got to got to have that students such a\nGreat unexpected season and I as I said people just enjoy this ... you're already in gravy and I don't mean that in a negative way\nI mean come on I don't care how much of a how much of the Braves faithful you were you didn't expect the season to go this way it's time to have some fun in a little difficult when he gets smoked in the first two games so I'm Glad that that that moment of release of wow what a great season happened last night\nYeah it was just one of those like okay this isn't totally a fluke here yeah we did the Braves do belong even though the Dodgers have a Seventeen more million dollar payroll and the Braves do and\nYou know I heard a lot before the game and do this and the same old bravely always under achieve no this is actually a proper achievements [laughter] God not you know in the series the Dodgers are a little better but the Braves\nDeserved to be there and they proved it last night\nAbsolutely so I got a a key called Dr Joe for me there I'm not UGA of course I Would never do it on you looked at my my producer Jared yeah no no I'm not going to be there today because I don't have to go right past the stadium for my three o'clock appointment\nTo go right past and turn around and go back into the battery and get a little\nBoy the area altogether and go home and watched it on television where you were in regularly on Saturday my mind as well go to a black can I say you are you are a worker man let me tell you something you are a team player Jay Black\nBecause on Saturday and what have you I had been used you are sitting right in the sunlight and just not complaining oh you're a little grumpy but\nNot complaining that was not because of the sun all that feedback [laughter] but I Do what you think man\nHe finally got to go to Georgia game in ... under the lights yeah I had I had a blast it turned out that the almost everything happened not only the end zone we were sitting in but our side of the end zone so it was a it was fantastic now you tell me a J cause you obviously know more than I Do I was a little worried I never thought\nYou know a a van de was they were getting some runs and stuff in the first they weren't scoring but they were they were\nThey were a accumulating yards or in the first quarter and I was ...\nUh in the first quarter and I was wondering if it was if this was going to hurt Ga\nGa if they would drop from number two not because there were never any danger of losing but it seemed to me like I'm van de was moving the ball on them quite a bit early in the game and you think that will affect the way or the standings come out\n[noise] no no I don't think so I ... everything will be decided in the next four weeks yeah play ranked LSU ranked Florida ranked Kentucky ranked all burned and then I Do want to remind people that\nThese are still SEC teams with SEC coaches shore yeah you do have ability to do football things in Georgia\nYou know yes it's forty one of the game was forty one to six yes ... touchdown against the you know fifth string or is that we're in there for the dogs um I mean they was\nBut I'm a worrying area was known nominate say I'm a warrior\nAnd when they were moving you fit and you fit in to build on what I'm saying [laughter] that is how things work we are all Larry among them live a warrior and they said that when I see that in my mind I was thinking what if this was Alabama right now you know that's because ultimately that's that's the test right ultimately that's where that's where the train is going\nTo get past Alabama if you want anything to happen right\nSo if if it was Alabama they scored a couple and we just got a couple and then we'd have seen where we go from there okay All right so you you're confident when does when do we find I Know the AP things already out there still never to write\nA ... or the playoff stuff doesn't come out for another uh oh no no no no no I Know that I Know I'm just about the rankings that are out there now but uh Oklahoma last\nOklahoma last and a Texas so they're they're going to take a little bit of a hit LSU oh LSU lost the Florida so the dogs will get Baton Rouge against the angry and desperate LSU team drawn to stay right there in the hot in Auburn went down so we had a little bit of chaos and the top ten or what\nWe tell me the truth or did you recognize Roger star back when he stepped up on the stage\nYes that's that's that's one I actually got a one of a Kevin Butler's teammates from the Chicago Bears who came to the stage and our security folks adult if I didn't know who he was\n... years Roger Starbuck I was when I looked over and thought first my first thought was that's Roger stop backing that can't be and then I was told it was and I'll tell you this I was too nervous to ask\nHim for a a picture I can understand well I don't know what I Want somebody like I went over to Arab desire and I said a ... year quarterback he's a quarterback you make it happened and I'll just jump into the picture [laughter] he said no [laughter] [laughter]\nI was trying to you Eric desire is my style back up exactly\nWhen I was trying to do [laughter] that's\nWhy everybody's just going by the ... the student center one we're on the air during our children I'm home games because you never know who's going to stop by Malcolm then I'll go to shows you guys they're areas are Kevin butler Williamson Laurence Smith you never know who's going to\nPop it no so it was a fun time and I appreciate everything that we do that on the campus there was a\nIt was a blast is there anything else in sports overload the falcons what's going on man when he so is there anything else in sports when he was talking about [laughter] what about the falcons I mean I hate to I I hate to say this but given the the division there in I think it's telling us now and that one of the war like\nThere's only been a handful of teams that have made the playoffs started a season\nAnd for me not want it for you know so [noise]\nMatt Ryan with the latest Steve nine home away with this defense looks and just can't stay healthy\nYeah it's just too bad because you can't even ate it is too it's it's it's all about injuries and not be able to overcome the injuries I Would imagine that the you would hope that the depth would be there I guess it's just not there I uh so that's the difference\nBetween college in the NFL in college\nYou can have down because the guy behind the guy the only thing he's missing is experience he should have the talent if you could recruit correctly in the NFL there's this pesky thing called the salary cap yeah and having to pay your quarterback yes the falcons had to do unfortunately that doesn't leave you a lot of money left over to have a little bit of death\nYou know that's interesting actually on on on the pro side are right now I Would say on the AFC I think the chiefs of the best team in the rams are the best team on the NFC side\nThey're both dealing with kind of a cool thing they've got great young quarterbacks on their first contracts which allows them to go out and spend a bunch of money in other areas while they're getting way more than they're paying for from their young quarterbacks that\nSeems to be the the uh the ... you would say that that would be the way to plan it out but you can't plan it out\nOf people are now taking a wall in the draft though hope and you get one of those guys because right you have to have a quarterback in the NFL and the way the league works the way the salary cap works you only have such a short window and if you can pay that quarterback a rookie rate you know up everywhere else you have an advantage in the falcons they had their window and it's starting to\nDiminish your little because they have to pay met Ryan you have to say devout they frame and you gotta pay Grady Jarrett and let her et cetera\nReally hurting so do you think there's anybody who's ... who's tradable going forward to getting really happen you don't really get fired sales I mean you know no no no no I don't mean during the season I mean\nReally get fired sales and I don't know I don't mean during the season I mean going and I mean after the season's over if you could bundle a couple of together and ah you know you lose but but then again like you said the window is closing so you at this point with Matt Ryan's career you just want to be adding right now and trying to make that run but a ... you say some\nSay the Colts and you know be like Andrew Luck and waste the great quarter I gotta you gotta go around it\nWas going to say that everybody was picking Patrick my homes and the chief to lose to the jaguars and it looked like they were just playing a second string\nT he got killed this couple of things I like I always like ah watching ah Jay Lynn I'm a I was mostly Jay Leno rejecting Ramsey Ramsey I I I always liked seeing him being shown up\n'cause he just runs his mouth about all every man and and what's that he's a very serious and also on the same weekend to see a quarter of a drag or get knocked out a great weekend them [laughter] as far as that is good or just see I Am I'm not a I'm not a U.S\nSee expert or like Allen Hunt so he's probably a better person a brand new here pronounces but I realized we were in a big deal when I was heading home from the game Saturday or well sunny morning at three AM and every sports station in town was talking about but I brought us see things wow it must have had a had a show and boy they did\nIt happened after the fight was over I guess the winners went after the ... someone of Conor McGregor is a a ... yeah you're you're just one dude I I was trying to figure out why something like that happened the minute occurred to me the J they're all goons [laughter] either in a cave [laughter]\nThat's why he turns out there just street brawls hours so they'll but there's something about I don't even know why us she keeps I guess whenever Conor McGregor is involved it's it's a it's a high ticket affair Allen did you did you watch\nBut I mean the guy can't find any more kind of regret who can't find any more so as soon as I get out of here or other I ... I think he's I don't like Conor McGregor I can tell he's not I like my like my USC fighters to be humble", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "08"}
