I'm Sorry I have an audio complete those those two names uh yeah I mean that that's that's pretty big ... that was thrown out Sean because I mean that's the killer that now stormy is actually responsible for Trump's legal fees I ... and by the way it\nShould be always gotten ... from the beginning I'm kind of it these are street fighter um but I think what especially during the Kavanaugh hearings with Julie sweating egg I mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis\nYou know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls in these boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of adults almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on his job it's like a fairly smart guy right and and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that with this I'm going to say that a girl who was to treat years removed from high school repeatedly went\nBack to parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back and I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the story at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the for people that Julie sweating except rep those parties one's dead\nTo win and returned our calls at one didn't do virtually sweating it was so now Democrats who used to hell ... and the media obviously\nAnother story but also hurting on it\nBut in the process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process in the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that\nI got to run but Joe ... over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nThis is who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWell Trump said we'd create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad wire and building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs so you know the ... look it's\nI'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're going to watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when\nMaybe they lose the house you lose the house then all you're going to see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeach but that's the agenda\nThat's it there's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... you know there's a lot of states [noise]\nThe Democrats rely on people of low information they rely on propaganda and putting things out there and can be used in people that's the way it is\nA let me tell you what it is they they got one play book they're the party of smear slander mismanagement\nBook they're the party of smear slander mismanagement racist sexist massage in is\nSeeing a phobic homophobic Islamophobia dirty air water kill children skill grandma it's the same playbook\nIt's never changed on Thirty years in radio it's never gonna change when they did get power for eight years with Obama you saw what they did with it it didn't improve the lives of anybody it left many Americans behind the worst economy in modern times was Brock Obama's so\nYou know I it's amazing that they don't want to talk about well on the tax cuts I'm working no they want the crumbs back\nAnd do well healthcare never worked out for anybody but they want to keep it I mean it's just it but are there focuses the hate Trump investigating Trump\nNonstop All right um but I look on the other side I'll be blunt\nYou know if three weeks from tomorrow it come on the air and say well you know we're going to be stuck with Nancy Pelosi you didn't get out you didn't vote\nYou know what we'll survive it will fight we're not going to stop but\nIt would be so much better and so much easier for all of us and especially the forgotten men and women they just get no foot hold now in terms of jobs and opportunities for themselves and their families\nYou know now that it's going to be you know a battle every day non-stop accusations non stop fighting\nWe've had that for two years since Trump for president that supposedly coming to an end\nBut we'll just pick up and we'll fight back that's what we do you don't give up you don't give you just stay on it\nYou know you have to win these political battles matter you get the government ultimately you deserve America deserves better than what this Democratic Party is offering but that's going to be up to you my vote here in New York was meaningless in this whole case this is not going to help\nI Can't help you in this election\nExcept tell you the truth I'm telling you the truth and I'm saying all of these races are infinitely winnable right now there's ... there's been a change\nDemocrats have overreached they've they miscalculated\nAnd the American people are good fair minded people they're figuring this out pretty quick they watch the judge Kavanaugh they see these mobs they hear these you know these incitement this these marching orders if you will by radicals that are Congress men and women and senators\nAll right let's get to Don and Detroit's white John James is like the greatest candidate he doesn't he's doing better in the polls he's down in single digits I Wish the people of Michigan gets the outbreak this guy is he'd be he's that's a long shot for us but while he'd be amazing\nIt is a long shot for us Sean thanks for taking my call that I've really had but it only campaign and let them take\nYour enthusiasm away this man deserves a vote\nNo no not at all where we're going to the is this will be one of my first campaign rallies for Senate or for a Senate um killed it a long time it's going to have kid rock there is going to have 'em Donald Trump\nJunior and Kimberly guilt foil there tomorrow night is that gonna leave tomorrow night where I'm\nOn the Michigan from six tonight I I don't remember exactly the venue but people can look it up a giant James for Senate dot com\nLet me tell you something that this man is beyond impressive he has all these leaders\nIn the army at the same at the same time as him that he provided air cover for me I was a flight medic provided a lot of air cover for me when I was there is an awesome awesome awesome man yeah\nWell I you know I look at his background and his experience and he just you know some people just have it whatever it is they have it they own it and um I I just think he's a natural leader and I hope the people millions pay attention to him\n... Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan a couple of weeks ago came out they dangle this care in front of us and they've done it every year every two years they dangles carried out in front of us\nCalled the ... border security and the bill funding the entire wall\nRight only if they win and two thousand Eighteen we had a fight where we were bloodied whenever we attended a Trump rally we were bloodied up and the reason Donald Trump was elected one of the big reasons was because he was going to build the wall the reason he won the election was because he said he was going to build the ... the reason we maintain\nMajority in Congress for the past eight years and especially in she was I was sixteen was because the Republicans were finally going to fund the wall\nAnd when Kevin McCarthy came out who I have a lot of respect for came out a couple of weeks ago in ... in front of the voters faces I was screaming at my TV saying you've had the opportunity to present Donald Trump with no less than three spending bills and neither of those bills get it had any appropriations for border wall\n... why you have had the majority in Congress for eight years he won an election onto that I was sixteen\nFor building a border wall they act like they're losers they don't know\nBorder wall they act like they're losers they don't know how to they don't know how to act like\nThey do but he has been more critical than me I mean I I really I have news the adjectives spineless\nGutless needing a back a bone\n... look at this point it's too important we've actually gotten a real lot done\nThe president what he's done in terms of ISIS degrading and and feeding them at a level nobody anticipated\nNorth Korea everybody thought we were headed for a real tragedy there and you know which sole thirty million people their lives at risk no more rockets being fired over Japan were not dropping pallets of cash cargo planes of cash and or the currency of two Iranian mall as\nA as we see what's happened on the economic front for point two percent GDP we've we've watched an economy go from losing jobs to creating four million plus jobs at this time eight million fewer Americans in poverty and I'm fat and food stamps\nI'm we see the pipelines are being built an wars opened up um we spent three billion three and a half billion on the new wall we need the full funding you're right the twenty five million a but we're making the progress to originalist on the Supreme Court great judges on the lower courts\nAnd I I just see in America that's transforming before our eyes based on every measure consumer confidence everything in between uh yeah I Wish they would have worked faster they would have kept their promises better there's still a lot of work to do but the alternative is non existent\nThere is no alternative if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi in the house vote for a Democrat for the Senate you're voting for Chuck Schumer\nUm that's it if you you know you save the house and Senate we can get a lot done we get these additional seats in Indiana North Dakota Montana if we ... you don't hold in Nevada and we pick up with Martha ... Sally in Arizona\nI mean and we Claire McCaskill gets sent packing and Rick Scott wins in Florida it'll be amazing holding the house is key\nIf it even if you don't particularly love you Republican congressmen it's not going to be an impeachment investigation vote that the Democrat is offering you\nSo for that reason alone I mean it's important to me will survive but I'm not saying we wouldn't not going to come on here the day after election day whining complain I'm going to just dig my hills in and do what I always do after elections and that's fight for what I Believe it\nBut it will be so much easier if we just did it on election day\nAnyway I appreciate your call I'm Dana is in Oklahoma Dana Hi how are you\nSaying wow Sean thank you so much for taking my call and how you doing\nI'm good what's going on with you [noise] um\nI prefer it from the other time and I lift your chief fate picture I listen to the Democrats and it's just such a pity and they are just felt found um power hungry and see if they don't want the truth and honesty\nThey don't want one nation under God which is they ...

seven fifty that when you asked me their hand on Melosh\nNews first and accurate news ... am seven fifty you asked me [noise]\nBack every one back to back senators or he's outta Nebraska but he's here in New York where he feels very comfortable Senator Ben Sasse\nThis year he's got one of the most intriguing books out in quite some time even though his knee deep in politics and policy and he knows the the amount of emotion out there he's looking at the big picture he's written a new book called them why we hate each other and how to heal senator welcome thanks and good either but I also like the ... you also um\nYour book to extremely well too because you thought about the big ... picture you thought about culture what each other\nI think it's because we don't have the natural tribes that were used to as the place that you find happiness we have a collapsing nuclear family structure we have fewer deep friends than we've ever had and statistics on this stuff we have declining local worshipping communities and we have shorter duration job so\nPolitical tribalism is ramping not because of politics politics matters but it doesn't matter all that much it's not the center of life\nBut politics is trying to fill a void as people's neighborhoods that are collapsing and we should be attending to the first things first which is not politics\nSo if I'm In for a bomb in the house uh watching and ah watching on um my Apple TV and then I pick up my iPhone um texting a bunch of people and interacting with people that don't exist\nYet I don't see you said that the stats one from average amount of Americans with friends have three friends three point something that's it's down to like one point something now ... is it because if technology is a huge part\nOf it so I thank you for reading the book by the way a we have half as many friends in America today as we did twenty five years ago the average American I have three and a half friends in Nineteen Ninety today at one point eight as you say\nAnd so the smartphone has great lots of wonderful economic things come from a smartphone but make sure you turn the dang thing off tonight and have dinner with your kids because it turns out that matter so much more than your smart phone if you go from two hundred five hundred social media friends you're not happy are statistically if you know the neighbor two doors down you're happier\nBut you're just saying these right now America is for the most part a lonely\nVery lonely you talked to researchers at the national institutes of health they think that loneliness is the number one public health crisis in America it drives most of obesity for instance being lonely for a day is the equivalent of smoking Fifteen cigarettes I Want people to read them because I Want him to be healthy or not just physically but in their neighborhood\nToo we can't do a you know it's very frustrating to hear well the nuclear family has gone away and we hear a lot of the minority communities that's part of the way I Do about that makes me want to throw my hands and say what am I supposed to do about everybody else making decisions not to have nuclear family yes so\nThe first thing you should do is invite people over in your neighborhood you got lots of listeners who are blessed to have a stable nuclear family there are a bunch of kids who don't know their dad two blocks from you invite them over for dinner\nHosted a coach little league joined the Rotary Club joined co want us all that stuff is more important than who you're angry at in politics again politics matters but it's way downstream from the stuff that really matters which is probably within five minutes of your house so that\nThat's very interesting thing we could all do but here you are a knee deep in Washington the big policies the emotion lose Lindsey Graham says that was being spit on two weeks ago being spit on by people I've never met before Senator Jeff flake is being accosted in elevators by a woman he's ever seen before so how does someone to look at that\nAnd think ... book really spells out how this happened\nYes so I've had those experiences to we I mean I make everybody outlook life gets death threats now I my kids I have three kids aging from a ranging from age seven to Seventeen we host water stations that local marathons\nAnd people come up and and screamed that when the water when I handed to a twenty year old woman running buying the marathon they'll scream don't drink get it's poised and he wants to kill you\nThey think they're doing that because we differ about legislative issues there's something much deeper wrong in their life if they're willing to scream that I'm trying to poison somebody when I'm volunteering at a water station\nThe only way you can make that stuff's better is in the neighborhood where you live that can't be made better by legislation in Washington you can't pass a bill that mandates people become friends but your listeners need to become better at being friends in a world where the smartphone is telling us we don't have to live where we are so if\nYou have an example of Washington and working across the aisle or with a buddy let's say ... it was more or less\nBull and Washington and working across the aisle or with a buddy let's say ... more likeable and he felt like you could work with him I'm so Jeff Flake said this on sixty minutes and it I think it applies here\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running out of ... and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp two parties there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWell that's the problem that's the identity but is that the reason you shouldn't I mean if if the bench that saw somebody of like minded could cut a deal with on the other side are you concerned about you a political future if you do it\nYou know I don't care about that stuff I Want to eight people out of a hundred in the Senate has never been a politician before and when my wife and I decided to run a we said for four and a half of the next six years will act like we're never run for reelection so we're due to\nPray about it and how it all and I've talked to some wise counselors in July and August next year and make decisions about our future but I don't worry about political incumbency as a core motivator for me um but the problem is Washington DC is filled with political addicts tells are not normal people people who want to go to Washington DC instead of their whole life\nThey aren't good representatives of the people listening to your show we need term limits we need people who want to be from a you know all the communities Syracuse a New York and and Fremont, Nebraska and want to go back to those places because that's the place where you love those are the communities that really matter\nBut as the does is also the fact that we safe spaces at colleges or the fact that they sent therapists to dorms after the election does that play into why you wrote this book\nYeah that that's a mess we do to touch on the ... movement or in this book I was a college president before I ran for Senate\nAnd one of the reasons moms and dads should be writing checks to send your kids to college is so that you encounter ideas you didn't already know if you want to go to a college where you'd have to never have to encounter any idea you didn't already know I don't know why you'd spend any money that's called education\nI don't want my kids to be safe from New ideas I Want them to encounter new ideas but I Want to do it in the context of human relationship where after you argue about philosophy or politics or whatever you don't want to go get a drink with somebody and have dinner with them\nBecause they're actually still humans created an image of God\nSo when you decide for example I think you might be a good example years told me something I did not know you've been critical of the president not at his policies but a lot of it is is a is a is demeanor a lot of the way approaches do things but you do still talk to the president oh I Do\nI I like talking to the president and I'm grateful that he's willing to to take my call so we wrestle through issues I think he's done a great job on a bunch of cyber issues for instance and I've been present on that and I wanted to take a tiny bit issue but I it demeanor obviously there's a ton of stuff the president does which is new that a lot of people are just having to wrestle through and make sense of\nMy my their issues where I agree with the president on policy their issues where I disagree and he's grateful I'm grateful that he's willing to to wrestle with me and have a conversation\nWhat I'm really worried about though is not this president or the election of twenty twenty I'm worried about what kind of country we live our kids in ten and Twenty years and we need to be having long term conversations about what America's about why we have limited government why we should do entitlement reform\nAnd the kind of stuff we talked about in them which is America believes in limited government because of the center of the world is your community not\nD.C Suzanne or you live in a state that likes to ... days like Fox it what are the so called fly over states if people are ignoring before Fox came along I Would argue that Los Angeles DC and New York\nOr just would program every single a sitcom and every news broadcasts we didn't try to do that or an audience came in different what do you know in Nebraska that New York DC and California doesn't\n[noise] ah that even though we're oh insects right now the Oscars are still the football team in the last ... years in every state gotta get ready for the for the best of the last fifty years now granted we were really good from fifty until about Seventeen years ago ... won't be back yeah go to Ross don't lead us back to the promised land\nRight but football aside do you guys you guys are not caught up in this in Nebraska you're not in the play by play you're not into the ... century no I\nThink the vast majority of Nebraska and know\nThat the really important things that happened in the world are what kind of character your kids are going to have two months and two years from now right it's about whether or not the people in your neighborhood want to go to the same neighborhood gym\nNext Saturday Night and share on the same team even if we differ about politics politics can't be the center of your life it can't fill the vacuum of the worry we all have in our soul who's going to comfort us on her deathbed\nThat's going to be family and friends and coworkers is not going to be some politician off in Washington\nYeah I agree with you say the iPhone also has some things in it now the lead they will tell you how long you been looking at it what you've been doing and in ... and parents can get involved in that just like they get ... and they tell you who you can hang out with when you're younger they could tell you about your iPhone\nBut I'm not sure you'll understand me and I'm not sure if you vote for me and if I Do lose I won't be too chagrin because I'm familiar with disappointment but then he says but I'm going to try five or six times until I'm too humiliated and then I won't try again I promise\nBut he said in that opening statement if I don't know something I'm going to learn it if I say something wrong I'm going to correct it right from the start he comes out of the gate with those qualities of resilience humility and empathy and they stay with them the rest of his life\nSo tell me if this was a leap did you could take lunch or notice book on grand talks about how grant when we were slaves after the emancipation was issued more and more slaves were deciding to run for free\nAnd as a patient was issued more and more slaves were deciding to run for freedom\nAnd when they were running to grant grants idea to say let's give these guys some uniforms and let them fight and he sees how they fought they got together and the galvanizing came to a unit and that's when we can start getting an idea of how what the world with this country is going to look like when this war is over\nThen I think that's right once the black soldiers became part of the union army as they did when he finally opened the door to the black soldiers they fought magnificently and even the generals who have been against the idea of bringing them into the army began to see that they're helping the cause and they're doing an amazing job\nBut Lincoln was reluctant at first to do it I mean he waited and waited until Nineteen sixty three because he feared that the whites in the army weren't ready for it he fit the north even the north wasn't ready\nTiming is everything he said so we watch the changing sentiment he watched what was beginning to happen and that's another quality of a leader you can't do what you may want to do unless the timing is right the timing was perfect for the Emancipation Proclamation and for allowing blacks in the army\nEven though it was driving Frederick Douglass not that he was waiting so long right exactly\nBut Frederick Douglass said once Lincoln takes a stand on something he'll never go back maybe slow getting there but it's true I mean it when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation there was a lot of blow back in the north north and lessen the legislatures passed rules\nSaying or a statements saying we're not for this we didn't fight for this where just for the union and some of them were threatening to secede from New England and yet Lincoln knew that the timing would be okay that they would come around and they finally did and then dug was finally accepted yes you are right on timing\nWell Doris Kearns Goodwin here so if there was a natural leader even though we started off grew up sickly and he was somebody had to be home schooled it had to be Teddy Roosevelt it seems he built up his body because he couldn't early he did later became physical weight because he couldn't early right\nNow you know what's so interesting about that is that he made himself a strong person and that became an example are for the rest of his life he said one time there were two\nKinds of success in the world some is when somebody has a talent that nobody else can develop no matter how hard they try like cheats for a poem or Lincoln at Gettysburg\nBut most people have said like himself\nHave ordinary talents that they developed to an extraordinary degree too hard sustained where he was he wasn't a good eyesight person but he was a great bird or he wasn't that good of a shot but it became a world class hunter\nUm he wasn't a good boxer but he somehow lost an eye one point but it became a good boxer everything came to hardworking made himself who he was boxing in the basement well I mean by the White House ... wrestling matches boxing the his favorite thing was taking people on these hikes in wooded areas of Rock Creek park\nWhere he made a rule that you couldn't do around any obstacle you have to go up Iraq if you got to go down people were falling by the wayside if they're trying to find him in the woods two hours he would exercise every day it's one of the things I think about my leaders which is\nThat they able to figure out how to find time to think and relax and replenish the energy we think we don't have time in our twenty four seven world they had pretty important things to do the civil war World War two and they did they surely did\nWrite a doors or when you talk about to Roosevelt he took on the monopoly he felt like be there too much power and they did maybe perhaps it would control too much of the economy and if you want to take on the uh the big guys the bullies\nMaybe it helps that you were a hundred and ten pounds suffers from asthma your whole youth and maybe were picked on yourself and maybe you don't lose that ability to try to avenge it\nYou know that's really interesting I'm not sure I fully thought about that but I think you're right I mean he was bullied as a child\nAnd he felt that some of the big companies were bowling smaller companies and getting them out of business and he was going to defend the people who needed to help the people who win the independent companies and and wanted to have their own life and their own sense of accomplishment and they were being taken by the big hand of these monopoly is I think you're right and\nThought about that well I Want to talk about the power plays of FDR and LBJ or do we have we have some more time we can we can go get great so leadership position with a book and turbulent times it's doing extremely well no surprise Doris Kearns Goodwin up put it together or two more presidents coming your way and how it compares to the president today\nWhich I Know is a challenge or back in the moment this is Brian kill me ...\nGiving you everything you need to use for June

twenty five percent I Want to see her family tree oh I see her go all the way back toward this in the well it's supposed to come up\nHere still Jacobson he's a Cornell law professor cut thirty one\nShe did not claim it when she was a child she didn't claim it for college she didn't claim it for law school she only claimed it when she was in her late thirties and beginning to climb the law school ladder the law professor ladder from the University of Texas to Harvard\nThat's the only time she's ever claimed that she never affiliated with Native Americans she never health Native Americans she was never a faculty advisor for Native Americans she got her self listed as Native Americans so she can be declared a minority law professor\nAnd that's the problem is that what she had not only did she claim it but she used it for the advantage Jim Messina writes\nHe uh oh his superior officer us or Henry Clinton in New York kept saying don't worry we're going to come down and help you and finally the British fleet did come down and under admiral Thomas Graves and an September fifth they had this battle in the entrance of the Chesapeake now up until this point the British almost always won\nA but for the first and not as ... for the first that up basically last time the French\nThe French one this time forcing graves to return to New York to repair it ships and just as that happens Washington and a French general roshin bowl arrive and begin the siege all the pieces fell into place it's all it's a miracle really\nRochelle ... along the way they stop at Mount Vernon you said yeah first time in six years as Washington and he goes into I Know what are you just went to Mount Vernon recently and they showed me the table that he reportedly opened up the map on and the kind of devised a plan do you does your research say that\nOh yeah no it's it's amazing what an emotional moment for Washington you know he hasn't been home in six years for grandchildren had that he's never seen have been born in that in that time and he he walks in the ... um Mount Vernon I'm Rochelle bow with him and\nThey know that this huge fleet of friendships is there and they you know pull out the maps and start planning it he's only there for a few days but it's the beginning of the great victory\nThat will win this side note we're just talking about this I was just reading some experts in your book and one of which is Washington has got some problems not only is he trying to win a war that seems impossible\nWhen he writes home he keeps finding some some disturbing news one of which was the British come down the Potomac and they start burning every plantation they can but they don't burn Washington's why why well his his\nCousin Lund who was the caretaker of Mount Vernon goes out to the British ship the appropriately named Savage and says uh here would you like some provisions are with us a gesture you know if if I give you these don't burn\nYou know if if I give you these don't burn the place and and if they don't in Washington here's this he is infuriated you know how how could this happen to the leader of the American army said I'd much rather lose all of Mount Vernon a than here this news and so do\nThe enemy he basically offered a bribe Erie is trying to destroy the enemy and his a caretaker of his nephew yeah nephew thinks he did a good thing\nYeah yeah no it was yeah and you know thanks to that we have Mount Vernon today but it put Washington a difficult position and you know and this is one of the things I I kept realizing in this book you'd like Washington to have that high five moment you know I've done this we've won one this thing but\nAt every turn he's runs into issues that make it very difficult uh at the great victory Yorktown\nOr his stepson Jackie ... died of cabin of of camp fever and you know so instead of\nYou as the rest of America celebrate season morning and uh you know those kinds of things it was really tough on Washington right so he what he does surrender that how does it get cold while to surrender\nWell are they surround a this is a siege and so ... what they do a series of line in which they they moved the artillery closer and closer to the British position in Yorktown until finally um they're just pounding the British to pieces\nAt night lord Cornwall is tries to escape by the rowing across the river but a huge storm comes up that doesn't work\nAnd eventually they have no Cornwall ... I've got to surrender\nAnd so he surrenders and Washington is very insistent that the terms of this treaty be in our favor because when at the battle Saratoga under Horatio Gates it was just the opposite\nA Washington was a very tough negotiator are finally it's it's the ... that the ceremony to surrender book Cornwall is doesn't show up he pleads illness and and uh that's the voice of the public humiliation of having to turn a sword over the washing\nNathaniel Philbrick are uh he's our guest right now so if you have the headquarters in New York and that's what general Clinton yeah how's Cornwall surrendered or anything but the south in the south like\nHow does transfer right well it's interesting you know you think Yorktown the war's over actually it would be two years before the British finally evacuated from New York this was one part of the army a very significant part seven thousand soldiers there about ten thousand up in New York\nAnd so this meant there was still a significant army in America and Washington worried even though we won this thing the British are going to come back\nAnd there was a naval victory they won in the Caribbean all this stuff but finally the British Parliament realizes that people no longer want war no matter what we just have to get out of it to us in a lot of money to cost them a huge amount of money and uh you know it costs the French just as much\nAnd you could argue and ... have that the French Revolution in less than a decade was a result of the fact that the French were bankrupted by their support in America and the revolution and about five thousand in New York you said in particular\nUh the the French no no the uh the British the British had a over ten thousand tend to have so that the Washington wanted to attack New York before he wanted to check\nTax the Chesapeake but the French felt it was much easier to sail into the Chesapeake and they were right and they were right hey you know and they shifted Washington shifted gears I mean this is the thing about Washington he would when he realized you know they're not going to do it my way okay shift gears what can we do to make this happen\nAnd he and he did it in a very decisive brilliant way because he made his preference for New York\nMake the British in New York think that that's where he was going to attack until the very last second when they realized whoa a Washington Rochelle bows army or on their way to Philadelphia and ultimately Cornwall is in the chest\nAnd they ended up just two years later just leaving on their own cars\nRight it was the evacuation of New York ah in in November of Seventeen eighty three and a you know a huge huge\nSymbolic act if nothing else in Washington rides in um as a a you know as a ride thin it's it's it's now um you know we have one this and it's it's one of the major moments in American\nHistory yeah we ah went down to Francesco tavern yeah where she had his final drink a the report is a with his soldiers year he was overcome with emotion\nI couldn't really speak but he says come up and touch me yeah and basically she would take to shake my head but yeah and they did and they watched as he walked out to a barge there was waiting and took him down stream\nAnd then you look out and you go to ... really to do was make a turn you could see with a barge would be Oh absolutely I mean it's not as if it's been covered up by building you could see the path that Washington talk\nSnow it's amazing when you go down to that Wall Street section of New York you know the ... it's a village or when you look at the historical buildings and it was all very intimate\nUh well when you look at the historical buildings and it was all very intimate\nAnd when Washington left and he was on his way to Annapolis where the continental Congress was to surrender his commission from ... done you guys can have you back up a country might be alone you know and King George when he heard that this was Washington's plan to retire to Mount Vernon\nHe said if he does that he will be the greatest man in the world because you know ... it was inconceivable to surrender power I mean you know so many dictators had had refused to do that in the past and the polling in the future book that's what Washington did\nAnd he made it possible for republic to then spring up from this this great victory right but at first it will be no president no there was no president there was a dysfunctional Congress or without an executive\nAnd it would take you know almost five years before the continental Congress would uh with the the constitutional convention would begin to create the system that we have\nToday I understand you can use to grant sure okay yeah we're going to have a few more questions because the other thing that's happening now since last time we left more than ever because the attack on history and our past\nAnd but you know I talked to Douglas Brinkley about this talked Doris

I Know that you're you're from Missouri Missouri is a special state because Democrats are more conservative they are more pro life they're more pro God of theirs are shrinking base that a clear as to appeal to so this video tape and side of her office shows her own staffers\nAre saying they were fueled coordinators talking about how she has to miss\nUh saying they're her field coordinators talking about how she has to mislead voters um she says of course when we asked her about\nGun bans we got clarification from her staff you heard the soundbite they're semi automatic rifle ban another staffer Nick\nStole roast says that\nShe has the same policies as President Obama but she has to mislead cheat and she says that people just can't know that she had the McCaskill a bomb a quote essentially have the same views on everything so there's this pattern in these red states Missouri being couple the strongest example or the Democrats have to lie to have to mislead\nThe voters because of the nature of the political dynamics in that state and that's what this videotape showed that shows all of her staffers saying\nWell she's got this incremental approach she can't speak publicly about it this is what they're all saying behind closed doors one of the staffers actually says she has to essentially lie about everything wow\nYeah she said that they and what the video shows is that\nUh she still close with Obama that he can't come to Missouri to campaign for her otherwise it will\nAh make her look as though she's not a moderate it came out that she gets to take the money from Planned Parenthood although they they don't publicize that they take money from a mom's demand and apparently moms demand a Bloomberg um astro turf gun control group comprise a lot of her staff\n[noise] hit us got robbed mills who's one of the higher ups in her office says that she doesn't open ... support moms demand action because in this is a direct quote because quote it could hurt her ability to get elected\nMissouri and see that and they're like well I don't want to support or even though they stand for the same policies so you're talking about this incremental approach where she'll she'll do it a little bit at a time and he said quote she's really good about strategy and making sure has a goal and can get their\nUh she's worked out stuff with moms demand to make sure that she can support their goals without supporting organization openly and there's this pattern in in Missouri where\nThe Democrats you know there still are I guess a very tiny pro life Democrat community it's shrinking because most of those folks have have chosen to become Republicans but they're they're still she's still trying to\nLike she has to lie to half of the people and then be honest with the other half and that's what this reporter so damning about because it just blows it all open there's a Greek chorus of people in our office all saying the same thing on all the issues Obama guns\nAnd Planned Parenthood there's even a thing about impeachment where we ask this this Stafford Glenn Winfrey is the staffers and it was just so tell us about\n... plans to impeach truck\nAnd we the staffer says we're going to tell the moderates to quote get over it\nOnce we pull a bait and switch on them you know so it's just all across the board insider office\nWow yeah and that and that was pretty I thought that was fascinating as well like get over it and that's what moderate\nDefinitely should pay attention to she's focusing on all of the things ultimately\nThat add costs Hillary Clinton the election and it's you know it's difficult for her because it is very much it's a Trump state um a lot of Democrats voted for Trump and they're pretty please me look at approval ratings and his approval ratings\nAre in Missouri they're pretty pleased with what he's been doing and what it means for you know the manufacturing in that state um\nThat I I I how she responded as to the\nAh because I I guess is she can tend to allow her staff to talk for her are all in all of a moderate to\nThat is the question I I was in Columbia yesterday Columbia, Missouri and I did talk to the next arose to walk down the street to his office and I do or stop them with a with a camera on my shoulder and a microphone and I said ... you know what why aren't you honest with people and he said I Can't I'm not authorized to speak to the press\nAnd that kind of felt proud because I kind of felt like saying well Nick they don't consider me a journalist so maybe you can talk to me but\nHe did not talk to me I did get a comment from Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate he's tweeted the video out twice and they usually what happens data has happened in Tennessee is that that first they'll they'll try not to talk about it and then there'll be this bubbling critical mass ground swelling from the grassroots\nIt'll get on local TV ONE of the local reporters will ask Claire and she'll have to fumble and bumble that's typically how this stuff goes because there's nothing for to say all of her staff are calling her ally or what is she going to do fire all of her staff will\nThere be honest with you the staffer are being honest there they're on unbeknownst to them they're whistle blowers and they're being very honest and forthcoming about what she stands for so it'll be interesting to see the local TV stations in Missouri ask the questions\nI Would I think that Missouri voters would like to I think everybody would like to know where she stands on it because she it's weird she'll be very vocal about where things and then she goes and hides when it gets really tough\nSo uh we'll see we'll reach out to her too although I don't think she will ever come on but uh well if we can yeah we've reached out to our repeatedly she hates me so you got more from her than any other journalistic project variants has ... dot com and tune it out the video as Well James O'Keefe we're going to follow this closely because we'd love them clarify that\nAnd a follow this closely because we'd love some clarification from Senator McCaskill as always thanks for joining us\nThank you so much take care\nYeah I Would love to see I'm just very curious and and did you hear in a video too if you watch it the staffer said oh yeah we got a lot of moms demand people that work here they're trying to import into that state just like they're trying to do in Nevada just like they're trying to do in ah Texas and everywhere else they're trying to Bloomberg is trying to import\nUh or export from New York into the state New York style gun control meaning in New York say fact they're going to the state's going to make sure you store things the way the state wants it to et cetera et cetera\nUh but uh and and she's not vocal about it because it will cost her with voters so voters in the state especially the more moderate ones you know the only to figure out sort of where you you guys are going to be going with this ah because she looks like she had been on the up and up with you\nI Will reach out for clarification as well we have more to come including coming up Broadway star Patti LuPone says the Christian right is no different from al ...\nOh I Know I she's yeah the president rips a Stormy Daniels right or ... calling her horse face she says game on tiny and accuses him of ... this

you're really rich and a lot of people out there that they don't make that kinda money [laughter] so so so so it's just not enough\nThe top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes meaning a greater share of the money they make so a a percentage of the money they take in\nThe top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes than the bottom Ninety percent combined still not enough sir\nNot at all we need to go after these are these people that fall under the thirty to forty percent making about two fifty to about six hundred thousand have but give it to the government\nThe top fifty percent of all taxpayers paid Ninety seven percent of total individual income taxes I Would say people are paying their fair share that would be my point of view\nThey're paying more than their fair share you would say that I Would say that I was I'd rather they take a ten Fifteen twenty percent of that money and pilot back into the private economy as opposed to going up there for some boondoggle plan if some professor UGA decided hooked up in his mind one night that would to equal the or do something about the income gap\nAnd these people have to pay for it I'd

right now and quick service magazine I is that it is that an industry service journalism and fast food service industry rag\nAnd they say through a rigorous research that Burger King as the fastest drive through line of all the fast food chain that spot a lot of people are embarrassed during the\nDress [laughter] what's the matter can't afford McDonalds here [laughter] I actually like Burger

claim that the one or two things happened here either\nThey just did this in areas where there was no chick fillet or more likely they knew chick fillet would win and they didn't want to you know the whole chick fillet right and you know how are you have if they go to church and they actually believe what is the ...\nThey was a chick fillet what all my hippie friends and I have a lot of them you know people on the left like you know what here's the thing you may disagree with chick fillet on this political issue or that one because they they skew evangelical in their\nOutlook outlook ... outlook of the world the outlook of a\nThe world but here's the thing they put their money where their mouth is they're closed on Sundays or you take all of those stores I don't know how many stores chick fillet has in the country\nThe amount of revenue they willingly because of their principles because of their religious principles how many other companies how many other entities any people\nWalk it like they talk it by closing every store on Sunday every week I Can't imagine the amount of revenue they lose every Sunday\nAnd then a month a year didn't\nSomebody looking fine having over to two thousand two hundred location and they you know if you've ever gone to chick fillet for lunch there are a lot of money on the line at two thirty in the afternoon and you think people would not on their way the games are on the way home from church\nSo they're given up a lot of money and a lot of my left the friends who are socialists and they owe people care too much about money and

for you it's not really bond yeah why he's an actor plays pond [laughter] I Can't believe it got sick of this [laughter] wherever the masculinity humor is just going away\nSo many comedians now that decide what you oh you can't make a joke about that\nAs we get further away from the cabin on hearing just a that no one is Saturday Night live Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Kimble Stephen ... bear cordon Seth Meyers how many he put all of those comedy writers together is probably a hundred people\nAnd all of them I guess on their own\nCame to the conclusion that there was zero humor potential in anything Dr Ford said or anything she did they must have all come to that on their own so that's called self censorship\nEven though I've got a really funny joke I'm not going to put it out there is not going to be worth it\n\nTo people who are young let me just say the world wasn't always like\nThis everyone was open\nIf you were on the in the public eye the only time people cared was if you were a private citizen minding your own business\nBut if you're in the public eye when you were open to parody\nWe see this so much now a member Samantha beat a couple of weeks ago how you know it's just been brought to my attention that um some men are raped and ah [noise] it's just wrong to uh\nMen are raped and ah [noise] it's just wrong to ah make light of that has anybody ever heard of gallows humor condemned men making jokes to each other as they're walking\nTo the gallows to be hung maybe for something they didn't do and in that period of time wise millennia would say how inappropriate\nTo be making jokes it's called gallows humor\nThere's a reason to be humorous about anything there are also lines that are drawn certain jokes you don't tell in mixed company this is all common sense\nOf comedians now deciding every week there's a new saying oh we don't make jokes about that patent Oswald writing something and one of these ridiculous magazines\nOh here's the joke that I ever I regret it gotta be kidding me funny joke to I Believe that there should be a real study done in academia you don't get any real good studies you know get a new nine thousand study about climate change\nWe got our are the fastest drive through line early\nOn about some of this kind of reality have come out of a okay I got out of the ACA academia\nWhat's becoming ... which I Would I Would like to know more about or something I think that I'm noticing which is very interesting is that if people are free long enough so this has been a free country for I mean let's throw everybody and\nLet's let's let's let's pull it up and go I'm going to be controversial to anybody [laughter] since Nineteen\nSixty six at least in trying to outlaw this has been a free country for everybody\nSo in fifty some odd years my question is\nIs it obvious that a free people eventually will begin to censor themselves like the government isn't there saying you don't go to jail for making any of these jokes that now Samantha being patting Oswald say shouldn't be said you don't go to jail is not a government saying\nThese are artists\nWho are making decisions amongst themselves these writers and all of these late night ah comedy rooms there's no government that saying you can't make a joke about Dr Ford's testimony\nThese are free people free artist who are putting limits on themselves there is a very interesting to me it's not something that we thought that you know we know America is an experiment we know we don't know how how long uh uh people governed by themselves can last\nBut I don't think anybody saw this wrinkle\nBut actually if people are free long enough\nThey will begin\nTo censor their own speech they will begin to decide that there are things they are not say one in the past the whole idea was you'd better not say get your head cut off\nAnd that this will be led of course it would have to be led by artist because they're the creative minds so you have in a free\nCountry in the world now we're at a point where artist or deciding that there are certain things they shouldn't comment on I Know for a fact now that I'm authors young authors submit their work\nLike if there's a\nIf there's something in there about a minority they submit their work they pay minorities to read their stuff before it gets published so that they can come back to them and tell them oh you shouldn't say that well okay I'll take it out I mean after all you're the minority and I you know I'll take it out\nOf that that's artist asking\nTo be censored\nAsking the question what shouldn't I say and this comes out of the freest country in the history of the world\nPublished authors have to do that now too you know like ... or any of those guys right as pop guys that came out in the nineties in two thousand they meet in groups and they read their books to each other and stuff and then that's problematic you got to take it out so guy like him he left the group\nGood some people are going to leave the group and there are going to be more successful by the way you know whatever your vision is an artist that's what you should go with\nAmazing I I it seems so ... it's been now perhaps there to say like politically correct that's been now perhaps there's too much freedom that's the point my question is if people get enough freedom will they be given to all of their own free will\nRestrict their own freedom\nAnd and I guess it all comes from the idea of well we're becoming more enlightened about other people's freedom and what they need now no one is free from humor at least not yet that's not the way it used to be\nAt least not yet that's not the way it used to be oh this where you can't make a joke about Dr Ford yeah I Know that uh she claimed we had to wait a week because she doesn't like to fly and then we find out that she flies all the time\nI get there was a different ... yeah it's a little ... and get stuck there for a cup of coffee

was pointed out that she flies to Hawaii and all these other places because she loves to serve and she actually said\nI'm flying doesn't bother me when I fly in that direction on vacation if any

at the ballot box\nAnd away apparently a it was on with Mika Brzezinski\nAnd they wait patiently a it was on with Mika Brzezinski\nOver the Joe and make a liberal Morning Joe show\nOut of a broad question about the future of the Democratic party how does the party reclaim its reach across the country well fighting these battles came replies way we get outside the bubble as we take advantage of the tremendous public outcry against the administration we've got to do is fight in Congress bite in the courts fight in the streets fight on line bite at the ballot box\nAnd now there's momentum to be able to do this\nWhen I was so excited that the American public has energized to speak out against the abuses of his administration for the way we get outside the bubble\nYears we take advantage of this tremendous a public outcry against the administration what we've got to do is fight in Congress fight in the courts fight in the street fight online fight at the ballot box and now there's momentum to be able to do that\nNow there's momentum and we can be able to do it we got a it was one article out today oh in people play several is that true this can't be true\nGateway pundit reporting that separate pigs heads at polling stations in Austin, Texas no way I'm not believing that it's got to be fake nose probably one of those fake reports\nAbout to talk to sweep baby James to

oh good grief\nReally twisted in sick I got to tell you\nLook at how sad things have gotten you know you got the ... now that we're talking about mob mentality apparently the scorched earth war against Republicans who oppose ... capital by the way you know they want to impeach bright capital there's no reason to impeach him no way they can impeach him can't be impeached for what he did did before he was in office\nAnyway we have poor Susan Collins that day after the hazmat team had to be called in to deal with a suspicious packages that they claim Bryson was a part of a one of these anti capital nut job send to her and her husband now we have a major university being bombarded with calls to rescind the honorary degrees they gave cones in Nineteen\nNinety eight and twenty Seventeen and that was you know it just wears I mean I just don't understand the whole sick ugly twisted mentality that has emerged here but it's it is what it is this is the modern day radicalized left wing Democratic Party\nAnti closely vowing yesterday that if she wins backed the speakership\nOh well you know why don't you just in your mind say do I want Nancy Pelosi speaker do I want to elect somebody that's going to vote for Nancy Pelosi\nDo I agree with the agenda that gave us the worst economy and America's declining position on the world stage which was polo seeing Obama\nDo I want that and maybe I don't feel like voting but that's like a half a vote for below sea and a half of both for your democratic Senator Schumer it'd be a stay home\nYou said if she does nothing that she would trade for President Trump's wall she'd said if it ... it happens to be like a man who would issue for the president building a wall I'm not interested in that\n[laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\nI mean imagine if Trump says we can't allow him to say we're not interested in protecting the border well you're not they want to open borders and the one on limiting ice\nAnyway her stance on the wall won't matter you know where Republicans during the lame duck they have enough votes to pass you know the billions of dollars the president's requested by the way some Democrats are claiming Obama's a wall during the midterm campaigns this was in the Daily Beast too bad\nI don't think it really helps voter registration numbers show no sign of Democrats so called big blue wave in the country\nIf you look at it after conducting an extensive study of voter registration numbers across the country NBC News which has been pushing this pony blue wave narrative for a long time about what may be the going unfolds I don't know I Hope not I don't have a crystal ball you have that power not me\nAny way that it will actually materialized will say you know denounce not sure that was that he's uncertain didn't want certainty over whether or not the wall or the wave will materialize contrary to the fake news media predictions democratic GOP voter registrations were at the exact same level as they have been in the past election cycles\nLet's see daisy I don't know by the way of paid democratic fraud or bring has been uncovered in in Texas picked up by CBS News in Dallas\nAnd in Texas picked up by CBS News in Dallas early for women have been charged with felonies in Fort Worth after discovering that they were intercepting ballots primarily intended for elderly voters and filling them out themselves or trying to trick the intended voters into signing up not just a few ballots either\nVoter fraud involves mail in ballots and apparently is fairly widespread and a major organization the attorney general's office is pursuing the case for two years it's a major organized crime situation known as harvest there's\nThese women were part of a group that's been filling out ballots in the hundreds or even the thousands\nRight well where's the Democrats over that let's say\nHello see having the gamble will give me leverage over Trump polo see Democrats could win a suit nominee some democratic candidates are actually running ads against below sea don't worry when they get elected they're going to do everything you'd expect them to do vote for her you vote for a Democrat\nAnywhere in any house district you're voting for below sea you both for senator\nThat's a Democrat in Florida Nelson and sit in a month in Arizona the vote against Heller in Nevada if you vote for British than a Democrat phony in Tennessee not Marsha Blackburn you're voting for Schumer\nSame thing goes for Claire McCaskill you vote for her you're voting for Schumer you vote for Heidi Heitkamp you voting for shooter Schumer your vote protest three voting for Schumer it won't but Donnelly voting pushed Schumer\nJust what it is you don't vote for Ted Cruz you're voting for sure in Texas Texas\nUnbelievable that give me more leverage over Trump I have the gal I'll trade nothing of manhood issue for the president building a wall", "show_name":
