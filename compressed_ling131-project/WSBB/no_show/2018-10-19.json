Bush nobody said that and I just thought something was a foot there was something about Donald Trump and you look at here we are almost two years later\nAnd Donald Trump remade American politics and just look at how many politicians are trying to out\nTrump I mean you got Elizabeth Warren this past week I mean she really stepped in it because she had you know obviously he really\nGot under her nerves and she took debate you know\nShe did the one thing I'm sure some genius who is now looking for work said hey I've got a great idea you're going to have your big presidential rollout let's do it three weeks before the mid term elections when all the Democrats are just trying to stay\nOn the offensive because we're ahead and what does she do she makes a big announcement hey I might be one\nThousand Native American fat is just crazy because people are tried out do Trump\nBecause that's how he got a notice the accurate one one thousand twenty four to ... percent European but the thing is the first minority\nWoman ever tenured professor at Harvard I mean she did it for organizations she was a part of she did it at U. Penn when she was a I guess teaching their wrote this this was a this for her was a calling card and I\nRemember Shawn you go back to a a month ago before she imploded like this uh you know that\nThe mainstream media regarded her as perhaps the one democratic standard bearer who could at her age with her stance take on a lot of the Bernie Sanders positions of and\nA lot of the British Sanders positions are and and she was a senator and she was relatively young so ... and then she does this so now\nIn the past week essentially the mainstream media kind of turned on her it's like they they called her up that was a dumb idea why because they want to find somebody who is a viable alternative to Donald Trump\nAnd they can win and with this kind of baggage she's not going in place\nWhat do you think as you look at and we look at polls every day and I watch Fox and friends and I watch you guys you do a great show you the number one new show on cable news by far in your hour and you have

mother\n[laughter] he's got his mother's hair I'll just say that I'm Peter told me that he was a you know he's following the elections very carefully and he's got a source of income both sides of the ... one of the guys who is in charge of buying the ads for the Republicans in Washington DC says it over the last two weeks they see a essentially\nA five point bump across the board for Republicans and they're basing that that they attribute it to Kavanaugh\nThey attributed to taxes and they attributed to immigration\nAnd so given the fact that the enthusiasm level is higher boats suddenly the Republicans are spiking\nAt exactly the right time the big question is and I know a Newt Gingrich I think he resigned with us like you said the election comes down to to think Kavanaugh and the care of it and the caravan of of course of course of action by the United states hey Mexico do something about this or going to have to put troops on our southern border and shut it down\nWell I think the caravan is it really does highlight the case here and\nI got to tell you something the way the Democrats abandon I mean when you become the party of all we want to raise taxes\nWe want to open borders

off [noise] there's a new study that's been published by Deloitte\nBig guy consulting outfit and they found that\nPeople doing four O. one K. loans\nDecimate your future financial security and retirement\nIt's very common that employers will make it super easy for you to do a loan from their four one K. plan\nAnd the philosophy of employers historically has been hey if we locked down our four one K. and people know they can't touch the money under basically any circumstances\nThan they are going to be afraid to contribute enough money to save for retirement\nBut the reality is a lot of people do take loans out from a four one\nK. and depending on\nWhose survey data you believe it's a very very common thing for people to do four one K. loans and typically somewhere twenty twenty five percent of people will do four one K. loans but the thing is when you do that\nThose loans dramatically reduce how much money you have down the road\nAnd in fact you may find that\nYou will have to do away your retirement years down the road that you'll have to work any of a number of additional years to make up for the last earnings from that four one K. loan\nThat's even when you pay the loan back and you may wonder how could that be\nWell\nThere's a two for here when you borrow from a four O. one K. you have to pay back the plan right\nAnd so while that money is not invested in most Sears Holdings in four one K. is go up so you lose the up escalator on that money that you borrowed\nYeah you can get a commission if he can bring out of their faith lent and that's what my antenna\nUh and how much commission like if you get me to buy you said a hundred and fifty dollars worth if you get me to buy a hundred and fifty dollars worth of this\nThis electronic Coyne how much do you get to the commission\nI get a ten percent\nSo he's got Fifteen dollars and then whoever is putting this together gets the hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nAnd the whole product is this supposed that money that you're supposed to trust and that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy and sell things\nThat's that's the story\nOkay how would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there's no true product or service that's being sold if it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins\nAnd that

part of the deal section is last minute cruises and it's a cruise lines\nDeal section is last minute cruises and it's a cruise lines can dump their unsold inventory on ships at the very last minute and you'll find\nThat if you can be opportunistic like that and by a cruise at the very last instant that that's a great way for you to do it also have you ever been to the website cruise compete dot com\n[noise] no I haven't\nSaid Cruz compete you can put what you're interested in doing and cruise only agencies literally compete for your business\nAnd so many times they may be willing to give up some of their commissions um you know in order to be able to sell you at a lower price\nOkay that sounds pretty you know talk like last minute as you said on the website there are they talking a few days or like a\nGenerally with rose last minute is less than three weeks before sailing\nOr less okay less than three weeks\nBecause you think about most people that are buying a cruise they're not like you they're not living gosh if you're in central Florida\nYou're fifty minutes or so from Port Canaveral which I think is the biggest\nUs crews sport now there's a lot of ships sail out of Tampa that are like probably Ninety minutes from you and people in South Florida Miami Fort Lauderdale across the Everglades\nIn Naples Marco Island they do these last minute deals and so it's very common practice\nFor Floridians to do these last minute bookings 'cause you don't need air but most people\nAre living who knows where in the United states or even in Canada or overseas or whatever and they've got to make advanced plans so once you cross that Twenty one day period\nThat's when you see so many of the deals\nOkay very good and the most of the large cruise lines they'll participate in a\nRow not necessarily it varies I'm looking right now on what's available on the thing I was talking about they're showing a lot of cruises that are just in the next couple of days\nThat there are real deals on to those that are about yeah about three weeks out\nThat there are great deals on and they show you how much a percent discount there at but I don't ever believed discount from a cruise line I only care about what the prices and comparing the price from one vendor to another\nOkay very good appreciate your health closure\nAnd have a great time and remember always join whatever frequent guest program there is for each cruise line you go on because you accumulate enough points which you can easily do living in Florida now\nThat you start getting all kinds of benefits like uh maybe if you like to drink free liquor on board don't do that before you fly um anything that makes it a better experience like free cabin upgrades those kinds of things are available as you accumulate points on particular cruise lines\nKelly is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Kelly how're you\nHi ... I'm great how are you I Am having a wonderful day thank you what's going on Kelly\nWell my husband and I are finally getting around to cutting out the window and living trashed and special needs as we have special needs kids actually yellow adults and we have no idea how much to put in a special needs for\nThe amount of money potentially to set aside to be quite large and if they are young adults I gosh\nI don't know the sensitive way to ask this question so I'm just going to need to ask gays okay I Know what\nYou're going to say they have potential to live to be a hundred years old [laughter]\nHow did you know that was what was going to as he has\nA lawyer asked that same day so he said I don't know how to ask that so I I should've just put that in there before you even had to ask okay so we need to be prepared that\nA you know could live you know All right we'll longtime white\nPeople normally do is the first thing you do is for each of the kids you establish a five twenty nine able if you're familiar with five twenty nine or ... if you saw a lawyer a that was probably explain to you\nAnd count I now I don't remember\nWhat an what five twenty nine able is is it's an account where you are able to put money in for each of their children the gross tax free and spin on their needs is spent tax free\nOkay so the first money you put aside for a disabled child should always going to enable\nOkay and they vary\nGoing to enable okay and they vary in cost\nOr because they're sponsored by states in some states have very very low cost tables and others have more expensive ones it's almost like a cousin of the five twenty nine college savings plans I'll talk about\nOkay the best\nBriefing available in the country on buying an evil is it's saving for college dot com\nOkay\nAnd I know this isn't about college but they've done a very nice job breaking out the the cost for the able accounts\nOkay\nSo if you go there you'll be able to see is a very simple chart you'll be able to see how the plan works\nAnd I want to congratulate the people at saving for college dot com for doing such a nice job on that but that would allow you to put aside it didn't answer your question how much money should you have instead I jumped right to this is the most efficient place for you to start putting money\nAs far as how you'd find in overall need for a lifespan that might be another potentially Seventy or eighty years\n... term life insurance is almost certainly the best choice with the money going into a trust for the benefit of each child to separate

into\n[noise] and you have some meaningful expense and drawing up the trust that the life insurance would find [laughter]\nBut because the the financial need if you were to die much younger than

meeting was for\nNon registration\nUnder your\nHey it's Eric van has through my radio show is now on three hours every weekday minds a new right here on WN be\nThat being said Saudi Arabia's then a very important ally of ours in the middle east if you look in Saudi Arabia and they're an ally and there was tremendous purchaser\nPub not only military equipment but other things what I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things so they are an important ally but I Want to find out what happened where is this will and will probably know that by the end of the way for my my parents coming back we're going to the loans off\nI have nothing against the president taking his time but man I have never seen a case with such overwhelming evidence ever that means so much but John Roberts is always there to put it on perspective he seen it all lived at all and there's been nothing like the ... even for John\nBut there's a new one John a U.S that do you are the White House's you or Fox News is cheap White House correspondent did I get your time to correct\nYou did ...\n... ... something a little extra and your packet this week for\nDoing this thank you John this this thirty three year old who sixty minutes says with his revolutionary leader and was impressing everyone by letting women drive on their own which I'm against here and you know I fought against that I don't think women should be driving in America I'm only kidding\nAround anymore no you can't you can't get around and they were did we miss characterized this guy if this is true\nWell is it if the if the prince and Sleeping Beauty is is being criticized for the kiss that will occur uh I don't know where we\nGo I have no shot but let's say let's talk about this I mean right now I I Know that the administration saying we have a lot on the line here and the president plays all his cards in front of you which we're not used to but but it is overwhelming what's coming out now isn't it\nUh I mean it really is it ... there's there's there's no question that\nSomething is is going on here and it's going on if not at the highest levels at least in an orbit that is very close to the highest levels I mean if you look at the Fifteen people that turkey has said we're responsible for the disappearance of the alleged murder of John Rocker shaggy\nA number of those people up to nine or ten of them\nAre a very much involved with the Saudi royal family in terms of security than this one I saw\nA ... minute trip\nA he said to be an intelligence agency for the Saudi intelligence services so this this is getting very close to the orbit of Mohammed bin ... and as you pointed out there's this contradiction here because he has liberalize some of the policies in Saudi Arabia\nBut at the same time he has a you know I take it a lot of people who have said in the royal family who were corrupt and imprisoned them\nAt a hotel in downtown ... so he has built a lot of enemies as well and if he is in any way involved\nWith the despair it's an alleged murder of democracy Yogi that is going to be a serious blow to us Saudi relations particularly since NBS as he is now and is expected to take over from king saw him on in the not too distant future\nSo the word is uh they're trying to find a way forward here let alone the ... has the details come out that it ... if this is all true and the audio reveals he was tortured interrogated fingers cut off while alive and there was a report that\nUh to chop up his body he urged everybody to put on music while they did it\n[noise] yeah and and the fact that the ah [noise] ah the Saudi console\nUh Mohammed ... is a allegedly a herd on on tape it saying don't do this here take it outside you're going to get me in trouble in another voice sudden this alleged audio recording says shut up if you want to make it back to Saudi Arabia alive I made it definitely seems like like something\nVery horrific took place inside the Saudi consulate and then there's this idea that it cleaning crew was in there just before forensic experts came in there were walls that were repaint it but you know if you're if you're a good forensic expert and and this is not just from watching\nUh you know and see I S a but if you're a good forensic expert you can you can find traces of of blood\nOr good forensic expert you can you can find traces of of blood in places where you would think that you would be able to it's very very difficult to clean it up if you know what you're doing\nJohn how you explain this type of miscalculation if all this is true with ... I think that they think they could get away with it\nI think it's I mean have you know you're dealing with the society that for years has disappeared enemies and it's not just not just Saudi Arabia it's it's so many other places um you know I I I I think I think Louisiana Senator John Kennedy\nWho is ... is is known for his colorful language a set of quite accurately when he said the other day I other than\nIsrael I trust a Middle Eastern countries about as much as I trust gas station sushi you know there are there is a a long you know thousands your long history of dealing with your enemies in in various\nMet evil waves and uh I I think that this may be another case of that I don't know who or why they thought that they could get away with it but but somebody clearly thought that they cook\nSo what's the way forward here in the revolution prove current uh revelations proved correct there's not going to be much time for the White House or for Saudi Arabia\nAnd this is why many people are saying that this is one of the most important decisions how he handles this will be one of the most important decisions that President Trump makes because you can can you just let it ... if if this was involved with the highest levels how do you just let them get away with it and if you have to do something\nWhat is it that you do because you've got in the overall a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of a military arms deals are going with Saudi Arabia that means tens of thousands of jobs for companies like Lockheed and Northrop Grumman racy on and and Boeing\nAnd then there is you know a greater trade relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia the president said the overall value of the deals that they signed last year was four hundred and fifty billion dollars and then you have to have Saudi Arabia's\nCooperation in the war on terror you've got to have them standing as a bulwark against the Iranian expansionist um I'd ideas\nAnd and then you've got this idea of oil everybody says well you know America's mayor become the number one oil producer in the world\nYou know that's that may be all well and good but you shut down the Saudi oil supply and you watch how fast the price of gas a gallon type the ... how fast the price of gallon of\nGasoline jumped so it's a very very important relationship\nAnd uh how the president deals with this east east going to have a very very difficult needle to thread\nRight I mean if he came out and say hey by the way we're bringing up relations and no one would push back in the Republicans are upset Democrats are upset Corker came out right away and said the guy's dead and then but it's windy Graham says it's time for the prince to step aside princes don't usually do that I studied a lot of prince tech a print I think the chances\nAre modern been Solomon stepping aside and prince ... suddenly becoming the crown prince again I I think is highly unlikely\nYou look for the president went after ... secretary of state Pompeo to make a statement on this today\nTom if not the president or it may be possible for ... to come out and say something he did come out the other day and say something\nAh after ah he had had a meeting with the president so uh we'll see as as always\nOur Brian you never know what's going to happen with this White House I mean the president woke up this morning and threatened to put the the US military on the southern border to close it if Mexico didn't do something about this caravan of of Hondurans which seems awfully conspicuously timed considering we're three weeks away from the mid term elections\nSo I'm getting a somewhere that Venezuela actually might be behind is is that what you're hearing\nGuy I don't know yet I don't know\nDo you want to just do agree with me and make me feel\nLike I could I could I could do that and probably be pretty safe ground\n[laughter] or you could say it's impossible at this point a to a John what's on the agenda today\nOr what can the president woke up this morning and drove the news cycle by saying then you might put the U.S military on the southern border to close that if\nA rascal doesn't do something about this Honduran Karen but he's going to Montana right oh you oh that\nIs going to Montana and then he's going to Arizona [noise] ah and then after that he's going to Nevada so I you know he's he's going to be away from the White House for three days but even when the president is away there's still a ton of news coming out of here so\nUh we we can't afford to be away for a second by\nSomebody else who's raising the John Roberts family uh I Would I Would\nBe coaching my son's little league baseball team but unfortunately\nRight kids can't play because of the president that's a new ad for the Democrats can't play sports bags on Robert or a ticker alright uh that was an interesting hit I think John regrets taking the making the call am I right I'm pretty sure\nHowever if they think the administration thinks that the message sent if they find some very questionable way to pay for this over\nThe message sent will be catastrophic around the middle east and two American journalists around the world\nIf this guy paid the price for his life and not only was killed was tortured doing it knowing that this ties back to America which should have made them in pervious from another country as opposed to a terrorist act\nYou'd expect is sadly from ISIS al ... al Shabaab but not a ...\nAt least from ISIS al ... al Shabaab but not a country that is helping broker Middle East peace with Israel\nAnd then a country that's been a counter to uh run not a country that has gotten the first visit overseas visit from the ... the United states and they showed them that respect they may have and according to Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker we've talked to on and off the air the intelligence they have received indicates that this happened\nI Want the administration to collect its cards it's crossed his T's dotted ties but understand that they cannot pull this off they could not get away with it you could think of the responsible I think it's accurate Fred listening K. J. J. in uh in Arizona Fred\nHow are you doing Brian Greene a I agree with the previous caller I mean you have to look at this from a purely analytical basis who benefits from this instability between us and the ... and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nThere are many enemies of states who are very happy with this situation we're very close with people in Saudi Arabia fate\nYou know what I Would love bread you know what I Would love I Would love Saudi Arabia to deny it\nWell you know I Would say what they say you know maybe if here's my point\nIs that you have to say who benefits from it out as MPs benefit from us out of ... like the ... the kingdom of Saudi Arabia benefit from\nIran you have if you will have a turkey these are all people that have contrary interest to the United states they want to see this happen how do we know that this was oh we're getting is you know recordings\nOf what who made those recordings ... these are things that we can make major decisions on without having a\nPro and here in front of the ... the president agrees with you I've read by the way or the president has come out with a policy he hasn't come out with the position he's still collecting information I he evidently is not willing to share cut to\n[noise] for this video or until it is that the ... we have this or that didn't exist whereas a them but we've got we've asked for it if it exists [laughter] I'm not sure yet that didn't exist probably does possibly does\nUh I'll have a full report on that from my when he comes back for that that's one of the things I very that's going to be\nQuestion I asked you up a so he's got to hold these cards like you are Fred but when when the Graham came in and you know his own arm services gets a lotta information as well as tapped into the White House said this how\nDo I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS the de facto leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nNow here's Bob Corker\nWe've had our alliance with them but look it's a it's going to be hugely damaged and uh I Know that Congress there at the lowest point with Congress that they've ever ban since I've been hearing them I've been up by the way of a friend of Saudi Arabia is okay I tried I've tried to kick keep by arms sales from\nMaine blocked by Congress and have been successful up until this point I Would not be successful in that on the floor to die and I don't know that I wouldn't even attempt to be successful I probably am now moving in another direction with them\nThey're right and I when I have guys like dad come forward you know if I see Senator Schumer get primary microphone Feinstein I roll my eyes I have no interest they just want to damage the president the party\nWhen I see these guys and outgoing chairman of Foreign Relations and a fan of the president who's to support her Senate Lindsey

have a love affair with autocrats\nPresident Trump Trump Trump Trump yeah I mean the idea that he's already making excuses before the faction\nTypical but it hurts us international\nThat is the former vice president of the United states Joe Biden on CBS or talking a little bit about the president and his assessment of how he's dealing with this disaster this political disaster uh over in Saudi Arabia and turkey regarding the missing Washington Post columnist\nOr the president loves these autocrats so what's he going to do is it going to crack down on Saudi Arabia\nLet's deal in rich Lowry he is the editor of National Review a friend of this program a friend of mine and a friend of yours rich the morning to you\nHey Steve I ah how's it going it must be a lot of pressure big big shoes to fill kill made out of it than like left [laughter]\nI was just hoping you know what am I going to do for the first twenty four minutes and tell a rich Lowry comes on to\n... yeah okay All right I'll bail you out [laughter] so it'll be radio magic now I I\nThink so far so good uh what do you think about the president in how we said you know let's not be too fast to blame the Saudis regarding the missing guy\nSo I don't mind the attitude let let's wait and see all the facts what I Do think the president has theme could be too eager to accept\n'em a cover story from the Saudis yep so I don't I don't think that's the appropriate public posture and uh apparently ... ... recording in which was quite tough than his private meetings\nWith the ... so I mean the difficulty it it seems clear they deliberately set out to murder this guy and the most hideous way you know out of the Quentin Tarantino\nMovies yeah and we're each day\nWhen we turn to you know movies\nYeah and what he's saying\nShould condemn them there should be some sort of consequences\nBut you don't want to destabilize the regime because this although I think the Saudis are bastards is is probably the best we can help or um in terms of the government and Saudi Arabia and to their an important ally and you know forced to choose between the Iranian and us out which we are you know on a daily basis you go with the Saudis even\nThough they are imperfect and repressive and murderous but I I just this is such an additional being a\nCrime to such a blunder I now know figure I can come at your conflict and not leave and no one's going to notice well\nAnd and it makes you wonder has this ever happened before this happened to guys who simply aren't weren't apple watches and and somebody's rolling tape on him\nYeah I mean well they're they kill dissidents all the time they just usually don't do it and there's a brazen a man or\nA overseas so it's bad you know the the reputation of the crown prince will never be the same\nUm but you know where we can't overthrow the Saudi Government and create a liberal liberal government they're just the conditions aren't there for that I don't really have to deal with reality as it is\nAnd that's where I think you know Trump has represented a correction to an over emphasis on idealism you know in the Bush years he just has to guard against going out swinging too far in the other direction\nSure and of course everybody's hanging on everything he says because we are less than three weeks away from the midterms and you know the Republicans are terrified that they're going to lose the house there's certain it looks like they could actually pick up some seats in the Senate but that's another story\nRegarding the midterms what is on your radar as something that could break a either way for either side and the next three weeks\n[noise] I I don't know it would would\nBe inherently in some sort of surprised\nWhat about the Caribbean\nUm it it could yet could could help energize the Republican voters hum and the question is clearly that the gather the Kavanaugh fight was galvanizing Republicans increase their energy which is hugely important and transformed\nUm a couple of these Senate races where it looks and almost impossible to me now that Republicans could lose nominal\nControl I think they have at least you know the worst case has fifty fifty were Pence's tie breaker um but the question is does that energy you know last that the next\nThree weeks so if there's something like you know crisis over the care of and maybe that helps the problem in the house is just the these um districts that Clinton won that are occupied\nBy Republicans are really endangered the ones where they're Republican incumbent has retired at eight of them are basically gone even Republicans admit they're they're gone and that gets you you know eight eight seats towards just twenty three they need that that's holding the house will be the Republican somehow managed that it'll be a near miracle and I'll do it you know by Syria to\nWrite a weird Eric Trump on Fox and print this morning and he said look if the Democrats when they're going to be a lot of investigations into you know\nThe Trump Administration the Trump family everybody he said uh but then again when you look at what the Republicans have been able to achieve with a Republican president\nTheir record is spotty you know the president really wanted to build the wall ... you know they're barely building the fence or you want to get rid of Obamacare So it's not like a Republican led Congress is helping him\n[noise] yeah so they did a tax cut which is which which is a big deal step but otherwise most\nOf the important things have happened through executive action than through\nRegulatory actions so that the downside of Democrats taking the houses on you you you know what the other party to take power period but um as Eric I'm pointed out they'll you know Pete spend all their times of painting the president made no stretching and investigating and try to make everyone's life miserable\nHey how's it going it's going okay what do you what do you make of one of the other things we were talking with a rich Lowry about a little while ago\nIs uh what's going on in Saudi Arabia and it looks as if\nThey could be covering up the fact that uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia ordered that his hit men decapitated and take the fingers off of and then just kill a this Washington Post correspondent a rather a columnist in Turkey\nWhere do you what do you think about what is going on with that dynamic because so many people here in the United states Keith are asking the president in the United states get tough and do something about Saudi Arabia\nWell and what happens unfortunate if it happened we need to get to the facts of course however I think a plane sanctions and the social situation would be rather inconsistent\nI mean if we're going to do it the one we should do it all I mean just this past August we had Iran order seven journalist to be jailed and flaws in the wake of their coverage\nJust in February detain relatives of three United States and journalists and do you ask a green card holder for their coverage or Serena Shemp she was an American journalist who in twenty fourteen was killed by the Turkish government the drug and regime after the two days after the accuser and being a spy um\nAfter the two days after they accuse her of being a spy on I mean in fact turkey under their German regime they've been one of the worst offenders when it comes to journalism direction now are we supposed to really expect an honest investigation from like the turkey if so that would be a kinda giving credibility to Russia's investigation into the poisoning of Sergei scrape\nOff what do you make an interesting point do you know the president's in a pickle it's it's um damned if you do damned if you don't we're going to have to see what he does keep thank you very much for joining us here on the brand kill me Joe\nFerrari a meanwhile over on the news maker line we've got congressman Rodney Davis he serves probably the thirteenth district of the great state of Illinois Republican and he's on the house committee on agriculture and the chair of the subcommittee on biotechnology congressmen or thanks for joining us here on the brand kill me Joe\nHey Steve thanks for having me are\nIt's a real pleasure hey listen ah I hear that the vice president was out at a rally for you or what I'm about a week ago right\nYou know he was he came out to Springfield, Illinois to plant of Lincoln it just had a great shot rally the troops and really I mean you can't made a nicer guided vice president pets caged wants to help every Republican get elected but we got to get everybody the polls and he knows\nHe does know it and that's why he said this about you listen\nThere is a joy version of the people of Illinois are okay\nAnd make no mistake about it it's not just the choice between your congressman and his opponent but also it's a it's a choice between two futures in Congress is\nI mean the truth of the matter is that the Illinois Thirteen may be the district that decides whether or not we ever Republican majority or whether Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the house and the next congressman just knowing my hard here in central Illinois you're going to choose results you're going to choose\nMore prosperity and I know in my heart that people are central Illinois are going to support Rodney Davis whether\nYou've got the vice president seen some very nice things you know congressman so many people think oh Illinois a that's a completely blue state that is not the case there\nAre absolutely not downstate Illinois decorative of many states throughout this nation where Republicans are are winning\nRe air winning seats in areas that that even Democrat or legislators drew to a lot of craft and we've got to get those voters to the polls and it's humbling to hear\nA vice president and say those words you can I was there when he hit it of course but here again a kind of you know tears me up a little bit but also it puts a perspective on the fight reinstate and were fighting them extra Nancy closer than ever gets that speaker ...\nAnd I know that is one of the things you're saying out on the stump what when you talk to people I Know you've shaken a thousands of hands over the last couple of weeks trying to get out the vote\nFor November the six what is the is there one motivating factor for Republicans or independent to lean your way who are Democrats even who who may vote for you on the first Tuesday November ... something that's going to motivate them and issue in the news right now\nWell a lot of it boils down to the local issues issues that affect each member of Congress sure so when I go shake hands and in whatever town that I'm blessed enough to represent I'd meet protracted sat down with a group of senior class students at ... Illinois and the issues that they are most concerned about are usually\nGo to that but when you you look at the national issues that they move on to ...\nAnd a lot of it has to do with fear fear of Democrats\nTaking over and what is what is Congress going to look like\nNancy Pelosi as speaker is Jerry Nadler is chair of the Judiciary Committee because I don't think there's any way with the flood of a left wing dollars coming in by the billions he led by district\nThat they're going to hold off from teaching the president and in ... Supreme Court justice and that is not how we keep the economy moving forward impeachment for only stalled progress that we've seen working with the ...\nCongressmen I wanted to ask you about a there's an ad that is being run by your democratic opponent Betsy ... uh that essentially I Know you feel it crosses the line because it takes shots at your family\nYou know it really does Steve my you know my wife is at night to your cause cancer survivor I sat across the table for the vice president the president while we were trying to reform health care and my number one concern was making sure we add layers of protections for pre existing conditions I've been attacked by my opponent\nFor wanting to take that away from Americans and her allies and an ad that was just recently brought\nIt took pictures up by a wife and my kids and used it and then they get it out of gas hey you could say whatever you want about me I stood up and ran for Congress to keep my kids that's just something that crossed the line and I don't think any candidate for Congress Republican or Democrat deserves what what happened there\nNo kidding you know um that is over the line and that's just one of those things are so many people are disgusted by uh my wife is a cancer survivor\nThings that so many people are disgusted by uh my wife is a cancer survivor as well and\nFor instance on this book to her so many people have come up to her and said I perjure story I just wanted to give you a hug I'm sure you've gotten it from your wife but she's not the public figure and she and I\nI don't know of any Republican congressmen who we're talking about ... as we try to do something about our health care situation to get rid of the uh pre existing conditions a provision say our our insurance companies have\nNo none of us are enough and it's a matter of fact the American health care act has has aligning says that nothing in the actual take away preexisting condition coverage I mean it's in the bill and it's been scored four ... fact checkers and it's just an hour\nAt my own it or allies have doubled down on the sly and it offends people like my wife\nBecause health care isn't just a political talking points us it's just like you and your your wife it's personal\nSteelers absolutely well congressman I Know you're in a uh find out they're good luck to you I'm Out there in the thirteenth district of the great state of Illinois congressman Rodney Davis sir thank you very much for joining us today on the brink ... radio show\nThank you Steve\nRight or listen to it Steve doozy on filling in for Brian today on the other side of this time out we'd love to hear from you folks all across the fruit of playing call Leon and weigh in on this Newt Gingrich said last night to the mid term election will come down to two issues\nThe Caribbean and cabinet off do you agree with that we'd like to hear from your one eight six six four or eight seven six six nine this is Brian kill me radio show getting past the all the rhetoric needs Brian kill me [noise]\nIt's Erich von ... entertaining Tanya independent thinker listen a weekday nine to noon right here on W.

L. Rick thanks for joining us right now you feel the same way about the president using military at the border right\nTotally I'm totally in favor of that as President Trump's number one job is to protect the borders of the United states to protect our country and with regard to the ... incident um\nThe bottom line is to show he was not an American citizen and that a crime that alleged crime did not even take place on American soil so I don't even see what we have any legal standing to get involved with that sure it's an outrage and a terrible thing that's happened\nBut ... not an American citizen and I don't believe in\nA slap in sanctions on a country like Saudi Arabia and hurting the American economy I don't like go into the gas pump and having to pay three or four more dollars per gallon of gasoline you walk into that\nConflict of his own volition it was a stupid thing to do well there's not an American citizen well I don't\nThink he was a count on getting murdered in there but uh it it is a quandary\nFor the administration to figure out what to do Rick thank you very much and let's go to Jerry in Nashville Jerry um you you feel the same way what what what's the deal with the show the right\nExactly I feel the same way you know Russia to the drive by shooting of a reporter over there and we didn't have to put on a bunch of sanctions would stalk Kim Jong il and Charles is older relatives and and you know we didn't have to get involved with that China is actually currently chili\nIs is this a ... of the Democrats in Congress to close the loop holes\nAnd take action I as I said what I was ... director out on how many times the secretary was up on the hill\nAnd we talked about loopholes such as you can only you can only ... families for for twenty days or less and less time time enough to see a judge it get released they never show up a court if they don't drop a court order the judge's order but when they're so ... know deterrent to this illegal activity\nWhy would they stopped doing so this is Congress ultimate failure and and that's why it's so important\nThat you know Republicans maintain control both houses ... if if they don't it's only going to get worse because I think there are a majority Republican support Donald Trump in his immigration policies or walk on the other\nThing Congress needs to address this asylum all black people coming to claim asylum and uh they're coached by the organizations say a few key phrases which gets an approved at the border\nOr once they show up in court if they show up at court eighty percent of the ... cases so what Congress needs to do is raise that asylum ... or so it can't easily meant so much fought\nYeah Tom we're speaking at a time home in a former acting I stricter about this Caribbean ... be a president in Honduras said that there are unnamed political groups that have organized and they say other sectors that want to destabilize the country but we will be decisive and we will not allow it\nHe's suggesting politics are involved to make a Honduras look bad but at the same time people are doing the political calculations here in the United states and they're going\nLet's see there about a thousand miles away they maybe they could be and our southern border around time of the midterms and then we've got that whole separating families thing all over again\nI I knew a ... for years I certainly don't believe in coincidence that's I think I Can't there certainly is a political a sight to look\nAnd I think it's going that far out of ... people are paying attention this isn't Trump's a President Trump's show your this is a Republican Congress scarier\nThis is the Democrats younger so\nBut the Congress scarier this is the Democrats younger so you know bottom line that President Trump\nHe wants to do the right thing he wants to close to the polls you've heard him say it many times of speeches he he's he's a bad Congress to close loopholes you said many times worse immigration laws in the world's log that is true so this I ... I think it's going back for I think the American people pay attention to our border right now is not secure\nAnd I think if you if you listen to those on the hill you know when you apologize uh uh you know it's all about in the family separation at least every type of St family separation\nNo one likes to see families separated I get it\nBut because of what's going on right now if Congress don't make the change of these people do get truck border either we just open the border up a little keep coming back in the hundreds of thousands in the past year full always what we do prosecute those enter the country legally\nAnd separate of just like we separate American families when their parents get arrested sure I mean that in ... and let me tell you that during the family separation only a couple of weeks to get that that the numbers on the border dropped twenty two percent\nSo you know it it does work it shows a consequence of deterrent to illegal activity works and the third thing when you talk about\nIs Congress hasn't funded eyes at the proper levels they needed Fifteen thousand page right now the proposes forty thousand as big of an ice ten thousand less ... which means the people that you do get a recipe book Joe allow won't be released so there's no place to put them you know so Congress has failed on all sides\nWill you know because he is a political issue the Republicans are saying look a\nCome mid terms it's a binary choice either a if you want open borders both for the Democrats if you want a strong security at the southern border to vote for Republicans and I think Democrats Tom realize that because they've been telling their members whenever you do\nLet's not talk about immigration because uh you know we don't have a a really good story on there to counter the Republicans saying do you want a strong border not\nBullets or I I don't think the American public's going to be fooled by this law if they want to abolish ice or not talking about right now\n'cause they know it's gonna hurt but bottom line is polishing the ice you could open borders because you're lucky to get by the border patrol and you get into the states no one's looking for you there is no ice so you know I I think that the curtains been pulled back on them they're open border of Canada\nAnd they can talk about it for their actions speak louder than words or the let me say it's better or not action speaks louder than words it's American people are secure border and American people want you know this is a a A R Sommer teach remains then they got the right parts of the office\nAnd they need to make sure that like parties and I'll just to maintain the president's agenda\n[noise] you know the president does have a lot of discretion when it comes to immigration as we've learned over the last two years\nGoing forward in the last two years of his first term of Donald Trump or Tom Homan what else can the president do to a perhaps tighten up some of those loopholes or get rid of him or or just make this the our southern border a little more secure than it is right now\n[noise] well I think we I think uh\nThe wall to wall is necessary every place\nI've been around a long time I was on the ball to like you said back in eighty four eighty five and six and we used to wrestle thousand aliens a night\nOn the same as you go down at the soccer fields once it put a border barrier up those numbers drastically or decreased they put a barrier in El Paso but wanted to sign that don't want to know central every place to build a barrier that illegal immigration has decreased so that you know\nDespite all the rhetoric out there that wall actually works as strong as photo illegal immigration was formed slow down the golf\nClubs and like I said this morning I don't care who Republican or Democrat every one of them have responsibility to protect just ... protects us citizens there's no downside unless drops and turn this country there's no downside unless it was ...\nAfter truly for low level boat low level low skilled labor than Congress he's a fix laws national toward a worker visa but to keep growing the criminal organizations to smuggle these people in the United states is what we're doing that that's something we don't talk about this isn't just an illegal immigration problem Steve this when when when\nIt was the immigrants are a criminal organization\nTo smuggle them so we're paying two and a very low organization that will smoke John's assaulted Raj they all try to pay a tax when they worked two cartels plaza when when a criminal organization which most people to the plaza cartel owns that area you gotta pay the cartel taxes so this this is not just yeah it was the immigration issue is a national security as\nAnd the other thing is and this is something that we don't pay enough attention to because it's like it's a political thing if you tighten the border you don't\nBut this is about the tens of thousands of men and women in our southern border who put their lives on the line each and every day when they go to do their job and you know if there's a cartel trying to smuggle people across if need be they don't mind killing a border\nIf need be they don't mind killing a border patrol agent\n... matter of fact you know the ah ah last night\nOr the night before last August actually had a ball Joe foundation dinner in Washington DC Stillwater bought them twenty shells and she said she said she said is down ... protect this country or sleeping and I met a lot of families have fallen both choice\nAnd so like I said last life people don't want to build a small close loopholes president than certainly due to the men and women who died of the nation yeah there's there's there's there's a couple\nHundred names on that national law moral history won't we work and if anybody questions do you know check with the flavor of medical ended up ... trips to walk that lawsuit in there so this is about ... this country and and taking care of the choices will get so much as\nThey know works they know that you know southern border they want these people's clothes and one thing I'll add ... ... it's all tied up changing diapers taking care of these families that cartels will will push a large population of families across one sector of the border dropped the ball was tied up with them\nThey're pushing drugs to an area where they were chosen responds to family crisis is that is that is proven intelligence reports the last few years so this is just you know they're going with something\nSo you are so right about that Tom Homan thank you very much we know you're very busy these days a former acting director Thomas Homan on the news Baker line so thank you very much for you\nOr it was a pleasure thanks

Ted Cruz multiple times to appear tonight in is in in his own town hall but he declined yeah probably cause he watched a damn town hall I was at ... think of that\nMaybe he watched the town hall that you threw in which I participated maybe he saw that\nThey thought I don't think I Want to do that I\nMean good grief like they have zero self awareness it's just amazing to me there of self awareness\nWe have a a lot\nIncluding the latest Claire McCaskill you know she is really not happy\nWith that project their tossed expos anywhere and she was she refuses to clarify a which I guess I'm assuming her staffers right when he says she absolutely supports a ban on all ... rifles we've reached out came right no clarification\nSo I guess she does All right let's take another quick thing\nShould flood producers five [noise] well senior treasury employers charge were sending sensitive financial report to a journalist has this was a CIA discharge yesterday leaking confidential information related to special counsel Bob Mueller's probe [noise]\nMadly in may flower Stewart Edwards a senior advisor at the treasury department's financial problems in Portsmouth network charged with disclosing suspicious activity reports on a on a denser vide reporter beginning last year [noise] and they all focused on Manafort look at that\nThese are these people that have been put any is a ... color role and they're the ones who are undermining of the ... the administration the [noise] the deep state do satellite imagery share the shows that Russia is appearing to operate for military installations in a call in and grab in Russia strategic outposts on NATO's doorstep\nRight there between poll a right there are a in a in which we pull in a while in Poland right below Lithuania on the Baltic states\nIt's um it's sandwich actually is right between hole and it's a it's a Russian territory that ... to right there right on the right on this little peninsula right between Poland and the Baltics than it's not really connected with Russia Russia they call it a non played\nA but it's been the focal point of a lot of tension and so now there appears to be satellite imagery of some build up\nAnd ... and so now there appears to be satellite imagery of some build up going on there that the ... I had this is what I'm Talking about you don't let them get a foothold in there [noise]\nSo bloom house the ah ah\nMovie directing the movie company in the past production there behind paranormal activity and get out and things like that uh the company's founder Jason's lung told ... that they are trying to hire women but there aren't a lot of female directors out there and all the social justice warriors got really mad because there aren't [noise]\nMoving on to system so tired of that and oh man which I ... what did we get to the princess crap oh my gosh yes we have that today too so amazing and Italians\nPoles do does some there was this hill about a on a hill piece about John James he's West Point grad combat that and he's running for he's a GOP Senate candidate the hills says in this piece that\nThe Michigan candidate apologized to Tuesday because critics pointed out that their looks like what is what appears to be a swastika and a brief appearance of one of his campaign ad it was ten to a bulletin board in a school hallway [noise]\nThat was featured in the ad so he went to a school and he was he was shooting at that and it happened to be up on a bulletin board in this hallway\nAnd he said well it was a terrible error on our part because we didn't catch it and he goes I'll make sure never happened again I mean for crying out loud it was in a school on a bulletin board they were using it as a less than ...\nPeople killed the hell out and so now you have all of these idiotic media people who are lecturing him I don't think he us combat that is going to need your all lecturing on fighting oppression so maybe just stopped for a little bit [noise]\nOoh we have more on the way we have that coming up we have a also the latest with access and what is that would have Disney Princess but\nWhen it comes to hiring they're our job sites that send you tons of the wrong resumes to sort through that's not smart you know it's also not smart using your relatives to fill in at work while you look for staff\nWhen it comes to life you know what's not smart making the lottery the centerpiece of your retirement plan for instance but you know what is smart going to zip recruiter dot com slash Dana to hire\nThe right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's a powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identify people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates bashed\nTo my knowledge I don't even think he even knows James's crew\nNow there are people in Missouri who do because Missouri back in the day when I Lived there was a the hotbed for activism [noise] uh but I think that was before Holly even came on the scene\nSo the I I think that was just a she lied that was a lie that she said she lied again and she's desperate to spin this as oh no\nThis isn't so much an issue of me lying to voters about how moderate I Am and my staff telling voters that I'm going to I'm totally onboard with impeaching Trump or if the house and Senate\nSomehow change hands to Democrat and we're just going to tell those moderate voters that supported me to get over it I mean it was literally the quote from her Stafford they have to get over it and her staff or say well she supports you ... a a ban on some item attic rifles\nNow McCaskill what's weird when she was talking to that reporter she wasn't seen anything that was already not publicly known everyone knows that she said she supports an assault weapons ban\nBut here's the difference she kinda got caught\nBecause when you're talking about an assault weapons ban you and I both know that a lot of people on the left use that as the term coming all semi automatic rifles but they know that saying all semi automatic rifles will scare the crap out of you so they don't sale a semi automatic rifles they say assault weapons so as to to suggest that they\nActually only support banning just a couple of kinds of semi automatic rifles but that's really it\nBut that's not what it is they're talking about going after I mean if you look and I have them easily pulled out the two thousand and two wells are all the way through two thousand and sixteen FBI uniformed crime report which was the last collection available and they'll have others coming up I think there is one singular twenty Seventeen report that's been published there is nothing for twenty Eighteen yet\nBut the two thousand twelve and twenty sixteen report when\nYou look at the breakdown and these are murder victims these are not people who are a suicide et cetera\nUh the vast majority if you're comparing quote unquote assault weapons with I don't know maybe say automobile accidents are hands feet and says those are two and three times a deadlier than just quote unquote assault weapons\nAnd that's according to the FBI zone statistic which is easily available on line by Google in for FBI uniformed crime reports UCR twenty twelve to twenty sixteen they also have it available in a PDF format\nHe'd like to save and keep it you know just for grants and go goals\nBut the bottom line is that it's it's not even it's it there's so many other things that are way deadlier but that's why they don't want to say that they say assault weapons they don't want to say semi semi automatic rifles because then you when you go after some automatic rifle\nA semi semi automatic rifles because then you when you go after some automatic rifles and you're going to go after some automatic handguns and then you're just going to go after whatever else is left\nAnd that's the goal it's incremental and they want to change the language which is why they made up these terms so when she gets out there and she says that you know before an assault weapons ban okay so semi automatic rifles\nAnd when she won't clarify that well\nWhen what do you what do you what conclusion do you come to win a politician\nWill not publically say no that's not true I don't do that and they're just quite from it and they run and hide from it what conclusion do you usually ... what do you usually think about an issue where a politician act like that movie with some folks have been a little disingenuous sounds like they support it doesn't it yeah yeah I'm trying to make you believe otherwise yeah exactly\nThat's exactly it and so she knows very well is that how silly it was that she's sitting here accusing Josh Hawley it's just silly\nAnd we've asked her on this program numerous times um I've always been incredibly civil but I'm I'm going to disagree with you I'm going to question you she looks at that as an act of incivility which is why at one press conference I asked her a question and she began screaming at me she was yelling at me\nIn front of all of this media shoes yelling at me she falsely accused me of working on her opponent's campaign and all of this stuff I'm like I've never ever worked on a campaign ever I have never worked on a campaign\nEver now I'll support issues never worked on a campaign not since I was in college and it was for a Bill Clinton and I was just a little lowly volunteer don't hold it against me it was this this is a reelection but\nYeah so um that's you know\nIt it was silly for her to say that the the thing is though is the press in Missouri seriously is always been kind of weird but they've got to I think it's it's media malpractice from Missouri pressed and not ask her where ... and ... because isn't that the whole purpose of\nMedia I mean you are supposed to you're you're you're supposed to get information and share it with people right\nI mean she was asked about you know this stuff and it looks like she's really really are trying to hide her\nHer full I'm really trying to hide what her positions are from moderate voters\nNot in Missouri debate I think the Senate betas tonight\nShow mhm\nThat ... that Senate debate is ah from what I understand this evening now she is already demanded that there'll be a special prosecutor brought in to investigate the fraud she says\nOkay so what do you mean fraud\nWhen the hell was fraudulent because if you want to I mean we let's first defined what the fraud was what was the fraud the fraud seems is I mean when I look at it I see the front of you not being up front with your position senator\nI I see you try to have it both ways\n\nAnd a video showing where are you truly stand how is the video showing the truth fraud I I Would love for that to be defined pleased to find that where is that fraud yeah so\nYou know hopefully that I Would love to see that as a question most somebody moderator suck though I don't know who's modernity tonight but I'll find out\nUh the some of them hopefully that won't be as bad as the Texas Senate debate moderators were more to touch on car shield is a great program that you should check out because it's extended vehicle protection for

W saying oh now the woman's gonna kill him and it's going to be a powerful whatever actually\nIt doesn't matter as long as it's a good story this is why I don't understand I don't understand isn't just about the tenth sequel to Halloween and what they're saying is forget about everything else and pretend that there was just the first movie and all these years went by and then there's this movie\nWhich you know in the marvel universe and all that because of the way they do the comic books you can buy into that they had these alternate sort of timelines and so you can buy into the rebooting and these sort of things but uh\nIt seems like they're taking that and trying to apply it to the Mike Myers story\nAnd my role do care about that they enjoy these films I never really gotten into the horror films but you know they're\nFollowing a good one I can tell you that Halloween I'm not a horror film guy myself but I did see Halloween back in the day and it's it it that is in particular it's it's a well made movie a and you just have to cover your eyes every once in\nWhile because a lot of horror fan what you know what the mask now you'd miss the mask\nIn Halloween or whether you have the hockey the hockey mask right or is that friday the thirteenth William Shatner mask with the eyes caught a little bit bigger and painted\n... I didn't know that ... a little bit of trivia for you I did not know that the measures that they don't prepare so you know they're saying to people and no you're right I said that now apparently I was wrong take back there I I take it back get back I took it back get off my back\nGet off my back out my ah I\nSaw another story they're worried you know because you know the ... of crazy people and they've uh you have a lot of fans of this of this franchise and they've told people don't wear the mask to come see the movie because you know we got\nFreaky weird people out there that do freaky ... ruin the movies when you're a true fan it's nice to go to dress up and go to a movie yeah cheering is nice to dress up as a woman [laughter]\nAnd I am for Star Wars just my memory should've avatar and I thought it was\nBut I think now they want to be able to identify everybody on security cameras if it unfortunately becomes necessary\n... there was a documentary I saw about the this group of kids their siblings and they are in the on the lower east side of New York and they pretty much were locked up in their apartment bond over that yeah their parents wouldn't let them out but they watch movies to pass the time and uh one one of 'em did get out on his own ... or the the Myers matter\nPeople yeah they call it a collapse of course they did was they looked like a psycho I assume that he

you'll be staring right at Larry king's making [laughter] look if you got to tell the opposing pitcher this is something you have to look don't let a surprise you don't let it you know what I Would do\nWith all my pictures once I found out I was going to be in the world series you had a couple of days maybe before your first game and certainly the first picture I Would force him to put a Larry

first one this guy is contradicting yesterday you mentioned the on friending business and social media and how\nI think by I think he's disagreeing on he's yeah he's a he's he's disagreeing with your ... who is the language Jerry yes he's disagreeing with you and your philosophy which you made a great point yesterday about that you said that it's not worth it to ... people over differences in Palo no I don't\nKnow if people don't just calling your name's that's one thing but I don't think\nI think we're we have too many people who are silo now you should hear people who disagree with you and you should be able to make your arguments against them and I think the reason that people an friend over politics is because they're afraid that they're not able to actually make a reasoned argument without calling names back\nAnd so and I think it's a good idea to have people around you who disagree with you no matter where you stand on the political ...\nThey may be this guy will persuade you otherwise probably not\nIf I'm going to disagree with you on that science say or to be honest with you a stable either Hillary Clinton\nIs innocent and I believe the balls the Ford lady was telling the truth and anything to Saudi Arabia and guy who just got killed is more important to independent Americans that we lost ... did they don't need to be a friend of mine I based my friend was parking [laughter] but not a factor there on time\nHow are they actually are the dominant or dumb enough to believe that stupid stuff I just thought I'd let you know banks says\nExactly what I've been thinking that are far too many people you see what he said there the bases that on character so a disagreeing with that guy is not just a disagreement\nYou reveal yourself to be of low character well how this usually you hear this from like the Hollywood people on the left\nBut how great it must be to know that your right so firmly and so confidently that when someone disagrees with you you\nDon't hear disagreement you don't hear as if oh I Need to make my argument for this person I've got a good argument when someone disagrees with that guy they reveal their low moral character to him [laughter] so for him I Would say you are right you shouldn't\nYou shouldn't debate anybody because the concept of a debate is that\nOne's right one the other person could be right like nobody goes into the debate thinking they're wrong but the whole reason we have debates is so that people who are undecided could be persuaded by one side or another this guy shouldn't debate anybody he's so one hundred percent correct as a matter of fact\nHe doesn't have opinions he has faxed everything that he believes isn't a belief it's an absolute fact so why would he engaged in any sort of debate with anybody he knows he's right\nHe's so right that he knows the person debating him actually knows he's right so that's not a disagreement\nThat person's up to evil for them to disagree with something that we all know is right how do we know what's right cause that guy believes that\nThis was going to be easy from now on whenever an issue comes up we just get that guy he's infallible why he just told us that he himself he's infallible his thoughts\nHis opinions sorry using that word just to get the idea of clocks knowing of course these are not a ... this guy doesn't have opinions that must be wonderful he doesn't have opinions he just knows\nWhat's correct so I Would say to that guy yeah you need you you are so far above everyone else but there's no need for you ever to come down off your high horse and actually engage in conversation or debate with anyone you belong on that high horse\nPut a step ladder on top of the saddle and sit on that that's how high up you are why would you ever again to actually come down to earth with the rest of us who are still trying to figure things out\nWhen you don't have opinions you just know what's right I salute that guy man I Wish that must be great to walk around knowing your right all the time\nWe shop scribe to his newsletter because then we I mean we get all the fast and then I could just the parrot but he says I and I could just like knock off and go to the beach why do any research this guy and I think you know I Know I think yes go ahead and he\nTalked about the soldiers and thank God the versus the reporter who is just killed\nYeah allegedly yeah um\nHe's saying if you care about that reporter more than the three soldiers than he doesn't want to be your friend and that doesn't really I don't I don't know if it's right that is at the\nAs well also is the reason people care more now is because it's in the news now it doesn't mean overall I think it's more important it just what we're talking about now

guess it's a I don't know why he did that but he has may have died after catching a rare mad cow like disease well that's a weird report may have died as in may have died of this correct he is dead yeah saving it\nDoes then we're not sure yet at the Scripps whirling range may be the cause\nUh I'm guessing that would be the culprit I Would point my finger up a look at this the first law and tells me that uh this is one of my people\nRather and this was a a hunter from Rochester New York oh now you drive people are from\nAnd uh I can tell you that I Lived there are a number of years and have family members have lived there for generations and uh we've never had squirrel brains no and we're we're we're not at the top you may find those difficult to believe but I Do not come out of the elite of western New York were we were the lower middle class so you're thinking of squirrel brains\nWhenever the lower middle class so you're thinking of squirrel brains were all the rage we would have had some but I never had some\nLittle family wasn't ... family friends with raw dry and we were not in the ... around ... never part of the ...\nNo no no not at all not at all we were uh\nWe were we were the little people if everybody should have been eaten squirrel brains would have been my family and uh we never did I I guess the mad cow disease is called mad cow but really if you eat the

how much you want to repeat myself over and over and over again kids don't eat squirrel brains how many times I have to say this before it actually\nGets into there I I look I Know I Know the kids are going to do what they have to learn the lessons the hard way I'm not saying it's not tempted yeah do each girl brains we've all been there while you all those all gone through those stages of eating

them a name and show some hundreds of murdering somebody design credit for all kinds of restaurants to real estate I connected\nTo my site and you can hire enveloping Google Search at any time even from my\nAnd they used to have programs in the department of defense and the kids didn't want to be outside of that so they've actually there's this weird thing going on\nWe're tech employees it ruins the word tech\nThis is a weird thing going on where employees are telling management what the company's gonna do\nBizarre it is it is time for employees and the tech sector to be put in their place\nTo be put in there and you have to understand where this comes from\nA these are these this is a generation of workers that were raised by campus revolutionaries remember that the sociology department is revolutionary not like American Revolution the great thing about the American revolution is we revolted we won and then the revolution ended and we went into governance\nBut most revolutions if you notice during the Soviet Union time Cuba Venezuela it never and China\nIt's an ongoing thing it never ends there's always an enemy there's always somebody who's not good enough for the revolution so you get these kids who are sparked by campus revolutionaries and they were taught it was their duty\nNow this is important they were taught it's their duty to infuse every institution there are a part of with revolutionary\nJustice they were allowed to bully the faculty during their college years and now they feel they can push around management now that they have jobs and the private sector\nAnd it really any Google has backed off you got to give me the Jeff basis I Know a lot of right wing or something like Jeff Bass does because he owns the Washington Post\nAnd he hates Donald Trump but a few days ago even with that being said he didn't say I hate Donald Trump in this forum but everyone knows that he followed the Washington Post he's not a fan of Donald Trump and he said he was asked a question like about this not not just the facial recognition but the fact that they are doing work\nWith the department of defense and Jeff Bass so said I Love this country this is a great country this country needs to be defended and if the top tech companies in America do not cooperate with department of defense America's going to be in trouble\nAnd he also said I Believe that the leadership of companies sometimes have to make the right decisions even when it upsets some of the employees he's the only one speaking like this he's the only adult in the room and I'll tell you what the ... the ah the the the ... at Google the reason they want to Google Google\nWas a helping the department of defense\nWith a dealing with drone footage\nAfter it was received not the flying of the drones themselves but taking in the drone footage and getting the most data out of that footage now\nI'm assuming like the rest of us they wouldn't grant that to me but like all of us we don't like collateral damage we liked the idea that a drones out there and we don't lose a another son or daughter of an American family because they have to be out there\n... of an American family because they have to be out there but we don't like that we hear the stories that ah you know the bomb hit a wedding and a whole bunch of innocent children were killed along with the people we wanted to kill we don't like that right the Google employees I assume don't like that but\nThere are so stupid and they're they're fed with full of this diet from the social science departments are on a on the college campuses bits of the department of census evil and everything they've done is evil well really what Google was helping the department of defense do what's reduce collateral damage\nThe better we understand the information we're receiving from these drones the ... the more surgical our strike can be so the Google employees\nThat they don't it's a different generation does they don't care about reality we signaled our virtue that said where's the next house party\nThey're not interested in the reality if you really care about collateral damage in drone strikes you would encourage Google to get more involved\nSo that we can better understand the data that we're receiving these drones and that we could limit the amount of collateral damage so at least just base owes so he doesn't care about this this is about facial recognition software I'm not speaking to that issue by the way\nI'm not speaking to the I think that there are dangers and facial recognition software\nThat's why it's very important go back to the cabinet hearings why it's very important that we stick to the idea that every one is innocent presumed innocent until proven guilty for reasons like this because this is the future\nAnd there's no facial recognition software that's not going to make mistakes from time to time just too many people and there's too many people who resemble one another that aren't even related\nWe've all had that I've got to stop all gang or here in this building yeah you do I don't know what the guy does every other day I'm told Hey Eric I saw yesterday I Know that wasn't me I don't know if you were talking about and then the last\nConclave care uh I was up there and I saw this guy actually strangely enough put it all together is I think he's the guy who works the drone camera for example you asked\nMe no wonder you have such a positive view on this than on the average ... story [laughter] here's my view it doesn't matter you take tax\nOut of it employee management\nManagement tells employees what to do if you're an employee and you don't like your job or you don't like your company is you don't have your companies do doing you leave to go work for a company that you more agree with or how about this\nHad a little courage like Jeff Bass hosted put your net worth on the line and start your own company 'cause that's what he did and he was called a fool for years and years and years and now he's the richest guy probably in the world I Would imagine now I think he is but he had courage\nAnd he put everything on the line for his vision are you willing to do that\nIf the answer's no can shut up let Jeff Bezos run the company he wants to run you decide if you want to continue being an employee there\nBut this is really coming off the college campuses because this is what you have to understand when you're dealing in terms of revolution the revolution never ends\nSo the social justice that comes with the new reckoning has to hit everything or it's not or it's useless so that's why we're constantly hearing about this the pay gap in the entertainment industry everything\nIt's not a revolution if it doesn't touch everything and these kids were taught to infuse their ideas of social justice into every institution they bump up against two and then into and then right\nThere at the very beginning they were allowed by the so called adults the faculties of these campuses they were allowed to bully these adults into doing things and making changes on campus and so\nThen when they graduate and now they're part of Amazon\nThe revolution continues\nAnd my idea of social justice has to infuse everything therefore the river otherwise the revolution is not successful that's why in Cuba the revolution supposedly continues and Fidel Castro is bad after leaving the country for eight hundred years\nThe American revolution\nWas the awesome revolution because when it was over it was over\n\nMoved to governance what are we going to do now we're going to create our own government how we got to do it we're going to do it this way you didn't get to Eighteen oh five and hear leaders saying the revolution continues the reason the leadership has to tell the people that the revolution continues it's still the leadership doesn't get toppled\nContinues is still the leadership doesn't get toppled go away if just simply overturning but she still wasn't enough think Castro\nWithin president for eight or ten years and moved on\nBut no that's not the narrative and there's no it's not about winning the the the the the palace the presidential palace it's the revolution we won't be done until the revolution has every country in the world you know what that means in your lifetime will never be done\nThat's the point in your lifetime will never be done now when you when you put this into America\nIt's watered down of course\nBecause we have a lot of reasonable people who will push back but that's what's going on here\nThese are kids who were taught by revolutionaries that the revolution has to touch every institution so you start here on campus and then when you go into the real world and you work for Amazon now you infuse Amazon with your ... your idiotic social justice thank God\nOut of all of these people there's a Jeff Bezos\nWho says I don't like this president but I Love this country and this country is worth defending and as the top tech company we're going to work with the department of defense we're going to work with police around the country\nThat's the spirit of America I'll tell you that that's the spirit of America recognizing that you're not always going to agree with the people in power\nBut you agree with the idea of America so\nA lot of protesters I feel like aren't taking into consideration any sort of reasoning behind what they oppose\nNo because I've been told that it's just evil they all they're all everyone is Hitler yeah everybody's Hitler
