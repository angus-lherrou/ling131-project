coming out later [noise] what do you do when you're on the go how do you stay connected how do you get Internet\nWell there are new solutions that are making that so much easier also yeah\nTalk right now about something that is a terrible problem for our country and that is that housing affordability has become out of touch that for people who are trying to buy a first home people trying to move up\nThat we have a brutal circumstance with affordability new homes\nCost per square foot for ... for new homes is just out of sight\nAnd I've talked in the past about the problem we have in the United states that we have not adopted new methods of construction\nLike other countries have done particularly other developed countries and we are still pretty much building homes today in the United states like homes were built fifty sixty years ago\nAnd that's crazy you think about every other facet of our lives that technology and new methods of production have changed so much made them so much more efficient housing not so much will now\nJeff Bezos has decided that's another area Amazon's gonna potentially disrupt and Amazon is putting money in plant prefab\nWhich I talked about

zero afforded with a piece of trash bake these are fake MasterCard which is a visa and MasterCard debit card that attacks your checking account or the credit union your equivalent to share draft account the problem is is that federal law\nDoes not give you the same protections so it was an example of one place you never want to use a debit card is buying anything on line or anything you're going to get later\nBecause if they don't deliver it\nYour bank or in your case your credit Hughes says that's just too bad Pete because you know that was like a check you wrote and it doesn't matter they didn't deliver your out your money where the credit card you're protected for failure to deliver goods or services\nIn the event that somebody compromises your number or your card\nWith a credit card generally your liability is zero but in any circumstance is max that fifty dollars with a debit card your liability under federal law is generally five hundred dollars minimum up to a maximum of every penny that's in your account\nNow a number of visa and MasterCard issuers have said they are are following an administrative rule where your liability is kept at either zero or fifty dollars for a debit card but they don't have to do that\nOver the wall is not there to protect you you're depending on the kindness of the financial institution to do that\nAnd then the other thing is if somebody steals your account number you're in possession your card even they steal your card whatever with a credit card no money leaves your hands\nYou know it's just a charges posted you tell them that's not your charge and that's it after you do that paperwork but with with a debit card the money disappears from your checking account and then you have to fight with your credit union or your bank to get the money back other than that they're great\nWhich I didn't leave anything else for them to be great [laughter] you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nNews Ninety five five and a um seven fifty

no Internet connection at all now you'll have a\nCarl is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Carl\nHello how are you good how are you doing\nGood thank you or your wife is retiring\nYes a sure repairing Raul large retailer and uh she's gotten the option of taking a lump sum or monthly distribution for her pension\nMy goodness she's retiring from a retailer and she has a pension\nYeah believe it or not allow last ones left\nWow you know there's almost no such thing as a as a retailer with a penchant for their workers\nYeah she'd been there for thirty four years now wow\nHow can I be of service because that's a shocking thing\nWe were just wondering what [noise] what America you know lump sum or taking a a month or distribution [noise]\nSo if we just look at the dollars and cents or without looking at her individual plan almost always and it's not a hundred percent of time but it's close it's better to\nTake the monthly payment from them than it is to take the lump sum but you since you told me it's a retailer you kind of not me back on my feet because that creates a different concern how solid financially is this retail\nThat we don't we don't know\nYou have real ends to doubt how viable they might be oh yeah if you do that would mean that even though the odds are overwhelming there would be better for your wife to take a monthly check in this case\nIn this case she probably be better served taking the lump sum\nWhat about tax of other lumps from would that be a tax at our current rate or whatever the uh extracted a lump sum be\nYes that was when you get a lump sum distribution you get clobbered on tax in\nThe year you receive it yeah\nThat's the only reason I Do want to take as 'cause that was for the for the very top tax bracket\nSo here's the thing if you take the monthly check and she was there a long long time there is a ... federal agency called the pension benefit guarantee corporation so if at some point the company she worked for fails to the cease to exist fails and they're done\nThe pension liability is turned over to this agency the pension benefit guarantee corporation and they have a formula based on how large a pinch and your wife would be receiving what kind of haircut she'd get how much of her pension\nShe would actually have reduced that\nShe would receive from them forward from this ... federal agency so residents scary right so the risk to her\nIs this is you know if this was a company that was doing great and reporting huge profits and their future looked bright far out into the future then you take the monthly check\nIs almost always the monthly check in ... uh higher return then you're going to be able to generate on your own on this pension distribution but the lump sum\nYou know she gets the money\nSo I always tell people take the monthly check unless you're worried about the company's finances\nDon't know which way to go\nI think it's a matter of what let's look at it this way if\nShe takes the monthly check and let's say three four or five years from now they fail\nWith it or would it just demolish your quality of life and your ability to afford things or would it be more like a well we're not going to have that money every month but will still be okay\nHey we're here oh well\nIf it's an old well and you're going to be fine either way take the monthly check if it's money that's do or die for you as a couple I Would take the level of some\n... well that's good to know\nSo and I would I Would say with her as well because she worked there for so long psychologically it may bother her a lot if you know the pension stops are is a new wouldn't be stopped but it'd be greatly reduced in the event of a failure\nGreat does that help okay here's here's with us\nToday 'cause you know I'm fortunate enough to have a pension benefit that I have to choose at some point lump sum or receive as a lifetime benefit and these are tough decisions how to choose\nSheryl is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Cheryl\nHi how are you great thank you yeah like\nI said as I heard an advertisement I'm On the radio about real estate company that um next after they're wearing tank can be a fair market type on your home I got a thick thick enough or getting any repairs [noise] and they either will tell you how to fix or less guaranteed are down by it or that market price that they offered to [noise]\nAnd I think to get to the train of thought that I checked with him\nSo this is happening around the country residential real estate is a very high interest item right now so there are local real estate offices\nLocal individual uh but high volume sellers and national offers where they say we not only will mark at your house but if it does not sell we guarantee that will be the purchaser\nMhm and as for what the purchase period is most often what I've seen is you said six weeks for the one you saw\nI think most of\nThem I've seen or twelve weeks\n'cause normally for someone to effectively market your home they need typically a three month window but anyway if you found somebody who says six weeks fine\nSo these come in two types one is selling distressed real estate let's say you're having to sell the house\nOf a loved one who died near the administrator executor exact a trip that's one kind\nI'd near the administrator executor executive ... that's one kind or the other is where you're selling your own home\nYou know you're having to relocate would somewhere else or you've already done if I had the home you want to move to you need certainty getting your house so [laughter] so in that environment is not a distress sale it's not a house that's falling apart or anything like that\nAnd you're just looking for certainty that the sale will go through and you're not going to get stuck with two house payments so with these things the\nKey test is they offer they make as to what their fallback price would be ... is it one you can live with\nYeah actually the price that they offered to her and we had it appraised ... and it pretty hot on I was actually surprised I thought it was the lander\nThen I think that's fine if it gets you the peace of mind that you're working for them and\nThey you know that six weeks out if it's not sold in the open market you're out of that house why not\nThey are saying that they charge you X percent there have been like a fair price\nSo they would do now do you pay six percent commission if they find a buyer you discount the price six percent if they're the buyer okay is that right\nIt can guarantee you had six percent that included the buyer and seller if they buy it outright I don't know I just kept that are not\nWell normally they would they would have some discount that would be the equivalent of a commission from the price they are offering you and I have no problem with that\nAt ... okay so you got to be the right person do you got to be the person you need to be done with it and you know that you'll be out of the house at that point if they see the price they offer use reasonable\nWhy not have that certainty okay\nFound it and I and I hope I don't hear back from you at some point hey it six weeks come and gone and made it an honor the deal I Hope he does not so I Will tell you that that's never happened before oh\nAnd wasted lives untreated mental illness and the U.S results in an

your point oh I Can't wait to hear more other and orange dreamy do Bre\n\nThan at Dana radio dot com one girl\nSo we're watching this developing story of all of these these ah these suspicious packages that were sent to a Debbie Wasserman\nSchultz a Governor Cuomo\nA as well as ah the Clintons and ah the Obamas and Eric Holder\nAnd they we know that the ones that were sent to the Obamas uh I think it was both\nObamas holder and then and then there were sent to CNN too but at least four of them they've confirmed that they are a\nRelated as and it's the same ah it's the same in individual apparently behind it they had a Debbie Wasserman Schultz has the return address which is weird or the ones that Clinton source were not confirmed which is why didn't include those in there\nThere's a reason why I said they're specifically only for that they've confirmed because only four of them had Debbie Wasserman Schultz the ones that Clinton and Obama ... those were completely separate so there's a reason why I said at the way I did\n[noise] um the other thing that struck me as odd and I've been seeing some discussion about that so there was a a photo of the one that was sent to Brennan and it had stamps a all over the package et cetera obviously but there wasn't postage marking on the stamps\nAnd then when you when you send a package and you you have stamps on it you get postage marks on the champs right this didn't have them just didn't have any stance on the package at all so\n... what\nI mean think about this as well um and someone else or a bunch of people that are make that a ... a couple of other people made this point to\nThe a pipe bomb I mean that and that can mean a number of things by the way the incendiary explosive device a but this particular device uses steel piping and when you're shipping a package\nYou are you are being charged by the weight of it and so some individuals\nApparently some people who even working or have worked in a post office before they were saying well the six chimps wouldn't have covered\nThat and everyone speculating you know just how heavy it would have been but they all were in agreement that well the six stamps wouldn't have covered that it even if it went through but there were no posted posted markings on it at all whatsoever\nSo what ... what\nAm wondering and what other people are questioning because the store is one was hand delivered to that facility this seems like this was also hand delivered to\nThis seems like this was also hand delivered to now that makes me wonder was\nWhere the Clinton ones was that hand delivered was\nI mean there were these I mean these were these all hand delivered\nI mean I think that that's kind of um I think that's kind of a fair point\nTo ask and also if they were is there any which I'm sure they're looking at\nI mean if there's any sort of security footage et cetera et cetera where you could uh um where you can\nSee the uh\nYou could see you know just exactly who it was that that did it I don't know it's just that because that strikes me as weird I mean I'm looking at this photo of this that strikes me as incredibly weird um do we have time I know it's our quick segment where time to\nKick into some quick five okay yeah let's go ahead let's go\nDo this quick five okay so this is the latest that is that happening right now aside from the developing story that we are watching at Michigan City has banned clowns on Halloween Oak Park city officials said clans are too scary\nSo if you're going to go to their party the blue bashing the Detroit suburb of Oak Park you can you can be anything you want you just can't be a clown clowns are banned in Oak Park\nIs seven child has died this is a horrible story I saw this yesterday in seven

live when it happens but and I'm looking here I see another I see another\nUh a picture of it of the device um\nI mean it's a pipe bomb I mean that's that I mean that's steel that's yeah the the the\nIndividual that I was referring to her message me and said they still work with the post office and said if you're going to mail ... if you know not pipe off you're going to mail a heavy piece of metal like that\nThan it would be you would you'd have to put it in a box\nThey're not going to dislike stuff in one of those little bubbly envelopes and and mail and and that's just not going to happen but I still say this is I Do think\nAh I Do think that this is absolutely I mean it's some\nSort of um it is domestic terrorism I don't know how she put it it's domestic terrorism\nSo very and I mean and it is a\nGoodness so we're going to continue watching this this uh this this story as it unfolds 'cause we're still getting developments them and\nI don't want to engage in the speculation that bill de Blasio Andrew Cuomo engaged in um earlier when they were giving press their press conference I'm I'm I'm not going to engage in that kind of speculation that's ridiculous\nWe're not doing that um but this I'm telling you it is a it is ... ...\nYeah ... I mean ... I mean six stance for the weight of a steel pipes six stamps for the weight of steel pipe\nI just don't I don't see that I don't know\nI I someone also so Bryan on social media was also saint hard to determine the explosive weight but it couldn't have\nBeen much so I this yeah I Am just really you've had since you have rice and that was sent well suspected rice into Trump to\nJames Mattis to Christopher Wray Gina Haspel\nHeather Wilson to John Richardson earlier this month\nUm and then just when if they determine uh who sent this\nThen\nI mean this is just getting out of hand this is just getting out of hand I mean this is you know just come on just come on\nAnd it but but and that was that was those were actual that was the actual domestic terrorism too I think this is also domestic terrorism\nSo\nSo we will uh\nWe're gonna we'll continue seeing ... we'll continue following these developments as we get them there was um apparently so now apparently a suspicious package was intercepted by Capitol Hill police and it was addressed to Maxine Waters according to\nSeveral sources this as per a B. C.\nSo this is\nA\nThis so they sent to mask the right and I don't know if this is the same it we don't know anything about it at All right now at this particular point except that that was just it was intercepted in a it was sent a Capitol Hill police got it\nAnd and we'll see I'm sure we'll get more information more development as to whether or not it was like what we have seen with the Brennan package and with that pipe bomb et cetera\nBut I'm just I mean it is just completely getting out of hand at this point um and\nThere are a lot of theories going around there's a lot of stuff going on I like to wait as we get more information\nI like to wait and see and the reason I say this is I go back to when you know they had the the election um Israel's last election what was it there it was a there was a report that there was um\nA bunch of bomb threats to all of these Jewish centers and everyone was thinking oh it's this political it's this this this and it turned out to be just just just knocked job teenager and Israel\nAnd then back in twenty fourteen I'm a scorn spouse trying to find her husband ended up sending rice and letters to the New York city mayor and the White House back in twenty fourteen twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen so that's why I say you kind of you all it's always smart to wait\nAnd then when you find out and then when when when we find out who and the motive then by all means\nBut\nYeah this was that the novel if there was no sorting coat on the novel up there is no postage marks on the federal whatsoever this was never handled by by the United States Postal service the fact that was not handled by the United States Postal service at all\nThis was hand delivered this point this ... this package was hand delivered so if it was hand delivered that means there's going to be closed circuit footage\nBut here's the other thing I think about this now it is possible because you have what you have the\nAh\n... Clint ... I'm trying to get Clinton Obama's or in DC you have the I the Capitol Hill ones I Would imagine are those I'm sure we'll we'll figure out if those were\nUm hand delivered are mailed but since all of these are hitting about the exact same time these all could not have been hand delivered correct or could they have\nAnd it was oh wouldn't that suggests there was more than one person involved it's hard to believe because the hub were former presidents in the White House give their mail is where\nWe were discovered so unless your hand delivering to that special emphasis and yeah the CNNs and New York wasn't right and the lines in it and I don't know where the Clinton sorting facility was that's why you're reporting yeah Frenchman with those of you know yeah that's exactly where it's a so with some of\nIt on now Laughlin mark hey over at the Daily Beast says he thinks that there's an of he says it looks like there's an ISIS flag on a pipe bomb that was sent to Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSays\nSo always ... I I I don't even want to trust before I verified but I Do think that it is\nA\n... that would be very and I don't again I think it's even too early to determine that\n\nSo there's just a lot a lot here and then that and then that brings up a whole other\nYou know are we going to have our mail system used for terror but this is absolutely domestic terrorism there's so\nMuch a\nThere's a lot happening right now and uh and and and a lot a lot of developments coming in on this and but I Am fat because that wasn't the only person who said this\nThis isn't the only person who said does this look like an ISIS flag Muslim or cave not\nI've ... I've know log on for ten years he's pretty much a moderate so yeah that's very interesting a lot of people are going to be looking at footage I Want to take a quick break and I'm going to round up just some of the developments 'cause there's a couple more um\nThat I Want to make sure that we have and when we go to break here I'm going to take that time to do that uh and then also we have other headlines to get into as well\nAnd also we have other headlines to get into as well\nUm they are because this is all of these happen around the same time and if it's a lot of these were hand delivered that had to be more than one person I just don't and I I'm not ... I'm just saying I don't know how it's physically possible for it to not\nBe so well we'll get into I we I Know we've got a lot to a lot to ah get into so\nUh we have a more stuff to come\nOr in the meantime as we get moving on I tell you one of the the best things to do to exercise your Second Amendment right to make sure that your training and that you are\nThat you know you're you're you have a particular skill set to defend your life and out of your loved ones so that heaven forbid if you need those skills\nYou can rely on them as opposed to not having them and need in them and that's one of the things that Cal Tech support Cal Tech is a very family oriented to a small business I mean they they started I mean George Pell grants started this company I mean this is the tail of the\nOther as an American immigrants success story who created a very awesome business and that employs a lot of people a lot of veterans\nAnd they I I did the employees they're genuinely love their jobs\nAnd George is he's the driving force behind every innovative fire on this manufactured by this company or whether it is you know their pistols whether it's the rifles whether it's you know the already the bullet downright or\nThe pay three eighty which is the ... one of the most copied handguns out there a small a small carry a gun I Love I think everybody should have this particular ...\nAh ... does it right quality a safety innovation and affordability check them out at Cal Tech weapons dot com K.

then you can start saying I'm gonna take that extra money and put it into long term things but one thing I'd recommend is make sure you have some fun to pick an amount that fits for that long term but

there's really have to be the week that the New York times has five novelist imagining Trump's next chapter\nAnd one of the novels actually goes into oh let's see murder and the other one goes into a fake Russia again\nYou know the Russian waited until they were a few steps passed and he drew the gun each flight it on the center of the president's back and squeeze the trigger\nBut it missed fired the secret service agent at the president's shoulder heard the quakes button into a crowd she registered the scene instantly drawing his own weapon with razor edge reflexes\nThe Russian taster taser failure closed his eyes waited to pay the cost the opened his eyes the secret service agents it beforehand presenting his glock\nBut first hear the agent said politely use mine\nReally that's what they want to and these ... that's the New York times what they're putting out there\nA Andrew Cuomo was forced to retract the claim that he was targeted by a pipe bomb that didn't happen but it doesn't surprise me that you got multiple reports you know of course we had fake news you know some of these people do need lawsuits\nAnd there is there is a line that is being crossed here that deserves a real court challenge as it relates to slander\nAs it relates to smearing people's characters you know but you have the NBC reporter suggesting the perfect person responsible for the mail bomb scare a you know you know when Robert Gibbs probably read the conservative news website the Drudge Report\nIt's outrageous that's on fake news MSNBC again a segment with this guy highlighting the image of the device sent to John Brennan nobody wants this to happen\nI didn't like it when I've had rats really serious ones in in my life and career to my family or powder scent to where I work and it said that it's one\nAnything of any substance comes out the only thing they have said as the bombs had a powder meaning some type of explosive powder and broken glass or which would mean the maximum amount of damage and shrapnel that ... that should they have gone off none of them\nAnd my mom a damaging trap know that ... that should they have gone off none of them have gone off usually in the mail bomb like that you would think if somebody opens it that's when they're going to realize that that's the moment usually would detonate a thank God none of that has happened thank God\nI'm all packages or were listed apparently Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the return address thankfully none exploded no one was injured\nAnd this full scale federal local investigation is to hunt down wherever those maniac is that would be responsible for such things you know it is um I don't care who it is\nYou know there is no place in the society for this type of violence these types of threats this intimidation it should have no place in politics or country you know this is evil ... we're talking about and I wanted to act of terrorism here\nIt's ah having lived through some of this myself I Know how horrible it is my thoughts and prayers to go out to anybody that is involved in this it's just wrong I Want these guys put in jail for as long as possible\nAnd it shouldn't they should not have to be said no conservative I Know what ever\nSupport this horrible act or this type of violence but the property as the president condemned it yesterday\nUm nobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do\nWhen they can politicize something you know is this has now been unfolding you watch people assigning blame or to all political rivals especially President Trump and they go to Fox News and talk radio and it goes on from there\nMeanwhile we've heard the play some of it in the last hour play some of it later in the program today that most incendiary over the top out of control statements that have now been going on for weeks and weeks\nThese mobs literally showing up getting in the faces taking their marching orders of Spartacus and people like Maxine Waters that create a crowd and follow them into department stores gas stations grocery stores you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore wow\nHey is that is that how it is what they said to Mitch McConnell and his wife this weekend\nI'm you know you you look at the ... the rush to politicize this and the silence has been deafening\nThe last number of weeks as all of this has been ... you know unfolding before our eyes Sarah Sanders entered family Pam Bondi and secretary Nielsen Ted Cruz Ted Cruz and his wife and of course Mitch McConnell and his wife the guy got violent in the restaurant over the weekend\nAnd everything to lawmakers punched in Minnesota\nAnd you have a Boulder thrown through Kevin McCarthy store as a matter of fact Republican or Democrat does it's it's got to stop and we saw what happened and the Kavanaugh hearings what was Rand Paul saying well as I say I say we better just get the general public out of the halls of Congress because it's not safe anymore\nAs in those cases left wing activists you know getting in people's faces spinning it Lindsey Graham in a rush to pin blame on the mail bomb some extreme is you\nKnow well it's not just fringe Web sites and communities on Facebook but you know Soros Obama the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio on Fox News for over a decade well if this idiot fend Collins at NBC News that ever bothered listening to my show\nWhen the White House and I have multiple examples of what I said it remember that guy walked into the White House through the front door one day nearly went up to the residence\nBrock Obama's president has said this is insanity we've got to protect our president we've got to protect our politicians who says in political that's an attack an assault on the United states well but the president says fake news but they are fake news most of them\nEvery second every minute every hour every day there's Trump paid that is all over television\nYou know this is an ... an abject idiot and by the way they're not alone little insinuations by fake news CNN fake news conspiracy TV MS and ABC NBC CBS the same thing\nWe've been calling for calm we've been condemning the mob set of been confronting politicians doesn't matter if they're left or right\nWhere the ones when a Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assassinate Republican lawmakers on that baseball field nearly killing somebody that has a friend of mine house majority whip Steve ... nice I said I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders for this he had nothing to do with that\nAnd that's that's but that's the type of logic I even said boy was the other way around they say the same they've they blame us immediately because they want to put politics Trump's all in their world\nIn a political disagreements et cetera you know they shouldn't be marching orders to follow politicians and cabinet members and create crowds and confront them and tell them to not want it any more in a anywhere anymore\nYou know but if you call out the deep state the call out the less hypocrisy you call out their calls for violence the fake news media reporting fake news if you do that that's not inciting violence that's just telling the truth and the same goes for people the media\nSo it's just telling the truth and the same goes for people the media you know those those you know Trump supporters of Democrats bashing they passed me every other day is weeks that I'm old I'm plastered all over these channels as as wallpaper for crying out loud as they try to use me to get their ratings up\nOut listen I look for all the rhetoric but rhetoric is rhetoric you know what at the end of the day individuals are responsible for their own behavior\nAlthough it does sound like the orders have been sent out to get in people's faces and confront them and tell them about what it anywhere anymore that sense that was that you know nobody talked about Susan Rice the target of\nA a package of what they purportedly believed to be rice and that was sent her her home or three weeks ago President Trump General Mattis FBI Director re CIA director Gina Haspel they all got suspicious packages that they were told was racing\nOr done juniors family or going back a few years when it happened to me\nI Know from first hand experience it's a horrible thing to go through it sadly is threats to me and my family of happened many times over the years\nMore than I Would ever tell you\nI've been saying for months the rhetoric needs to come down someone's gonna get hurt or worse\nYou know Kevin McCarthy we got to Boulder thrown through his office what if somebody was in there\nAnd we've been condemning the the unacceptable behavior day after day night after night Democrats have been nowhere to be found they've been silent and they have threats to want to punch the president fight the president beat up the president blow up the White House et cetera you know separate heads of the president\nHappens and can make a so called comedy shows it happened to the so called news channels it happens in the mainstream media happens everywhere really the New York times perfect tighten up five novelist imagining Trump's next chapter you know one including murder\nGood grief that's ... that's that's maybe a little inappropriate for president if think\nKnow it's and then to watch the calls for civilian it just brings hello to me and I'm not blaming these people they you know they can do what they want this what the Democrats do every two and four years\nWe have some interesting developments in the state of New Jersey\nWe might have a race and then there's there's only up by three points people in New Jersey of figured out who Menendez is just like in Minnesota people have figured out who Keith Ellison is he's down seven\nIt looks like you know we're now finding out of the people have figured out who reticent is down in Tennessee and who McCaskill is in Missouri and who's Christine similar sentiment is in a you know for sure I don't have a problem of Americans during the Taliban why would she get one vote in Arizona after being that crazy\nBut we have a race there in the ... race now with the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morsi's up by two over Joe Manchin a lot of people weren't expecting up when you think about it is logical\nAll the success of the west Virginia economy and saving coal jobs and energy jobs and all the prosperity is because of Trump's policies and mentioned didn't even support the tax cuts and frankly my guess is the capital but it was just an election year conversion they'll go right back to supporting Chuck Schumer\nAnd Missouri you've got the Daily Caller reporting that Josh Hawley who's running against Claire McCaskill sharing a photo of a yard sign that have been vandalized with a swastika and his name on the sun is this was really come down to we asked you now the Missouri attorney general\nClaire McCaskill also caught on tape saying I'm just like Obama I'm just I'm just saying these things to get elected um she doesn't care about raining in or or representing the people of Missouri\nYou know you've got another Daily Caller report talks about non exploding bombs turned up yesterday and today the New York times has no reason to seemingly to apologize for the Trump assassination fantasy that they published the day before the pipe bomb was discovered the first one\nTimes published a story short story about assassinating president Donald Trump on Tuesday one day before potential explosive devices showed up at the addresses of all these political figures New York times are asking novelist to conjure up possible outcomes to Robert Mueller's investigation\nThey don't care only care about Russia collusion as long as it's a Republican and only care about sexual misconduct or assault if it's a Republican they ignore Ellison Spartacus Clinton they only care about incendiary language\nWhen they think it comes from a conservative not their own\nBy the way Charles Grassley is issued a criminal referrals for Avon body and Julie sweating neck member she was

package well there's been several open and none of them have detonated which tells me\nThere is some sort of problem so I'm hoping they're not real um and I hope that the the authorities find them sooner than later I think\nThe ... the way I got searched go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talked about this yesterday that none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on somebody\nAbsolutely absolutely by said yesterday you'll have you know probably twenty four to Seventy two hours a day in and I stand by that ... much of an enormous amount of evidence that they've been able to capture because these things to knock that day and I think we'll see something so\nAll right Dr Gordon we give you the last word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we a release of how we throw the book of them but it doesn't matter what side you're on\nThe the responsibility for the ... of violence as father on the left when you have an a former attorney general who worked for President Obama say when they're down you kick them\nWhen you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil off do we win the election nobody on the rise says that it's a less responsibility for the normalization of five and\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Petra Marci ... congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell ... thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is it voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and matches or dishonest Washington\nTrump advanced the Trump jobs agenda and my actions are dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people drilled down on maps and record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good now we're going to win an election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nKnow I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy of the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened and Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened to the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration a show on we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today a I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWell he votes with them when it count so you know I don't like the ... a naming of post offices a procedural vote\nI don't know how well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have viewed as vote healthcare being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state Sean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and matching said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think the west Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\nJoe mansion how to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters Manson says no and even on Capitol\nWhere people say oh we ended up voting for cap and all the reality is he waited he actually left the Senate a voting chamber and waited until Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that he was politically death\nIs toe so I you know I kind of used a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you have open the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people who West Virginia and we certainly on important issues like tax cuts\nRegulation energy those are three main fundamental issues that that affected impact the economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places have struggled with a white opioid issues and\nWe do with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nWell that's one of the big issues in this race that Joanne since first vote will be for Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is made no bones about the fact that he's going to head out\nThe obstruction resistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're powering these liberals the hopes that really created all the rock distorting the capital hearings then you're part of the problem so that's why people were so focused on\n... first vote because they know he's not going to be with West Virginia\nAnd he's going to be part of a team that's tearing down the president West Virginia's don't want that and that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia to try and keep it or how much is Schumer and company in ... in company or are they investing in these negative ads about you\nWell they've put a fortune and I'd say by a what by all accounts they are going to probably be up over twenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more we're going to look at the final ...\nAnd that's what happens on you mentioned earlier you know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now the president came back twice he's actually our side we think it's going to come back again and we start to come back twelve to ten eight six to or to to you know to even\nAnd that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen lives are voting began in West Virginia as it started out\nEarly yeah early voting started yesterday and so we're starting to look\nStarted out early yeah really finding started yesterday\nAnd so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have a lot of energy\nAnd people know that the future of the Senate to really be at stake what this election and if there's a clear choice so we're feeling good about it we're not hockey but we're going to work Joe mansion and people are gonna know on the conservative fighter will help the president ... he's a dishonest Washington liberal and he's never there when you need them\nAll right well you're watching this race now put this in the ... column a where we once thought it was a leading Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda or is this Joe Manchin sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a deadline and race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help\nA future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish all the best Patrick Morrisey\nHey Shaun thanks so much that anyone interested in learning about ... you know we're Patrick Morsi dot com or take a look

B. depends on it\nIt is you're you're you're Ninety five five AM's seven fifty W as being [noise]\nCouple of things are I talked to some folks who are on the campaign\nTrail and they're pointing out a pattern and is so\nI don't mean this to be disrespectful I really don't but I had been in this game for a long time now I mean I got into politics in Nineteen Ninety four when I was a college student I I work with reporters I sent out press releases I helped shape stories I got into law school I became an elections attorney I became\nA campaign strategist I managed campaigns I consulted on campaigns I designed campaigns\nI worked at red state of the resurgence CNN and Fox reporters are lazy by and large there's some really good reporters out there but a lot of reporters are lazy and most reporters even the good ones don't understand election law they just don't\nAnd there are so much bad reporting out there about the election absentee ballot in voter ah voters been removed from the voter rolls pinning voters all that you can tell that these stories are beans\nPinning voters all of that you can tell that these stories are being spoon fed to sympathetic reporters who probably have a liberal bias both locally and nationally because look at the pattern that we're seeing right now\nThe first story was that Brian Kemp put fifty three thousand people on pending voter rolls and most of them were black voters it turns out Seventy five percent of those voters didn't put down an accurate Social Security number\nAnd twenty three percent of those voters had been there since on the pending voter file since two thousand third tier two thousand fourteen and they came from Stacey Abrams group a New Georgia project which messed up the Social Security numbers\nThe second story is that Brian Kim removed three hundred thousand voters from the rolls never mind that this happens in every odd numbered year\nNever mind that these are voters who hadn't voted in seven years never mind that the secretary of state had tried to find these voters couldn't find those voters and still have to wait for years to remove them from the rolls\nIt's just a drip drip drip drip process of trying to build the stories so what is the latest story well we moved into absentee ballot and so you see the process of the stories\nThis is how you can see that there's a political campaign involved in shaping the stories\nFirst it was about registered voters and then it was about ... voters then it became about the absentee voting process then it became about the early voting process and now it's about the actual voting machines\nThat people are calling reporters claiming the machines are changing their votes there's no evidence of this you do need to understand all of the reporters who were saying that the votes are being changed on these machines they've got no evidence there is no proof\nAnd I don't think it's possible\nBut what you're seeing is a manufactured grievance process in this story\nAre essentially it's the Abrams campaign building the story that the races being stolen from her and again I Will say as I said the other day if you're a voter listening to this and you hear the ... campaign essentially saying it doesn't matter what you do they're going to steal it any way\nWell then why are you going to show up\nWhich leads me to my larger point you would not be screaming about the rules being broken if you were winning\nBut ... every time the rules don't work out for the Democrats they scream about the rules and say the deck is stacked against them because of the rules or somebody's cheating\nStacey Abrams would not be out there running a campaign saying Republicans are cheating if she thought she was winning she would be making about the issue instead she's trying to build an issue to justify her for her donors after spending all of this time\nOn voting reform in Georgia and getting people register to vote why did you lose well it's got to be that they cheated they stole the election\nThat's going to be hurts use it has nothing to do with the truth of the matter asserted\nIt has everything to do with she needs an excuse to her donors again if you were running they successful campaign for governor in Georgia you're not out there trying to get people to fold the median said the machines are changing my vote when they're not you're not out there trying to get the media to say oh Bryan kept his throwing people off the roads and stealing the election when he's not\nThat's what you do when you're losing\nOr if you're losing because traffic is bad you screamed that I haven't since they were just turned ... there's a lot\nOf I Can't stand losing vibe or to read that you would have I learned a guy got another graduates cleared twenty what Wesley chapel solid toward ill wrote I was really\nOn the older one on one forty minute or two hundred twenty\nMinutes from what I've got a job where nobody buys\nAll I've got a juicy story ... ...

firm got evicted uh the landlord that older building effected them for failure to pay or some such he still wants to run for president\nThough the Democrats are now actively throwing the guy under the bus you guys do Michael having any right the stormy Daniels' lawyer he looks like a buddy of mine says he looks like scum bags Picard [laughter]\nBut card from the mirror universe nonetheless so he did a a profile in time with Molly ball volleyball actually two thousand Fifteen for the Atlantic wrote a big profile of me is uh the the most influential conservative in America you've never heard of\nA ... she's writing the profile of Avon Eddie now what does that say about me [laughter] she's moved to time though she also Molly ball did the the big profile of Stacey Abrams on the cover of time a while back a nonetheless a so this is a quote from Michael ...\nHeaded into the need to air a Democratic primary quote when you have a white male making the arguments they carry more weight\nAnd then he said he wished that wasn't so\nBut that the Democrats need to nominate a white male in twenty twenty and he wants to be that white male\n[noise]\nDo you really think that's going to fly I mean is is\nThere anybody listening right now who is looking at the Democratic party a fork us Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren and the light and they think that\nThat party really wants to go white male in twenty twenty really they're going to be a lot of white men running but do you really actually think they're going to be able to get anywhere\nIs bonkers if you asked me a listen I I don't take ... seriously uh it's uh it's amazing to me than the Democrats have taken the guy seriously and the only reason they've taken him seriously because they view him as someone who had fought back against Donald Trump and scored points on Donald Trump because the Stormy Daniels but he\nTotally undermined the opposition to break capital the he's not going to be able to escape that he can go on as many redemption tour says he wants\nBut Democrats right now blame him\nBlame him for undermining their opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I don't think that's going to change within the Democratic party I really don't um\nThey're going to go for ... there's a big profile of Kamala Harris the other day that\nThat people and I were in love with her because of how she fought in the Brett Kavanaugh hearing it that's the defining moment that's why they were planted up on the Judiciary Committee sheen Cory Booker is going to be a fight between her and Cory Booker and she's going to win because Cory Booker but I don't know that he can throw it to punch it I think she can\nWe knew each other I won't say great but we got along well\nAnd have gotten along since she went to NBC I think she's a very nice person I Do not think ah it was wise to try to defend blackface on TV which you know I I got to say as an aside here\nThis preachy cultural appropriation nonsense from the left on Halloween um each why is it always white liberals\nTelling people you can't wear a Halloween costume because it might have been some minority that that seems to me that there is some paternalistic racism in there that you're going to offend the American Indian or you're going to offend the the Chinese are Japanese person by dressing up as the ... or what have you\nUh and they get so upset about it and he don't really find a lot of Japanese people getting upset about your dressing up as an injure American Indians getting upset with you dressing up as vocal on us um and I think they're far more upset Elizabeth Warren for claiming to be Pocahontas nonetheless\nI wouldn't have gone down the road Megan went down\nBut really NBC is going to pay her sixty nine million dollars the rest of her contract\nOr to be rid of her and it really has nothing to do with her comments despite what people are saying the reality is\nThat there was a lot of resentment and the today show\nFor bringing making Kilian from Fox for so much money or they would have preferred I mean but this is Matt Lauer sexually harassing people for years a predator on staff and they were OK with Matt Lauer they would rather have him than making Kelly and it has nothing to do with making Kelly and everything to do with the fact that she came from Fox\nI mean what we're learning from NBC is behind the scenes there was a staffer remote about Megan Kelly they did not want Megan Kelly there they had been looking for excuses to get rid of her and they seized on this is the excuse to get rid of her because there can be no forgiveness for her ever working at Fox\nThat's what all of this is about and they didn't like that she came in with that much money they didn't like that she got that show then frankly I don't think she was happy\nThat much money they didn't like that she got that show and then frankly I don't think she was happy there either there have been multiple reports that she much prefer to do hard news that she wanted to do this off new segment she didn't like the soft new segments and she wanted to do more than she was in and negotiations actually have remote press reports say she had a meeting coming up this week\nTo talk about ... ... that segment anyway and doing hard ooh segments will now she's going to be out altogether\nAnd it has everything to do with the staff at NBC not liking her\nWe had the situation at the New York times as well remember that slack chat someone screen shot at least the transcript of it that\nYou had staffers at the New York times who were just appalled at the New York times would dare to give fair treatment to conservatives dared to actually cover conservatives fairly um the intolerance of left wing political activists in newsrooms\nIs really driving greater distrust of the media\nThere really is a and I don't think this works long term for the media I certainly don't think it works long term for the nation we should be able to have a media that people respect and we don't and I can't blame anyone for not respected them look at NBC's coverage Brett capital how much they got wrong how much they reported\nThat was proven not to be true that NBC in particular has been extremely agree just in the past few months of reporting left wing talking points is fact and then having them disproved didn't shown that\nUh they're not legit\nI I I I Wonder how long any ... any lack is the will pay president of the news group at NBC and I can only imagine going to be a matter of time before ... and there were maybe they'll bring Jeff Zucker back\nTo become the head of the news division um pull him out of CNN where he reviewed his contract but reports are he's not happy that he had been able to make the big debt as he wanted a who knows but\nUh you know making Kelly is essentially being rewarded\nFor sixteen I was sixteen million dollars to not work at NBC that's the way I Would look at it um good for her for being able to cash out and get out of there they clearly didn't want her and now she's free of them now we are not free of traffic we need to go check [noise]\nTrying to get a better do Eric I'll be honest they forty W

look into the terrible things she wrote on her and they really weren't terrible they were just terrible if you were progressive\nOn her website um but yeah you know there's an interesting comparison here with joy redone and making Kelly or they didn't like Megan Kelly because she came from Fox and she never went through the bend over backwards I'm now one of you throw my old positions under the bus a thing the joy read did\nNow jury doesn't necessarily ever show there anymore but there hasn't been a movement to drive route of the networks\nDespite the nonsensical a review of of her statements and trying to filing with the FBI claiming that someone hacked her website\nIs all a bunch of hooey anyway and everybody knew it was you know it kind of ironic for me to have this conversation I was on with Katie tour on MSNBC earlier today talking about the election the upcoming election I'm now I'll be on meet the press on Sunday on NBC's assuming they still have me on I think they will I've got great respect for some of the people at NBC like Chuck Todd\nUh even Joe Scarborough and I've been friends for a long time we don't necessarily agree on everything\nNow but he's a very nice guy or very much have great respect for some of them but NBC as a whole has been poisoned it seems by the progressive as amid MSNBC\nRotating staff between the two it hasn't worked well for him and behind the scenes some of their major figures at the network had been deeply critical of that but they don't seem to be able to change it and\nBetween them a ...
