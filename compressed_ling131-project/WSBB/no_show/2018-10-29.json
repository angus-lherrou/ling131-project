G. T. V. down and that's a very good spot very classic spot and the great news is we've been meeting with CNN and they're grown apart and it was a should have a a several\nUh that'll be displayed an\nAirport to most of the country and maybe even the world\nSo we're making a lot of progress last lady uh uh you've probably seen around town uh outdoor billboard\nCampaigns as well mhm they've joined in with them saying that we just not going to tolerate this before I say last I've been really be that this is going to be an ongoing effort for us\nBut the catalyst right now and the emphasis right now is the upcoming\nSuperbowl and that's right I was that was my ... and yeah\n... ... it's also probably in the event in the world that attracts\nBoard this activity that any other we've got to be right here in February so that's the focus right now the national football league the super bowl they're all coordinated with us to make sure that people know that we're not going to tolerate\nThis odd subculture events that's a lot of information\nNow but we're busy and we have about a ... member task forces working really hard on this effort\nYou know what that when it looks like the things that they say that we are missing in plain sight or we don't know I\nThink what I can tell you this ah from the forties you know child is a\nYou know immune from this will be\nBut I can tell you what the what the traffic or looks flight in a typical profile like traffic or there's probably a white male\nWave forty five fifty five or sixty years of age lives bucket or nor do\nNow that that gives you an idea\nOf sort of you had a rural someplace with a thousand white males that fit that profile or one or two of them are going to be involved with this\nAnd why we may find that the child today that it doesn't look right now I'm going\nTo look right I I Am so conscious of is that when I look around ... and you know you'll see the girl not looking at talking not saying there's something just doesn't feel right about this situation and wind adventure gut feeling you're probably correct\nYeah yeah so now and and just as as a concerned citizen what we do\nBe aware and make sure in there to be aware and when you're going to a restroom and a facility that you don't see the sign alert the owners of the established mall\nAnd let me know and we were absolutely going talk in this business on and let them know that they're required to have this signing up here's what happened\nThe first fine as five hundred dollars without having to sign up the second find is\nFive thousand dollars so we haven't found find anybody yet but it's only going to take one or two\nTimes to make an example of someone and people will get the war that we're serious because you say you know five hundred dollars second followed by five thousand dollar five that's pretty strong\nIt is that is and where can we do to get more information some will know what to look for where to call will know all the information\nWe have everything in my office and my um number at the office for zero for six one three\nNine eight one zero\nFour zero for six one three nine eight one zero in on the way the Atlanta public school system is are supporting us in this effort as well as the Fulton County school sip a school system both superintendents didn't hesitate\nTo get involved with it so it's a community effort to we're tackling this problem\nAnd I think that we're we're not naive enough to think they will ever be able to stop it\nTotally but we can sure ah put a big\nDinner and it has some Latta both the county and the state of Georgia\nAtlanta understand the sex trafficking is not just here for ... says well they're adults that are ... and uh we're ... we're\nFolk it's actually comes

the pizzas have to either shrinking in size or removing gradients to stay under the government cap on what a pizza can have\nSo the public health service in England says they got to do something drastic because of obesity\nWell I Believe that our laws requiring posting of calories that that is the right thing because it makes you make the choice and that's exactly where it should be\nNow I Know that once calories were posted calories consumed only dropped eight percent but a lot of people even with the information they ignore it or didn't change them I'm One of the people that calorie counts really change what I order\nBut the question is is just like with New York try and the soda ban the soft drink ban of any soft drink bigger than a certain number of ounces\nYou and I have to

York city and I'm really looking for a kid going she's from ... sheriff and I'm Wondering if you can help me out like I'm getting cheap ticket\nFirst of all if you're in Connecticut now you have to refer to yourself as being in the tri state area you'll hear that from over and over again now that you're there\nOkay you haven't heard that yet I have heard that yeah\nOr you'll see in the TV ads and radio ads no all across the tri state area so for you if you want to see a lot of shows taken a lot of Broadway an off Broadway\nThere's a great opportunity for you\nJoining the theater development find I don't know if you've seen this they're the people that run\nThose ticket boost in Manhattan and there may be one now in Brooklyn that are for the tourists coming to New York and they want to go see a show and they stand in line to buy tickets when your local\nYou can join the theater development fund\nAnd then it gives you access to ticket offers that are deals without you having to go stand in line with the tourists\nGray so that's one thing I Would do also because you're in the tri state area this would also work for somebody who's in New York and you know wants to buy a same date ticket and hope for a good deal\nThere's a website called today ticks T. I. X. ... it's not just for New York I think it's a number\nOf markets around the world where there's big theater scenes oh yeah yeah all around the country and um and also in London and with them\nOr you each day you see a list of shows available and white deals they have available for those shows\nOkay and I got one other one is well that is the one that I've talked about for a few years called Broadway box uh-huh have you seen that one I have not\nSo Broadway box dot com and if there's a particular show you think hey I really want to go see this particular thing\nIf you're a member of the uh theater development find and you have the deals available for through them and you look at today ticks and all that you can always compare those to Broadway box wherever a particular show you want to see in a performance you want to go to is the cheapest you just buy up there\nOkay great thank you very much\nAll right I Hope you enjoy being able to take and all that theater at is with us on the Clark Howard show\nHello ed hello car how're you doing excellent yourself\nGood thank you you have something that it's getting really old in your life a home equity line right\nOr right down to zero for quite a while and it's come in um time to either get a new one or just try to end this life\nAnswer the question I have is from the credit scores standpoint if you're going to help me or hurt me to go hand in a tree and get another two hundred thousand dollar home equity loan but never use\nNow is it a loan or a line 'cause the distinction where the difference is a line you can draw on basically with like a check it's aligned\nLion and the interest rate floats so to let's step away from the credit aspect for a second let me ask you this do you find that it's been a useful financial tool for you to know that that's available in a financial emergency of some kind\nIt is although I doubt that I ever need to use an except for maybe a light and use it to make some other investments that pay a whole lot higher interest rate so that would be the only reason I might want to use it\n'cause I liked the idea of home equity lines of credit is stand by in lieu of keeping money and things like simple savings accounts or anything like that if you have assets and you keep them invested and if you had a sudden the financial emergency\nHaving to sell investments could be at a bad time and that's where a home equity line of credit I think can be very useful for people who carry very little or no debt in their lives a home equity line of credit can be a wonderful tool\nAs far as how it would affect your credit how long you staying in the house you were in\nSo you were in a we'd been there twenty\nEight years all the time we got another five to ten\nOkay so you're not looking to get a new mortgage or anything like that I think having a home equity line of credit is a good idea as a strategic thing then in terms of your credit the history of the home equity line you have will benefit you for years to come the fact that it's been there\nThe issue potentially is available credit and ratios in terms of use of available credit and that would put the argument towards you taking out\nA new ... new home equity line of credit but what will it cost you to originate that he lock that would replace it the one that's\nDone they said if I could cost think if it won't cost you anything I'd do it okay that's what I was thinking All right we'll best to you at\n... thanks\nRebecca joins us on the Clark Howard show Hello Rebecca how are you doing\nClark and fine thank you Rebecca you're looking for new wheels\nWhere I'm kind of a warm I bought my alcohol actually model car\nIt's a two thousand Thirteen guy got it in September of two thousand twelve and we're going to keep it for five years\nBut kind of come and gone pretty quickly and I always get the urge for a new car I like the new bells and whistles I'm attack arsenic object Carson an awful lot of thinking and we pay for our callers that shot and I'm just\nA lot of money to be tightened down on a car and once we write that check it's gone except for the car you know we have the car back I'm thinking I'm leasing might be an option for me\nSo when you bought that car back in twenty twelve am I hearing you right you just wrote a check for it you didn't take out alone\nNow we've got and pick out on\nSo it's a lifestyle choice if you're in a position that you don't need a loan for a car and you light new wheels routinely\nThat's a circumstance particularly with luxury vehicles that it may make sense for you to lease instead of by because with the luxury makes they don't like to out now discount the vehicles because they're trying to maintain a cache of brand worth\nSo with all often do is they'll ... factory subsidize the lease and where you get the deal on the luxury vehicle is in a way you usually for three years they want to turn you into another vehicle in a three year window\nRight and so a book cause for you is not a dollars and cents question it's more a lifestyle question we sing on many luxury makes wouldn't be the right decision\nWell so my question if I decided to go into a lease the next time I Want a new car do I sell my car out right and then had to go with them on because I'm not you how you're supposed to hang on the price of the car and not the not the monthly payment ... [laughter]\nRight so harder when you when you get the deal are involved in the trade interviewer existing vehicle it really gums up the works at fogs it up and it's hard for you to know what you're really paying\nDepend on\nFame trumpet call your phone\nUs the triple ... colored blame the apple open\nWhen you ask me about ... er Cox media group station [noise] twenty four hour news weather and Trump\nFive and a um seven fifty\nFor me to the news\nMorning it's two o'clock I'm our cable line live from the ws me twenty four hour news center [noise]\nImmunity vigilant Pittsburgh to honor those killed and injured in Saturday's mass laying at the tree of life synagogue bits burgers packing the soldiers and sailors memorial and the Oakland neighborhood where Mayor Bill de Blasio pledge to city support to those affected by the attack\nWe're here for you because we're pitch burgers and that's what we do we care and take care of those in need and we show it as immunity of one\nThe Jewish federations Jeffrey Finkelstein called for the United states to investigate in order to prevent similar attacks from happening again\nThe Jewish community across the globe has been rocked by this targeted killing Jewish organizations from around the world has that representative and labor leaders to Pittsburgh to provide comfort and support\nWorld headset representative and labor leaders to Pittsburgh to provide comfort and support interfaith leaders are also expressing their solidarity\nABC's aerial rush up in Pittsburgh tonight the suspect Robert Bauer is facing charges on twenty nine federal counts twenty two of them make them eligible for the death penalty Dave Pecker ABC due\nSouth of here but you're a two oh one fifty seven degrees channel to actually use meteorologist rabbit says well see clear skies overnight lows around fifty sunshine Monday highs near Seventy five as most accurate\nAnd dependable forecast kinda got if we're talking working selling a cat Lauren\nThen is a member of temple Emanuel and Sandy Springs tells channel to actually news\nWe will not be afraid I'm going to stand up to the rabbi spike\nAnderson says security measures at the synagogue under review unleaded the shooting in Pittsburgh\nSo I think we'll just re examine what we've been doing and make sure our tastes are crossing her I's are dotted the\nRabbi telling channel too\nThere are no words that are appropriate I felt like I kicked him that got\nRobin well landscape W.

[laughter] you know this guy I Know well I was there as well I took\nPicture [laughter] it was a video I set the video oh here's the reason Greg now you tell me you tell me but I think that this is the way that it goes I've never seen the guy before I saw this one picture and of course they're comparing whose official picture with a new guy on a bed in a hotel room\nAnd it's a little fuzzy because of the video but I it's when the nose in the ears of match is when you know you have a match\nIn the theaters match is when you know you have a match right and so that's why I looked at I look at the nose over the years and I said uh that guy is involved in a grotesque production that's what I said [laughter]\nYou agree on it or not I agree looking at this ... it's hard to deny that it is him um and then there's a picture of him with his wife and she's just standing there looking defeated because what else is she supposed to do come out oh it's ...\nIt's Brazil and say that I like when I come at me like what what are you implying with that statement I\nKnow do I think it's a good thing or a bad thing depending on where you are saying is I think Brazil is one of those countries where the men are expected to have Mr says you know like I like Italy\nIs like that there are certain places where a that this might be hard to believe but uh as people are together for quite a while as couples in some countries like Italy and perhaps Brazil\nWomen actually don't mind the guy wandering because they're tired of him\nLike that uh they they age together the woman's like fifty four she's had enough of this yeah go find yourself at twenty five year old dandy and have fun and leave me alone so there I'm not making this up there are cultures where it's expected that you're going to have a mistress later I really don't want the wives\nNo I'll tell you why they don't it's not a matter of not mind the it's a matter of being a part of the culture because what happens is when you become say fifty five or fifty six years old and you're in a marriage you remember when you were twenty two and you were somebody's mistress elect keeps going in the culture you see what I say are so you can get a because like\nI like writing an office part of the other cultures where women can't drive what about that you know you have complaints against that and\nThey hold on cigarettes correct we've had an accident here on the buffet Ohio no and in the eggs I Want to\nSay is everything okay now they're very good but I haven't worked a buffet line since I was in the Catskills in the early nineties [noise] this is fantastic All right well uh I say to that guy will\nIf not when do better than he would have done I think most Brazilian voters as if I have any idea will be turned on by the or the tape that's my prediction\nThat's my prediction I might watch I'll be in trouble with the country of Brazil or you can get in trouble with things you just never imagine that's all right we'll put us on a map no we suffer you know the suffering me do we have time for another story I have no idea how much time we have us another story or\nA California man has burned down his house because he was using a blow torch to kill spiders\n[laughter] I never heard that on the home fix that show [laughter] you know sometimes\nYou hear stories you just think yourself they're leaving something out [laughter] yes I Believe there was a spider yes I Believe our house was burnt down but I feel like there's a piece of information it's being left out because if you're afraid of a spider why do you what did he uses a toward\nBlow torch but these are black players these are black widows they're very dangerous I heard that they're not now are black widow spiders dangerous yes Poizner here day Becker here yeah that was if there by you'll get real sick [laughter]\nThey've begun their Becker here in the home fix a charity every weekend our dirty as they get out there at our church but you have to be careful with the house of my writing I didn't know it and just the sheer [laughter] this is my thing is I I I think\nHe was doing something with the blow torch\nPotentially illegal I don't know and then he sees I don't think anybody runs to get the blow torch [laughter] I think you're doing something with a blow torch you're scared by the spider and then you turn and then you forget that there's a whole house attached to the spider and then you end up in trouble\nSo what do you think he was up to you have any\nSort of I think he was up to ... I think that ah that Brazilian candidate was in the garage and they were filming another video that's what I think it was going on as long as I'm In trouble with the country of Brazil I'd have to take a little deeper like a\nA I have a I don't pick spiders but ah\n[noise] I don't know why I don't think a spider as ever harmed too many spiders they just look like you they looked like they should be killed there's certain things\nThat come across you come across that should be dead what other things or look like that Eric hey look we're not going to go into my past I'm a reformed man yes\nI was gonna say spiders are good though they eat all the other horrible bugs and they usually leave you alone\nThat's true uh spider should be but they look like they should be killed a little bit scary there are certain things and sometimes I Will say to a small insects when I'm drunk [laughter] I Will [laughter] before I kill them\nI give them a little talk 'cause look man my places in\nLook man my places in here you're places out there\nYou stepped over the line pal [laughter] now you must die\nYeah well and then I called once a year they crawl into your mouth when you sleep the average person eats what seven a year\nIt's a lie is that is wrong with no it's not true is that true will get out of the people buy into this up here 'cause they know daddy daddy long legs which apparently is even a spider but it's the most poisonous spider in the world but it's a mouth is too small to bite you that's not true either it's not true you're here dispelling these myths\nOr they just have to know that I wasn't I Wonder if you if you want to be a mouth breather when you sleep you know sleeping at the spider's not crawling in there [laughter]\nI I I wasn't saying that the uh the I I thought\nMaybe it was a little bit too low because Tim address I think swallows at least Fifteen spiders a year seven seemed low to me yeah there are always telling you about the spiders wider enjoy it I or being after a while I start wondering if you're eating a lot of things because you have you seen Tim since the Grammy takes pictures of little bugs all the time spider silk\nReally enjoys them and then I I like the critters [laughter]\nWell anyway suffice to say that would fall into the category of masses in the news\nLike if you tell me a story like a guy burned his house down because he was afraid of spiders or what I Would say to you is the spiders incidental that idiot was going to hurt U.S House down sooner or later that's what I say that like a man who likes to play with fire yeah if you're playing with fire sometimes what happens\nYou can burn a if you're not good enough you get birds next door\nOr the or the Tesla reliability tumbles to near bottom in the latest survey now Tesla stock has been going up despite all the problems with the mosque but reliability\n... so a with a Consumer Reports yes consumer resale we got to go on a whole level\nThat the ... all we have to go to a break we do know no I've got some civil reports moves [laughter] we have to go to a break and we'll sit there was All right we'll go to a break we'll come back we'll figure out what's going on in Iran must have had [noise]\n\nHi this is Wes moss host of money matters when I'm not here at W.

no more in our simple three steps Christopher flipping homes right here in the local area but it's just an\nSupposedly blackface controversy I mean she said one thing maybe it was inappropriate maybe it hurts them feelings she cheerfully apologize to the next day I don't think it's a big deal if she has really good ratings and they don't want to let her go but I think a couple of things going on here I think they don't like her\nBecause she chose to really go to the wall with the Matt Lauer sexual harassment stuff\nAnd a few other things having to do with that and also her show is not getting ratings\nSo if the black face thing wouldn't have happened\nI Believe that right now we'd be hearing stories about how we're going to end Megan Kelly show and she's going to join dateline or something else and she's going to go into a different situation all of a sudden they're handed this black space controversy\nAnd they can blame it on that and try to fire her out right now they owe her millions and millions and millions of dollars sign for sixty nine million I don't know how much is up front I don't know how many years that was but obviously she's going into negotiations today with NBC\nThey want to get rid of her and make it costs the least amount possible she wants to walk out of there with the most is she gonna walk out there ... out of there with her whole contract or how does that work\nWell you know you'll always have to be privy to the contract and be able to see it in an entertainment contracts are really long and they're pretty ironclad\nI Know launch seniors thank you very much and I my behind for a year once they got paid in full so so in a writer you know there's pros and\nCons on her side and now in every contract usually you can fire somebody what they call for cause and and they link that to a morality clause and if there's a morality issue which certainly race would fall under then she can go in there and the ... but she's not going to be in a very strong in Goshen and does it do their jobs\nTheir job is to try to say this is all about the black face controversy yeah she's got to go in with the truth now I'm not a Megan Kelly fan I told you this show is going to fail from the beginning but she's good but you know they did make the mistake of\nGet offering her sixty nine million dollars in a show she in my opinion is going to go in there with the troops which is you're not really firing you because you're using that as an excuse so you won't have to pay me because the show just didn't work out\n... the what they're going to do is is they're going to throw money at her depends on how much probably\nNot the ... you know a million ... million to walk away now come on to something like that\nTwenty or thirty million just to cut their losses and get a show in there and that's a winning show instead of a show that's just right you know dive bomb\nShe said that she wants a Ronan Farrow to be in the meaning you know he's a guy who's doing all these sexual harassment things because she believes part of the reason that they don't like her isn't just the ratings and she's probably right is that she covered the NBC sexual assault scandals\nShe covered the NBC sexual assault scandals lot which I think she probably had her best ratings when she did\nThat well but she wants him there because he's not only a lawyer but a journalist and she\nWon he's a lawyer he is your own and Farrow is a lawyer he went to law school he looks like he's Thirteen while he's got a baby they do they have a elementary law schools now oh you\nMust have known that still [laughter]\nYeah they do there's a a child lawyer graduated elementary\n[laughter]\nYes Mr pharaoh you ... ... what do you have to say\nOkay thank you or\nDid you watch them do to be or already that lawyers trying\nTo\nGet you get the lawyer a pass equal you hold her in contempt now so [laughter] so it really is we don't know because we don't we haven't seen the contract but that's that's the dynamic\nSo yeah I mean the threat of having him there is to give NBC poor PR ... she wanted to be so to speak for stalking horse right and so\nAnd they can't say anything out of line or else who's going to write a store\nRight on who's going to write a negative stories about unfair the negotiation was so they're going to throw money at her to get rid of her I mean that you know the show that was on ... twice the ratings yeah without ... and that\nLike wow it's out broker for heaven's sakes that's a ratings machine right there and why would she would you want to watch a weatherman sit down behind a desk for an hour right\nBut if she gets something that she perceived to be in on their mouth and she's going to double down and you know Britain further litigation\nWanted ratings she'd have Ronan Farrow\nOn the show and then tell them that you have Frank Sinatra's DNA and give him a twenty three and me test and find out if he's actually Woody Allen son because I think he looks a lot like Frank Sinatra\nYeah we'll see I mean maybe it was no way that that little booth is my side [laughter]\nFrank I'm Sorry I'm Sorry [laughter]\nBring a dang thing I Need to bring some real talent and that is right maybe they'll replace real Woody Allen and Matt Lauer\nMatt Lauer and are actually bring Matt Lauer back when they say this he's\nDone he apologized I don't even know was anything like Megan apologized\nMegan apologized as well but see Megan I Would love it if she would have sexually harassed somebody\n[laughter] where do you mind hired at\nA skews me mega did you ever sexually harassed anybody\nI don't know what you're talking about but if you came in sat next to me maybe we can talk\nFurther Megan Kelly I met her mentioned on that I can share with you Jake black know Sean Hannity\n[laughter]\nOne time and I was getting changed after my radio show getting ready to do my TV show I caught her peeping through a whole Shia drilled into the dressing room\nKelly was PG got you as you are changing\nAnd I went on Roger Ailes about and he said but then a baby nine ... just like yours [laughter]\nHe said I drilled that whole you were

did you say on the L L man that was the other side the Arabs will Farrell is gone door to door Kennesaw yeah to\nTo back I tried to get people to and again and if you ask\nYourself this question why has the gubernatorial contest in the state of Georgia\nCome down to Will Ferrell versus Donald Trump well the answer is simple wheels making a movie in Georgia oh my bailout bowl and Trump know the answer is very simple because this gubernatorial race is about\nPower\nParty is going to be in power it's not about ideas\nIf I said you Brian Kemp what's he all about what what what's the issue that animate Brian Kemp\nIs I don't know I don't know but that you left that behind you haven't really been talking about guns in the general election that were legal immigration no that was in the primary we don't see my daughter's boyfriend\nA ... it's not about a ... or people who hurt people got closer to the issue that ah there's no way as you Stacey Abrams who both people Brian Kemp tried to make you forget about the ads where he was you know shooting everything up he wants you to forget about this Brian Kemp\nYou know shooting everything up he wants you to forget about this Brian Kemp [noise]\nYou know I didn't say that and Stacey Abrams is doing everything she can to make you not notice that if she's not radical now in in the earlier years of her political stuff she was a radical so you have to people who are doing everything they can to keep their essence\nAway from the voters' minds and when you get into a search and nobody's talking about the number one issue for Georgia\nNo one is\nAd is why you shouldn't vote for the other person not because this is the issue that animate me and I'm going for it and that's why I Want to be your governor no they both want to be governor because they both want to be called governor because they both want the power\nAnd they've both been in a long enough that hey it's about time for me to be governor\nThere they're both life long politicos and if you stick around long enough hey why not be governor but there is no one issue that animate either of them and they're not pushing it so why not\nRead your too boring candidates that have nothing to say so if you're not going to vote in the Stacey Abrams versus Brian Kemp race why don't you vote in the more fun Will Ferrell versus Donald Trump or race\nOr that I hang on a second lady [laughter] I'd like to add that I don't have the firepower guy like common\nYeah write comments coming in right exactly to on a ... and how some swayed by this is the thing I Do I'm going to ask I didn't you didn't they already have your vote my guess as you were never attempt to pursue\nSome yeah okay\nYou're [laughter] nobody has you know the thing I mean he was like ... yeah so you can yeah you didn't so uh [laughter]\nI mean that old track and he was yeah that would include looked like\nHe had a beard and like that we're hair cut that everyone\n... this is the voters go anywhere I like avocado oh\nMy gosh this great brunch place where they have this off and on the ... and they put so much on top and it may play stop\nWell they got I think I'll be there [laughter]\nI'm In ... called grand man you know what you have more in common with his Brian Kemp than you think young lady\nAs well about ... and so\nI guess I never had a great place to wait ... [noise]\nOh I got me one of the inverse skaters I'm going to go now you're near embarrassing yourself go down the line on them skater\nAbsolutely or whatever\nYou know what else you're way cooler than I thought I was a little closer that's why I hate guns more than I Love God [laughter] let you go [laughter] so uh\nYeah and you wonder about the Democrats having to use this move before they're so in ... celebrities nor the Ossoff campaign oh yeah this is a lab or to use it at least a mulatto comes in and tries to the polls\nThat didn't work get there it's hard to say no to a celebrity one although will Farrell is a it's an a list or you've got an a list or on your side there I Wonder if that the er the Democrat headquarters mount Olympus yeah if uh at some point a list of a lotto must have said\nHey I Want to go to Georgia and there's a we kinda got already in he's in town east do anything we love you but we're going to go with Will Ferrell Tony ... [laughter]\nAnd a child she is a ...\nThey're going to talk about bugs him alone [laughter]\nSo that's really what's happened here you've got a well run state or Republicans have been in power for a while you in in anytime you're in power for a while it's a little dicey getting in there again neither of these candidates are animated by any real\nIssue they're both lifelong politicians who just want the next job and so it's going to come down to who's going to rile up the base more it can Will Ferrell rile up the uh\nThe the left base or more than Donald Trump can rile up the ... I Would say in a state like Georgia Donald Trump got a better chance that goes to\nThe whole national outlook as we go to the midterms if you look at the polling\nThere's very few people\nWho are undecided all the way around\nAnd so what does that mean it's all about get out your vote whoever gets their people to the polls\nIs going to win in a lot of these races governors races or the house and that's why I still think the house probably goes Democrat\nOr because I ... Republicans very motivated to vote Democrats have always had a better machine to get there are people out to vote and this is all about who gets up off the couch\nAnd goes to vote the weakness with the Democrats is young people sometimes talk of big game but then they have a hangover\nBig game but then they have a hangover on election day and they still make it senior citizens vote so the Republicans have that\nUh so there's all this is coming down to and that's why it's getting silly with Will Ferrell and and the sort of nonsense because no one is undecided anywhere in this country any more so it's all a matter of ... people out get I'm voting you know early voting in this country right now actually\nBoth sides are way up\nFrom early voting which really brings it down to election day now the get out the vote on election day becomes even more important than before when we had early voting so that's what it's going to be all about who gets there are people out this is no longer a gubernatorial contest between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp\nWe're now voting Will Ferrell versus Donald Trump America or leave it to you a story\nFor me yeah so good at running Hillary Clinton was asked during the Q and a on friday did she want to run again and she said no but she said I'd like to be president you know what I don't know that I Believe\nYou English Nick 'cause you're not from this country and you're not always on the show so let me let me go to the source material here you say she said no but\nShe would like to be pro yes in twenty twenty let's see how close you know a lot of people say this fake news out there and see how close you are to reporting the actual news you want to run\nNo ... no ...\nWell I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nChanging I'm right Hillary Clinton told the truth is there for the first time ever in life that lab [laughter]\nBut that is the truth right now she's getting a you know I Love that laugh around this time of year plus they get really were sees these bees may run against ... uh she really got to the truth as we listen to both parts of that you want to run\nNow\n[laughter] I accept that now because well I'd like to be president [laughter]\n[laughter] that was one of those like a fun house [laughter]\nYou ever go into those fun house the other side's like big clowns her why any I'm quiet until you walk past me\nMost of them got hurt that another world [noise]\nSo uh [laughter] yes she realizes no matter what you think of Hillary Clinton she's not dumb so after two ... ... oh You're welcome a after two horrible campaigns where she is the worst candidate you the worst candidate and how he lost to core nations now does that ya\nSo she knows she's not good at that but she does want to be president that's the way she ran her campaign last time like you know I really shouldn't have to come down off my pedestal and deal with you stupid people hand an\nOld lady become president I'm tired you're tired right so I Want where's my teeth\nSo in there you found the actual truth when it comes to Hillary Clinton yes she wants to be president no she doesn't want to have to go\nUp close to the little people again\nBecause a lot of no yeah it's not like you build you know people she's real up putting probably looking at it I don't know what\nYou're talking about I'm a loving grandmother bill is

forty eight eighty four\nThat eight hundred three eight zero three forty eight eighty four eight hundred three zero three forty eight eighty four\nThis was W speed meteorologist Kurt knowledge looking at how trick or treat weather is shaping up find my forecast anytime on the radio at [noise]\nAnguish Mick filling in for a job a motive\n... do you have a I I my understanding is that air pollution\nYeah is the new tobacco it is what we're breathing in is killing us as being worn by Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey from what I understand oh no no you got the wrong who my for how we're talking about the world Health Organization no great classic rock band for low or even banned okay\nSo the world Health Organization says the air pollution is tobacco the simple act of breathing is killing seven million people a year and arming billions more the simple act of breathing and so is this is a doctor from World Health Organization should use the advice to stop breathing\nDon't break should we not is it so dangerous debris [noise] can you vape smog [laughter]\nMaybe less than a start vaping the air I think you're right man vaping is the answer that's totally started vaping now we can stop being addicted to air pollution you know people by the way I like to\nOut people are living longer than ever in world history it's not even close ... we live in probably and if you live in this country or the western part of the world\nYou've never had it so good is the I guess it would be boring every day to come on the news\nI guess it would be boring every day to come on the news and just tell people in the world history we've never had this many people above the poverty level\nMaking a life for themselves and then we live longer you know all the problems that we're having most of the problems we're having with health care we didn't used to have cars for the most part everyone was dead by Seventy five we we are living so long now that\nWe are creating new problems yet every day we hear is how horrible things are so the simple act of breathing is killing seven million a year and show me the death certificate to die to Malta exactly exactly and\nUh ... I Would bet you that most of the people who are dying from that live in countries right I Will not repeat the president because that was scandalous hell hole concern but living in countries where\nYou might be about if you weren't enterprising young reporter\nYou might be able to find a political system [noise] full of cronyism [noise] kings queens rulers who just basically rape and pillage the people they're supposed to be ruling is that a lot more reasons\nWhy these people are dying when we're breathing everyday and most people in the west actually most people on the planet are living longer than they ever have before that's the real news\nNow here's something that feels great getting some slack side of the closet that didn't fit a couple of months ago and now they are just perfect you can do that with the quick weight loss program loose up to thirty pounds in thirty days for thirty dollars all services included and the results are guaranteed\nThe quick weight loss program costing less and offering more for forty three years now\nTrust me I've tried a lot of things sure was happy when quick weight loss came around finally something that works\nIn reality are these people really could they possibly have gone back to school done six years gotten a certificate and know what they're taught me this is a brand new thing so who decides who becomes the sex cop the whole point is so that if something happens or an allegation is made in years after the production\nThe company can say we had an intimacy councilor we did our due diligence that's really what it's all about but that's not what the reason I was going to talk about used to be off the track\nYeah they're good game of blame the new show aim of\nBlame so now it can't you know this is the way it works in America it can't just be a nut\nThis idiot in Florida who is sending these pipe bombs that didn't go I Can't just be a nut there has to be blamed has it's not there is no fun and blaming a nut right you get nothing out of it you get no political power out of\nIt it's just kind of a well glad we got 'em before he heard anybody right and there's no politically speaking there's no good resolution there so now that I saw a story about a Google\nHas not done their due diligence they may have done some stuff about guns they may have done some stuff about nine times but it turns out if you type in pipe bombs first thing comes up out of make pipe bomb and to get off the thing I Know that you\nHad the anarchists cookbook I don't need a failure disgruntled over there [laughter]\nAs you say about this story it's not possible to not allow\nInformation to get out anymore don't people don't understand this\nIs so what they're asking people they're not actually asking this is all about a a symbolism over reality nobody is asking Google to actually stop someone from building a pipe bomb what they're saying is oh we haven't checked you off the list yet\nFor a signaling you're wonderful virtue and burying the but no one really believes that in twenty Eighteen\nIf some psychopath\nWants to get a hold of this information they won't get but it's the same thing as the sec scouts or Google did you do your due diligence so in the future when we come after you can say hey we buried that as far as good on the page\nBut no one actually believes the Google can stop the next psychopath from doing what they want to do information wants to be free it will find its way out this is a known fact I'm not going to get too\nDeep in it but it's what broke the enigma code\nReally information will always bleed out you just have to know where to look\nInformation will always bleed out you just have to know where to look how to look where to find it so I get annoyed by these stories what's\nThe name of that a social network that a gab these ... these ... people's these nuts are on because they were kicked off of Twitter because they're nuts right and they do nothing but just so division\nWe live in a free country right free speech but that doesn't mean you have a right to be on somebody else's media platform so I guess as a response to Twitter somebody started gab so people can talk and not have there and I guess there's a there's a this horrible human\nBeing the Pittsburgh Pittsburgh guy was on that I signed up I signed up for gab when it first came out just to see what it was all about I think I made it a day yeah and you're like a troll strong yeah but like you enjoy I don't mean hatred but I mean you enjoy gas lighting ahah I like letting people on yeah but yeah this this is just it was a\nIt was ... I'm I'm thinking of a very the wrong thing to say a circle it'll say the wrong says you know what I mean last job I've ever had in the [laughter]\nThan echo chamber right for conspiracy theories and racism yeah and then all of that because once you've kicked out of one place that's all you're gonna have now did the people who started this thing I don't think that was their God at all but that's what I was hanging up we because people were being thrown into the Twitter thing that didn't belong there right\nAnd so here's a place where you can but you know a a an awful lot of horrific people used the telephone yeah we don't think oh well we got to get rid of phone because horrible people use them to communicate I bet she wants to telephone came along\nA if you had a a a some sort of terrorist type organization in the United states even I'll bet you as a lot easier to call around and set up meetings and set things up you don't blame the telephone for that\nBut I don't know what it is people just want to blame Google or the social media platform these things hatred and tribalism existed since people have been forming any sort of civilizations whatsoever\nSo weird thing I think it's in the human animal alone really other animals kill for food and they kill each other over territory or a mating other other animals that\nJust kill us like it seems like a serial killer or something like I don't think there are other animals who are idealistic killers 'cause they can't be idealistic because they don't have abstract some\nAnimals just murder because that of the blood lust do now yeah Fox is two and then up from the fact doing they don't kill okay so he'll be money chickens because they're gonna you'll twenty they kill twenty guys are in there and it's just\nMaking a a a suit of skin out of the animal you know because they can't right they're not again right but that said they had ... maybe the first time this gene referenced [laughter]\nI'll tell you and maybe I Would imagine I guess new like something that he ... he sees the carrier pigeon together yeah yeah and that and they\nOutlawed ... already shooting them down yes they did which I think it was absolutely wrong and the Fox news love that because they get that that I Can't think of anything now but at the same day that\nIt was gay and he would know easy to these dark green or he's the guy that they loosely based the Texas Chainsaw man ... okay\nWhich was more like him\nThat a little bit of both I never saw Texas He was a\nRedneck and lived in a in a rural farm in hell and psycho\nBut yeah it was like it was based on him as well yeah but he was making he was a boon job would he made close out of skin I Know around I Know that sounds mom around after she died yeah that's what I'm saying is Hollywood really benefitted off of it [laughter] but\nAnyway again use the telephone right I mean ... ... yeah [laughter]\nTotally loners but I mean so this is\nThe thing that we can't ... for some reason [laughter] it's not enough for people just to go that person's responsible for that heinous on them it's yes yeah now if we find out you're crazy or whatever it makes it more difficult because we don't really know what the deal with you\nI don't care I'll be honest with you I just don't care\nThis guy in Pittsburgh you know I don't care about his mental state I'm Sorry sue me I don't care I don't care what his mom did to him I don't care what his dad did to him I don't care if he had a bad interaction with people of a different face I don't care\nGet them in court because America and then kill him\nThat's where I stand I'm not interested in what led him there's an article this morning or might have been Fox News on line or something you know who was\nThere's a whatever the guy's name is Robert what's his name\nAs a name is Robert and yeah they were asking who\nIs the uh I don't I don't know whatever these things happen I have no interest in the deep story on who I don't care about the guy who shot up the nightclub in Orlando I don't care about who really was the guy and they don't care\nI don't care if the guy in Vegas took care of himself I mean there's a lot of stuff and we have to take care of but we got to give them a you've got to give them the day in court because America but uh I I I just don't this fascination with these people\nYeah but when you when you do the ... the FBI just profiling on these people they knew that going to get into the minds of people who make it on the news but normally it's too late anyway\nUSA today's going to do that to be it's really kind of sickening to me when they uh they they massage these people a little bit there shouldn't be celebrities I mean they've done something heinous which puts them in the public eye\nBut they should be ignored as much as possible at this point\nSomething like this I just think about those eleven souls who were lost and I think okay now let the professionals come in and work this guy to the system and then from my point of view I Know some people disagree with this but from my point of view he's given up his right to live in a society\nSo put them through the system and then give him the death penalty I Know a lotta people disagree with that last part but that's where I come\nFrom I'm not interested I don't care who wrong them I don't care how we ended up this way I think anybody who takes innocent life [noise] it's crazy [noise] so\nIf you were against the death penalty for crazy people I Would say nobody would ever get the death penalty you have to be insane to take innocent life who back", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "29"}
