and as they continue with Daniel McLaughlin and Jonathan Gillum you're on the Sean Hannity show so they talk to the poor people before people stand by their original statements what else can the FBI

allegations or do you get hit by a by the\nAttackers may not by the FBI should we should the FBI now investigate them if this is the standard Jonathan\nNo but that's not a story that those are local crimes that happened now the case or we need it Roderick however um he would that would have been a state matter because at that time a Bill Clinton was the attorney general\nWhere's the attorney general you know and so but here's the thing that you keep saying and and Daniel I Love you but here's what you keep missing and so many people that are emotionally involved with this\nIf you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate but if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are done\nAnd there's not going to be any because it doesn't matter\nWho you question the very people that are the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't know anything\nAnd so if you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or hurt here say it becomes here say you know that for being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence that case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally right and the the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used\nOutside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me because that is that that's the thing that ... I'm a governments do\nLook look I agree I think that one thing that's important to cut back to this is what is the standard here this is not a criminal investigation out this is an investigation and to conduct\nThat may or may not have beer in a way that somebody get a lifetime appointment um and I understand and I agree that this is the kind of extreme like political and extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\nAnd yelled isn't a question do you have any corroborating witness or any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat have been on the question that has an unseen\nReally I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... well I I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is legitimate question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there's no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something if somebody says\nWhat other information do you have that for a ... question because there is not and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with not either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have ... ... it would be them\nRight and on the side there is no robbery evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with the he was

about it but until she really mature enough to know about it honestly\nOkay and the thing is if you set up a custodial account how old is she now for team\nOh okay so if you open an account for a fourteen year old and you open a custodial account generally the money becomes hers depending on the state of Eighteen or twenty what but\nWhat you can do and I'm going to give you their car cancer knocked the book or legal answer OK\nOkay where you can do is who gets the mail every day I mean she never even has to know that this money is there and even when we come as an adult the male is still coming to the address of record which has yours and she never even has to know that\nShow what type of account like can I Do like that's my problem like I thought about a law that you need to be me let me do that but if we do a concert and I just keep putting ... money every year will be okay\nYeah but see even with the custodial Roth\nYou know let's say she starts working and the next couple of years and then she becomes raw eligible you start putting money into it she still gained control of that is that what your state considers to be age of majority Eighteen or Twenty one she has control so you have to do something\nAnd she has control so you have to do something that is this is a case where what's for the child's good is you don't let her know there is any money there even when she is a young adult and you don't even bring it up\nTil she's old enough to respond to William and with maturity handle the money\nSo me and my wife could we both beyond the custodial count and I'm sure that it would just like all three of us ...\nGenerally you know it depends on the the investment house used but generally you have one parent as the custodian for the benefit of your child's name but\nDepending on where you set up an account they may allow you to set up both of us custodians now there is what's\nThe minimum ... minimum wage and count\nYou can start an account you go to Charles Schwab you can do it with a hundred dollars\nYeah no I mean per year like this if we open 'til you how much money do I put near per year to\nYou don't have to put anything I mean once you've established an account with the account minimum you can let it sit or add to it as you wish\nOkay so that to work and then a Roth I could do that sorry so that when I say you're going\nSo that you know like a raw savings account\nI Know you can't do or raw till she has a job so that's got to wait a year or two to she starts working and then you can put up to fifty five hundred into a raw now by the way the legal Lance or if you want to keep\nThe money away from her until you feel she's mature enough is much more expensive process where a trust can be established using a lawyer who specializes in wills estates and trust\nAnd you can fully legally keep the money away from her till a set time much later in adulthood but I think when you're starting with a smaller account just keep it simple keep the account a secret from your fourteen year old Mary's with us on the Clark Howard\nShow Hi merry heart I ended up ...

competent but he doesn't agree with you and yet he can't get your vote why [noise] I'm\nIn my view the jurisprudence of a judge Kavanaugh is well outside the mainstream um I think his views on presidential power and\nAn individual liberty are beyond the mainstream of American Jurisprudence I don't think that's the case with Kagan instead of my or my friend Senator Graham has made that point to me personally and forcefully that in his view the confirmation process has gotten away from looking at credentials and credibility and into ...\nSo Scalia wouldn't have gotten his vote that was Chris Coons on Fox and friends on the show I'm On a Fifteen minutes ago so he wouldn't he got his vote because of how we would have voted and and some of his decisions in the past ... not many people who are legal experts like Jonathan Turley who I just hung up with and you just heard on the show\nI think that he's out of the mainstream of conservative thought in fact one of the critiques\nOr against President Trump's choice was to conventional\nI mean the fact is that George Bush and uh and Karl Rove and a lot of the conventional Republicans conservatives watch him on the bench they thought wow that's not Trump in\nAnd now you have Chris Coons who I tend to think his level headed on the Democratic side say that Eric who's a WD be owner window Eric\n... a Brian great show I think

thought she was everything was going to stay confidential that's kind of odd she retained a lawyer oh that's kind of odd so now she wants to an antibody she's not mad and whoever leaked out the name that kind of odd\nI mean that destroyed that changed your life forever the fact is I talked to someone today who's best friends uh was really good friends with the person who dated her for six years\nAnd he told me this guy's got impeccable credentials and says she never talked about sexual assault well maybe that's a reason number two he says there's never talk never was claustrophobic never afraid to fly and never talked about a and a and did to help her friend passed so I ... that was where this story came from\nAnd this guy it doesn't want his name out there but was tracked down

think he has a political future Greg Joey listening W. R. S. and our CNA Joey\nHow you doing I'm buying a listen I just wanted to say you're a couple of things real quick number one is that scene this morning on Fox News but the other two people next year and I liked the way you handle Cohen that there was pretty darn good and I gotta tell ya I kind of respect the guy and I couldn't stand it but it wasn't that bad but also\nInspect the guy and I couldn't stand it but he wasn't that bad but also you should have brought up about how Nancy Pelosi's just out of a mind to them and she'll never change and also no one ever brought this up I just want to explain something to you you're married\nOr what it costs ... to see I'm married if any if your wife came out with those allegations okay would you be sitting next to her twenty four seven and that thing and go there but the and that try what\nI mean I I'm not sure but I Would say this she won evidently she wanted her husband interviewed for this pro right Alison thousands also a lawyer Alison do is is that true\nDoes he had had you on it or has been in the media anyway that's none of the people that I Know Coons reference that you know the FBI didn't intervene everyone that Ford requested one of them being or has\nThe right and the thing is that that's a good point Joe but that is also a preference the other thing I keep it in the back of my mind when you marry Brett Kavanaugh you know you're living in a public life to a degree if you're dating a I'm a you know other people that you know you you're not signing onto this public life\nI Know maybe the husband does not want to public life and if he's sitting behind her he'll never has is anonymity again\nAnd sometimes people and businesses that you need Republicans and Democrats let's say you owned a restaurant I don't know what the husband does let's say you're a realtor and you don't want everyone to know that your wife came out to try to uh destroyed Brett Kavanaugh\nI think it was more simple it was simpler than that but I read was that he stayed home with the kids so that they'd have a sense of normalcy\nYou look at him by ... by a Joey thank you uh Tim was W. H. I. O. in Dayton hate him\nHey Brian love your show just a one to bring something up about a professor Ford why did she needed go fund me\nI'm a page her lawyer said that they were paying for everything but probably pay for all of her flight and everything there to take care of everything for her I'm I'm just curious set that up because once you've testified she said that she did not know how to get into it she didn't know anything about it\nAnd now she's a millionaire\nYeah well a ... a couple of things the same way Michael Cohen wanted to go find me page or to pay for Lanny Davis Lanny Davis has Michael Cohen's lawyer and these expensive so Michael Cohen has no money to fund me page\nSo glad he wants to get paid a so I go from page to pay for the lawyers there'll be grad is unless somebody comes up there and pays the bills\nSo that's a good point I don't know if she did it to be rich ... when you have a PHD in your psychiatrist usually can make a pretty good living\nBut uh there's a lot of mystery around her but you know ... including a lot of the story now all of a sudden she wants to live thoroughly investigated she wants to mount multiple people and she only turn over the therapist note if she's asked to testify and for the FBI so\nUh Debbie Ramirez couldn't remember anything then she did remember something to know a corroborated the story now she's got twenty witnesses or is she getting great law lawyers and they are finding other people that the ends justifies the means if I could stop it conservative from getting on the bench it's okay if I come out and cooperative story I really don't remember\nBrian or by the way I Want you to hear that in fact we called him I Want you to you that Nancy Pelosi by this is what the caller from W RCN was referring to this is Nancy Pelosi listen to she compares Brett Kavanaugh to cut you off\nThe signs in the late ... phone from hearing loss\nCan roll from them\nThey can\nGet I wasn't it um the one she compares or the one I wanted to hear as when she compares Brett Kavanaugh who the president likes with Kim Jong on\nYou comparing this guy to a brutal dictator that repressive jails and sometimes murders his own people\nWith Brett Kavanaugh I mean that's a woman that might be the next speaker Brian listening W. P. T. F. hey Brian\nGood morning you're lonely I Am wondering if anyone has a salad and the audio recording of Dr Ford other than the ones that are available where she testified to the Senate committee [noise]\nOh you mean comparing of voice if she went out of a way to sound us yes\nYeah that's a tough thing to that there might be curiosity but that that wouldn't benefit anybody to bring it out and listen to how authoritative she sounds compared to how she sounded especially when her first words Brian we're I'm terrified\nBut her first words Brian we're I'm terrified\nSo they'll just say that's why my voice was so high I was terrified of all was about to happen to me [noise]\nSo uh thanks so much for the call over in Raleigh North Carolina a love the fact that we have that station there's a couple of things that's going to happen once going to happen at eleven o'clock and we'll take a break after this\nAt eleven o'clock today it looks like the Democrats are going to have a professor at which time they're going to say how dissatisfied they are with the scope of the interviews they got nine they wanted more\nNext they're going to say that Senator Grassley was mistaken when he said in Kavanaugh's background there was no trace of impropriety\nSexual drinking issues and not with was the term that\nSenator Grassley had not with that prompted eight Senate Democrats from signing a letter saying that's not true that there is something on his background check\nThat shows a ... inappropriate and then I asked senator Coons about this I said is that it did you sign as you said no\nI said why not what are they talking about he goes there is something confidential can never ever say it\nPublicly but it does show the Grassley essentially overstated when they said there was nothing on his record\nThere you go again last minute statements coming out to try to trip up an investigation into the trip up a cat or to see before it gets to the vote it's about mccaskey Coons and Collins Manchin Heidi Heitkamp\nAnd others are tester donnelley's kind of safe and test or they would do well for themselves to vote for Kavanaugh if they want it to be in the mainstream alone with McCaskill especially McCaskill because she's in a dead heat with Josh alley\nSo now she's in a dead heat but she's already committed to not voting for those others have to say what matters more my political

insane that they're saying well we can't\nWe can't give this to you we want to give this to the FBI when we sit down for an investigation\nIt's a stupid delay tactic by her lawyers it made zero sense Adel whatsoever to hold is one of the committee\nConsidering what ever they discover\nThe committee because\nEr into this is a background check at the request of\nThe Senate Judiciary committee that's right class that's who it is that's who gets the information so is she refuses to provide the evidence okay\nBye Felicia we're moving on we're going to hold a vote that's how this works you can't say well I demand that you consider this evidence at as a way to corroborate my claim but I'm not going to show you this evidence okay by\nThis works none of this works this way there is a process but it's not a criminal\nTrial yes thank you so much for reminding me that you know that's why we're holding the vote\nAnd and by the way why\nIt was in her lawyers goal this tactic\nMakes sure looked like she wasn't entirely forthcoming during the hearing I mean let's let's examine what information did she not disclosed during the hearing\nBecause that was and I'm Sorry I'm having a Sam kennison moment [noise] guys that was the it\nWas the whole purpose the whole purpose of having a hearing\nYou don't go wait a minute there's some things that I purposely what from the hearing that's not [noise]\nNo it doesn't work that way at all if you had to pick between a not how this works and B doesn't work this way actually both would be right\n[noise]\nSo this it was I mean it was\nTo me to

is\nOne of my favorites you guys want to know what it is oh okay so now I'm here now they\nThey say because now that it shows Deborah Ramirez was in her ... interviewed by the FBI right they haven't said anything about Ramirez\nAnd I love to have dinner for Reuben to pretend conservative at the Washington Post the only reason Jennifer Rubin calls herself a conservative is because they have a bunch of of old angry progressive women already\nAnd that's that's an over saturated market place so it's what isn't is if you claim that you're a Republican or conservative and you pass the administration well then there's some clicks to be had there come on over that's like me calling myself a football player her saying that she's a conservative columnist\nDenier so harsh this morning just to sit down ever cookies were economical you football where it would be yeah I Know more about football but she knows about conservatism oh my gosh and that's just not a lot\nSo she had asked serious question doesn't Deborah Ramirez count blah blah blah blah blah yeah they\nThey they interviewed her good job keeping up on the facts wants you to write a column about it but no one will read except a bitch about good job keeping up with the facts\nThey interviewed her you know they interviewed mark judge for Seventy thousand hours I don't remember how long it was like ours\nThat they interviewed him nothing there nothing there so\nThis was a ... so they they they made the talking point did they have\nIs that while you know they didn't talk to the some of these people there are ... I Can't believe that the R B I didn't talk to some of these people wait a minute I'm Sorry you mean the people that you told just like a year ago like a year ago or a couple of months ago after this guy's name came up that oh well I think he did something to me those people who heard at thirty six years later\nAnd they heard it secondhand you think that that's a corroborating witness\nPrayed sell sell high\nI just have to ask just got to ask I mean it's what what\nLike Democrats sometimes think that the FBI will be Keystone Cops for them\nNow all of a sudden they're not happy with the FBI you remember that organization that it was essentially a sin to criticize just a couple of weeks ago Cain actually just a week ago do you remember them all sitting there like sketch sees on that panel\nDark crystal reference I'll Remember them sitting on that panel and they were saying oh my gosh we must\nHave the FBI investigate it is the most in bold set the FBI investigate this I mean ...\nAll of these alarming accusations we must read the death by instilling the authority of the investigation into the FBI because they will get to the bottom of this Oh yes and then they all murder and amongst themselves Oh yes it's absolutely we must have them that\nI say chat and Grassley we shot into to vote\nOn on this individual and hey we have Sarah investigation by the FBI and that\nAnd then the FBI investigated and then they came back and said yeah all\nAnd now they're ...\nSo I have a list of who man you want to hear my list of whom ads pharaoh\nBooker Matt Feinstein mad a Democrats mad and now they're claiming there's a cover up\nI kid you not\nIt just gets better and better they say there is a cover up you guys\nHow I mean I'm ... how\nHow in the world would that even be possible in any way\nHow would there be a cover up I mean it's only the most known\nAbout and that's just what do they covering up some than\nIt does it make any sense but that's their talking points that is a big talking point in fact uh this is to listen to this uh adios down by a doctor or you or somebody Twenty one Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer says this was all this wasn't good enough listen\nWe're many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI and getting all the facts [noise] having received a thorough revenge on the documents those fears have been realized what\n[noise]\nWhat fares\nWhat what fares\nOh now suddenly they asked me I didn't do a good enough job that's the organization whose skills and abilities in the race or say religious lagging I laughed at the last war and now that can make the second is no longer goldie NASA\nWell what do you what the hell you want what do you want for real\nI mean what what what are you all waiting for when it gets better because then Dianne Feinstein the woman who sat on his accusation for how many weeks who you know you had an investigation that lasted forever but you also thought you were going to be killed and sit on it and suddenly that doesn't look so cute anymore right\nHere I Know you guys are yeah it's just not working so here's Feinstein discussing that she's she blames Trump\nThe White House certainly blocked access to millions of documents from judge Kavanaugh's record I Know that\nI'm at and ensuring that nine percent of his emails and memos weren't available for the Senate for the public in the hearings it now appears that they also blocked the FBI from doing its job\n... trail\nBlocked\nExcept it's not true it's completely false and not true um in fact there has been a just with with Brett Kavanaugh there has been about nine hundred\nThousand pages of records which is more than the last five justices\nCome by the last five\nMessed this up so when we come back more who mad and what's next stay with us [noise]\nMessage and did a race may apply guys isn't the time you stepped up your game in the gym in the boardroom and especially in the bedroom American men are getting saw we have left us drone that our fathers and even less than our grandfathers we owe it to him and ourselves to fight back\nWith alpha king from forest factor it's never been easier just one small pill a day for a serious boost in total testosterone alpha king is on the rise of GNC but you can claim a complementary bottle by texting cop\nAnd he uh\nThey wrote a piece of read the New Yorker about that and then his surrogates were saying\nWell you know if you need any any more evidence that the uh that this that this has turned them into ... at you know journalists have become advocates well known and that's what Ronan Farrow is here he's he's he he I think undermined everything that he was building he became an advocate and forgot his journalistic purpose\nWhich was unfortunate because he had such a promising career now nobody can take them seriously anymore\nNo one can take them seriously they have tried they tried to delay delayed delayed delayed the lay\nYou had her\nAttorneys saying well we're not going to we're not going to basically cooperate who by the way to say no to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee is it the new standard you can just say no I don't know you could do that\nShe she wouldn't turn over her notes\nShe refused David French and attorney wrote about this my friend over at National Review\nHe said no she she outright said she wouldn't do it and it undercuts any effort he says this is a serious problem and it undercuts any effort to prove or claims against Brett Kavanaugh\nThe American legal system is characterized by mandated transparency\nAnd he goes what my friend and I said he says in criminal cases the prosecution is required to release exculpatory information in other words it can't be required to undercut its own case\nAnd civil litigation parties are generally required to turn over not just all relevant non privileged documents to the other side there are also require to turn over all documents that could lead to the discovery of relevant information\nThat is one reason why the decision to litigation ever be taken lightly 'cause you're opening just ended its called discoveries what the process is called\nSo [noise] but the Democrats kept saying on purpose well this is such a ... a trial says job interview so essentially what\nThey were saying is well we don't have to meet the standards of fairness or balance or anything like that we can just make a baseless accusation and not have to prove it that's what they were saying\nAnd in any other any other courtroom it would have been in a courtroom it would have been dismissed and it was and it and it should be a bit and should be dismissed here\nThey can bitch and moan all they want you about something being incomplete but you all have nobody to think for yourself you got an individual who could not corroborate a single one of her claims you got an individual who refused to cooperate and provide information to the Senate Judiciary committee that could have further shed perspective and and and in in some sort of and could have further illuminated\nThe scope the breath of her of what she says corroborated and was evidence of her claim she refused to corrupt a cooperate her attorneys refused to cooperate Democrats refused to cooperate and now they want to complain about the process and say that it wasn't it that it didn't include everything\nIsn't it that it didn't include everything again\nI Would say that\nThis is insane\nSo going forward oh and I wanted to share this to a\nA wheeling Kaiser's her family's speaking out there was a big I don't know if it's still out there and check that there's a big old piece up about her ... that was a where her family spoke to the daily mail\nAnd she they say and apparently living Kaiser says Christine for through her under the bus yet\nAnd the family says yes she did not corroborate her story to the FBI a close relative expressed anger at Ford suggestion that Kaiser cannot recall the party because of the quote significant health challenges she said no health challenges of not impaired her memory but being caught up in the cabinet scandal has been physically trying\nThey're and they're mad they say she just she did they say that she just uh it was like she was dragged meant that Ford was called to the principal's office with a family member said it felt a lot like Christine was the one called the principal's office to get an account of something and through Leyland under the bus you know just reached foreign name\nAnd Howard J Walsh the third Kaiser's attorney a confirmed last night that Kaiser spoke with the FBI and when she did she could not corroborate Ford's account\nAnd said she double down on what she already stated to the Senate committee\nDid you guys hear anything by the way in the media on MSNBC CNN any of them about FBI talking to leave and Kaiser nope [noise] and she completely did not corroborate Ford's account\n[noise] mhm\nSo she was that the I spoke with her and and remember Ford called her her best friend\nShe said she was my best friend at Holton arms and apparently even after she said that they were close and then Kaiser's relatives said that Keyser was shocked that she named her as a witness because she hadn't even spoken to her in several years she said it was like she just took a name out of the ether\nHuh says\nShe that yeah she just kind of I think they talked via text really but that was pretty much as you said she hadn't talked to her and several years\nSo the protesters are out in force as well\nAnd it looks like because we have two scenarios here and I you know like I said I was on Fox and friends this morning to ask you know what would happen what would happen if they if they didn't confirm Kavanaugh and I hope that the Republican Party does not play this kind of a gamble\nI actually like Senator Lindsey Graham suggestion\nThat if that didn't happen\nAnd they didn't uh they weren't able to confirm him I think that he should be re nominated Trump should re nominate him\nAnd then you appeal to send its verdict to the ballot box and Utah all those people out there you'll elected me to fulfill my promises that I made an ISIS filled my promises\nBut they are blocking your will in the Senate polling across America\nShows and I consider and go over with you\n\nPeople are infuriated over how Democrats handled this process which I'm going to discuss how it's painting Democrats later on in the show in a number of states and a number of battleground races too and it's also increasing a GOP voter enthusiasm which is huge\nAnd Trump could say look I kept my promise the Senate's blocking\nYour will how are you going to respond\nEven if Kavanaugh is confirmed you all need to realize you still need to turn out just as you would if he wasn't and he was re nominated again to be confirmed after midterms\nBecause you see how Democrats are acting right now\nDid did you did you hear about the Democrat who was doc scene Dianne Feinstein staffer who docks everybody he was doc seen all these Republican senators gel here about that\nDemocrat in turn was arrested for doc seen by dachshund I mean he was taking all of their private information and putting it all over the Internet [noise] Jackson Cosco age twenty seven can you be twenty seven years old and an intern\nHe uh was sharing all the details of Republican senators posted their private cell phone numbers apparently and everything on line he worked for ah Sheila Jackson Lee he worked for Dianne Feinstein\nAnd he has been hit with seven charges including including witness tampering identity theft and second degree burglary\nIdentity theft and second degree burglary he was currently working for a number of Democrats but most ah but at but really with Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd this I mean unbelievable he posted a lot of their details on line with with with what goal you know they've

C.\nAnd as a senator representing West Virginia exactly who different things going on there that want to point out to people who don't know this\nBecause I think that we're both I I Believe that you're on the side of Kavanaugh as am I yeah I I Want to point out if people don't know you may be considered a the founding member of the never Trump voters in the primary season I voted for the libertarian\nOr but this seems obvious to me that this guy has been smeared I Wonder what you think about when you see people saying I just believe everybody and I don't care what the subject is it seems to me that you got a a a bunch of people saying\nI Want to throw I don't want to have to think anymore I'm just going to believe every every single accusation that is out there and also I'm a little amazed at how willingly some people in this country are\nAre well are willing to throw away the concept of innocent until proven guilty I I'm astonished by this I don't know if you are you might be a little more cynical than me because you you play the game a little more than I have as far as politics and inside baseball but as it is it somewhat astonishing to you is it is to me\nOh is it very much as you know the first principles in this country are innocent until proven guilty and um the is that you got the right to face your accuser and the burden of proof is on the accuser and on a leak used and\nDemocrats have seen very willing to throw the way that this new very post modern idea of of bully evil women will you you've got hundreds of women who have known bread capitals as he was in kindergarten saying this isn't bright capital he's gotten female friends who were with them\nAt a number of the parties where he supposedly was a binge drink belligerent blackout drunk and they say never happened and yet now we're not supposed to believe those women but we're still supposed to believe all women do none of it makes sense except for the fact that you understand this is has never been about\nThe accusations the accusations exist because the political left as opposed to brick capitals jurisprudence\nIs all about roe v Wade yes and I and I'll say this I\nThink that actually I think both sides are planning a bit of a gay Monrovia weight 'cause it's very interesting to me that Republicans are kind of like oh no don't worry about it [laughter] oh we never had a million years will be and I think that's a little bit of a political ploy I think that uh certainly it will be challenged but you know ... elections have consequences\nAnd you end up the presidents have the right to put who they like up there\nAre now that now we know if if not in an election year you have that you have the right to put up there but at this is really about roe v Wade and this is what annoys me is that we should we just have the conversation about roe v Wade tell Democrats go get it passed at the state level you won't have to worry about it\nYou know very much so you eat is there is a corrupting influence here in abortion politics in America that this is all about it and we can't have this on his conversation I mean what happens if\nRod capital where to go to the Supreme Court tomorrow and they were to overturn roe vivid way well that means then there would be fifty states has fifty abortion policies as opposed to one national abortion policy and frankly then that works against a conservatives who are pro life because frankly a lot of Republicans at the state level have the convenience of saying the pro life when they're really not because they know there's nothing they can do\nRight ah I ... back to cap it all uh specifically he wrote an op ed I Believe it was in the wall Street Journal yeah he defended his a judicial temperament I don't know that was smart I must say I don't think that uh apologies are accepted from Republicans apologies are just seen as admissions of guilt\nYeah Republican I I agree but ... that op ed was not written for you and me it was written for Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and they read the wall Street Journal\nOkay that that makes I hey I read that are you saying I don't read the wall Street Journal\nList that I read it to the audience to loosen his performance last Thursday was for an audience of one down the street from the capital his performance in the wall Street Journal is for an audience of do inside the Capitol\nOr what is the little wrinkle where uh somebody has a wedding on Saturday\nThe Danes she's the the senator from Montana his daughter's getting married um that in the Saturday Night\nAnd the vote is supposed to be for thirty pm on Saturday So dangerous office confirmed he couldn't be there on Saturday well dangerous now circled back in self [laughter] barely his wife got involved and said no time change you can hop on a private plane and be back in Montana and time for the wedding after the vote\nI how do you feel this is going to play out in the mid term so I'm assuming that he does get on by a bare majority ah how do you how do you feel I'm I I can tell you anecdotally I've been surprised that I Know it's anecdotal but I'll tell you this most people that are good friends of mine\nKind of disagree with me on politics so I don't have a lot of people around me I'm In an anecdotal way I've been surprised at how many women\nYou mean anecdotal way I've been surprised at how many women I've spoken to who feel that ... is being smeared and I'm Wondering ... seems like all of this what I hear is this is all about trying to get suburban women\nYeah but you know ... there's actually really good data on this now the Quinnipiac poll has been pulling specifically suburban women for three months uh\nIn in July the generic ballot for Democrats among suburban women was at fourteen per cent in August it was at eleven percent there last poll was the very end of September September thirtieth and it was it one percent\n... see there is a reality here ... and this was something my wife talks about all the time we have two sons my my wife's point of view she has two sons\nAnd they're young and they're out there in the world and ... so it's not always this war between men and women not only men and women are at war and mothers have not only fathers and brothers but sons to worry about and it seems to me that the Democrats are not thinking in those terms at all I don't know how real this uh\nThis image that's been created is in the country as far as the war between men and women\n... it is it is a very real issue inside very liberal exist in areas along the coast and urban areas of the problem for the Democrats is that this doesn't exist in suburban areas that are the swing districts in this country\nAnd then they've really gotten themselves into bubble it as much easier for a liberal in San Francisco to never encountered other conservative than it is very conservative in Atlanta to avoid encountering a liberal we we don't live in the same bubble that they do\nAnd one more thing to point out about uh the the uh the prevailing wisdom uh from the left that women are so their point of view as women never lie about this yet we have this Keith Ellison case\nAll right well this ... Keith Ellison before he was running for the attorney general was he was he was involved in this in the power structure of the Democrat Party wasn't not\nYes she's the number two at the gym or will he was the number two the Democratic National Committee a first Muslim and Congress and he's running for attorney general ... Minnesota his ex girlfriend claims she abused her her sons have come out and said it as well she's done it on videotape\nThe Democrat said they had an investigator look into it they won't ... released the report but they say there's no they're they're right um but they didn't have a formal police investigation she actually has ... the one like Christine place\nNow now she does sound so she she says she has a video she won't produce it my point is this just for the Democrats come back with their report that says there's no they're they're well that ... this idea that women never fabricate these stories\nYes we'll ask these four Denison in California who were ... found not guilty or the charges dismissed against them for sexual assault of a woman because of videotaped evidence proving they didn't do it\nBy the way I'm I'm not saying I mean I ... I Believe it is time for America to come to this uh I Believe that women have to put up with far too much from men I Believe that there are plenty of sexual assaults that go on and I think it's time for people to stand up against it but the idea\n... that ... that ... age gender never fabricates things is absurd not because they are women because they're human beings we know amongst all types and flavors of human beings there are good people and bad people and truthful people and liars and this is just a fact right\n... the University of Virginia case um the we don't have to go back to to kill a mocking bird\nDefied examples of this All right very quickly what's your final production what you think's gonna happen here it's going to be very close but I think he gets the nod and you think it's going to happen Saturday or Sunday I think it happens Saturday around for thirty\nSo stop worrying about what your pets might do your home and just love what they bring your life\nCall and we'll be knocking you\nAsked me about ... er Cox media group station [noise]\nTwenty four hour news weather and five and a um\n\nLooking for another hot day to day lots of sunshine afternoon highs around Ninety two that's about sixteen degrees above normal good morning it's ten o'clock I'm Sabrina cupid live in the W. must be twenty four hour news center here in Atlanta\nWe continuing team coverage of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation W.

we're going to win this thing right we have nothing to worry about this is going to be a cakewalk against van de tomorrow night right yes it should be what's the line twenty seven okay we'd have snow last week we won soundly but I guess didn't cover the the line I did not cover the thirty one point\nSpread and now people are getting their says the people I'm seeing on this sports network a very famous sports network as that are beginning yeah beginning to wonder whether or not Georgia\nIs actually going to make it into the playoffs if Ohio State runs the table in Oklahoma runs the table and a and there was a feeling that maybe Georgia did not win as soundly last week as they should have\nWell you know and everybody's contracting ESPN there's two pages\nAmong the fifty ... let's say we have to create scenarios for the college football playoff no matter when where or what yeah because they they they're the ones that put on the show yes so you must create the drama to lead up to the show\nWhich is you know good broadcasting in in in a good business so I get that I I think that they are you all for Georgia we'll all get settled on the ... yeah Auburn LSU you beat those guys\nBeating Tennessee by twenty eight instead of thirty one is not going to be and I now my\nGuess here is that a coach Kirby Smart as being very politically correct and telling us what a tough team these uh these kids from banned the he's very worried about quarter bank account\nHe has a tremendous receiving corps he's very intelligent\nHe understands the system he plays in he's able to know what coverage or in a really good quarterback that understands the game and one of the many in the SEC now that are growing up really bright you know when you you mess up sometimes quarterbacks miss it he doesn't miss it and you can throw the ball anywhere in the field\nAnd there's no defense through I'm giving you hadn't seen him for his is a lot of challenges for us\nThat's what I call political politically correct PC coach smart we're lucky enough to have non piece the smart way to tell us how he really feels about the ... quarterback\nI'd been quarterbacks going to be hit a lot I think he's a terrible pastor I think she's going to hit try to hit his routes and our quarterbacks and insight these are just going to take a take 'em down his name ...\nThe son of a former Brown's coach\nYeah but that no matter how he still thinks and no way\nAround stink so you know by the friends of property that is true the browns are terrible even Nick Chubb who who I Love them [laughter] you know he don't seem to be doing so hot there Sean what an HMO only get three carriers and scored two touchdowns you're gonna have to ask around I just nowhere to destroy mended hungry and\nThey don't even know a lot of the same field whether you do they non PC coach smart you know I I'm embarrassed that we have to be a limit\nOn weekly vanity on homecoming vet tells me but it's fun it's fun you know people can show up you know and they know that we can win and they're just gonna you know have the time and party enough to really worry about what to the games on\nPC coach smart you said to be you would before the Mike's around that uh you told the kid you told your players this week they don't really even have to chop wood\n... what do you know what they need to do they can just sit in the forest and look at the tree\nLighting now no worries us when we get [laughter] so are there like a real Jay blacks a little nervous you know you'd like to\nPoint out that this is a real Jay Black you of course believes everything the coach smart says of course right Oh yes absolutely line and sinker this is the way it's supposed to be it's a good coach he got to keep your kids a lot of hard games coming up after this ... ranked opponents you can look you could look past this house in ... some abilities\nRanked learning the SEC in passing and they have a collage Lipscomb the wide receiver leads the FCC and receiving the arts so yeah there is plenty of a building there at quarterback just maybe not the rest of the way\nRound again I think we're looking at a in these games I think Georgia means the largest blowouts possible as far as the\nOne to the college a playoff rankings start like a month from now or someone or something like that I haven't looked as ... or rice in her crystal ball is that health I think she's still on [laughter] I get together on the on the yes on the other or Texas every week by\nSaying where's [laughter] that's\nLike the joy pizza I think it will be funny if this year I think there's gonna be great if maybe three teams from the SEC made it into the\nFall when the hell all four teams why not taught Alan ... coffee Kentucky is the wildcard\nTeam and ... they are no Kentucky is pretty good I Want to change things here a little bit it still has to do with a Georgia the campus a but baseball bulldog so a date and they say is it has a ... hazel hazel in hazel would uh they just got rid of them completely and this is a he is the first base\nOkay you're talking about Adam ... one of the first baseman hazel would recruits\nYou know what I'm getting to get her sports he just doesn't now and I don't know no no no I I Know I I just called no it's my fault you can't even smell Vanderbilt right is this as well it's my ... I can\nIt's my fault you can't even spell Vanderbilt right is this is well it's my I confused two stories let me stick with this story first since his sense of this the football team hazel commits\nFrom the bulldogs yeah how was this he was the number one recruit number one receiver occurred yesterday in the upcoming twenty Nineteen class now is he thinking that he's just not going to get enough time when he gets there is that it I don't\nWanna yes the thoughts of a high school kid there was no way to and just because you decommissioned doesn't mean you won't commit\nSo St Louis so he's saying my own daughter still little so he's you know because he he committed early and you know they still recruit you even if you can ... they just don't stop\nSo we started to say you know maybe Miami is a better place for me to go so he just has often said goes direct which really yeah it really doesn't change anything they still recruit you as hard as if you are not\nIs it possible that years ago when they first have their eye and this kid that Rick was one of the first people to talk to him back then\nSo he may still have a lot and ongoing conversation and now let me turn it to Adam ... going to get my story straight a second team all FCC selection or dismissed from the baseball team that's now he was at a dog's game last week and he started yelling the N. word yeah\nNot a good idea though no and the alcohol apparently was involved here referring to the other quarter back he was okay you know did he think he was being positive saying put him in or something like that but using that weren't\nSo uh and he was drunk was he drunk or what what has been reported and he said it more than once he was warned he kept saying it and\nBut I find interesting is that they would just get rid of them rather than saying hey you know here's some discipline we're going to put you through some training some sort of program or does it does it speak to the idea that this isn't the first time people maybe you've heard this or as he you know because you know when you make one mistake\nAnd you are really good player and you're off the team I Wonder if that that's just the first month I Know you've heard it out\nNow that's that's certainly a possibility that you can't have that in your in your program and you certainly can't have that\nI don't have a multi I'm Amazed that you ever hear it from athletes in any sport I Know baseball's a little lighter maybe than uh football or basketball but you amazes me that any anybody who's been in that life from the time they're twelve Thirteen Years old uh doesn't have\nEnough experiences with other players of different uh you know variety you know\nJust all sports seems to be one of the least racist and\nAll that long ago items right you're dealing with all kinds of different people back and you win the person that's going to put me in the best position to win yeah\nEspecially professionally is going to play because you're not going to lose our job over a you know a racial issue if he's the best player he get it as well\nBut I guess my point of view on it is I'm surprised because it seems to me that it's it's difficult to be an athlete over years now in locker rooms and not have friends from all different kinds of background absolutely\nYou can have it all or just pennies on the dollar for example I to wake our

that's not what we have you here for well yeah we're here to talk about the uh\nThe law that underpins a lot of the stuff that we are talking about in a pop culture and politics of course you get here just as just a few minutes after\nThe Senate has voted in favor of cloture which means there's only a few hours of debate left open the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and I know that no votes or was it fifty one forty nine that's right Murkowski was the only Republican who voted no and Joe mansion Democrat devoted yeah voted yes in pretty much I Would think if you voted yes\nOr no on this it was fifty one forty nine enclosure is probably going to be fifty one forty nine or on the vote itself I don't know about the guy who's got the wedding tomorrow and how that's all going to work out my question few law wise now we heard a all through the week from Democrats\nThat uh this isn't a trial when they had cabin on they had for this isn't a trial\nThis is a job interview I don't know about George I'd been on a few job interviews in my life\nNever once have I been accused of gang rape in the middle of a job interview so I I think that the feeling here is a little more like a trial kangaroo court shore but a trial so let's take it out of that job interview thing from your point of view as a man has been practicing law forever or what\nWhat's in most courts in this country is there anything in these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh that would fly in a proper courtroom\nOkay well you know it's definitely a hypothetical ah\nWell I run a little short so it hasn't really happened first of all the statute of limitations is up so there wouldn't be a trial but if there was\nAn ally in Maryland my understanding is uh the foot with the Ford is it the Florida there were mere as one of those uh there is no statute of limitations on this so extremely rare theoretically I Will I Will I Will Perry your hypothetically would theoretically\nIn one of these cases you could go and try to start a some sort of investigation\nPerhaps button and the court of law Eric the standard of proof is guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that's a very very high standard for the prosecution to meet in order to get a a guilty\nVerdict not explained that that's that that's that would be as opposed to preponderance of guilt ...\nSo preponderance of the evidence is the civil standard let's say when you sue somebody when you were injured and that's the one percent wins when\nOJ or lost after he won right but it wasn't considered double jeopardy 'cause there was a different court and the standard was lower\nShore so that's the one percent of the jury says something basically that's the standard for civil but in criminal it's much much higher standard um and it's very difficult standard for the or the burden for the state to me especially on a thirty five year old case when it's just he said she said sort of a scenario\nAnd we often hear this a supposedly if you point out that\nShe doesn't know what the house well she can't remember the day apparently that means you're in favor of rape if you just point out the inconsistencies in in her story or the way that it is 'cause I don't know if you look at your calendar says twenty Eighteen on it and that means if you point out inconsistencies you're in favor of rape so putting that aside\nLet's look at the inconsistencies you'd be tossed right out of the courtroom right\nThey call the inconsistencies in us an a you know criminal case ... that's called conflicts of evidence and and that ended up itself creates reasonable doubt and if there's reasonable doubt you're supposed to find somebody not guilty\n... you you know it's interesting to me because I always grew up and I always thought it was a leftist notion a member of the reading of the Miranda rights and and that whole thing I was a left this notion that it's better to let a hundred guilty people free\nThen to sort of accidentally or through a few railroading somebody put one innocent person in jail\nI thought that's the way that I ... I thought that was left just notions of judges were forced to let people that pretty much everyone knew or guilty go because the police officer initially did not read them their Miranda rights things like that\nAnd that was always from the left the idea was hey wait a minute we're trying to yeah maybe he's guilty and he goes butter better a hundred and guilty people go free than one innocent person goes to jail and now that seems to be turned upside down from the left where it's well he looks like he's guilty of that\nYou know if you go way back when to your your daddy's time you know back when the\n... before my dad left me when I was twelve years old and one day I saw a thanks a lot George or great grand and I thank you so\nAre you go back then when back when they accuse somebody of being a communist than it was just assume that you're accused of being a communist then indeed you were communists and your profession has ruined in reputation was ruined in your family had to move somewhere else and go high up you know\nThen again the letter for years were seen as the people who would stand up and say no you can't treat people like this\nExactly except in this nomination for the judge said\nWell it's not us here but that doesn't mean it's going to end here I mean now that we're going back to people's high school yearbooks are I Wonder if even if a if the left is even thought this through is everybody's ready to defend everything they did\nIn high school and college all their behavior you know it turns out people apparently and I had no idea about this George I'm eyes have been opened that apparently a college in high school kids drink a lot of my and I know idea for a bit and the stupid things\n... it's interesting to note that the the left has come up with a twelve hundred professors that said he shouldn't be the Supreme Court judge\nBased on his temperament when he was defending himself right\nBut just somebody give somebody a law professors are are in the United states about twenty thousand\nSo twelve hundred seem to have a big number then and mentioned that though did they\nYeah I Would like to see in any story that tells you about the twelve hundred uh where did they give to political campaigns if they did what campaigns that they get to how do they lean or as you you mentioned there's twenty thousand lawyers nice twelve hundred\nThousand ... they came up with five percent said he shouldn't be so [laughter] wow that's a big number yeah five percent\nOr let's move on to uh the uh this uh the lawn mosque he was making all kinds of news yes let's yes there's there's you got you on over there uh [noise] now\nThe SEC not not the Southeastern Conference in college football but the SEC that sort of over watches the markets [noise] um well they go to sue him and then they came to it\nUm well they go to sue him and then they came to a deal where what happened in the deal he loses his he has to step aside a CEO\nRight well here's the genesis of the problem that he has yet as he wanted to take the company private again and he stated apparently allegedly falsely yeah that he had funding in place to take this on Twitter right out of\nHis mind maybe he was being sarcastic but he included funding approved any put a number on it for a hundred and twenty dollars\nA share right so he made it sounded like he was in the bank when actually it was apparently it wasn't but he could easily get it\nHe could easily get it but you can't say that you have something that you\nDo so as a result is the stock sort of like you wouldn't believe like you know a huge amount\nAnd then when it's time I wasn't real people lost money\nSo yeah so now he's got an agreement with the FCC that whole stepped down as a CEO for three years but during that time he'll sit\nOn the on the board of the board of directors continuously and pay twenty million dollar fine which is you know small change to him so you think it's a slap on the wrist I I think it's basically a slap on the rest but I think the ... the judge the judge thinks the federal judge thinks it's too lenient now she can increase some of the penalty and she is now\nAsked to see why you came to this again he was just the ... the federal judge will decide if it uh if uh if if it sticks a and I my question is\nIf it was someone who had a name that was in Iran must that we've never heard of and it was the same exact situation you think maybe it would have\nGotten a wouldn't have gotten away with this much\nProbably on the things that I got to tell you it is kind of a good thing because Tesla is Iran must or they may have to know that if they take this one guy out he is that whole company and is a good chance the entire company collapses and a bunch of people lose a bunch of money well they have to be careful\nRight or little sweetheart company they don't want to hurt it and yeah it was held in high regard\nWell he started tweeting again though he treated again and made fun of the SEC I Believe they called it the short sellers a encouragement commission or something like that\nSo he's out there openly mocking now the SEC but he's just made a deal with this kind of being held up in court right now so I'm not a good idea not necessarily a law point but uh\nSessions and it's all done with no pain\nNo needles no surgery and no medication golfer a

which could decide the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination it as Susan Collins Republican senator of married telling us how she intends to protecting\nFits right is important to me\nTo my knowledge judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee\nTo express a view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in article three\nOf our constitution itself he believes set precedent and not just a judicial policy it is constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay heath two roles of\nIn other words ... goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances\nThe judge further explains that President provide stability predictability reliance and fair enough\nThere are of course rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court foot right the overturn a precedent\nThe most famous example was when the Supreme Court in brown versus board of education over rules plastic versus port purchase then\nCorrecting aid gravy asleep wrong decision to use the judges term allowing racial inequality\nBut someone who believe that the importance of president has been rooted in the

Kavanaugh's praised the\nAs the judge just started to me a long established precedent it's not something can be trimmed narrowed discarded or over and looked\nIts roots in the constitution get the concept I'm Sorry to say is greater way such that the president can't be trimmed or narrowed simply because the judge might want to on a whim ensured\nHis views on honoring precedents would priests

case that struck down a law banning the use and sale of contraception\nGriswold fabulous the legal foundations that led to grow eight years later\nIn just griping Britain's falls as settled law judge
