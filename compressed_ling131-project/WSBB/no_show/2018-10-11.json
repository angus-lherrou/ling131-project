they want to also steal from you any indignation you would have about being wrongfully smeared and then they want to steal from you your ability to defend yourself\nThat's how they're doing it it is so sad it is so unbelievably sad [noise] I ... and that's Heidi Heitkamp for you pay hike camp ladies and gentlemen [noise] now I Will say this for a hike camp\nWe played for you or do we have those remarks really quick and we pull those up the highs Hillary Clinton had set in an interview where she was a ... she was an essentially she was\nSaying let's be an civil she was telling people to be on civil with each other she was telling them and of course remember\nThis is after I which I think is incredibly are responsible for Hillary Clinton to have said this\nBecause we're talking about a time of which Democrat shot up a congressional baseball field attack Senator Rand Paul in his yard sent powder and other things\nTo a Republican senator and other lawmakers offices um threatened the children of a number of Republican lawmakers ah docks Republican senators threatened to put the medical records of Republican senators children on line can I go should I go on\nThis was a time when people who are on the left have been protesting by burning down buildings and punching people in the head and engaging in property destruction and Hillary Clinton says this\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nSo she's saying civility we can't have civility until we have power\nThat's what she said and we talked about her comments a little bit yesterday but I have more on them now she's saying that we cannot be civil until we have power we're not going to be civil to you we're not going to be civil period until we\nHave power bottom line bottom line and\nThis by the way she's not on the same page as the media who is coordinating a massive push back against the mob narrative\nSo yeah and I have more on that so how do you hike camp\nShe said that\nYou had said that what Hillary Clinton had said she said well it's ridiculous uh she said that\nAh it's that I mean I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring civility back into politics and that goes for both sides high can't when I was ... she went on to add that she hopes he can find common ground in this country et cetera et cetera\nSo that Hillary Clinton's remarks were incredibly unfortunate because this is the exact same time that Democrats now have been fighting to ah avoid the mob tactic now do you want to know why there's this coordinated effort to push back on the narrative of the mob and it's not a narrative it's just a fact\nWould you like to know why they're doing that\nI Want to take you back to the president's op ed\nLet me just take you back to this real quick I Want to take you back to the president's op ed in USA Today where and he discussed Venezuelan style socialism\nAnd he also discussed the on civil way that Democrats have been um having discussions on uh the everything every every policy\n[noise] one of his course was the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern and and he said he mentioned that again in his op ed but do you remember the speech that he did that can you give me this audio he says the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to government but do you remember his audio he said you don't hand matches to an arsonist [noise]\nAnd you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they've become [noise] he said you don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they've become that was the president's quote from his rally the other day\nThat was the president's quote a Sunday night at a rally the day that Kavanaugh was a sudden it started Saturday Night the data Kavanaugh was a finally confirmed listen\nIf I was doing ours are those\nWho do you know\nAt a rally the day that Kavanaugh was this and that started Saturday Night the data Kavanaugh\nWas ah finally confirmed listen\n[laughter] doing ours\nKnow are you angry left's winning mom [laughter]\nHave CNN and MSNBC and everybody falling all over themselves to go back against the ... in fact Brooke Baldwin over on scene it wouldn't even say the word mob she literally said the M. F. word\nAudio soundbite twenty three this is some of that discussion listen\nIt's because I Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting faced out or restaurants by a mob oh\nYou're not going to use the word totally um all it is without a doubt that there's no other word is\nIt's going to put a stop on a mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August ago mom is not what we saw chasing what did I think we've right what about the\nPeople who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls that civil protest or vote them off I think he has a way of all\nYeah it's a monitor what she was saying the N word earlier it's them up it is a mom\nAnd so they're they have to they have to respond to this because this is the way the behavior of Democrats el always works against them this is why they lose they they they just blow through their strategy because they they fake it but they can make it 'cause they can't fake it that long\nThe real intent always comes out the door the authoritative ... tendencies always come out to try to suppress difference of opinion through force\n\nYeah Charlottesville was a mob and you know what so it was the antifa on the left you know what\nWas the Portland protests that we've been seen you know what so as the mob of people who went outside a lot of the rallies and murders\n\nYeah Charlottesville was a mob and you know what so it was the antifa on the left you know what\nWas the Portland protests that we've been seeing you know what was the mob of people who went outside a lot of the rallies and we're doing the stuff that they were doing\nSo is that those are mobs did you see what happened on the inauguration that was a mob all of it was a mob\nViolence angry hateful mobs people punching people because they were a red hat people ripping hats off of people's heads at malls and restaurants et cetera et cetera people hounding other people in restaurants simply because of a difference of opinion running them down an airport attacking them in their yards\nShooting up a ball field\nViolent mobs like behavior\nThe dumbest\nThing I've ever heard of sound by twenty five now here's we're seeing and tries to explain to you a mob like scenario\nCalling them a mob is that a bit much\nNo not when you see what they've been doing look uh I don't think you need to tell me that we want you need to tell those people out there that are banging on the doors of the Supreme Court and chasing US Senators out of public restaurants and they only get US Senators are in in elevators or look\nThe Republicans won they knew that that meant that the president would have the opportunity to appoint one possibly to a nominees to be confirmed on the Supreme Court and they should actually acknowledge that\nIf they spent more time handing out voter registration forms across the country they'd be much more effective and that meant that the president would have the opportunity to appoint one possibly to a nominees to be confirmed on the Supreme Court and they should actually acknowledge that\nIf they spent more time heading out voter registration forms across the country they be much more effective that\nHappened and colonel tactics\nFit right a lot of people don't I mean all of us who doesn't mean that people don't get to object I mean that's your right and the work and to object for sure is covered in the first amendment but here's one yep\nSure they certainly government sure they certainly can do that but what what are you saying and and we're seeing it across the country\nGoing to a restaurant and and screaming at an elected official in a public restaurant\nAnd they did the same to Sarah Sanders they've done the same the course of ... to many members of this administration because they object with a policy of this president and what ... what the elected officials were elected to do that's not how you go about doing it I\nSaid\nWell you mean as calling and the mob that's not accurate I mean people don't do object to I mean it's you know that's not my behavior they're angry with the way the country's ... that's my behavior\nThe first amendment does not include busting down people's doors and engaging and violence\nAnd it's my behavior they're trying to justify mob behavior we were not wrong and we said that magazine waters was calling for this show called for it

headed toward this turning into something awful\nIf we'll get some pulled back 'cause I guarantee you if\nIf this kind of stuff was happening from the right there would be the the media will be asking every Republican senator every Republican House member every Republican governor what do you feel like this is there something you want to say to your people there would be a whole deal about how\nIt's the responsibility of the leaders on the right to tell their people to back off because it's getting dangerous we've already had people shot\nOne almost killed\nAnd it's come from the left Rand Paul yesterday was saying that it's not reported that he was yelling all kinds of things\nThis is for healthcare well yeah yeah have you and then he had a list\nOf conservatives to kill in his pocket and\nAll I Know you can't prove a negative\nSo I Can't prove to you that if the person had shown up with a gun and started shooting a Democrat senators I'm yelling about a Republican or worship anything yeah right I think\nThat that person would be on the news a lot I think that story would have been big and I think part of it would have been isn't it time for the Republicans to tell their people to back off to combat I Can't prove a negative\nI Can't prove how they would have covered that but I think we all know that if a Democrat would have I mean I'm Sorry I messed it up if a Republican would have opened fire on Democrats\nYes screaming about abortion or some or gun rights\nThat never would have ended it would still be on today\nOh well yeah and it would have been you know every Republican needs to search their heart but since it was a cook who is following Bernie Sanders is a coup now I'll be honest with you I'd call both of them cooks I Would I Would say hey that that's really what it is these are crazy people\nBut I'm pretty sure that if it was a Republican shooting at Democrats the story would have been pushed a lot bigger and we each anybody who was the right of center at all would have been told you know you need to search your heart\nDidn't a Hillary Clinton said this week that do you have that all again yeah it it's the tone from the top of that party\nYou have to have all again yeah I ... it's the tone from the top of that party I Would not just Maxine this is\nAmazing that this is not getting enough play either this is\nUnbelievably irresponsible from someone who came very close to being president United States and a respected figure with in her own party certainly a leader\nWho is basically I don't care how you look at this I'm going to call it like it is she's basically if not calling for violence excusing it if it happens\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about [noise] that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house band or that that twin civility can start again\nAnd we have complete control and no one can challenge us that's right first will burn it down then we'll restore civility\nWe need to start over [laughter] I mean now suddenly around so we can rebound it's not even a good guy or that I Know there's a little tired I wouldn't let them ... ... beyond that again let's go back\nTo I Can't prove a negative but\nIf Newt Gingrich would have said something like that if there have been a little bit of I Know where the Tea Party one guy brought a pistol to a one rally in Arizona and it was the biggest news for a week who was the last time will somebody show me the last\nTime a a a rowdy group of Republicans set fires on a campus because they didn't like the liberal speaker who was speaking on campus the body even remember a story like that\nBut if it happened it will be big news\nIf a bunch of Republicans started rioting on a college campus because Terry Gross from NPR was speaking [laughter]\nAgain and I'll tell you it wouldn't just be news it would be on the the the narrative will be pushed that anybody who's right of center needs to look in the mirror needs to search their own heart\nAnd figure out but when it goes the other way it's just it's either not news or or uh uh hey don't call them a mob Don Lemon these are just people who care I don't remember that attitude about the Tea Party people from the Tea Party were rude at town hall meetings\nBut they were at town hall meetings\nBut they weren't rude I'll give it to you they weren't rude they were never violent\nThey didn't leave garbage everywhere you there they'd never thought that was cleaned up after the rice and when they went to Washington the big rally yup and then when it was over they all stacked the chairs neatly over to the one side right\nSo now you've got Maxine Waters saying stuff like that Hillary Clinton Don Lemon and then eating Eric Holder jumped in it as well\nOh it's just that the Stacey Abrams thing I was here for ...

that just prior to the appointment of Mahler yeah there was no there there they had nothing on Trump and Russia and any collusion\nSo what did they do well they went to their their strategy which was their plan B which was oh let's let's let's leaked to the media everything in the Clinton bought and paid for it down the a\n... like it's coming from all these individuals sources will look like it's real\nAnd then sure enough they leak that's their insurance policy that struck and page talked about\nHow you got in the Washington Post he got McCabe is arguing with Rod Rosenstein you have now three people\nFor people as of today that are now saying Rod Rosenstein absolutely men at when he talked about wearing a wire on the president to get the president to say something FBI directors said this week it couldn't give a straight answer about whether or not there's still surveilling the president of the United states what what is this\nAh do you think that it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders are in the Boston database I'm not sure if anything I could speak to\nAnd they don't send in Republican it's been reported in the Washington Post about two years ago there were Fifteen hundred times in which the president this was when Obama was president ah was minimize meaning the yes you are gathering up so much information you know what I'm saying the intelligence community\nAnd actually the president's conversations are gathered up in there and do things possible then a congressman or members of Congress are going to find the database if we talk to international leaders\nWon't center I'm quite confident that we are conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law and the constitution and subject to extensive\nAll that's not true

the same people are involved the same people that think were smelly Trump Wal Mart voters the same people that literally gave her an exoneration without any real investigation now they're going after

against the Trump campaign associate how did they do it\nThey didn't have verify corroborate any of it and they committed fraud on the face of corn and lied to by the court judges to get a warrant against that American citizen they didn't do it once they did it four times\nIt is unbelievable the abuse of power and then they they leak disinformation Brennan in company all to influence the American people with lies and propaganda misinformation before the last election then when they lose the election while in comes the insurance policy\nImmediately strategy and the media league strategy is oh let's just create the impression that all those horrible stuff happened with Russia and none of it did\nI say that we but we did have a plan of Donald Trump didn't accept the results of the electorate meanwhile they had a plan you know they never had a plan or thought that Donald Trump would win that's why I keep saying to that in twenty seven days you have the power to shock the

innocence and a belief in Fourth Amendment rights for crying out loud and you've got you know leaders of former attorney general of the United states they know they go low we got to kick them\nAnd then we got other people are getting their face follow them into grocery stores and and and malls or wherever the apartment stores and gas stations that were chasing women\nOut of restaurants like Pam

S. B. talk we're chatting about the fact that the media now or at least elements of the far left media by that I mean mainstream\nThey are they don't want to use the word mob\nMob conveys bad things and when people are beating people over the heads and screaming and shouting and ripping signs out of your hands and and slapping you and hitting you and and cursing at you and making you feel bad because you get your kids lined up to go see a movie and they're yelling at you and they're kicking you out of a restaurant we don't want to call that mob mentality\nWe want to call Betty peaceful civil gathering covered by the constitution and the bill of rights [laughter]\nI'm Sorry\nYou guys you ... you know what I get it for so long for so long\nThe bar fringes of the left had been able to

with signs in their altogether and there's no physical violence there's no destruction of property besides the fact that their parent Lee most left wing protests can't find a trash can when they get

windows there's a huge difference\nBetween calling something a protest\nWhen it's just a gathering of individuals who are all voicing concern and people roving the street or attacking attacking\nPeople I'm Sorry there are a lot of individuals in government that I totally disagree with their policies I'm not going up to Maxine Waters at the ... you would ever pick the restaurant of

and fact point of fact basis\nAnd I mean more than willing to accept a different point of view if you've got a different perspective for me because I'd be more than interested to hear who out there thinks\nThat randomly attacking yelling screaming ripping protest signs out of people's hands throwing rocks hitting people with sticks I'm really trying to figure out if you can justify that that is not a mob\nLet's go check out how folks are ... the roadways we've got Doug Turnbull how does it look out their\nVoters address my buddy buddy WNBA all they just opened on five dumped out in the south

want to use that term they want to call it a peaceful protest they want to call it a gathering a civil gathering covered by the constitution the constitutional guarantees under the bill of rights to gather and\nHave their voices heard I got a problem if you're gathering it want your voices heard the differences is when you go into a private business and you start yelling and screaming and people
