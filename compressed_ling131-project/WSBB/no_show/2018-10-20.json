need to be close and the attraction in magnet is up and about eight thousand a day or come into our border and the border patrol was helpless they're not trying to raise the border they're giving themselves up\nIn order to uh get some shelter and then it within twenty days get their ankle bracelets and then for the most part we understand Ninety percent cut them off we never see him again is that anytime\nTwo percent cut him off and we never see him again is that any type of immigration policy for a Democrat or Republican it shouldn't be and the president saying I got up in the morning was so outraged by the caravan barreling to our border he made that statement causing some controversy\nMicrowaves is one of the stores here on on a W W J be over in in Tampa one of our great affiliates and that's where I Am in Studio today Mike you've been up you're the same hours as me yeah so you're you know you we can't go out and party like we used to because you got to get up\nEarly the hell do I party all the time rarely your big dancer that club I quit drinking twenty five years ago when when I started doing mornings you can't do it right but I I still I Am I'm Jealous of the people that can well\nIs it ... it would be today are either go to AA meetings or get a morning show and then you have to make a decision\nThere's never a morning ... but there's rarely a morning where I don't get up not happy they did to be at it I mean because I Love doing this so much and there's so much news is just a ton of fun\nRight and I said what does your whiz but how much does a immigration illegal immigration legal immigration how much does it matter that people to Florida to the people who listen to you\n[noise] it so they say it's a three to one of the three big issue here it's I wouldn't say it's the largest issue here because we don't see it but it's definitely high on people don't like the lack of security on the border more than anything is not we don't see the immigration problem is you're likely due out west\nRight you know I I I was out there ten Fifteen Years ago going to a a ski resorts and and I saw um people from all over the world these different groups of folks coming in and I was telling people here in Florida I say the west coast is not look like Florida and it's coming this way\nAnd so people are hearing about it in the news right now and the lack of security along the borders everybody gets that ... that's a big issue\nSo you got two ... two races that have the whole country looking you look at a governor Rick Scott wants to be centers got take notes and seeing it looks like a virtual dead heat can you give us a sense on the ground in Florida how you think it's going\n[noise] Governor Scott started out very unpopular in slowly become popular he's he's he's been at it in that people like him he's done a great job with the economy said let's get to work these folks laser focused on that and then he's shown himself to be a tremendous administrator\nDuring hurricane recovery and his polls has started to come up he suspended his campaign in his ... started to come up because he's getting this great free advertising showing what he's good at hurricane might he's he's he's handling and he's doing a fantastic job up there\nSo you have a round to say it as soon as making his name and military background making his name on Foreign Relations really ah like Jim Jordan and others are taking on what's going on the FBI and the investigation of Donald Trump but then he says I'm going to run for governor and the president says he got my I got your back\nBut yet he wants to continue more of Rick Scott's policies that has a state really rolling and Gillum doesn't the mayor of Tallahassee has got an FBI investigation Tallahassee is not a smooth during operation but he's got a lot of charisma and poise on the stump why do you think this is a dead heat [noise]\nBecause we're a purple state no other reason than that I was talking to congressman Dan Webster is one of our two main Congress and for the major coast area yesterday and I asked him that same question I I that I said ... going to ask me what are you saying he says because we're a purple state that's the only reason\nBut the word is getting out on what Gillum stands for and I said at the very beginning forget these polls\nThis guy's a socialist and it's the word is going to get out into the saddest will be able to just tell the truth about him and his poll numbers have come up and get almost will go down I think there'll be type but I think the Santos has it\nBut one thing about Florida I thought it was Democrats or Republicans were coming here because of the tax situation yeah and that's a little ... made clear I'm raising taxes\nFor retirees come down here from New York and they don't want to pay taxes and I don't blame and things are a lot cheaper here and he wants to raise the prices making more expensive for him\nRight and I'm surprised that resonates in a state like this\nI don't think the issues are resonating at all and I think it's just that we are fifty fifty Republican Democrat and there is course across the nation\nAnd a lot of states they have very anti Trump right man coalitions not everywhere but it's you know Florida is fifty fifty now I'll be I'll be honest with the I don't know anybody that is a liberal that that is like the ones we see portrayed on TV Now maybe that's because of the circles by running but I don't know where those people are here in Florida\nRight you're saying that uh the people that support Gillum you don't know them at all so that I live in a neighborhood that are they're all Republican right right\nBut ... and up here we are very conservative here but I'm I'm moving to Alachua County University of Florida and uh they're liberal up there and I don't hear it all big buzz ... them but I Would imagine there is more so than here great time to be a talk radio host in Florida absolutely sure it's always a great time in Florida is a great time regardless\nBut I Would say that you're that you're a guy who watches this skating the gymnastics hoping they fall off the uneven bars hoping the double lots ends up being a ends up with the uh the uh the figure skater on the ground on the ice\nTell me that that's not a good time it is it\nIs a little bit when you see them go down I'll be watching it and I don't know if you remember\nInternet and I don't know if you remember the\nPrice but I'm sure you do between a Joe Frazier and and for for ... I think it was in Jamaica or something back in the seventies ...\nAnd a Frasier was the heavyweight champion of the world and Howard Cosell was was announcing it and and as\nForeman just just knocked knocked down eight times in one round and goes and Frazier goes down ... inside occasionally I Will say that about some sweet little uh a figure skater and so as a ghost town\nOr that is very interesting I Do remember that by because for a phrase you gets in the ring having beaten Muhammad Ali who was thought to be unbeatable after three and a half years in exile and here's this Olympic champion\nWhose knocking out people but they say he's not going to be able to stand Joe Frazier's left talking memory you can hear her Frasier he just one Fifteen rise with Mohammed Ali and knock them down\nAnd next thing you know to see Frasier go down before your eyes and who this ... was his George Foreman and who smiles once every ten years they said that and so this guy's going to be champion for ever\nAnd Frazier said to me and my first big interview ever I interviewed him at the Waldorf and I'm interviewing him and I said a he said I Would love to fight for him again he goes\nBut I don't think it will be a different result my goal in life would be to get in the ring with Tyson at this time Tyson's twenty three years old and it was just hadn't beaten up his son yet Marvin\nAnd I said why would you want to get in the ring with Tyson people were afraid he goes I just want to feel it I just want to feel how powerful he is and I thought to myself that is a different mindset than I could even understand\nWhat I Want a failed out fest saying to my job I really just\nWant to feel may I say incidentally the this anecdote that you're told now was gold you need to include that in your performance tonight because I think talking about Joe Frazier and George Foreman from forty\nYears ago how your audience has got to love the ...\nWhile I Can't believe it I thought we were bonding and it really does it was exactly the reverse that I I don't know I think\nWe're all guys and you know I said we could do well at a retirement village I said I'm not ... hey Robert Robert Frasier form and fight oh my God at Howard Cosell ... goes down\n\nHow ... how how did you get that that is uh Pete and Eric or doing some magic behind the scenes ...\nActually I tried it and it wasn't fragile goes down goes Frazier ... that was great that one more like well what Eric\nCrazy\nWow I mean come on let's go now that\nThere's got to stop I Would definitely probably to hear an hour and a half of of Howard Cosell of course he's passed from this mortal coil so that would not\nBe so where did you have you met him yes I'd at with my father I met him a few times and did you like him\nWell I mean come on it it it it was a larger than life he was this the showman and it was you know he was identified with every big sports event in the world and sure I was I was excited to made him\nYeah I mean he gave relevance to everything he made you feel as though sports mattered more than ever\nBecause you know just what he said even when you were critical of 'em and if he was\nFull of himself I get it but just his voice and when he hit his voice said what was happening how could this man who stood the fury of Muhammad Ali\nOr be be going down so easily with from this Olympic champion but I'll talk a little bit now since we had a chance to reminisce and in your terms board people I'm I was gonna say\nI ... I think you're Howard Cosell running in essence is going to work very well to tonight I think you should go to Jack Jack gave Roosevelt Robinson a man who broke the color line\nOkay [noise] I ... out to rescue the segment can we do that\n[laughter] I think it's gone I think we're on life support but go ahead what's the ... out there let's try to\nSay I I I'm going to do it but before I play the sound bite I Will tell you I have no problem with it because I've been watching Donald Trump I get it cut one\nQuick Greg you're smart and by the way it never wrestle him [noise]\n[noise] any\nBody slammed my cat I shouldn't say the ... ... there's nothing to remember as a way indoors Greg very early but I had heard that he body slammed the reporter\nGreg GM forte who ended up winning a special election in Montana and so Ryan Zinke you see the president and having fun with the fact that he did that instill one that's Trump do you have a problem with it\nWell it I think this particular wake and I and I know people are going to eyes are stuck in the mud but this particular week when the world is focused on the brutal murder a jump ball to show gay I Know there are different things I'm not sure that setting they're having\nFun with a guy who attacked and hurt a reporter who was just doing his job is is is ...\nA reporter who is just doing his job is is is necessarily the smartest of\nAll right let's move on and talk I see I I don't see any relation and you know Trump that he's a little different is that George Bush breaking format\nYou know it's it's not Bill Clinton doing that it's way the way he does he he plays into this massive audience or who believes what he believes by the way his crowds are out of control large and and and\nGet out I think your crowd tonight is going to be what on under control small [laughter]\nAnd I think it's got to be out of control\nBut but you can I I I don't know well I'm very ... I Can't wait for you to tell them eight next week how this went\nWell not only that an Saturday a double axle into the into the eyes\nChris Saturday is in Norfolk, Virginia so and then Sunday is in Nashville and then I'm done and we'll see how that goes and then when I met my\nSunday you might get it together I got I got one of the way I Would go to the national performance 'cause I think Tampa's probably going to be a disaster\nIs not going to be a disaster like do I have folks\nIf you're looking for a train wreck I mean it'll be entertaining there's no question about it'll be entertaining\nOh my goodness to not have Chris Wallace in my corner is really disconcerting I'm like a\nCop man for a fighter to like what George Foreman fought Frasier a you know I'm like the government cut may ...

glorifying violence against journalists nothing like making a joke out of body slamming reporter one another journalist when these member his fingers cut off three weeks ago\nThat as John Berman who does not happen to the president was talking about a gene forte\nThis guy a gene for tape these congressmen who took Ryan Zinke he seat\nWell before the special election he body slammed her report which we know is wrong but the president referenced it last night and they were saying wow how could you do that no one could show he was killed and he was a reporter to\nThe you know the president he's not looking at the relation between the two he's working a live audience who waited a long time to get in and he was just talking about what a local politician did there was flat out bizarre but I don't think he was supporting it that's the way he\nTalks that's the way he rose he wasn't thinking ... and he's not going to pay a price for it but maybe I'm wrong maybe you believe it was

honesty when he said a ... that may have potent oh I'm In Leningrad when he was really in St Petersburg remember that\nYes I did but he was trying to win the lottery or putting over\nTo not pay him was eight and a half and\nHere's a hit has had a quick to Saudi thing you're you're ... you're right about that is terrible about killing women and show but look at in the sixties John McCain was a baby killer and they were at his screaming about him dropping bombs on the on on the Vietnamese you know everything's just\nSame Brian I've been on the street for Thirty years you're going to find out it show all the Paso a chair you're sitting in\nHow you come across\nWell thanks a lot of Bob would happen is of course the Vietnam War there was a draft there was a lot of resentment for that war\nAnd they started getting mad at our airmen the air force members as well as a our army they say well you're killing kids because a lot of the video and images brought back with that but that wasn't the reality on the ground things that happened were casualties of war and hopefully we got past that period but they were talking about air force pilots as doing that\nBut no one ever thought um is is that I cannot justify what happened Saudi Arabia that's not going to be okay they will receive ramifications for this and on top of that the president's already made it clear um that he died they know it so now we got to figure out how the Saudis are going to own up to it\nYou know we're also processing applications\nAnd increasing the rate at which you can become a U.S citizen and green card holder\nWe're actually looking at ways to reform our legal immigration system as well not just for ... base reforms\nBut also be able to get to do it the right way speed up that process so you can become a legal resident and become a U.S at us in the right way but I think it's just a slap in the face to those who are doing it the right way and are following or us immigration laws versus those who are openly flouting that means and our faces\nSo ah do perception is that while this is a the the president of the United states is going to set up before she was a great\nIt's a great topic is a great issue for him would come the midterms but you're saying on the ground when everyone's focus on these caravans you find it relatively aggravating because so focused on the care of and the Caribbean is just one issue you're dealing with that on the border on a daily basis and your feel helpless\nRight now you know we're seeing a caravan coming towards the United states\nOf about four thousand people right that's what the news is reporting we're apprehending about two thousand on the border each and every single day that's where you know the men and women have CBP and border patrol or apprehending them but there's not much recourse they can do once they apprehend than were forced to release because not only are detention centers\nOnce they apprehend then were forced to release because not only are detention centers filling up but then even if we do you know keep the family and it's an detention we can't do anything with him since twenty days is too short of a period to be able to adjudicate and removed from our country the best attorneys removal and we don't have that ability right\nNow do you do you think the word is out on these loopholes in central and South America\nOh these smugglers traffickers no our laws better than members of Congress\nI mean it is the most shocking that I've seen recently\nUm is that you know from two thousand sixteen to now more men are coming across the border with children than ever before you know and twenty sixteen it was about six thousand men came across the border with children today it's up to sixteen thousand which says that people know that if they bring a child you will be released in the United states\nAnd there's little or no chance for removal\nSo I Want you to you David to forage said on TALK of the other night uh he's a former President Obama's State Department official\nWe're talking about illegal my immigration and illegal immigration has gone down for Mexico and it couldn't go down for Honduras and Guatemala and other countries in Central America we improve those economies we only give a little bit of money so let's help improve those economies are they really are going to leave him there and we need to pay more\nSo you heard talkers sarcasm but that is the feeling that if we just gave these people more aid they stay home\n[laughter] you know the number one and number two reasons that you know border patrol has found when they interview folks at the border\nTo come to the United states you know what's driving them number one is reunification and number two and economic opportunity that is not because they feel unsafe that not because the economy is not great they really want to come to the United states\nYou know if if you're truly seeking you know ... if you're ... persecution and your fleeing no reason why you cannot remain in your home country\nWhy not stop and Mexico but they don't stop and Mexico they continue on to the United states you know I was just at the border a couple of weeks ago had a chance when we apprehended a family unit you ask why are you coming to the United states I'd like to meet up with my brother who's living illegally in Richmond, Virginia\nSo we're seeing that's what you're saying so drawn um oh good good year is is um he's he is Mexico's ambassador to the United states he was on our general yesterday I Want you hear what he said about the Caribbean ... to\nWe have evidence that or this carbon is also very much politically motivated so we're not we all knew the are sensitive to the humanitarian situation that we encounter and we're acting for seizing\nBut we we have also made very clear that there is no legal ground on which Mexico can issue a permit by which the ... to go forward so United States\nSo but they do they let them through and the care of in some of that has been sponsored by some enemies of our state but on both those issues first off who put this caravan together\nI mean this camera and is being put together by NGOs and others um mainly for media attention I mean are they just said we're seeing caravan side every day at the border you know we've heard reports of these folks getting on buses and then getting off and walking for the cameras you know they are getting a ton of media attention and it is\nAt least putting a spotlight on the loopholes the serious loopholes and us immigration law that once again is you know at least things flash on everyone's TV screen to know just what a crisis that is at the border day in and day out\nCan Mexico do more\n[noise] you know Mexican ... Mexico's definitely taking steps to address the humanitarian issue but yet you know these Mexican cartels control the entire U.S Mexico border I feel comfortable saying that you know predominantly\nYou have to pay a smuggler or traffic or about five thousand dollars is the going rate right now to get across the U.S border so there is a two point five billion dollar industry for these traffickers they smuggler these cartels to get people across the border illegally that it's happening in Mexico right now\nYou know we're speaking to know a kid he's dealing with this on a regular basis or we have a duty woman here ... spokesperson so Dianne Feinstein does not only does she not regret the two thousand a law that pushing for central and south Americans to come here and stay\nShe says if she if she gets her party gets empower the she put on fixing the law or or and bring it up\n[noise] you know I'd have to say that we really do need Congress to act in a closed these loopholes because if not if you just continue to see more of the same that is four hundred thousand you know I just said that a hundred thousand people apprehended at the border last year there are all here today are going to continue to see it as an influx\nOf family unit an influx of unaccompanied alien children because if you keep screaming we're exempting you from the law work exempting you from any consequences you're gonna continue to see people come in and it's up to Congress now to close loopholes\nGave you just don't understand if the if the Democrats see this happening dude it's not good not a good issue for them to let people\nHappening they it's not it's not a good issue for them to let people think that people can fought our borders and get into our country so why don't they want to fix this I understand that they have this thing for the wall they don't want to get the president a victory but why don't they want to fix catch and release\nIt seems like common sense to me but maybe it's just a fundamental misunderstanding of the way US law works I mean to me it makes perfect sense that if you had a you know a crisis going on at the southern border you'd want to fix that but that's a great question for Dianne Feinstein\nWhich she says that you would like to even make it easier for people to come here illegally right\nI think so yeah\nWell and do you feel as though this has been defined well in this in this political process in this election season\nI think we need to as as much as you can and much as your listeners can\nReally get out there and educate on what actually is happening at the border because it's not just four thousand people today it's a thousand people every single day and age people we can't remove and then it's either going out\nYou know into communities and putting themselves at risk and they ... every day and go out there to keep our community than keep drugs off the street and it really is an effort\nAnd educational effort to help everyone understand why it's happening at the border and why we really do any Congress\nAnd three there were three border patrol a soul to uh over the last five days so that the danger is real and Leslie for people listening for those who say well you know Katie well I'm In a brain to made their talk and they don't have big hearts these people have horrible lives and we should just give them a shot\nHow much of our tax dollars do you want to pay\nA ... there are people in this country who are worthy of help from the government\nHow can we possibly sustain our country if we have to pay for everybody to come here is just not sustainable we will not be the beacon of hope and democracy because with the collapse from within were running on a ... basis a deficit of seven hundred\nAnd fifty billion dollars how much more are we willing to spend for people from other countries that's the question that has to BS just tell me do we all have to work an extra day for people in other countries when there's people in this country that need so much\n[noise] you know Brian\nWe fence thirty three thousand dollars a year per unaccompanied alien child who's in that country there's Thirteen thousand unaccompanied children ha chest coffee right now that money could be going towards Pell Grants that money can be going toward inner city schools that money can be going towards\nThat advocate [laughter] show many things in our country and closing loopholes doesn't cost a diner taxpayer dollars\nIt's frustrating I Know for you especially when when people don't understand the issue and they make it personal and they're trying to go up in the polls when you're just trying to solve a problem Katie Waldman thanks so much thanks for having me on you got one eight six six for all

that we're sending a message to the rest of\nThe world that authoritarian tactics like this that you can just Orwellian makeup facts and that you can do and that sort of thing sends a message to people like the leaders in Saudi Arabia that it's okay to take us rats or a kill them just member um\nA kill them this member on and then spent two weeks trying to come up with a kind of ... or\n... your former spokesperson for Bill Clinton are still outrage that Donald Trump exists let alone is president says uh the message if we go easy on Saudi Arabia is just that he's not wrong\nBut I think by taking your time the president's not wrong but Congress probably won't David nature shortly on what the Congress should be doing and was there indeed a pattern of brash and is whether things in the presidential daily brief and they should have indicated that the Saudis were looking to do this\nChocolate W.

I just can't get over how Florida is still a dead heat with this with this race\nAs well for those of you who are sick of taxes and efficient running government he's your answer\nIt's only the only you know what you believe maybe it'll play out in this debate\nThey're going to debate on Sunday and let's see if we're on to say at this cannot out China him here maybe doesn't deserve to be a governor because he has not been it has been very visible and I know he's very competent military background at very impactful congressman\nHe's headstrong he is he has a a they don't kind of a rapid fire temper uh and he doesn't have anybody around him to to just say hey wait a minute\nHey wait a minute that's not such a good idea [noise] I you know we don't know how this happened uh my own reporting has been to the deputy chief as intelligence service\nI'm at a loss or even a has a been instrumental in forming a little while I was told was a tiger team to conduct the covert special operations last month we learned about this and other reporting is that he is the person the Saudis are kind of a dentist flying as\nThe uh the fall guy basically the designated a corporate [noise] um he he worked closely with a with the crown prince we know that I'm about half of the people who the trick say came into end is assemble at the time of this killing\nWere members of NBS as personal security detail so he's going to have to speak to the issue of his own culpability the idea of length just laying it off on well my deputy did this I don't think that's gonna wash\nWell I'm I Know it's not going to wash with Republicans and Democrats in the house listen to what Lindsey Graham told us\nHow do I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS the de facto leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nSo go\nAnd we all heard we all heard that when Lindsey said those words on Fox and and they went viral in the world I have ... friends who called me said\nArab is listening to what Lindsey Graham said and we didn't we [laughter] we hear him saying you know the the ... there must be accountability uh I I think you're right that in the house and Senate um\nUh I I think you're right that in the house and Senate um that people are angry about this I think President Trump understands that there there's a lot of anger out there [noise]\nUh but but again it's it's it's not that this was our our gut the Washington Post it would it's that he was living here as a as a resident and as such was entitled to certain protections\nAnd uh we need to take that seriously and get to the bottom of what happened what was the breakdown why didn't we know more as as he is he walked toward that conflict or from which he would never merge why don't we know more\nAnd you in your column today go over some of the questions you want answered for example did you know you want to know if our intelligence agencies knew that he was being targeted pursued like this new that they could so he was actually in danger like he was you up some stations do you\n[noise] well I Do ah the ... there are two possibilities one is that we knew and people didn't act in a timely way of what they know and that really bothers me but the second is equally worrying and and that is that we just don't have visibility into Saudi Arabia here's this guy\nWas how president loves them and then the president's son in law loves them but we don't know much about how he's operating so we we don't have that visibility that's got to be fixed that that's just not that's not a good situation\nFor us to to walk blind and the ... it was this disastrous as a so I think this is what the congressional oversight committees were were were created for small it's just like this they should they should it's it's a very secret\nI wouldn't expect to hire anybody else in the media would hear about it but I think they should review everything that was produced is and how [noise] take the psychological profile of NBS which\nCertainly is a CIA responsibility\nBut you know it should be reviewed that that would that was a straight up what was the reaction of of people in the White House when they when they were told us what they cautioned this is a volatile personality I could go down the list of Brian of all the questions I think should be\nShould be asked again this should be asked in private and asked in a bipartisan way but this is one where we got to get it right\nYeah I don't don't people the king is not enjoy it's the prince and you say that if the prince who's going to be removed NBS who's going to be removed you say in your last point your column\nThat they are that the people are rallying around prince ... bin ... the last remaining son of the founding king or a king Saud so he and do you think they might actually be a change in leadership because it is\nI think it's way too early to say that I I just think that that our intelligence agencies should be should be doing due diligence to see what's what's going on [noise]\nUm ... this is a moment where in truth it is king Solomon not MPs who's running the show he has in under the Saudis system absolute power\nAnd he can make decisions as he sees fit and if he decides that the kingdom its future are in jeopardy or with the current leadership under him he's going to act I mean the one thing I've seen of the studies over many many years watching them\nIs that they know how to play the politics of survival\nAnd you know sometimes I make pretty cold blooded decisions so um you know ... some of the person to focus on prince are met I had missed it there are other uh surviving sons of through them including some on [laughter]\nBut but prince I'm at is the one who um call the Saturdays I've been talking to us two weeks or you know he's a person we think represents the values the kingdom on some of those that don't get me wrong abroad is not a big movement ... are being very careful\nThere were just watching waited David but they're waiting for us\nThat's interesting and we're waiting for them to do their own investigation even though we probably have all the answers already\nWe have a lot of answers but they need they as they need on it you know for it to go forward as a country that's going to work they need to own it\nDavid if you put thought into that type of thing that would actually a sweat the type of thing they come out of this investigation is actually a ... wage Democrats and Republicans in the house in Congress\nSo I I think this is a rare moment you know we've had these very partisan into intelligence ... and the house of Russia\nYou know let's just put that aside for the moment and let's say agree that we have we have a big national interests are efforts to challenge Iran which I think are good depend on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's strict so we we we've got to get it right and I think Democrats and Republicans are are going to agree on that so\nThat that writes starting point is to have a solid foundation of intelligence about about the place that people and the policies and everybody I think can agree on that and I ... I Hope I Hope the White House would support it\nOn that and I hope I hope the White House which supportive so yeah we agree with this this is the right the starting point you know the Saudis have to their investigation but this one we have to do us a not a partisan issue shouldn't be a partisan issue\nBy Leslie I think the listeners need to know how well this administration has been working with Saudi Arabia to achieve mutual goals unlike the previous administration there rolling\nSo we're helping them with who the rebels supported by Iran where the Saudis are helping us to help bring around to the table by hurting their economy the best they can and the end result would be starving Hezbollah Hamas\nUh and and maybe settling things down in Syria and the Israelis and Saudis are working together under the wire like they never have before so there is a lot at stake here by misstated anything\nNo use everything you said is correct or we have a lot of interests in common with with Saudi Arabia and as you says so these are beginning to help us see a world where Israel is part of the region the ... lives and that's really important [noise]\nBut this one has to be solved all those good things are going to begin to crumble your\nData that's why we need to take this seriously and that's why we have to read your columns because your contacts are as good as anybody in America overseas in in the middle east because we've had so much conflict over there in the past David thanks so much ... class I should say\nHe got a best selling author to a lot of his books become movies one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine when we come back we're going to finish up your calls were thrilled to be the beautiful studios of WAMC J.

huge whether it's ... it's all weekend WSBIU USB radio em I'm scotch late last Monday proclaimed this morning news tropical candidate for governor Brian campfire\nSpecial gas going to get a ... a huge turnout you'd actually early voting locations opening round metro Atlanta next week the big questions about the new deal to develop a downside to land a golf course city council ways in and how long the cool ... could last ... five day forecast fungal triple the fabric actually six minutes Monday morning ...\nSo they took basically a trillion dollars that had been used globally for the last fifty years where the Saudis had been funding Muslim Brotherhood operations around the planet the last six months they put a stop to that part of the leader of that was allowed in will lead\nWho owns a center at Georgetown has owned a uh a center at Harvard et cetera which has been radicalized Muslims in the west or one of the close friends that will lead is ...\n... came to America a year ago there's no doubt that the princes folks want it to bring to show the end for interrogation and another thing so odds are that went sour odds are like many other dictatorships on my only knows the Syrian one pretty well\nThey're pretty ruthless thugs and they may have just gone south but the bottom line is is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American\nVery anti Israel the Saudis shifted than the last six months decided to become more pro Israel isn't real reforms it's more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million was starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and they probably want it to contain him\nWell that and the and that would make sense for the New York times had a piece I just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post said it was\nConservatives that we're conducting a whisper campaign because I looked at the New York times piece and they said you know ... friends were even saying that\nWhenever they would talk with him he very much expressed a anti western sentiments and he was a very much into political Islam and he was very much more extreme than some of what was being promoted in the charm offensive by the Saudi crown prince and you just touched on on doctors Yasser you just touched on\nA one of the other point I was going to ask you is whether or not that charm offensive\nAnd and all of this reform that we hear being discussed with the Saudi royal family and with Saudi leadership and policy if it was real reform or if it was more just sort of um a way to to survive politically and you answered that for me\nYeah I mean NBS is no more we'll reformers than to show that he is according to the Washington Post contrary to what the Washington Post said two months ago ... was writing about how the caliphate is real the Muslim Brotherhood should be a given time to evolve and the bottom line it's\nA majority of credit approach to the ... if you will um that's not a liberal democracy and I have to tell you I did my five cats so that'll air this weekend on the show gave a reform this is the name of it and I basically talk about how much this service and how much it breaks my heart\nThat they are lying I think a gentleman who yes we should speak out our allies should not be taking a abusing or violating human rights of people that are American residents or alone and I said what the Saudis should do they really want to ...\nIn ... alone and I said what the Saudis should do they really wants to ... for what they did to this man released rape better we relieve release ... the attorney that has been in jail for defending raped but we we have called for the release of tons of prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia or secularists\nWho are Christians who are other minorities that have been abused and nobody cared until somebody who was in the inner circles of the Islamic lobby in Washington a got assassinated\nAnd now all of a sudden they care what the Yemeni who were being massacred by the Saudis now all of a sudden the elite in Washington care about the human rights abuses of the Saudis went for eight years we couldn't get Obama dimension once the name of a dissident in Saudi Arabia that we've been working to help\nSo this is just ... I mean the reality is is that\nWe should change the way we're approaching hold them accountable we should not end arms deals but actually start to hold them accountable and the reason we shouldn't and the arms deal is that the balance against the Iranians there's nothing more\nBackslapping that's happening now than between the minister of foreign affairs in Syria in Iran and turkey that are cheering on uh the the decrease in the civility between the American and Saudi relationship\nYes and and and that would explain why all of a sudden they as you mentioned how that nobody really said anything about the president's silence the previous presidents silence and all of these incidents and\nUh and individuals that you name too are wrongly imprisoned or they haven't really said anything about them the or the the previous administration silence on that\nUm but ... and ... those are all the same people that were attacked\nEveryone else that wanted to end that safe to deal with Iran they seem to the apologies for Iran and I see them seizing in exploiting the situation as a way to try to position I ran a little bit better do you see the same\nAbsolutely and that's the whole thing if you look at the the Ben Rhodes uh uh uh you know\nFriends are what are they doing they're trying to find any way possible to resurrect than Obama legacy that wasn't about\nFeeding a terrorist state Iran that was feeding a genocide in Syria and elsewhere to sort of resurrect stumped type of semblance of of rationality wish there wasn't any\nDid the Obama carry approach and now if you see secretary Pompeo trying to rebuild the relationship with the Saudis and tell them what's going to come if they show a picture of him smiling and all of a sudden that becomes a bizarre a photo op when in fact Carey was smiling with\nWith dictators tyrants in Iran and to run and Egypt and elsewhere and nobody can say anything about that and it's just that in the yard to double standard I have to tell you\nIt breaks my heart as an American to see our values trampled on in the name of sort of revisionist history because all they're worried about the Democratic party's legacy under Obama rather than actually the real value as an end here you have a Washington Post editorial board putting out an op ed\nThings that we are trying to destroy a man's history and I said I might podcast if I was to disappear tomorrow\nI Would hope that my critics would continue to be critical of me because it's dishonest to all of a sudden become\nLie and I think that if somebody and lie about them after they die when in fact you're just honoring their entire service and this guy's writings was anti Israel anti western he was not part of the secular liberal democratic movement of the middle east is just the lie\nAnnounce last question for you Dr das are and we're talking to doctors any jazz or here on them where we appreciate your time\nSo I mean obviously we ... we can't have allies or or or anyone with and we are associated behaving like that we don't want them to behave in a way where they're killing people in broad daylight and they really don't seem to worry about the repercussions of it\nHow should the administration handled this with Saudi Arabia so as to not destabilize that relationship and then give Iran a leg up in ... and and and further empower them\nI think we do a little more than we did for example the Russians when they use the chemical weapon and assassinated individual in the u._k. we basically tell them number one we put sanctions against some other wealthiest individuals in Saudi Arabia so that we have them pay a price where it hurts which isn't the oil industry\nNumber two we demand that they're released prisoners that we know we've been asking for their release Canada just had a conflagration with\nTheir foreign minister and the Saudis where they ask for rape better we will lead ... release\nThat you know what if you guys really didn't mean to do this then released these other prisoners so that you can at least show that you're heading towards some liberalization\nAnd third I think we hold them accountable with transparency into the future about not only human rights but about thing you know what we're going to stop doing the operations in Yemen are there are some American planes being used there I think we sell them that's enough stopped doing that we're not going to tolerate that anymore and that would be the third part of it\nRight now you know doctors any jazz are always such a pleasure to talk with you I appreciate your expertise on this end for bringing some ... and bringing some\nAppreciate your expertise on this end up for bringing some ... and bringing a some perspective and a eliminating this issue thanks so

Blue Ridge WMA was cut in half turn back to just national forest [noise] okay what all that and say at the past two weeks I hiked\nUh ... creek and Joe ... creeks\nWatershed areas the old clothes oh wait a Springer mile oh boy\nAnd they are the hog population and those critics have completely devastated that area and I'm Wondering why this stay on the beat at all as toddle out individual trap or to go in there and set\nA sub topic hog traps the Prado Monday This Charles everyone knows you know there are direct other invasive species and they're just in direct competition with a beer bearing the turkey and I'm Wondering how is this going to ever be a drug test\nOkay who wants to jump in there I can I can do a whole Charlie tackled that well you know we do a lotta trapping ourselves and we have a we moved to the uh all the new whole center trapping but it's we've got\nA quite a few of the younger pro more buster corral traps are that are that are a lot more effective than the old style traps um we have certainly entertain the idea of of allowing a some members of the public bop bop permit and uh I think we have flexibility to do that I'm\nWithin ... on a permitted basis in a case by case basis um with ... with that area being on the national forest that's going to be a a trickier prospect and that would have to be something that you would work for the forest service to do ah we are a lot more limited in our\nUh our management activities on the national forest even in the W. amazing the national forest than we are saying on a state owned or state police WMA\nSo um there's just the forest service has a lot more rules that they are subject to that uh that we wouldn't have to deal with and uh otherwise so I'm ...\nYou know we've we've got a ... problem all over the state and um it's it's a a really tough nut to crack and we are we're making progress but uh but it's slow progress\nOkay you've got some input I Would say that there are several small tracts of private land in that area and several of those homeowners to actively try to trap and pursue and have hundreds and\nTo help the situation but that being far service the state really can't do much about it okay that far service keeps popping up here in this question that yes well\nGlenn I gotta tell you I I'm not surprised that you're seeing so much sign [noise] um yeah it's\nTerrible back there I mean I I quit hub for all the mountain areas because they're smoked held us more ... than there are there and I moved out the layer and move back to my old stomping grounds over there last week and a ... or ... that I Do here or there\nWithout some kind of a curtailed ... hogs run rampant yes and I was\nWondering you know jeers you're saying this about the ... a few minutes ago about them being a either forget the trauma knowledge that you used to it was either they were single or\nResident transient yeah what's with that with that\nSame theory applies to the hogs\nNo hogs are ah we considered hogs to be generally nomadic um they do establish a home rains but um you know it's it they move with the food source um so uh generally females traveling Sanders with what they're all ...\nSo uh generally females travel in sound waves with what their offspring and they're all springs offspring a Boris tend to be a little bit more loan or you know when they're younger they roam the south so um they're just uh they're they're difficult to deal with\nAnd you know you mentioned bears you know you get to ... a year and I encourage you to use them [laughter] that's right\nWe've got that we've got an awful lot of their Glenn I appreciate the call sir thank you all have to get by you bet there we go let me do that right there okay after manage this forty five after the our uh [noise]\nIs there any connection to the sighting of a coyote while you're deer hunting today or through the season and the sighting of hogs in the area that you pull the trigger on either one [noise]\nUh and you know how they affect you are you you're you're sitting under their stance mhm you're sitting in ... oh my goodness there's a hog yup there's two or three yeah let's say there's a whole sound right in front of you right oh yeah there's a there's a mama and six or eight okay what do you start shooting\nI say no I say if you got the ability to do so you make a mental note of where that is you come

stuff that we're finally ... banging the drum other social\nMedia less a lot of Facebook Live going to do a weekly live broadcast maybe a couple of times a week there's a lot of great people that have tuned in and said man the stuff's really helping us you guys are making the impact with us You're showing us the true\nWay the markets work the lives of Wall Street which we always talk about it and most embarrassed understand some folks you're smart enough to imagine stuff direct your own money we believe that when the market goes down that's not a bad day diversification does it mean that you're safe\nAnd the trend is it always your friend and those are the things that Wall Street teachers the masses and we're here to break that down show you the real Wall Street show you how institutions approached the markets and more importantly how you could profit regardless of what's happening exactly\nAnd you know what you have one of the big things right now is a lot of people are concerned you know this is reminding me of the market in two thousand seven I met a bunch of people in those seven and people are like the market's up\nStarting to get shaky I don't know one is going to collapse I don't know one I don't know what to do should I go to cash and I buy more and really the ultimately comes down to we got to preserve what we have and a lot of people have had a good run since March of two thousand on the market it's gone up and now all of a sudden everything's ... around and people are freaking out a little bit let's talk about how they can protect how they can preserve the capital that they\nHave eerily similar to two thousand seven record high starting to get these big moves daily big entered a movement in the S. and P. and the Dow in the Russell I'm it's just a repeat of the film and here's the thing\nIn two thousand eight many people lost a lot of money about forty or fifty percent of money in the four one K. and manage diaries was transferred out of those accounts that wasn't lost\nJust went to somebody else some understood how to make money regardless of direction so there's a lot of listeners right now and if you're driving down the road right now and you're hearing us in two thousand and if your phone got hurt badly because of the collapse\nHere we are ten years later\nWe're expecting other collapsed and many of you probably most of you haven't done anything different you're still not for one\nMany of you probably most of you haven't done anything different you're still not four one K. you still got all that money at risk think about that and I'm going to be blunt shame on you this is your wealth\nAnd you are not changing anything in this things you can do to protect and preserve capital this things you can do even in a four one K. or an IRA\nTo not lose in a collapse of the market at least protect against loss and there's other things you do to profit from it so the focus is is that if we're not managing risk if we don't have a position of place that says if this thing collapses I'm going to walk away unscathed there is virtually unscathed with a small pre defined loss\nWhat's your plan because we're expecting that were calling for the markets overvalued and when it falls capital preservation got to be so important here's the problem if you wait until it happens it's too late well exactly\nAnd that's it a lot of people and two thousand seven they didn't know what to do they got paralyzed two thousand eight they got crushed they sat there and watch this thing go down and all of a sudden two thousand nine rolls around they go now what what exactly what you said they missed it\nThey don't understand that they need to be they need to be proactive rather than reactive and capital preservation doesn't mean you get out of mutual fund that go to cast not necessarily cash is probably safer but let me tell you something I met a man of\nTwo thousand when the market fell forty percent and he said well I was okay I went to cash right before the collapse well\nThe currency that he was holding the u._s. dollar because when people tell me they go to cash only means the U.S dollar they're not going to hold the off the dollar or the euro and should they should in some cases they should this guy said I cashed out right before the collapse of two thousand and I was fine I said you weren't fun\nI said you realize that the value of your dollar fell thirty seven percent between the collapse of two thousand and the bottom of two thousand two in the financial markets so you had the same amount of money but it had thirty seven percent less buying power that's a real number of folks in other words cash isn't always the safest haven\nIf he'd have gone to the Australian doll he would have grown as account exponentially because that currency at that time was increasing and value let me tell you something folks\nCapital preservation means there's things that you can use in the market to ensure that you don't lose or to ensure that when you do lose its small and pre defined there's things that we can use like exchange traded funds that are inverse funds so in the market goes down our account grows it it's inverse to the actual performance of the market\nThere's options options are insurance people couldn't protecting hedge\nTheir positions in their portfolios with options if they understand it and the beautiful thing is that a lot of times you're basically ensuring for pennies on the dollar and if the market collapse as you walk away with a very small pre defined loss think about that\nThere's so many things that people can do here's the problem and you're four one K. you believe these two things one that up as good an down as bad in to that if it goes down it's going to have to ride it out because you'll never get out of that four one K. God Forbid you move that money into something else which is a travesty because\nWall Street has you convinced that you shouldn't move that money and you'll just write it down your Turner winner into a loser we see it all the time you can't afford that folks here's the reality of the mass of not protecting your ... your money\nIf you take these big losses like in two thousand two thousand they expect a big loss coming forward\nYou'll run out of ... years before you hit your financial goals in other words you're a lot of time to grow your account because those big losses are draining your account and now you're trying to get back to break even do you realize that a lot of people took them almost eight nine years to get back to break even know what the collapse of two thousand eight and here they are now at break even or there were they were\nThe problem is there nine years older and here's the other problem\nThe markets gearing up for class again think about that is the definition of insanity that's the masses we need to learn the skills of capital preservation we need to understand the things we can do to keep ourselves safe no matter what the market does we can profit no matter what the direction but at least we have to protect because\nIf we wait to their house burned down\nBefore we ensure its\nIt's too late now the insurance is going to cost the replacement value of your house think about that\nSo we have to be proactive and have a plan in place where if the market collapse as\nWe're not going to take the brunt of the loss and we can still take the upside of it goes in the direction we think\nThat truly understanding market movement in price and the problem is with the masses Adam they're convinced that up is good and down is bad and they don't want to touch their money because if they touch it they say I don't know what to do that there's a lot of simple things that you can learn process these that can help to protect and preserve and most importantly keep you on track for those financial goals long\nTerm well Jim you said all the time it's a it's a skill learning how to handle your money regardless of market direction is a skill understanding how to protect the money is a skill and if someone just is if someone looks in the mirror and as honest with themselves do I know how to handle my money and the average person the answer's no they put their money outside arm's reach\nBecause if it's in that for one campus in that Iran they can't spend it well\nKnow I Love about the academy on like trade academy our sponsor they teach average people how to protect their wealth in other words if you're in a four one K. if you've got money and IRA there's things in the market instruments you can use asset classes to protect and preserve and still give you the opportunity hit your goals and the problem is is that many people don't realize how to do it\nThe academy has put together a plan in place and helped a lot of people like you and I asked them to be more successful\nAnd then place in helped a lot of people like you and I asked them\nTo be more successful and preserve capital because it becomes that important especially when we're expecting a big move down exactly in capital preservation is paramount and market like this and\nPeople out there they're concerned about the correction they're concerned about the sell off and you've got to understand the protector out four one K. and I are re online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears they have a class specifically on Capitol preservation now you

what it is not as difficult as Wall Street wants you to think and many of the most successful traders in the rest of that I Know have never had any background that they just learn the skill from the ground up\nExactly in right now we're taking the time to check in with our sponsor online training academy contacted headed down to the school right there talking to education coach Chris Charles Chris what's going on buddy\nHey buddy man listen it's great to be back with you guys as has been one of the highlights of my week for a while now\nWell we appreciate taking the time I Know you've got a lot going on at the campus what's going on down and online training academy I mean what's one of the key things that are happening these this week\nWell fact of the matter is we've got a bunch of classes that are going on and and people are exploring you know multiple markets and if I could add them I'd like to take a second just kind of clear up a misconception that I've seen you know a lot of folks orange dissipating that the only people that can participate in the market are the folks that have an abundance of time and in fact of the matter is\nThat we're getting a lot of folks coming into the school and and they're living their lives you know they've got jobs lives obligations responsibility that got PTA and soccer practice and gymnastics lessons and horseback riding lessons and they're trying to find a way that they can make ends meet and do all these things at the same time and what we're finding is people are coming to the school with a main focus on trying to generate some additional strings of income\nHey Chris champ good to hear from you\nWhat what's exciting is is that when a lot of people finally realized that the markets can provide them that you may income\nThen they start to think well stocks of the way to go and you know focus on stocks cause in the United states as you well know that's the main asset class of people use with trading and investing what do you see when people start to realize that there's other things they could trade and what's really the eye opening thing for a lot of students when they do realize that\nWell you know a lot of people do come into the school and then maybe they have a basic understanding of stock\nMaybe they'd never traded before but they realize that there's you know there's an opportunity in the market and they assume that the stocks you know stock market's gonna be the answer for them and\nUsually it's not and the reason is because so many people are coming in here exploring how do I take a little bit of money and and get a decent return and unfortunately stocks not going to give people that opportunity it literally as a marketer requires the most amount of money it's open the fewest hours with the least opportunity\nAnd with folks come in here they start to explore these other markets like the currency market you know we've got a currency class it's coming up in the ... market or they start to explore things like\nThe futures market and their goal is to take a little bit of money and get a decent return but you know as as you talk about all the time champ as a matter of following the rules and being systematic so we can take people through a process of\nGetting started using alternative markets that a lotta times are not familiar with\nAnd we can start to explore these options that give them an opportunity to generate these additional streams again most of the students here the school or not folks that are trying to figure out a way they can quit their job and live off the market and while that does happen\nThat's not typically the goal for every person that I mean they're trying to figure out how can I in court with this into my life and we can do so with a plan in place that allows them to take some money and use it in these alternative markets to generate the income that they're looking for the additional stream of income\nIt's a it's a game changer for a lot of folks jam\nAnd you talk about it a lot of those parents ... and those futures accounts that people open up they literally can start with a thousand bucks a few hundred bucks so they really don't have to have a high bar of capital to get started and the problem with stocks as we all know is there very capital intensive I'm going to buy\nThe problem with stocks as we all know is there very capital intensive I'm going to buy shares of stock and got to utilize a lot of capital by that year when I use futures encourage these it allows me to be able to have less in the positions to get a good ... a good return what do you see when people start to understand the futures market in the ... what does that do for them personally because\nThey didn't come into the academy knowing that those are alternative asset class that they could use what's the biggest thing people get surprised when they see the futures are currencies are options as an alternative\nOr you know champ I actually think that the misconception about the market in the stock stock market being their answers scares a lot of people away from it because they used when they do have to have so much money\nAnd the average person that's coming in here than sitting in this giant you know on this giant pile of money and they're they're wanting to play with it they're trying to figure out how can they take a little bit of money out of their budget each month and put it to work\nAnd one of the big eye opening things for students in this environment is when they realized that they can use for action futures and the power of leverage to put a small amount of money at work in a market and still get a great return back of the matter is for many people they come in here at such hitting one thing and when they start to explore the process they realized there's more opportunity many could ever possibly imagine\nThat's awesome Chris and we thank you for checking in with us in ... thank you to the sponsor of on trade academy we really appreciate you guys what's amazing what Chris reference was\nIn this country the U.S it's all about stocks I mean when you listen to the news they talk about the ... and the NASDAQ and the S. and P. and those are all stock indices yet we look at the global market the size of the sheer scope\nThe currency market is immense the futures market is a mess and a lot of people don't even realize is up as soon as those markets and what we love to do is to share with them when I've traveled the world for online jihad academy I've been in Dubai in Mumbai in Jakarta we don't talk about stocks because for the most part\nThey're not used in those areas only in the United states do we focus on stocks there's so many different ways you can play to create an income and the markets and what's great is that the academy allows us to start to explore some of those different opportunities\nExactly you know trading for income is paramount for somebody who's in the financial markets\nIs a game changer whether you've got to streams income at the house or maybe one stream income if you pick up a third or you pick up a second it can separate you can help you and
