been terrific can can say yes Marsha Blackburn dot com from ... to find your closest polling place\nAll right thanks so much and I hope the people Tennessee understand how important the seat as it is pivotal you can't have a good night if if Marsha Blackburn doesn't win Tennessee that's how important it is an eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number one to talk more about instead of incivility Abul left\nThey care about only Donald Trump Russia collusion with all the evidence that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nRussian lies disseminated them to you we the people in the lead up to the election that those Russian paid for lives of Hillary were used as the bulk of information presented to you know four or five of court judges\nThat the that predicated the entire Russia which ... which was the pony bought and paid dot CA of Hillary Clinton from with Russian lives\nThey only care they only care if it's Trump Russia\nThey don't care about anything else you know if you look at the cabinet situation oh Kevin all we need an FBI investigation these allegations are horrible\nNone of those people that demanded an FBI investigation into nearly forty year old allegations some of them so far fetched from reality they never once demanded an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nAnd this is in within the last year with evidence with tapes with text messages with doctors reports uh nobody that was demanding the cabinet treatment for Kavanaugh ever demanded of for Ellison\nOr the recent report over the weekend about Cory Spartacus\nOr the recent report over the weekend about Cory Spartacus Booker\nOr kept Claire McCaskill's husband and allegations made against him a when he was married to his first wife I mean if that's the standard none of them asked for the Clintons to have this Bill Clinton to go through the same thing the judge Kavanaugh went through they praise him to the hilt\nAnd we've got the same thing here I could literally spend an hour on this program playing the incendiary violence statements of those on the left that the media routinely ignored\nAnd the hatred all ... the minute by minute second by second hour after hour day after day Trump hatred twenty four seven which is now that it's a it's it's a psychotic pathology on the part of those in the news media\nThey didn't care about that either I'm very clear you know I don't think the cabinet standard should be applied in in the case I Believe in due process still for even Allison even for Spartacus work insisted on this program\nThere's Russia collusion Hillary Clinton paying for Russian lies we need to know about it and in this case people making threats of violence against the president or against any Democrat\nOh I'm the one that said uh investigated when bill when Brock Obama was president and I'm the one that electorate how we need to keep our presidents safe and secure\nWhen Steve ... shot on that ball field and we found out it was a Bernie Sanders supporter I said I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders for what one of his supporters ... does that is not Bernie Sanders fault\nAnd you don't see the same recognition by anybody on the left is won a hyper politicize anything they can any minute of any data to bludgeon Donald Trump politically anyway Danielle McLaughlin is with us as well as Jonathan\nGillum welcome both of you to the program and uh how many more weeks we're going to have another little baby Danielle McLaughlin\nHow many we um Hi guys you know I thought that two weeks or so is that they have now from\nThat uh you know cats for a little while thank\nYou for any truth to the room where you're going to NATO to name your baby a Gillum Hannity\n[laughter] wasn't going to get a show when I get one handed a\nLimit on how they looked at my work well revelations [laughter] I've looked at it the real hate has\nBeen coming from the left it's been ignored by most in the media has been very little coverage I forgot to mention the severed head of a president they didn't seem to outraged about that most people\nAnd now there again there's a selective moral outrage be about Russia\nOr being about sexual assault or allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric or action so I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroyed the president bomb the White House and I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\n... you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think there is no excuse for it you know I listen to every cut that you just played and people are hard at work or doing the same thing that we had the ... when I asked about the extent to which the president has also made threats and it talked about violence\nAnd out of the last few months and then ... and what you do is you give me the the predictable liberal talking point I asked you very very specifically\nAbout all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we've now in the last month watch woman after woman after woman being run out of a restaurant by left wing mobs and the same left wing media didn't have anything to say\nAnd every one of those young rich as a matter of fact the new CNN wouldn't let their anchors use the word mob\nWell because that central planning for\nThe whole point it's a reality you don't win you know you don't have those those are mobs going after those people I Do I'm not going to defend it I don't think it's right is it a mile to be able to eat and find out looks like a month to me\nI looked at I think the presents unique talent police officers in Long Island ... states when they get in the back and a paddy wagon [laughter] you know calling the media the enemy of the people because you and I both know that for the most part journalists from across the political spectrum I just people trying to you know\nWe don't respect I don't see that I see a media that has been corrupted and complicit in advancing conspiracy theories lies and pure hatred of all things Donald Trump what do you see Jonathan\nWill tell you one thing I I Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs and that's a big difference in a mob\nMob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do is sort of thing but in this case these people have organization they don't just show up somewhere a ... once these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um\n[noise] uh it is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though I I Want Sean I think everybody needs or work when things are all that rhetoric that you've\nUh all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about who to target and when I look at the at at the response which you had which I've seen from other people a win bronco bomber was an office\nUm in in the case of the shooter that shot to\nUm the Mr squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders\nBut what you see here and I find this so odd is that uh these devices have been put out there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to uh to carry out a plan covertly to put these things in place all at once\nAnd none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized\nAnd now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever put these out there but the organization of their rhetoric is so disgusting movie the low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and ask 'em was this rhetoric prepared\nIt's a it's a very alarming thing\nWas that I got Daniel [noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the president's today I think that they're playing the light across the entire political state\nTrend and what I think regular people like me the ...\nI go out and the well I deal with people who don't necessarily agree with\nI get my job's Don Johnson I I ... hot and somehow I managed to get around the world get around this country to get around my city without inflaming tensions are the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that they cannot get their job is done without that kind of rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it is this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before and what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news\nA lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos has an agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton ruined throughout his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit\nAnd it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels\nAnd you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example but we've added Obama when no one else would we've invented the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving an opinion as part of what we do we're like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now\nAnd one thing that can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that when when something like this happens\nAnd all these Democrats are having these devices delivered to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the the uh down below where they have the

way that the the house seats are\nDistributed you have twenty five house seats in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen so uh you know Democrats have to make some serious games if they want to take the house but I think you're right about the Senate and very few people\nThink that the Senate is is likely to go Democrat unless there's some kind of a ... you know this blue wave that people have talked about forever suddenly re appears ah we we have a really terrific elections analyst at the Weekly Standard named David ... who's created this a Senate election model and he gives Republican now\nAn eighty percent chance of keeping the Senate and walks through that in great detail on on our website at the standard dot com so he's he's done that the the hard work on this stuff and that is good who did that there's a pretty strong chance that Republicans keeps sending\nA very interesting uh uh you know it's just amazing over oh Steve with all the bad books written on Trump and the chaos that was early he still about four between forty four I'm forty seven percent approval that's right where a Brock Obama Bill Clinton wearing their first the first two years\n\nTo mainstream media polls this past weekend Trump with basically is highest of approval rating yet now the country's in incredibly divided on people who like the guy tend to love the guy and the people who don't like the guy and the guy\nUm but the fact that he's got approval ratings that or you know five six points higher than they were just a couple of months ago I think is one of the reasons that Republicans are looking a little bit better adding into this election a couple of weeks\nHere Steve Hayes I was talking to you Steve thanks so much anytime Brian thanks\nYou got it was still tracking

to buy a house and metro Atlanta ... don't tell anyone that might get me in trouble because people in our industry housing that is they don't like the truth the truth is I had a seller call me in Roswell, Georgia this week which caused me to spend about Ninety minutes running data hurting it to a specific price range and I'd call that the bread and butter\nOf the housing prices in Roswell\nSo that the bread and butter of the housing prices in Roswell almost seven months worth of inventory on the market right now that's not good that indicates by the model of what we call housing absorption rate\nThat we'll see depreciation in that segment of the market of two to five percent over the next six months that's that's kind of alarming\nWe're seeing this in other parts of the market first Gainesville then coming now we're starting to see slow sales in other parts of the market is it a bad market no we're simply adjusting for an eleven to Fifteen Percent downward pressure on pricing because of rising interest rates on top of that people bought homes this spring and early summer\nIn anticipation of rising interest rates in the number of buyers on the market now for that reason are much lower so what do you do if you need to sell a home you don't do what everybody else is doing rent it through the winter\nKeep it for a while and wait till the spring makes everything better no

he should not be beating the the Tom Tom's of of anger and animosity and the more he should be trying to bring us together and he'll us as a people because the polarization that takes as taking place in this country\nOver the last couple of years is really quite antithetical to what this country is which is to bring Americans together\nI really wish I could be more like John Brennan he has been such an embarrassment to intelligence operations at every level since he left office political and his actual resume with me right now for a couple of segments is a Congressman Jason Chaffetz usually you've met John Brennan before I\nYeah I mean he's turned out to be such a a political hack it's it it really is almost sad to see and then when the president does reach out his hand and he does say something to try to unify the country in the wake of the uh you know these terrorist bombing mailings and stuff than the Democrats just sort of slap his hand to hand that way but\nAh John Brennan is not done a good service to to this country and you know\nDemocrats are always take this attitude that the divisiveness and in this country having unified ... when they lose\n[laughter] you know when they when it's all fine but if somehow Republicans when I mean thirty the fifty states came together and said we want Donald Trump to be our president not Hillary Clinton and somehow that was you know his his undoing\nI had lunch with George Papadopoulos this week and I got to hear his side of the story and I'm Amazed where this is going and suddenly this model make sense either my words\nIf ... if his anger and volcanic temper\nUh ditch been on display mysteriously for the last two years or even James Clapper said he's got a little unhinged I'm just wondering if it's because they're getting closer and closer to his would be role in the taking down or the diminishing of a of a president about to take\nPower you know I think about it they they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to be the president the United states\nAnd now you have James call me even going out and say hey vote for the Democrats because they want this that I think it's ... the my words my my approach to it I think they want this investigation shut down because I think Brennan and call me and a few others are in some serious serious or\nFake phony you know I'm comments about while I Wish the president do this or that that wasn't going to appease any of them I think the president was there's been pitch perfect over last forty eight hours and just saying\nLet's come together let's be United this is not a time to be divisive let's tone down their rhetoric those are all things that the Democrats them encourage them to do he did it and then policy and and Schumer tried to swat away his hand\nHe did it and then policy and and Schumer tried to swat a way of saying that I think it was wrong well I think it would be wrong to if the president came out and rip Bernie Sanders ... was shot and and that's why I think this can be an analogy there\nSo Jeff Zucker ... hours later a couple of hours later was president CNN says there's a total complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks in the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand the words matter\nDoes for the show no comprehension of that\nAnd I'll bring it to Marco Rubio's words yes words matter because freedom of speech allows us to air and settle or disagreements and grievances instead of violence the first amendment protects press freedom but it doesn't allow immunity from criticism\nCriticism calling people to violence or not the same he went on to say some already giving it to the temptation to react to the terror attack by either assigning blame\nFor or rationalizing it no sane are well intentioned person no matter how poor person would do this it's either the work of a demented person or terror aimed at further dividing America you wrote the deep state he's trying to elevate the conversation\nYeah I think Marco Rubio is is so good at it or try to get that down into a two way to both for about a I think he's saying it really well we have vigorous debate that's who we are in this country you can you can speak truth to power you can be critical of some of the media you can be critical of your president\nBut that doesn't mean that it justifies violence it you can't get their steps over a line and when people talk about\nThe uh uh you know kicking other people and doing the types of things it's just wrong it's just over the line there ought to be called out and and certainly what we're going through right now\nIs just fundamentally totally wrong talked about um we don't know the perpetrator is we don't know what their motivation is uh we don't know how it's being executed but we all all of us support law enforcement and finding and making sure this\nPerson's breath adjusted by Leslie or less question on

Brennan really attributes of what we're seeing now as a nine separate package would be bombs were devices a Soros Clinton Obama Brennan holder Maxine Waters twice and deniro and now looks like Joe Biden over in Delaware they are ... critics said the president so people like John Brennan Nancy Pelosi or quickly to say the president's to blame\nWith this right now as a Senator John Cornyn of

with a little different voice changed feel free to point on Ninety five and I am seven fifty a couple of you at the hands on his hands on ...\nHey it's Eric bought houses were my radio show is now on three hours every weekday nine to noon right here on W S P\n[noise]\nCutting a tree houses really insensitive that's like killing something and it made me wonder it's friends hold and\n[laughter] oh [laughter] looking back at one way to fix for seven six six I'm Mark listening in Leesburg, Florida hey mark\nHey Brian how you doing good where do you think about all these we have nine separate packages now what do you think the overall aim is it's got to be from the same people\nSure um first of all you can leave your shirt on TALK and you got to make a statement get some of the gods either Robert Graham shirts oh really okay yeah\nI'm I think it's a group of people I think it's multiple people that are doing this um I don't think it's just one person I think they want to make an impact they didn't go after the Democrats and they didn't they didn't target both of them\nBecause they wanted to make an impact so they just went up to Democrats to make you know give Trump a hard time I think it's um it's a group of them not just what mob mentality work in a group like they did with\nCabin on I think that's what the problem is and I think you're going to fight it's not what it's a bunch of all\nLet's see you know mark they got to balance you know that there's some they put this together like we can't even imagine\nLike no show a show runner has ever put together any type of drama on TV they're putting something together I think maybe even within our show we're going to begin to get some clues on this because you're delivering nine shepherd packages in five different states or to all these different locations somebody slipped up\nCould have detonated by accident if if they're right activities if they're right actions were taken on it\nI mean we know a couple of things where if it is true and it's a dummy device who we wouldn't be able to detonate I Wonder what we can learn from it and how much danger postal workers were in UPS drivers were in\nAnybody was in how far did he get now we know it wasn't gonna get close to the Clintons house we know what God did your chores his mailbox we got to Brock Obama's didn't get to his house but got to his location where his mails distributed or John Brennan was actually send to CNN even though he doesn't work there\nAnd he spelled his name Ron Eric Holder Maxine Waters that too and now you have Robert De Niro and Joe Biden and didn't get to actually to their house and I'm Wondering where are those with those people who were handling it if it was a legitimate bomb as it turns out not to be were they in danger and do we have to amend the system again\nYeah I think that uh will again and it remains to be seen if the devices or actually did have a running timer attached to some sort of power source of battery a battery device within the timer uh the clock mechanism is there a power source there\nThat that could have actually triggered these devices good question\nSecondarily if if certain mishandling hum bouncing the devices around them\nMishandling hum bouncing the devices around machines sorting the devices\nWere of a sufficient to you know potentially trigger that can cause a an injury or death or or maybe somebody look if if black powder in it and in a one inch PVC pipe with glass it sorted all about PVC is potential shrapnel as well\nAh the glasses potential shrapnel could you kill somebody could you apply them could you maimed somebody ... you know cause them to lose a hand unarm\n'em because of the the amount of black powder that's all in my mind a possibility of this is a dangerous device even if it couldn't have been triggered by the clock because the the person didn't have the technical\nSkill right to detonate this it's still a very dangerous if Iran I just\nWant to get your mind taking in twisting around just to see what other conclusions you get too so we pulled Marion O'Toole a she's a profile where she was on CBS this morning this is what she would some of her conclusions go on\nI Would be looking at that forensic and as a result um and also the behavior it's a combination of the two so for example the FBI lab will be looking at the functionality on these devices are they intentionally not working or are they not exploding because have some problem I'm\nKind of that's the case if they are intentionally designed not to explode but to create fear and panic\nUm then we can possibly expect to see an escalation and sense another batch of bomb that come out [noise]\nUm this suggests to me that this is someone that really planned this out quite well so we should not assume that mistakes that we see in the posting of the package as our mistake but maybe done purposely\nThere's also an arrogance about 'em out these bombings this is someone who um is creating a great deal of fear and panic in New York and then on the DC area [noise]\nUm and he's enjoying that my sense is that power and control and I'm not the kind of study and getting out to really be in the center of attention now throughout the country is it's probably like a narcotic for him\nSo that can play a part in how the bombs may start to evolve or how this series on attacks may ...\nWow the word of bombs is that your fear was that you worry\nThat that is a concern some of these are folks who are building devices are very often are testing them beforehand I think we saw that with the the Chelsea bomb a more that the guy had been created some other devices was testing them near his house\nA bad happens with some of these guys and so how does he evolved from this does he is he fearful because of this big law enforcement response right you have\nFBI Secret Service New York police department post ... ... postal inspectors um US Capitol police all engaged in this so far and other law enforcement as well um the does that make him fearful and say holy crap I'm going to get caught and he pulls back\nOr does it it power him and hasn't Mary Ellen was saying does it in Boulder habits that the rush he's looking for and say look look at the that the power that I hold you see sometimes this with our son is who are they they are they start a fire and they pulled back to watch the response that excites them\nSo what kind of a fender do we have a you know the next few days may tell us that\nYeah my lines are jammed I wanted to talk for a while but before we go can you let me know what it's like in New York there's New York has got the sense that they can do things themselves and maybe they earned that right that we have a very uh steamed counterintelligence operation at the same time the FBI comes in and they want to run things\nAre they ... the joint terrorism task force or they clashing do you know how they're doing right now\n[laughter] yeah I think we we have some good leadership up there I Know a bill Sweeney the assistant director charged a friend of mine a bright apartment I just saw him uh about ten days ago down to down in Orlando\nRuns counter terrorism for the FBI the J. T. F. John Miller is an FBI alumni I fix those relationships have matured and moved in the right direction\nI don't think ... particularly because these devices are popping up and other places around the country\nNYPD understands if it's terrorism the FBI takes the lead I think that department gets it um and that these relationships are mature enough now that look this is a combination a team effort not a one department effort\nA ... at the FBI as I understand that the FBI has taken the lead on evaluating these devices out at the lab in Quantico\nThis should be a team sport right now we need the team to come together I think these participants get that\nGot a run thanks so much should they run out and go a former\nDeputy director of the FBI or every line is Jim I'm going to try to get to as many as possible one eight six six four or eight seven six six now by the way the series times but Andrew Jackson America New Orleans is out in paperback I Hope to talk to OU if not in St Louis on friday night in Baton Rouge\nThe night in Baton Rouge on Saturday or New Orleans on Sunday you listen to the brain kill me Joe kids Brian kill made [noise]\nIt's Arizona has more entertaining than independent thinker listen and weekdays nine to noon right here on W.

struck chatting time we got a big show come anyway the bottom of the Martha McCown and I think we're going to be going on with ah America's Newsroom on Fox News channel given idea what's on your mind will take some calls and also go over the series of a package bombs or none of which gone off\nFor proven to be a lethal or even actual up but the materials they're the intentions there and the targets are certainly there and they're all famous and you know all of them and they're all Democrats who are critics of President Trump what it means we'll be following but first let's get stores\nNow with the biggest things you need to know who the power of three Brian's big story numbers three\nWere just Thirteen Days away from a very very important election it's at election of monumental\nIs isn't it wouldn't you say monument\nEverybody or so that is interesting the president's talking about a monumental a mid term yes but he was somewhat subdued because what happened during the day but I think very much responsible if you want to know how the house and Senate will go look in Wisconsin look at the governor's race where Walker trails number\nThan best skater so now studying at least nine suspicious packages that were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump the latest was addressed to actor Robert De Niro and found in lower Manhattan this morning\nA night suspicious package was found this morning the last two in Delaware the latest address a vice president Joe Biden and Robert Deniro production companies you just heard I'll bring you the latest [noise] number one\nYeah because he is a mainstream Republican thinker who just as a different way of delivering and I think most of the people those voices you heard right now I understand that Donald Trump is different why they get up every day and I believe this was one of my big three earlier in the week\nWhy everyone gets up everyday and surprised when this president is unconventional is stunning to me\nWhy they want to go back over his rhetoric and blame violence would be attended violence with nine packages being sent two prominent Democrats on Donald Trump\nThat will be is wrong I Believe they're blaming Bernie Sanders for the Bernie Sanders worker they shot and almost killed Steve ... on the baseball field\nThere'll be like blaming Brock Obama for setting the tenure so out of South Carolina shooting took place a take place or the Sandy Hook shooting to take place of the Gabby Giffords shooting to take place I don't think the president's responsible for that\nBut what I Love to see a reset between the media and the president after the midterms yeah before that I'm not too sure to work after the first one didn't\nBut maybe the president after getting his feet and read them for the last two years\nAfter getting the mother investigation over a that lasted two years if that is over and he emerges unscathed which I expect him to maybe he's going to take that time and who would not say yes the New York times Chuck Todd George Stephanopoulos come to the White House three of the two or three of the time\nShe has me or the the White House or a Trump Tower one day\nAnd you say listen when it comes to New York like to see you guys and then he go to Washington me with some different reporters and then you have off the record conversations where people get the air out the main problem with them I don't think anybody could say he's not accessible now I Know is one on one interviews he gives more to Fox but\nBoxers what more fair to him and then the other channels so I don't think that necessarily\nFox is much more fair to him and then the other channels I don't think they necessarily good or bad I think they're more fair\nSo and I know we've got a lot of lying to you what I'm going to do is going on America's Newsroom shortly at which time we'll talk a little bit about what I'm doing tomorrow night where everyone everyone who joined me at St Louis county library so that I'm going to be coming in going right to the stage and we've seen that with mark Cox and we're going to have a great time up you have some tickets there\nAnd you'll get a book with every ticket and I'll be able to sign them personalize them and it's all about taking the listeners in St Louis who keep us\nOr one of the top are chosen the entire area\nThen I'm going to do this thing called go to Louisiana with Andrew Jackson America New Orleans I didn't get a chance to go to the first time\nMotor Baton Rouge on Saturday and on Sunday I'm going to be an Octavia books at one o'clock flying at about five o'clock back in New York about eight o'clock eight nine o'clock\nAnd they're ready for Monday I'm and Monday will be on the five Tuesday I'll be on Martha it's going to be a crazy couple of weeks but have not been able to talk about history and uh about the history book for obvious reasons\nUh we got a series of package bombs nine and total now I Can't even say bomb I Would say a would be bombed devices and I said devices because it's not been proven that any of these packages would've blown up\nTheir looks like there's powder on the inside shards of glass on the inside on the outside it looks like a bomb but for the most part there is no proof that it'll blow up but it almost says the same effect thankfully it didn't because a lot of innocent people would have been hurt and a lot of prominent people would have been hurt if it did\nHowever but it's not going to hurt the president or the former President Bill Clinton or Barack Obama because they've been screened for George Soros he's smart enough to leave his mailbox outside his compact\nSo that got to him there forward in Delaware and never got to Joe Biden but two packages were intended in Los Angeles\nIt was intended for Maxine Waters and in Washington DC in Florida down in Miami southern Florida that was intended older return addresses word for Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Washington Eric Holder the former attorney general has been a big critic of the president might be running against him\nHe also was targeted so the people that block for all these prominent people would have been hurt\nBut we know is the same on blow up the same boat we're up on the inside the same printing or they say it's the same printing that's on the label and then the return addresses all Debbie Wasserman Schultz jumper and his name is not spell correctly they also have\nA mocking stick around it mocks ISIS one to buy a ... at least one has a parity ISIS flag and as the phrasing praising get her done and that is obviously making a fun ah get her done is uh the cable guy\nYeah we're still waiting so the device looks the same\nUh the new a New Yorker NYPD sources\nUh there was no they could not have blown up according to the CNN package because there was no blasting cap there was nothing to ignite it that according to Stephen go man is the fact that nothing blow up shows that it's an amateur thing or their pro\nWho want to just send the message I got a bomb it got close to you it was intended for you intended to Iraq your world\nSo those are the things that we're going to go over the\nISIS flag on it a lot of people saw it and saw Arabic riding on the\nUh so Arabic riding on the battery and I have not seen that any other place on a side note tomorrow we hope to have George Papadopoulos in Studio I had lunch with them on Tuesday he is going to get a chance to testify behind closed doors and talk about the dealing with Mahler what went into it\nAnd how he essentially was set up [noise]\nBoth high profile critics of President Trump want to check with our colleague and friend Bryan kill me if I come from the anchor author of Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans now out in paperback how you doing Brian and the dating you want to hear it on the radio or whatever people\nTalking about well I tell you what for the most part people are a ... for those package bombs on a side no bill we used to have you here you sand used to do the show this whole third hours hurting our relationship but we can still talk in the hall or ...\nThey should this were nine and there are now okay so we're kind of locked out actually competitor I Know I guess\nThough but uh I had lunch by the way with George Papadopoulos on Tuesday he was really looking forward to meeting on Thursday and he's coming in to Fox and friends tomorrow he has a story to tell they could blow the lid off the entire thing and leave it takes out of it but in terms of my calls are saying\nA lot of concern a lot of pointing out that nothing was detonated and there's a lot of people who feel as though when it's all said and done there's sometimes a plot\nOr on the left to make Donald Trump looked like the bad guys who we start talking about Donald Trump's rhetoric and not about the caravan\nAnd not about cabin on and not about the economy so those are something we took about twenty five calls already anticipating coming out with you and Sandra and that's just the pulse of the people but since I've been on and since you've been on as you know we found out about two new packages of both intended for Joe Biden I have yet to talk to anybody and like you I\nJoe Biden I have yet to talk to anybody and like you I talked to Ron ... who have said that these are our bombs but it just worries me then again if they were the most innocent like postal workers in couriers would've been in the line of fire it reminds me of the anthrax situation\nVery much so they mention Papadopoulos seems the number one suspect right originally he was sentenced to fourteen days in jail has served a day at ... as he addressed that yet oh yeah and what what what does that mean what does that say what is what does that indicated about the investigation\n[noise] I think it says everything about the investigation I think it says a lot when with congressman Jordan would Mark Meadows\nWhat Devin Nunes has been doing it pursuing ... been talking about this twenty eight year old was really on ... was targeted possibly by a previous a previous administration because of his links to Israel he was helping Israel with newly discovered oil and setting it up with Greece they did not like that\nThe word is there might be another Pfizer warrant and it was on him and ... yeah and they continue to look at him and then he top submerged pops up in Britain right the critical column against David Cameron and next thing you know people start coming up to them you need to talk to them wanting to have a few\nFinds himself in the middle of all this I'm really looking for that interview tomorrow quickly on your book it's in paperback what more do we learn Jackson\nSince we talked last time Andrew Jackson's ... has been to file for the first time since his death prior to the civil war\nHe is now in the line of fire or what I tried to do is remove Donald Trump who's a fan of Andrew Jackson and see what past presidents thought of him because we do in this thing this war on history\nSo I have a look at what Reagan said Teddy Roosevelt said FDR said with Truman said no to Abraham Lincoln said about the impact of Jackson that battlefield when was special that made them those famous man in America it let them to become a two term president why\nWhy we attacking him now why we let him off the twenty why we booting horrible phrase is on his tomb\nThose are the things I attack in the paper back this time crap\nWill check it out thank you Brian nice to see a server back to the radio and you go\nYou got an air welcome anyhow I Can't wait Sandra Oh so you can grab ...\nThank you [noise] by one eight six six eight seven six six nine that's mostly the calls I'm getting I mean I just had to be honest most of the cause believe this whole thing is is set up there maybe ... somebody else's behind it but there's no substance there's no proof\nUntil we find a perpetrator until we find a the person who would try to terrorize the nine people\nI Can't go ahead and say this is some plot either way\nBut I Would hope the one thing that would come out of it is it everyone tone it down if Steve ... bleeding to death on second base on a baseball field on a friday morning I think it was if that wasn't a wakeup call I Hope this is a wakeup call because you don't want anything that you've said personally\nTo be responsible for somebody else's pain let alone injury let\nA fence act that was put in place in two thousand addicts by President Bush which was supported by Charles Schumer is supported by ... it was supported by Hillary Clinton all of them saying that we have to have a secure border that you can't\nConduct the sovereignty of a nation without some sort of water and they all supported the eight hundred mile science project along the border at that point so I it's it's understandable if Democrats don't know quite what to say about it now they see just gone so far away from that stance\nSome more through the other thing is the word is when both any Kelly will going at it last week it wasn't over an issue it was over ... Nielsen and we know the uh the general Kelly the chief of staff is a huge fan of his replacement and former deputy ... what do you know about that and will you approach that today when you speak to her\n[noise] you know I mean I think that those issues of sort of you know at least you know put them in the palace intrigue category at the White House I you know everyone that I've spoken\nTo in the White House is very supportive of secretary Nelson um\nAnd believe that she's doing a very good job we know that you know she's always said that she starts at the pleasure of the president and that she feels that there's an enormous a jet\nThat falls under her job title that she's very committed to carrying out um but certainly you know questions along those lines of of you know because it's difficult to do your job is if this kind of friction that are in place and and yes we'll get her response to that\nYeah I really do you do you're also going into and I'm I Know you're going to be able to cover this more than likely but this Arizona Senate race or find endlessly intriguing\nMore yeah Shelley the fighter pilot on paper I thought we'd have the seed but I guess the primary so brutal she's had trouble getting momentum but now she's got it here she is a with you last night\nTalking about I'm Talking about the border cub forty seven\nHave to do whatever it takes us into the border and uh if it's so frustrating if the Democrats continue to\nDo whatever it takes to secure the border and uh if it's so frustrating as the Democrats continue to obstruct on this issue\nIs the the care of on if it's ... it's raising awareness to everybody about what's going on but every single day in Yuma little mini caravans are coming from you know where people are showing up\nThey know as soon as they ... that set foot in the United states either where the kid or they say the right words they're going to be released\nAnd sixteen thousand five hundred last month just released into the interior of the United states never to show up for the court date this is not working for our country we have to secure the border we have to close the loop holes so that includes a border wall and include more agents includes access Rosen technology\nBut also closing loopholes or the cartels and others are taking advantage of right now\nSo she she understands a major issue for hours on end and you're getting now now that you're down there\n[noise] ... yeah absolutely I mean it it's a fascinating race to watch between Christmas set of eyes and Martha Nick Sally they're both current Congress numbers from from Arizona\nAnd whoever wins will be the first female senator in the state of Arizona but the demographics and Arizona have been changing dramatically over the years and it has always been a

least two hundred journalists most of the retired or semi retired have signed onto a letter condemning the president's attacks on the media and accusing him of inciting violence against the press\nThey open letter the journalist many from ABC News signed it they said Trump's condoning a political violence as part of a sustained pattern on of an attack on free press which includes labeling recorded she doesn't like fake news\nAnd meanwhile the New York times yesterday decided to publish an excerpt of a fictional piece wherein Dave ... the assassination of the president on at

Alec Baldwin showing bombing according to the rats yeah I Know he had a show they were talking about having the come up and being on his first week but it didn't work out because I have a schedule and also it's our fault one um but\nThey apparently the story goes that his show is actually working out too terribly well\nUm and that it looks like I mean it tied Univision and a key demo but his ratings I mean the words were years where\nBombs bombs bombs bombs bombs\nJust to point for demo rating I'm barely edged out uh some show on Univision and it was I guess it's on the Sunday prime time

... do you have a lot of people in media who want to make themselves victims because they're upset at being called out for reckless and irresponsible not journalism just propagandize ... is what it is\nAnd a free people have every right to call out and criticize their free press and when the free press starts telling me free people that they cannot criticized and you're infringing upon their rights our right to free speech and free expression\nThat is how speech and freedom works in the United states you can write an article that's demonstrably false for which you either have to issue a retraction\nOr apologize and take a downer corrected or do whatever entirely and there have been numerous publications and networks that have done that repeatedly we have cited there examples ad nauseam on this program on a near daily basis\nWhen you are purposely writing something to convey an agenda and you don't even bother to check the basic fact of the matter you are not participating in journalism you are acting as they propagandize Institute\nAnd you have every\nRight to be called out for that well clinging to the vestige of journalism and using that as of a near\nTo hide your actual activity a free people have every right to call you out about that a free people have every right to say that what you're doing is fake news as\nWho has fake news written about her quite frequently for instance media matters which is a website that is\nWas founded by a guy named David rockets holy subsidized by Soros and it was founded by a guy named David Brock who got in trouble because apparently the entity was encouraging its employees to illegally carry guns in Washington DC Daily Caller did a great expos they on this and apparently employees according to the Daily Caller were nervous about\nThe media matters a bosses erratic behavior due to drugs\nThey love writing maliciously falls hit pieces about conservatives with the purpose to further divided America end in sight\nAnd I had commentary the other day on how a an anti gun group was using the elections as a way to call for swatting all law abiding gun owners basically no matter where they are\nAnd they were using oh if you see it on the on the ... on election day they were calling to us\nThey were calling to use taxpayer resources to swat innocent law abiding Americans simply\nIf they were gun owners and I said that's dangerous\nAnd I said first of all it's not those law abiding gun owners those aren't the ones that are going off and doing all of the carnage that we're seen and I said furthermore if something were to ever happen be anywhere around a polling place or wherever you would be glad that there was a law abiding gun owner there to defend you\nMedia matters takes that says Dana lash calls for a conservative to bring guns to polling places\nYes I did consult a lawyer you are correct because I'm a litigious bitch\nNo I'm done with it because this is the ... these are the types of people I'm Talking about media matters writes headlines like these because they want to incite I honestly believe that some of these people are begging for violence because they write horrible things about innocent people because they hate them\nThey that's what it is they can't stand it so they I already\nDo you know how many people I had threatened to kill me in response to media matters matters is

[laughter] you know this guy I Know well I was there as well\nI took the picture [laughter] it was a video I set the video oh here's the reason Greg now you tell me you tell me but I think that this is the way that it goes I've never seen the guy before I saw this one picture and of course they're comparing his official picture with a new guy on a bed in a hotel room\nAnd it's a little ... video but I it's when the nose and the IRS match is when you know you have a match right and so that's why I looked at I look at the nose that was at the years and I said uh\nThat guy is involved in a grotesque production that's what I said [laughter]\nYou agree on it or not I agree looking at this ... ... it's hard to deny that it is him um and then there's a picture of him with his wife and she just standing there looking defeated because what else is she supposed to do come out until\nIt's Brazil and say that like when I come at me back what what do you implying with that statement I met said no no I think it's a good thing or a bad thing depending on where you are saying is I think Brazil is one of those countries where the men are expected to have mistresses you know like I like Italy\nIs like that there are certain places where a that this might be hard to believe but uh as people are together for quite a while as couples in some countries like Italy and perhaps Brazil\nWomen actually don't mind the guy wandering because they're tired of him\nLike that uh they they age together the woman's like fifty four she's had enough of this yeah go find yourself at twenty five year old dandy and have fun and leave me alone so I'm not making this up there are cultures where it's expected that you're going to have a mistress later I really don't want to live\nNo I'll tell you why they don't it's not a matter of not mind being it's a matter of being a part of the culture because what happens is when you become say fifty five or fifty six years old and you're in a marriage you remember when you were twenty two and you were somebody's Mr select keeps going in the culture you see what I say or they can get a because like\nI like writing an office part of the ... the cultures where women can't drive what about that you know you have complaints against that\nAnd they hold on cellular Greg we've had an accident here on the buffet ha no and in the eggs I Want to\nSay is everything okay down they're\nVery good but I haven't worked a buffet line since I was in the Catskills and the early nineties [noise]\nThis is fantastic All right well uh I say that that guy will if not when do better than he would have done I think most Brazilian voters as if I have any idea will be turned on by the or the tape that's fine but\nThat's my prediction I might watch I'll be in trouble with the country of Brazil or you didn't get in trouble with things you just never imagine that's all right we'll put us on the map no we suffer you know the suffering me do we have time for another story I have no idea how much time we have us another story sir\nA California man has burned down his house because he was using a blow torch to kill spiders\n[noise] [laughter] I never heard that on the home fix that show [laughter]\nYou know sometimes you hear stories you just dig yourself they're leaving something out [laughter] yes I Believe there was a spider yes I Believe our house was burnt down but I feel like there's a piece of information that's being left out because if you're afraid of spiders why do you what did they use a\nTorch blow torch but these are black players these are black widows they're very dangerous but I heard that they're not now no black widow spiders dangerous yes they are here David Becker here yeah that was their ... you'll get real sick [laughter]\nHave begun their backer here at home ... really are I mean you can earn barriers may get their church [laughter] you have to be careful with the house of my writing on it and just uses Sheryl [laughter]\nIs my thing is I I I think he was doing something with the blow torch potentially illegal I don't know\nPenn chili illegal I don't know and then he sees I don't think anybody runs to get the blow torch [laughter] I bet you're doing something with a blow torch you're scared by the spider and then you turn and then just forget that there's a whole house attached to the spider and then you end up in trouble\nSo what do you think he was up there\nYou have anything to do I think he was up to do yeah I think that ah that Brazilian candidate was in his garage and they were filming another video that's what I think it was going on as long as I'm In trouble with the country to Brazil I'd have to take a little deeper into like a\nA I have a I don't pick spiders but uh [noise] I don't I don't know why I don't\nThink a spider as ever harmed too many spiders they just look like you they looked like they should be killed there's certain things\nThat come across you come across that should be dead what other things ah look like that Eric ... hey look we're not going to go into my past I'm a reformed man yes\nI was gonna say spiders are good though they eat all the other horrible bugs and they usually leave you alone\nThat's true uh spider should be but they looked like they should be killed a little bit scary there are certain things and sometimes I Will say to a small insects\nWhen I'm drunk [laughter] I Will [laughter] before I kill them I give them a little talk 'cause look man my\nPlaces in here you're places out there\nYou stepped over the line pal now you must die\nNow well is it like once a year they crawl into your mouth when you sleep the average person eats what seven a year it's\nA lie is that is wrong you know it's not true that true will people buy into this up here 'cause they know daddy daddy long legs which apparently is even a spider but it's the most poisonous spider in the world but it's a mouth is too small to bite you that's not true either it's not true you're here dispelling these myths\nOr they just have to be able to do I wasn't I Want to be good if you want to be a mouth breather when you sleep you know sleeping at the spider's not crawling in there [laughter]\nI I wasn't saying that the uh the I I thought maybe it was a little bit too low because managers I think swallows at least Fifteen spiders a year seven seemed low to me yeah there are always telling me about the spiders wider enjoy it I was ... after a while I start wondering if he were eating most things because you\nHave you seen him since ... takes pictures of little bugs all the time spiders you know really enjoys them I like I like the critters [laughter]\nWell anyway suffice to say that that would fall into the category of masses in the news like if you tell me a story like a guy birthers house down because he was afraid of a spider what I Would say to you is the spiders incidental that idiot was get a bird is house down sooner or later\nThat's what I say well they're like a man who likes to play with fire yeah if you're playing with fire sometimes what happens\nYou get burned a if you're not good enough you get birds next

go there and get beat up a couple thousand bucks okay well look that's that is that's a classy beat down like you suggest\nThat is that's a classy\nBeat down ladies and gentlemen that's where that is that is\nA thank you [laughter] so uh I wanted to get we got up to ... love stories to get to we were talking about Megan Kelly earlier now uh I Believe that NBC is using this\nSuppose a blackface controversy I mean she said one thing maybe it was inappropriate maybe it hurts them feelings she carefully apologize to the next day I don't think it's a big deal if she has really good ratings and they don't want to let her go but I think a couple of things are going on here I think they don't like her\nBecause she chose to really go to the wall with Matt Lauer sexual harassment stuff and a few other things having to deal with that and also her show is not getting ratings\nSo if the black face thing wouldn't have happened\nI Believe that right now we'd be hearing stories about how we're going to end Megan Kelly show and she's going to join dateline or something else going to go into a different situation all of a sudden they're handed this black faced controversy\nAnd they can blame it on that and try to fire her out right now they owe her millions and millions and millions of dollars suicide for sixty nine million I don't know how much is up front I don't know how many years that was but obviously she's going into negotiations today with NBC\nThey want to get rid of her and make it costs the least amount possible she wants to walk out of there with the most she got to walk out there ... out of there with her whole contract or how does that work\nWell you know you'll always have to be privy to the contract and be able to see it in an entertainment contracts are really long and they're pretty ironclad I Know I've seniors\nThank you very much and I my behind for a year once they got paid in full so that's when it right at you know there's\nPros and cons on her side and now in every contract usually you can fire somebody what they call for cause and and they link that to a morality clause and if there's a morality issue which certainly race would fall under then she can go in there and the ... but she's not going to be in a very strong in Goshen in Brazil their jobs\nTheir job is to try to say this is all about the black face controversy yeah she's got to go in with the truth now I'm not making Kelly fan I told you this show is going to fail to the beginning but she's get but you know they did make the mistake of\nOffering her sixty nine million dollars at a show she in my opinion is going to go in there with the truth which is you're not really firing me for cause you're using that as an excuse so you won't have to pay me because of the show just didn't work out\nRight ... the what they're going to do is is they're going to throw money at her depends on how much probably not the ... you\nKnow a million ... million to walk away now come on\nTo something like that twenty or thirty million just to cut their losses and get a show in there and that's a winning show instead of a show that's just right you know dive bomb\nAnd she said that she wants a Ronan Farrow to be in the meaning you know he's a guy who's doing all these sexual harassment things because she believes part of the reason that they don't like her isn't just the ratings and she's probably right is that she covered the NBC sexual assault scandals lot which I think she probably had her best ratings when she did\nThat well but she wants him there because he's not only a lawyer but as a journalist and she was\nHe's a lawyer he is you know in in ... lawyers went to law school he looks like he's Thirteen while he's got a baby but do they have a elementary law schools now he must have done\nYeah they do there's a a child's lawyer I graduated elementary\n\nYes Mr pharaoh you may approach the ... what do you have to say\nOkay thank you\nShe wants them to be her her lawyers crying\n\nOr get get get get the lawyer a pass the full you hold her in contempt now so [laughter] so it really is we don't know because we don't we haven't seen the contract but that's that's the dynamic so\nYeah I mean the threat of having him there is to give NBC for PR ... she wants to be so to speak for\nStalking horse right and so and they can't say anything out of line or else who's going to run a store right on who's\nGoing to write a negative story about unfair the negotiation was so they're going to throw money at her to get rid of her I mean the fact that you know the show that was on prior to hers that twice the ratings\nYeah without ... and that like wow it's out there for heaven's sakes that's ratings machine right there and see what you want to watch a weatherman sit down behind a desk for an hour right\nBut if she gets something that she perceived to be in on their mouth and she's going to double down and you know Britain further litigation\nWanted ratings she'd have Ronan Farrow on the show and then tell them that you have Frank Sinatra's DNA and give him a twenty three and me test and find out if he's actually Woody Allen son because I think he lost a lot like Frank Sinatra you know we'll see uh\nWoody Allen son because I think it looks a lot like Frank Sinatra yeah we'll\nSee I mean maybe it was no way that that little who is my side [laughter]\nFrank I'm Sorry I'm Sorry [laughter] bring a dang thing\nI Need to bring some real talent and the veterans maybe they'll replace real Woody Allen and Matt Lauer\nMatt Lauer and are actually bring Matt Lauer back what they say this he's done to apologize I don't even know was\nMegan apologized\nMegan apologized as well but see Megan I Would love it if she would have sexually harassed somebody\n[laughter] where do you why high\nAt a skews me mega did you ever sexually harass anybody\nI don't know what you're talking about but if you came and sat next to me maybe we could talk further\nMegan Kelly I have some information on that I can share with you say black know Sean Hannity\n[laughter]\nOne time and I was getting changed after my radio show getting ready to do my TV show I caught her peeping through a whole Shia drilled into the dressing room\nWas PG God you as you were changing\nAnd I went to Roger Ailes about and they said they had a baby ... just like yours [laughter]\nHe said I drilled that whole you were supposed to use it the other way\nWell I'll tell you she was looking at me and I uh me too that's\nAt hand and he was wearing a very tight parents ... dot trousers that day I don't\nGet yourself in any more trouble than you already are\nAre other stories a law stories I'm Sorry I'm trying to read and do a show at the same time ah so the explosive devices this is my question on this explosive devices the spin stuck to CNN and other Trump critics uh we don't know who it is yet\nMy feeling is when you put out that many things whether they're live bombs are\nFake bombs or somewhere in between your ... you're going to give the FBI and CIA and the secret service and all these investigators so much to work with is that we will find who this is now getting ahead of the game\nSuch nope none of them have gone off and I want to get to the Andrews go when I was conspiracy theories here so we'll say thankfully none of them have gone off a at this point that when they find the person the guy\nOr girl I'm Sorry yeah right whatever\nIs twenty eight teen girls can be terrorists to\nGet out of that old searching for heaven's sakes ah once we do find the person or people behind this if there are no deaths\nIn federal law what's the most they can be looking at as far as punishment was the general statutes ran for those that music yeah just one

office and we we were they were given 'em out for free when you get one\nI don't know I feel like the flu I don't know I've just never gotten one before and I don't want to get the flu once every three years I don't like mercury you don't like mercury the planet no I don't like mercury and my shots so you are like Dr Joe ... well you you will [laughter] commanders agrees is a story about sex\nAnd yes to the story is a drop in the adult flu vaccination maybe the factor in why it was so bad Lester why the flu outbreak was so bad in the wintertime\nOkay before we go to Dr Joe\nAnd he can give us your line loaded you see him over there he's writing\nIs anti vaccine thing read that headline one more time because I'm a stickler for words I think that people sometimes words are in the headlines and they just slide right past people around that headline again\nA drop in adult flu vaccinations may be factored in last season's record breaking debts and young so word\nIn that headline that's most important\nMay be may be in a lotta headlights and have to work may be in there and if you just it allows you to put the headline\nOut there and then on Fox and CNN and MSNBC it's like I don't know three hours of the day the Fifteen minutes at a time you could assemble panels and ah and do that and everybody forgets about the fact that the headline originally said maybe here's the other side of baby\nMaybe not [laughter] they could have put that it would've been the headline would have been just as effective\nAnd gotten the same information to cross that have said the flu saying maybe not\nHave anything to do with the fact that less people got flu vaccines last year but I Am actually in favor of vaccines yeah I just haven't gotten my flu vaccines what I worry about with a with the all the anti vaccine talk is that people won't vaccinate they're small children uh-huh and I think that's very important\nI over vaccinated my children I I was like yeah I Would I put them in the system three times make sure I made\nThat that's not [laughter] I'm not a bad parent on live radio you're just say\nI Believe I Believe in vaccines I just haven't gotten the flu vaccine myself because I don't I Want to get at once every three years now you can go on you're a little anti flu vaccine but I can rent on Heidi out against the flu vaccine are you\nI'm against the I'm not it's not the vaccines I'm Still concerned with what's in the vaccine called vaccine doctor but you have to make vaccines without mercury it'll looming um\nBut you have to make vaccines without mercury it'll lumina and an artificial sweeteners\nWhy why is mercury in a little bit of ... so it's going to get the vaccine I suggest you get one that doesn't have mercury in it and they have ... more spent two\nRight I'll give you a small vial without the mercury in cars merger into body has zero need we need zero mercury in our body but how much of it does it take to hurt us it depends on the person that's the thing so I mean I can get it and go back and he talks about America ... other people get in the system cause some real serious issue because what was the serial story a couple of days ago uh uh yeah I'd like to say\nWhat like the day we killer right to say oh we killer in the cereal a little bit worried about it but I had a brain damage oh not that big a deal or silver the hormone disruption\nYou're going to be sarcastic yeah but my feeling when I see a thing like that we killer in cereal\nIs I think yeah if you ate ten boxes of cereal for three straight years every day you're right uh-huh yeah they will be ... that would be in there I mean people have to remember it's not just what the ingredient is it's how much is it in there yeah and how much it takes to cause a problem\nBut you would have I mean you being what a hundred and twenty two pounds right up like that global that'll be like yeah as\nYou eat a bowl of cereal and this young man sitting right here has a bowl of cereal same amount of cereal stealing my serial ... okay\nSo what happens is your body is going to have a different reaction than his body sure and he's still growing so anything that's going to disrupt his hormones is going to change his body dramatically more then it's going to fail Dr Joe says don't eat cereal till you're Eighteen yeah right yeah that seems to me the way to go and no one ever said why the ... like the state of industrial I Will tell you why why\nBecause what we're doing now unfortunately is we found that we ... life is said on things like uh we we can kill the week before we harvest it so it's easier to Hartman\nOkay so it's saving time and money but it's adding like the state\nWhich is now a known Carson again I mean we are used on a lot of things they

Barry Bonds were parents Erick Erickson\nUh and and for us just LSU definitely was the worst game that we\nPlay this year no different than all Britain you run into a team that has one of the best performances ah yeah but if you want to get a you're really into specifics though I think the big challenge right now or are are Georgia Bulldogs is is can we make improvements\nIn the running game really on both sides of the football but but maybe more importantly a or run defence ah it it has been\nPorous at times um and at times people have just been able to do what they\nWhat they wanted to against us on the ground and soon as you can do that as an opposing all fits everything else in the play book opens up and it becomes extremely challenging to get off the football field a and just saw that against LSU for a job or all was a\nA no question I serviceable quarterback you could do a very good job or it has been a very good job for that football team but it was the damage done on the ground a that has been problematic in and if we don't get that stopped\nOr even tomorrow is going to be a tough row to hoe\nI was a little surprised coming into the season that than I Am to things that George is struggling to to stop the run a little bit and ... is a little bit of an experienced all sorts of mine seems to have trouble in past protectionist ... lawn right now\nUh you know we've we've had a little bit for sure I I think that um when you look at the office of line in the run game uh we we are still doing a good job we haven't had the explosive runs from last year or no question a it passed game that we've had\nA couple of ah protect protection breakdowns and I think what you can look at\nThere are some of the injuries that we've had we've had to insert young guys\nAre into the line up and then you get out on tackle where we've had our tackles bang up a little bit uh that have been playing Mick in bruised and\nA and not at fault go when you're playing a jazz elite defensive lineman even if you are a split second slow off the blocks because you're you're ... with a little bit it it can be problematic uh and and we're seeing a tremendous amount of of different exotic looks for teams are bringing pressure and\nAh I think you have one other thing to that mix you've got some running backs that are in the game\nThat are still young and inexperienced as well and those guys are critical and pass protection so you add up the injuries the youth and inexperience both on the office of lining up running back\nAnd I think that's where you are running into some of the problems\nSo the bottom line is when you lose Nick temp Sony Michel ... and I mean when you got a recovery a little bit\nThere's there's no doubt and I I Will tell you we I I think everybody across the country can see how talented this football team is but we're still young and we are still inexperienced and when\nBut we're still young and we are still inexperienced and when you look at the program right now the expectations are that that we are going to be playing with the national elite we still are this football game tomorrow is obviously critically important to stay in that\nAre in that conversation but that that keeps all of our goals in front of us but but this team has to mature very quickly just because of the the youth and experience uh and and really lack of internal leadership that we've had to this point\nUh we've got to have guys step up a guy who got to grow up pretty quickly to be on that level\n[noise] Arabs are joining send them our game show getting ready for tomorrow's big Georgia Florida gain our coverage starts here on WSBIU eleven thirty kicked off at three thirty PM number seven versus number nine huge game both teams are six and one that being said Eric how long of a leash will coach smart have or have Jake on tomorrow\nYou know I I don't know I I think that that really the the plan that the coach smart has had\nWith these quarterbacks a it and to tremendous talents that that that we're going to utilize both guys in positions where presents problems for opposing defenses or if anything coming into this I don't think that plan is going to change what I\nDo expect is that\nThe packages and what we begin to allow Justin Fields to do a is going to be greatly expanded when he comes into the football game so I don't think there's a leash on Jake from\nI I don't think he should be looking over his shoulder he has had a a very remarkable a career so far early in his career between the Hedges a I so I I don't think there's any concern there I Do think though that we will see expanded options\nFor Justin Fields and and when you think about adjusted his yet you know you make your way through as a freshman\nIn this way you get six seven games into it even if I look back so long ago when I was playing\nA this is about the time where I began to\nUh get more playing time and and you know I think it was the fifth or sixth game but I actually got my first start\nA as a as a freshman you get to this point in the season with the kind of playing time but he's had even though it's been limited ... just all that time of practice or if he's in a position now where where we've got to hand over more the playbook to him if we're going to put them into the football game and utilize them so that that's what I Would expect to see is just\nNot a not a short leash on Jake from but definitely more expanded play book for Justin feels to come in and really showcases ...\nIt's not going to be if the tone about a situation is what you're telling me\nI I don't believe so now it if it is I think what shocked everybody\nA it now if it's a ... it'll never be able to tell them about a situation just because you've got just a bill so highly recruited for sure and and such a talent so I won't be a surprise but I I think that we'll see Jack from in a in the football game and he's going to be the guy that is that is pulling the trigger for the majority of the snaps\nA there but I think we'll see Justin Fields are more than what we've seen them\nLet me ask you as a former player forget your role your amazing role as the caller and restaurant was handed yeah All right let's look at the amazing coloring with with ah everybody's got Howard back to your playing\nThey do come into the did you come into the bird [laughter] you know just had a you know\nDo a couple of those comments every once in a while because those things are never ever when you get inside the radio booth it is you know it is just shots at your left and right so I appreciate those out\nAnd no I you know what I'll text everybody moral during the game just letting them know how amazing you are but you are an amazing player as well um as a player would talk about this game from the players perspective how important it is and and and what the players are thinking about tonight getting ready for tomorrow's big game\n... well I'll tell you that the minute you step on campus\nOr you start hearing about this football game as a player the atmosphere is so unique you know that there was a handful of games across the country that are played against rivals in a neutral setting where\nUh it is just electric uh it is it your your nerves are are probably at the highest point they're going to be all season during the regular stays at football game or you think about it constantly and it's a start the minute that yet but that ... that just step onto campus\nBecause everybody is talking about it it's it is that you need and and that electric\nUh and obviously when you're playing a team in Florida now that's ranked as highly as they are uh it just it ratcheted up\nAll of those emotions that go into this football game so as a as a player it is it's what's your dream about it's one of the reasons that Jeff there that you come to the University of Georgia you go to Florida a it is to play in this game and and be a part of one of the most amazing atmosphere as in all the college football but\nAt this point you know tonight every one of these players are so locked into their game plan of what their responsibilities\nThe game plan of what their responsibilities are and the routine of of the season and those game wake of a game night\nThat a lot of those nerves are beginning to subside a little bit is you really start to get really prepared to go play and you're blocked out all of the hoopla or as pageantry that surround this football games so\nIt's a a it's an amazing a vet players get riled up for it they think about it all the time but right now it's really about going out and executing all what do I have to do to help my team went\nNo magic combination of just the the setting and

know we started just there last year with the other team was playing well every team and the SEC ... and then when you put a rivalry game\nOn top of that you really can't it's cliche but you just throw out red or\nYou could thought rankings it really doesn't matter that these are two challenges football teams that will play at the best uh against each other because of all the things that we're talking about there is no problem right now getting guys locked into go play the split all day on both sides are going to be ready\nStakes are huge tomorrow they're always huge for ah Georgia Florida
