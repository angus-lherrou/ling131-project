I Believe and what he's saying I Believe and what you're saying you cannot let that night and\nHung in and now it's ridiculous it's out of control but it's all about the whole coordinate the effort and showing it so that the Democrats crack can't play their same game as\nYou know of course the ... you know with the way they're using all of their their word you feel sympathy and build next trust against the Republicans and\nTrumpet so good at that she's just got to make sure again there's a coordinated accurate said that there is a theme that people there and the military show of force start sending buses start sending plane all staged they're ready to say lean mean that\nThis is his rather than mine and the sad just like Obama had with the area he didn't do that\nThis is ... is is that and he got to show that and and handling is right with a really great where it needed Africa\nI'm really not worry yeah of course I Do I mean we don't want a humanitarian crisis you know the vice president actually said today that\nYou know a Central American leaders told him that left us in Venezuela are bankrolling this caravan which wouldn't when you're hiring me the Honduran right resident telling the vice president that and ... told the Washington Post the president of on doors told me this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras financed by Venezuela look\nBottom line is they should be turned back now but if in fact we see they're getting closer and closer to our southern border we've got to protect the border\nWe're going to do this in a way I I Know that is we want to have the best interests of innocent people and all of this nobody's innocent if they're willing to just brush our border Russia across the border we don't want people hurt we definitely don't want people killed\nAnd ultimately the people that will precipitate this crisis they're going to be on the Mexican side of the border because America is not going to do anything\nPeople that don't violate the law but if they violate the law there'll be arrested and I I hear what you're saying\nWe should have food water medicines supplies and transportation back to where they came from and I think you can do it in as as expeditious way possible with them as much hair as possible um but I don't think any arrest\nEver looks good and if the people on the Mexican side of the border border one of confrontation with American police and ice and our military\nUm our side is gonna win and you're right we should do it as compassion early as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt you know a lot of these people probably come from nothing they have zero to lose here\nAnd that's a that's a tough position to be in and then you have agitator that or you know they're not telling them anything that's honest and truthful that they're telling them they're going to get in\nAnd so they're going to be disappointed feelings and anger anger who's gonna probably be on display\nSo we're just hoping to get it turned around before this even happens but\nSo we're just hoping to get it turned around before this even happens but ... you know let's let's be clear here\nThis is the United states of America we're a constitutional republic\nWe believe in the rule of law and the application of our laws that's it\nDemocrats don't like it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this topic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talking about right anyway Patty thank you I'm Becky is in Tucson, Arizona next on the Sean Hannity show how are you glad you called Becky\nHi Sharon how are you today I'm good what's going on\nWell I got a couple of things being from a border town that people don't understand about this this law that's kind of [noise]\nYes they come to our voter but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV and chicken pox in life and our border patrol agents and all are people that are working with them get exposed to this\nThey don't understand there's a long term ramifications of them [noise] and I had a feeling of thought about why I'm Mexican Government it's not stopping this some\nMob it's because when they come here and earn money they send millions and millions and millions of dollars back to their family members the wire transfer\nSo why should they stop them because they're making money off so I think we should stop the why are trained first\nLook there is a part of me having been down to where you live in Tucson the Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been I've spotted reported on the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today I've been horseback all terrain vehicle helicopters boats\nI'd been there I've seen I was up close and personal when it turned out gang members were being arrested I've got the video of it\nDrug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand that people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying the laws\nThat we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America is to respect the laws of this land\nAnd respect American sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that\nAnd doing the right way and they should have precedence over those that are law listen don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple and you know I feel listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars were spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can take care of themselves they will be taking care of\nAmerica's never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm but it is that we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have the ability to do that\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and then I arrived from Augusta precious metals\nCoal

taken back to Saudi Arabia and tried if if he was really a part of the Muslim Brotherhood and uh with in fighting terrorism worldwide\nAnd and so the Saudis have a problem because I have a hobby and then they have people want reform and we have a similar type problem over here so Congress and the president and the government of a Saudi Arabian need to work it out\nYeah but you you are for for a guy that lived in Saudi Arabia as crazy as that society is in in comprehensible a as it is in terms of mores uh and the way they structure things you do see the merit in keeping relations with Saudi Arabia\nAbsolutely they're keeping the middle east calm is saving us a huge amount of money and preventing so many people from being murdered by the radicals they are not angels but you have to work with them and and we need to move them more and more moderate stance and there are people who want to do that over there\nAll right thanks I appreciate George Mike ... news Ninety six five and a window Hey Mike Hi Brian\nYeah the governor's race might give me your perspective dissenters birch Gillum why is Gillum in front and almost every poll\nI think Guillen is in French because there there's always been this perception that most Republicans don't show up until the gate of and I think that that just really has a he's got a\nGood guy behind him I think the jumping or spent works I mentioned earlier in speaking in the green room I think that what's really going to help to take this election over Gillum is the fact that we do have a very important Senate race\nIn these districts now we finally have some clarity it's interesting we're getting more clarity on individual races but the picture in terms of how the final flop is going to go this is like playing Texas hold them yeah it's it's getting a lot more it it's getting murkier about what's going to happen\nIn that final calculation I think we're going to have a truly interesting election night\nUh you know the words you think it's going to be extended I think Chris right because you think of so many of these races going to be a compelling out on the west coast oh you don't want to stay up all night but you do think you're going to end up doing that\nWell we we stay up all night on the decision that no matter what it is just whether we have company we like it if you guys stay up and watch a show because there's going to be a lot of interesting stuff you know control of house we have a we have a model that lets us predict which party is going to control the house based on the uh our our polling\nBut also the early returns a in a you know if it's a democratic wave will be able to tell you at nine o'clock a yet here they come in there there it goes a but if if this is what it what the current surveys indicate we're going to have to wait for Texas we are going to have to wait for all kinds of stuff to come in before we have real clear\nYou know it's interesting uh I mean as usual Florida I find the most intriguing and the headliners the governors and the senators number one I'm pure performance I Know Scott doesn't have the great or\nThe great charisma we know that but after eight years Florida knows them and knows these productive hardworking\nAnd honest and and the other side Bill Nelson who's been there for a while has not been necessarily productivity think if he's ever going to be vulnerable there'll be over after a two term governor decided to run against him dead heat and the last poll that except from Quinnipiac\nHas a Scott down I think seven points system like yes says well you have 'em down consistently seven I had two or three and then this was big\nSo surveys so he actually has improved one point in Quinnipiac what if he is one of our a plus polls that has a good track record that uses the right methodology and yet Scott has consistently trail and this is also what you see there Andrew Gillum in the governor's race in Florida\nThat should not be the Florida hasn't had a democratic governor since Nineteen Ninety eight I Believe when Jeb Bush won a now they don't win by a lot Florida tends to\nUh now they don't win by a lot Florida tends to have ... narrowly contested elections I think Rick Scott one by one point and one and a half points where his margins of victory as governor um but so Florida has been a state that has is they swing state but that has had a consistent narrow Republican advantage\nUm the fact that round to St Louis is struggling as much as he has to try to get some traction and get some advantage there talks about what kind of year it is in Florida what here's basically what we have we have the volume turned up on both sides to the max we're looking at\nA year and so normally in a in a by any election in the mid term election the last midterm election in twenty four team was the lowest turn out in any since Nineteen forty two\nWe are on track now to have a midterm election turnout over fifty percent which you have to go back forty or forty years or more to find that kind of turnout you have to go back to basically the the the internal political struggle over Vietnam to find mid term election turnout like that and if that's true so here's the danger for Republicans\nThey are the the intensity is back up on the Republican side to match the Democrats but the Democrats aren't debating and in swing states like Florida in swing states like Ohio if Democrats are storming the polls if Democrats are voting like Republicans Republicans are going to lose out on a bunch of seats because there are more Democrats than there are Republicans in America\nIsn't it great for the country is the guy loves politics to get that type of turnout\n[noise] um I Wish we were doing it in a less wretched way yeah um I Wish that it was not so vitriolic an apocalyptic an awful but yes uh speaking selfishly ... ah this is this is this is what I'm here I Am ... as the as the kids would say are here for this\n[noise] uh he's

like monster that they're violent you can't say that you can't say that\nThese individuals in any way I feel as though they're violent because then you're just being mean minutes usually I mean that's what we hear over and over again is not\n[noise] I the rally last night in Houston they the president made mention of ah of some of that and it was a very good rally this is one thing in particular um that\nI like [noise] this is one thing in particular that was said and a lot of people lost their minds over this audio somebody twelve listen to the president here uh in this was last night in Houston\n[noise]\nThat was\nActually not care about our country so [noise]\nYou know what we\nShowed up\nWe're not supposed to know what I Am\nNationalist sub [noise]\nAnd so the less lost their mind and they said oh my gosh this is this is so bad Hitler also said he was a national is seen who said he was the nationals Hitler was almost like they all have the same talking points\nHitler on the national is Trump on the national is high so two things and I'm going to come back to that\nI think there's a difference between nationalism and patriotism and I think that by respecting the law of the republic that makes one a bit of a nationalist there's nothing wrong with with a moderate form of nationalism there never has been\nUm and like I said there's a difference between patriotism and nationalism there and they also when you are in a populist era nationalism\nWhich seems to increase in terms of identification and in in in terms of appeal\nAnd this\nYou can yes and you can have ... you can be both patriotic and you can have enjoy a modern form of\nNationalism mean there's I don't think that there's anything wrong with that but here's where here's where this gets\nIt gets weird ah and there was a good piece of a friend of mine wrote that\nUh was discussing this at at National Review discussing how certain strains of conservatism\nAt at National Review discussing how certain strains of conservatism might not fully identify with nationalism or libertarianism because libertarians they see as they write some the borders of barriers to free markets\nA religious conservatism often emphasizes the God given dignity of all people which transcends national borders\nUh and then they say there are many conservatives are their American conservatives of different kinds which I had been influenced by you know there's a manifestation of patriotism there's you know some some uh support moderate forms of nationalism\nWhere it's not as sinister thing it's not a malicious thing it's there is you\nYou have you can have\nGood nationalism and ... and and bad nationalism depending on how you how you practice and what you believe but here's the thing I Want to come back to it because all these people say oh well Hitler said he's a nationalist\nOkay now do socialist\nDo socialist now\nThe Nazis were national socialist us the name so now do socialist front of you Democrat social is out there who are so mad because you say well Trump said he's nationalist and then hit list that he's a national is okay do do socialist now\nAnd see how that works real good who\nElse that they were socialist go ahead that's all right say Hitler status right isn't that what you believe isn't that the the party to what you pledged\nAren't those the policies you support\nBecause you naive Leon stupidly believe that the one reason they just haven't worked in the past is because the right people\nDidn't implement them and I'm sure those people at the time thought the reason that their form of government hasn't worked in the past is because of the right people weren't there to implement them and the people before them thought that for one reason that their policies didn't work\nWas because of the right people weren't there to implement them that is the definition of insanity trying to same stupid thing over and over and over and over and over and over again and expecting it to be in any way successful when it is by design a failure\n\nSo there is a noxious form of everything\nI mean you can you can go I mean there's the example of democratic nationalism of which arguments of Lincoln and Churchill and Thatcher they were champions of national sovereignty they were champions of solidarity\nThere's nothing wrong with the loyalty to one's country and and uh gratitude for the freedoms they're in and in a legion ... to to the people and culture and laws that's what it is\n\nThis from an RO when nationals and find political expression it supports a federal government that is jealous of its sovereignty forthright an unapologetic about advancing it's people's interest in mindful of the need for national cohesion\nAnd worthwhile nationalism has these components but beyond the content of the country's nationalism depends on its particular character American nationalism has an ideological component so much of one as to render it exceptional that's the phrase American exceptionalism\nThis is the truth underline the simplification that America\nIs an idea rather than a nation in reality it as a nation was an idea but\nJohn Quincy Adams famous remark in the federalist papers present America as an example to the world when he remarked how America quote goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy was immediately followed by she is the well was sure to the freedom and independence of all\nAnd that is built into our cohesive American\nDNA\nAnd see this it's not this is an as in our own notes it's it's it's this it's\nSeen easily enough and patriotic fanfare whether it's Memorial Day or fly over George ... July Fourth fireworks et cetera tomb of the unknown soldier\nThese\nThis\nExplains the revulsion that most people feel when protesters burned an American flag because it's based on the belief not that the protesters are symbolically destroying an idea but I think that's how I look at it but some say that they are disrespecting the nation to which they will respect and feel the\nSo there's so many things with with patriotism and there's so many things with nationalism for the president to say what he said it is and\nHe's not I ... it it as the night and it it demonstrates and ignorance that has infected the left\nFor people who bragged so much about intellectualism rarely have I seen such a display of its absence especially in reaction to this particular issue\nAny [noise]\nOf honor on the one that got the recognition because I received the award but like I Know that this isn't my I just was trying to fall everybody else around me you know all these guys did incredible things the only reason I'm here in the only reason I have a wife the only reason I have kids is is because those guys gave everything they had to\nBe American veterans center protects the legacy an honors the sacrifice of American veterans to hear more like us on Facebook [noise]\n[noise] yeah\nWell you asked me about ...

to be used the radio about\nSome of the south but I Will tell you what it is so I\nI don't want to be crowded out\nAll right we hit me with Megan Kelly stories driving me crazy I'm not a fan of Megan Kelly but ah I'm tired of people apologizing for things that need no apology\nYeah yesterday shows she apologized for saying this\nIt's really you get in trouble if you are white per se but we are black person it puts out a white all the way like I\nWas a kid that was okay as long as you were dressed up as a character\nWhat does she have to apologize I take it to started as whether white kids should be a dressing up as Black Panther because Black Panther is most popular thing in the world now I just think of is that even if it wasn't thinking of this ... the idea that it's black face in the wrong if a young white kid\nPortrays himself as Black Panther on Halloween\nThink of this twisted thinking supposedly from the left and all these were social groups what we want is unity more unity stopped dividing we need unity\nWhite kids dressing as a black superhero without even thinking about the color you want that is when you're closer to unity but the logic that a white kid can't dress up as Black Panther\nThan you are the same logic and by the way logic does not let you off the hook you can look the other way but it won't let you off the hook but\nAt the same logic black kids shouldn't be allowed to dress up as Batman because Bruce Wayne as what this is people claim to want unity\nBut there are so many compartments\nSo many different groups inside of a even a a wider social group\nBut people will just start bickering about anything we want unity but no one can be inspired by anyone else we want unity but no one can be inspired by your hairstyle and then they make it their hairstyle we want unity but everybody has to stay in their separate silo and respect the other\nPerson's silo that's not unity\nThat's not unity at all what people on the left when they wake up in here white kids want to dress up as a black superhero this Halloween they should be thinking wow we are making progress\nIn this country it's actually happening but instead they just turn the page okay where's the grievance books of\n[noise] that's against it is\nIt just goes to show you can never win and these people should be used on these people because what I mean by these people as people on the left who are always going on and on about unity\nHave no interest in actually resolving problems social problems in this country if they're offended that white kids want to dress up as a black superhero on Halloween that should be victory there's something\nSo unique about a business built on family in his nurturing with the level of care dedication and respect that sets it apart Hi I'm Monica ... and for almost forty years I worked for a family owned business WSBIU TV\nRight Lou and the less up yeah on a diet ... that lists that are ... me she will Real Housewives of New York and so you go I tell you I thought you said\nAnd you were saying of yesterday's meeting the autumn has no expertise them anything you'd like to apologize I I\nLike to go are you there you go I thought boy\nMy point still remains it's it's all the same piece I'll I Will say it again if you will if you especially if you're on the left I think everybody want unity but just given the narrative of the day the CNN's in the world is the MSNBC is with the world\n... you get to a point where ... little white kids want to dress up as black superheroes that should be seen as progress\nYeah looking at this costume to Lou in a ... put on ... whatever you have first husband built the Suez Canal that's nice he\nI'm [laughter] I'm wearing a white marriage cw post one in the Nineteen\nUh he's account he's count ... shy as a giant afro wig on and she looks like maybe she ... her skin but she didn't put black face right right and the pointer she'll or a microphone she should not\nLike she doesn't want to go about it I could just go Mike\nShe overdid it with the afro right which is probably one look of the nine thousand the Diana Ross\nOf the nine thousand that Diana Ross\nThis thing was that that that is supposed to be Diana Ross she didn't have a huge ... she had like a big long\nNo no but she also hair like last year she was known to dress up market of Leon wigs and I would imagine that probably if you look through it that's probably a look on stage at one point for Diana Ross\nSo there's there's nothing to apologize here there's no such thing as a lack of faith was never OK well listen blackface I Can't believe it I watch Turner classic movies sometimes and I'm Amazed at the thirties how many movies have ... as like Fred Astaire\nHow did you not know\nThat this wasn't gonna play over the years it's astonishing to me but this is not blackface than others this is dressing up as somebody when white people dress up as black people because they love them because they're honoring them\nThat shit how was that not seen as progress\nAnd by the way there's no such thing as cultural appropriation sense if you don't think it's progress you probably believing that\nThis is the bond Hester doctrine two plus two equals four I didn't say they're usually isn't cultural appropriation I didn't say that there isn't nearly as much as people are talking about I said what I meant and here it is there is no\nSuch thing as cultural appropriation let's do this research is [noise]\nAnd after careful calculation it's called Georgia staff wow\nWe'll\nOut from the time [noise] uh no no no not unless\nThere's a could be a Detroit Georgia set about UGA or the bulldogs would be a bulldog story that could be but not exclusively again and again and people are always asking this uh these are not this is not an excuse to get into a whole lot of ... stories [laughter]\nWe're talking about George you know the state in the United states of America not Georgia the country once\nA a Soviet satellite so now that we've got all that straight Jared ...\nWhy don't you give me some Georgia stuff headlines are well voting rights health care and the illegal immigration dominated the tens debate between Bryan Kim uh Stacey Abrams in had met last night on public broadcasting there was a fire drill\nA yes they're coughing I Believe was a sound flicker\nAre aligned\nSummit Monica I was listening to it other than that [laughter] um okay so they got past that\nYes they did how far into this I've only heard clips this morning I Want to say I I listen to the first five minutes of it I think it happened just after that 'cause I remember hearing a hearing some of the music and stuff that was\nPlaying once again as we said before you building maintenance and broadcasting need to be on the same page if you do you want\nAn hour every four years beyond the same page [laughter]\nAs far as when the fire drills go off a but go ahead what did they can't argue with what did they accused one another of\nWell Brian Kemp of course says he's not trying to suppress the vote he looked at the numbers minority participation in Georgia is a twenty three percent then he goes on the attack against a hold on hold on\nFor someone to deal with that have you ever saying anything about the voter suppression I Do a\nReality is another suppression is not simply about being told no he's not being told it's going to be hard to cast a ballot and that's the deeper concern that I have because under his eight years of leadership Mr Kemp has created an atmosphere of fear around the right to that in the state of Georgia\nPersonal Stacey Abrams you do not have a deeper concern about that you know this is baloney you've done some research just told you that it's a a decent thing to ban the about I've met you you're smart you know the reality the situation is that there's absolutely no voter suppression\nGoing on there is a ridiculous point at the end there this is the part where if you want to find out that something is absolutely cartoonish\nAnd foolish you just sees on the most cartoonish part of it and just say well just like butter I could spread this over the rest of the toast here because at the end she says ah it's theory spreading fear\nProduce the produce the voters produce please for me a room full of voters horse or do I vote\nI care I feel I have a civic duty I'm frightened [laughter] ours these people I'm afraid I heard Donald Trump's going to be there and he's going to throw me into a van and suddenly somewhere else you're going to do that [laughter]\nWhat is just as a as a voter\nDemand things be sensible\nLet me just break it down have you ever met\nAnybody in the state of Georgia who said I'd vote but I'm too scared [laughter]\nBad pothole on away in my polling place I ride I might get a flat Tyre\nRight I mean a flat tire and that and then\nShe says uh uh she says more about uh how hard how difficult for minorities campus making if\nYou have a federal judge held Mr Kemp accountable for the exact match systems and two thousand and sixteen that has the same system where just debating today whether it's fifty three thousand or five thousand is at our five ... five and the origins are being denied the right to vote for afraid of the right to vote and they had on his on friday and says apologize\nI'm Sorry she was actually took time to stop her because the\nThe overhead a extinguishers gone off [laughter] sorry it's raining and raining for the rest of the debate [laughter] innocent ... as far as this goes and I got plenty of stuff on campus well he he's not talking he's making no sense as well here you go on voting\nVon Hester doctrine we're here to entertain you but we're also hearing resolve problems it's this simple\nEvery polling place if you have a very small traffic light traffic polling place you have one machine for this high traffic maybe two or three everybody who walks through the door is allowed to vote if there's any question\nAbout whether they're action lined up illegally then you go to the one the machine that we know is going to be audited\nWhen the election's over this is how it works if the person wins by two percent\nAnd all the votes on these other machines add up to a point zero or just point five percent\nThan all you do is you just off of them for the record so that you have good records\nIf you have a vote that is with in the margin of how many people voted on these machines then both campaigns get involved and it's a a super scrubbing fine tooth comb each campaign can contest this or that\nAnd you know what Ninety nine percent of the time you won't get there\nBecause usually the amount this one by is going to be more of a percentage that all the people who voted in these machines but says the answer you have no problem on the spot you don't have Seventy year old a poll workers who have to deal with irate people who think that they should be able to vote but they're now off the polls\nThis happened to me wants to ... years ago in New York state I'd moved in with my mom briefly and I didn't I thought that I was registered to vote at this place this is New York state or they just sent me over to give me a provisional ballot right two months later I got letters that it didn't count\nWhen I go to I Can't go find that Seventy year old poll worker and yell at that person now\nThere are answers to this I did the same thing I feel that a provisional ballot yeah and it was like oh they didn't they ... years actually ah my counted yeah that probably 'cause I'm like yeah well wait a minute why am I\n[laughter] I didn't like it or they they let us get the camp so I can not OK and whatever the paper whatever so the big attack obviously paper tiger that's not right that is a China\nSo the big attack obviously on campus him is the accusation that he is suppressing the vote so this was his counter to that said this is all a distraction to take away from is Abrams extreme agenda that she has for\nA government takeover of healthcare morning to get a scholarship to those that are here illegally in many many other radicalization having to raise taxes for Thirteen thousand dollars per person in our state are you for all of this\nYou know I didn't I didn't hear the whole thing so uh what I really hope is that there was a ... there was a point in their

assume someone listed in right now just got a a a ten percent raise it works\nOr they're going to have some extra money every two weeks if you have an extra three hundred dollars a week that you can save a thirty five year old guy ... five year old woman yeah what what should I Do with that excess cash\nYeah so one of the biggest problems people have is going to have some debt that I think I should pay off I could draw more money in the four one K. should I start saving for my kids' education maybe five young kids\nAnd so the goal is having a very clear idea where every dollar goes you have some extra money the first question is do you actually have boring liquid cash sitting right now most people don't\nMost thirty five year olds I meet with have a few hundred dollars in savings and they're putting money in their four one K. but when a crisis happens they swipe their credit card\nAnd it becomes this vicious cycle so the first thing to look at is\nDo I have some liquid savings I recommend three months and it's boring right but once you get that\nYou knock out the bad debt then you can start saying I'm going to take that extra money and put it into long term things but one thing I'd recommend is make sure you have some fun to pick an amount that fits for that long term but then also open I caught an opportunity funds it's guilt free money I mean was the last time that you swipe your card\nFor something totally fun and didn't have that little pang of regret like I could have been saving that are so you've got to ask Chris Burns your financial question or set up a

you up a little bit okay he's lying [laughter] how do I know he's lying because if he meant Illinois screwed I just said it I'm governed by the FCC we didn't believe it\nSo that's why he's lying if he

stuff I've been looking at lately you know I watched that reveals network sometimes 'cause I get into them the uh the murder porn\nStrain I call it murder porn you mean an ID networks announced on ideas like that real does the same thing so it's like it's all not just a murder but death\nAnd I don't know it's really weird because I'm not into\nHorror movies or anything like that but I these shows that like celebrity autopsies and uh you know like oh yeah and it is\n[laughter] so have you on satellite or like the the the Peterson's ... drew and the other guy he beat her ... yeah there's like there's there's none of the same time there was two guys there's a drew Peterson and then the other guy in California\nPeterson and so you end up watching these things and and you start binge watching well now those commercials that\nCome on Geraldo Rivera who in general I like I just find this to be really disgusting it's got to show coming unreal it's called a murder in the family\nSo only the only does in any of these shows is celebrities who have had family members murdered and then we go do and there's a commercial I\nI guess I'll Try to do it tomorrow because enough time I'm sure I can easily find that there's a commercial I guess the first ones about Jennifer Hudson the uh American Idol yeah she had a real trend yeah I mean yeah just murder like crazy and and there's a commercial about it this like very flippant\n[noise] you know how real is does those commercials hey I saw that a prince was locked in his bedroom for six weeks by his father to get us and they have this kind of Marshall's and they're doing that with this new Geraldo show hey I heard Jennifer Hudson ... so and so's were murdered in there and then Geraldo walks in and goes you know in every family that I'm thinking\nI I Know I'm wrong but I think wow would've Jennifer Hudson is just like flipping around through the channels and people are being flippant about the fact that her loved ones were murdered and I just it just seemed\nYou'd have to have direct TV you don't think Jennifer Hudson has direct TV I think she probably still is cable you know she's very successful and well she's just linger yeah you don't think she's got a [laughter] ... ...\n... well what I mean ultimately just real says only on direct TV right yes\nSo maybe she's over at a friend's house\nWhat the hell is this

Collins\nSoros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a decade\nWhen he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush to joke we don't know who did it\nWe have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been tone deaf and failing to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nHow many women have been confronted and restaurants movie theaters how many times as this happened with you know the chanting and the restaurants with with politicians in their wives even this weekend with McConnell happened twice that Ted Cruz\nOver conspiracy TV MSNBC there just despicable insinuating that suspicious packages can be tied back to the Trump himself and at the intended recipient of all been criticized by the president\nYou've got to be kidding me is this how twisted let's just take the rhetoric of of who they are every day just last\nNight alone I played a bunch of tapes of you know lower thirds of the president he's a liar he says is he's a lawyer fraud this\nI'm Sorry the president flat out by saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election it gets hotter life changes this story again except for going to get sort of actually the president thinks you're stupid things people are stupid clear efficiently and the parents and in fact frame than\nPresident Trump tries to play with his base with like also\nNot even trying to hide his life anymore you just have fun\nAll right Paul so not even trying to hide it slides anymore he just putting all out there he's spreading a lot of lines about non why is this all you hear\nEvery single day from the mainstream media lies about why look ... look this is every election season you get it\nThat we did have an incident if you recall when Steve ... another's the shooting took place in the ball field and I actually I remember saying and I asked my staff to go back and find what did I say when we found out that the gunman or the person responsible for the shooting the nearly killed Steve ... was a Bernie Sanders supporters is what I said\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him so it's Ryan McCarthy and ...\nAnd this individual this assailant that we're now getting information on that you shared by zone and Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to condemn it because he was a Sanders supporter suppose\nWhat they want but you know what that they do it I don't blink Bernie Sanders of course not they would say would blame us yes of course I I Want to say you know Rush Limbaugh the radio in the in Oklahoma City bombing and you know they've got their ... ...\nWhat is it because these guys are convinced the left that by ratcheting up their rhetoric that they can get away with it and make it a free pass nobody didn't matter if they do it so here's what you have today right here in Washington DC\nAnd attempted assassination I Hope it's not and I'm praying that you know he's in as we know Shawn he isn't very serious very very critical supported earlier that he was upgraded a critical condition and upgraded from critical to good but he's been critical it's worth their while he was in stable\nYeah unstable conditions you get the point of what I did back I ... you can't blame or any of that\nNor can you blame any conservative but we don't know what the motivation is just it's all conjecture and that was being used as a political weapon to bludgeon\nTalk radio Fox and Trump it's just outrageous 'cause that's not who we are what what did I say yesterday about George Soros I won't play it again now but I said hey not this has to stop George Soros spends millions of dollars paying groups to get me off the air\nWe that's not how we settle political differences you know when the sun is out there apparently blaming Donald Trump Trump does not responsible for packages that might have bombs and anthrax or rice in in it\nIt's ridiculous you don't see why you know let me play Hillary Clinton today and Hillary Clinton just what a week ago what's what's his compare\nYou know not criminal ripple political party that wants to [noise] try\nWhat you found for what you care about the only thing that the Republican whom to recognize average [laughter] crank and mine of\nDeep divisions and we have to have to do everything we everything we can bring our country to get together\nBut we weren't supposed to be several ... a week later unless it an Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York you know we must be civil where Americans All right that's not what he was saying a while back when he talked about conservatives that live in New York people like me listen\nToppling this not me and they themselves are they the stream and show but it was like why\nIs it that they are because actually the extreme conservative [laughter] so that's not\nThe end of the day we may have political differences but this is one country we're all Americans he pluribus unum out of many one and keeping the debate and the dialogue civil\nLaw is very very important for elective leaders who in many ways set the tone\nIs especially important\nOh they're not New Yorkers there's no place in the state of the New York if you're pro life pro Second Amendment I happen to be libertarian on issues involving sexuality so it's not my issue\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it tell you a little story so I had this ... and and\nWendell lived through this window you know we're still very great friends with police who worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things and we're really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her in Washington when we were last there right yeah we just saw\nUm it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office and Fox right\nYeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over and the sad thing is and she was an isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even it was just horrible for her and she was cordoned off we went\nTwo or even it was just horrible for her and it just was cordoned\nOff we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us than we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being a one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that\nYou know about I mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah but I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one\nParticular person at another network I won't say who\nWhat was going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to get my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people\nAt restaurants and attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spent on you or threaten you or follows you I've had them all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama safe when he was president we gotta keep up for our politicians have whoever did this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do is there any\nConservative once anything to do with but this rush to judgment we don't know one thing yet who's responsible I immediately that trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat as I said well the president says fake news", "show_name":
