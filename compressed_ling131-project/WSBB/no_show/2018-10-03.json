desire that's very toxic for your equity\nSee the online valuation model is confusing most real estate agents and homeowners as to the true value of their home in today's market in other words the estimate the automated valuations on truly a realtor dot com and other Web sites including these will buy your home companies are all too low\nBut you've been accustomed to looking at that for the last few years and it being fairly accurate\nWill now those sites are far behind using sales from six twelve months ago which are substantially lower ten to twenty percent in some cases than your current home's value\nThey come out they make you an offer in that range you sign a contract they didn't beat you up in the inspection charge you eight to twelve percent and fees and before long you sold your home partially unwittingly for thirty percent less than it's actually worse\nDon't fall for those scams get an online valuation instantly right now at house hunting online dot com that's

good people\nThat ever want to say yes to get positions like this I wouldn't say yes who wants to live through this\nWell I think the contrast asked a question here said there's a report out today or poll out today that at the FBI supplemental background check doesn't change things sixty percent of the people leave the judge Kevin I should be on the bench so if it if that doesn't you know all I can say is it the stakes are high\nWho would follow Kavanaugh after this they will destroy everything we stand for Republicans if we legitimize this it only happens to why is it always just us\nThis is a time to fight back stand behind Kavanaugh getting the votes he needs he's a great judge and destroy what I think it's been a process that will destroy the country\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions or you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been mirrored in slandered or by all the right people just so yeah I mean people that hate me too so I don't\nKnow I don't think you find out later on I don't think you had a finer moment and all the years I've known you and you know we've had disagreements over land a keg

they know and they all ended up being wrong because they rush to judgment\nAnd maybe with the FBI investigation and the disaster is interview on NBC yesterday maybe now people will understand that it's falling apart and people's names character reputations families they bludgeoned for political\nReasons or a good friend Amy Kramer is checking in with us a Amy Hi how are you you're wonderful daughter Kiley is now joined our team here on the Sean Hannity showed the G give you the back number or did you call in and actually get it wrong [laughter]\n[laughter] oh shot I Hope you all can handle or she's a little firecracker and thanks for taking care of her at their\nAge is doing right we love and and I was wondering\nI appreciate you and I ... and the teams that Sean I have to tell you something I never in my life expected to be on the same page with when the grants and inviting had one of our ...\nSame page with Lindsey Graham and inviting him to one of our of that and actually we've done that this week um he's he just I mean he ... with us all last week that he not\nWell I think ... ... ... you know and that's another thing well he doesn't have the temperament now if you if you're accused of gang rape and accused of sexual assault and you're innocent\nHow was the what is the proper way to act was supposed to be monotone of guys I didn't do this so it's just not true I mean because as his wife is crying behind him as his daughter is saying to him pray for this woman and it ... it right innocent\nAnd the half the country and these people they don't care they don't care who they destroy in the process of accumulating power\nAnd honestly it doesn't matter what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and I and I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh could have been anybody this is much bigger it's about than stopping the Supreme Court\nConfirmation that's what it's all about they're willing to do anything to stop it and these liberal women these he kept wearing liberals women out there speaking like they speak for all women they don't they absolutely do not end when the\nPress in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um this cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we are the ones first sixty six and I think these women have been fighting the vote\nWomen were the ones that elected Donald Trump's women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the end of it turns and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kinda that\nTogether and we're pushing back on all of this and said they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the whether or not I looked at said it's going to hold a vote and a big Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue\nWhat is it your lovely the that convinces them he's not qualified for the job you know the guy admits that he drank he liked to drink he drink beer still likes to drink beer is sometimes drink more beer that he should have drank\nAnd then people say what he must have blocked out we know we did he's a liar he's perjure right and now they want to investigate an ice throwing incident at some game you know back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I can tell you what were the one and two days\nAnd that is we're having a win for Trump or first ever conference here in Washington DC it's limited for America first heels on ... and women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to be folded are supported the president and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd Thursday were taken a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most conservatives are working but we're going to take a trip and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote\n'em to support to confirm Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings this vote on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our conference\nSo I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may but no I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report\nAnd when that happens maybe it'll happen for tonight when that gets an ounce will senators will get to read it and then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote and we'll see where people come down on this shouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions they don't make recommendations they just they interviewed\nPerson a B C D E F G and but in every case there's no corroboration in every single case\nAfter case there's inconsistencies and every single case is very problematic and all I'm saying is is if this is successful we will never ever get good people ever in\nThis cone average look like do want to do anything publicly why should de\nSean I completely agree it's a political ... job and we need to stand up and make sure Republicans\nDo the right thing and confirmed hand so glad to see Lindsey Graham\nStaying with us with the president and fight back for a change instead of playing on the terms that the Democrats set so um I Hope that they keep up this fight and confirm Kavanaugh weekend anybody that's out there that wants to join us this weekend we'd love to have them and that just keep up the fight\nWhy not this weekend we'd love to have them and that just keep up the fight\nRight thank you so much for being with us we are very proud of collie is now part of the Sean Hannity show and she's the one that's

on WSBIU recently said this is the worst time ever to buy a house in metro Atlanta here's the question everybody may be asking is Clark Howard right this time\nWell the answer is unfortunately Clark nailed it I've been saying this for a while to prices are becoming too high\nWe are outpacing income growth throughout metro Atlanta and the markets clearly getting overheated most people don't realize this this will blindsided many buyers over the next year it's a rough time to buy unless you're gonna stay in that house in this market for about the next ten years then don't worry about it\nBut if you think you might need to sell in four or five years not a good time to buy by contrast and I wrote about this this specific phenomenon\nOf it being a terrible time to buy and a great time to sell in my recent book that's coming out soon the intelligent homeowner\nIf you log in any way on our website at the real estate experts dot com I'll get you a free copy if you want one just

never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be I'd be the world's worst\nAnd people love that even the trade group for standing behind him all friendly for an hour well he took questions Tucker girls Tucker you're you're very interesting because as much as you're into the traditional\nWashington speak as as a way it's always done you wide open to doing something to do with taking in Trump and noticing rather than judging notice he's doing things different but saying not necessarily he's doing things wrong that's different than a lot of a lot of Republicans in a lot of Democrats why you open to that\nBecause it's needed because the decisions that the people in charge made have been disastrous not just small decisions but big decisions on the economy and foreign policy on the culture they haven't worked that's why the middle class is dying that's what Trump got elected\nThat's the best part of the downside of Trump as he doesn't know how to get things done because he doesn't understand government doesn't care about details but the best part\nIs his willingness to say obviously through things like maybe we should secure the borders or what are we still doing in Afghanistan or why are the other signatories toward trade deals not living up to their end of the bargain et cetera those are all totally true things that everybody agrees with except in Washington or the people who made the decisions are embarrassed to admit they're wrong\nTrump takes a lotta crap for not apologizing that's a fair criticism but how about the policymakers who got us into all this garbage in the first place where they apologize never what they learn from their mistakes nothing I mean do you know what I'm saying like that's the best part about Trump is telling obvious truth is\nI always knew you as an opinion guy did Daily Caller as part of that you know so do you decide to launch that uh and it's doing shit credibly well it's on everyone's punch list in the morning you at three o'clock in the morning for me later for you to find out what's happening new and get a perspective\nBut the other thing is you choose to do something almost nobody else does you choose to book and engage people that disagree with you usually open how did you come to that or was that a no brainer for you is that a producer they told you that this you want to have to defend your argument in your a block almost every night\n[noise] no I mean that's organic that's what I Believe it I mean I'm very liberal in the truest sense of liberal I Believe in free speech and the free exchange of ideas I Believe an openness I really do\nI don't I'm exactly the same on the air as I'm off the air I only say what I really think I you may think I'm a total buffoon maybe you're right but it's sincerely who I Am and I think that you should if you're advocating for something explain what it is you're advocating for\nExplaining reasoning what exactly are you saying these are not hard things you seek to influence public policy and the weigh three hundred million people live their lives you should have to explain it I I sincerely believe in that it's a core belief\nBut you also research you're not just winging it and going on instinct you are to defend your argument but you research and go to ... you can go deep on your argument you can go layers deep you're not going to just out a out yell somebody\nWell yeah but I mean the the good news for me is I control what the terms are so\nDecided what we talked about and I don't know I don't know much about the law the sea treaty or abstract art so we don't do a lotta segments on those things which is a shame it is a shame actually I'm I'm against both just for the record right but we do topics that I care about that I think are really important immigration is one of them and I don't know that's what I'm paid to do is to learn about stuff so I Do\nWrite you you're the one who gets paid I did not know who that was so we did break here on the topic of the name of the book and we're going to talk about this uh of on as long as the book is a out and you want to come back\nBut you look at the Democratic party and under a minute and you said this thing has changed I get this is a different debate we're having I asked you sent TV Patel wait until the radio audience the bottom\nLine is it's a mirror image of what it was when I grew up and the things that they once defended free speech due process colorblindness they now attack why 'cause now they are in power\nWell [noise]\nHe's pointing it out now many other presidents just sit there and ... and go to town but Blumenthal has been the most sanctimonious if you lie once uh what else can you trust somebody by doing he's actually saying that\nTo a Brett Kavanaugh so we're we're we might be I I Know I'm a hundred percent right in saying we cannot be a micro analyzing his high school and college days where you were did not at a transgression when it comes to the law when you talk about in Nineteen eighty five story where someone said that he threw ice in a bar and was questioned\nFive story where someone said that he threw ice in a bar and was questioned by police they had no problem with it that is no reason you can't be a Supreme Court justice and spend thirty three years uh in the ... in in the in the legal system in the law in the community have his reputation so\nA couple of things when it comes down to the actual vote itself\nIt's got to come down to Murkowski Collins and flick so Senator Jeff flake asked say I've been to vote this out of committee but I'm going to give it seven days by friday I Want to investigation and then we'll move forward or not depending on what they find try to read between the lines I sense he's hedging cut seven\nDoes no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out how we have to realize that we may not be able to find out everything we've got to do some investigation\nYeah what does that mean now to the president's credit according to the Washington Post and he said it publicly I said to these I told the FBI expand if you have to you know whenever you have to get fall which you have to follow now that said you were a person who comes out and sat down with\nKate Snow of NBC her story is almost farcical it's a bad fiction novel\nI challenge you to listen to her speak and not have all the all the fire alarms in your head go off and say not telling the truth not telling the truth not telling the truth sadly if she was the victim of of ah what she claims is\nA group set on unwanted group sex\nThat is terrible but she cannot link Kavanaugh's to the scene that he had a red card that he would end to women that leads to punch was spiked out of high school party\nThat he was around the punch bowl\nIs that going to be okay with you can your life would stand these types of wild cat allegations so Lindsey Graham looked at this is seeing how this has developed obviously he knows Kavanaugh for Twenty years fan of 'em on every level and says this cut their team\nI don't think we're going to find anything new from the supplemental FBI investigation to take Jeff from a yes or no I think a calf cancer Collins want to make sure that the FBI\nDid their homework to check the committee's work that that ... yeah that that are were was good I think that's what this is all about no more not expanding it to all this crazy stuff\nNow listen ... Lindsey Graham has got to do something that they used to do that you would expect which college did when I think he would just sit down with her and say listen you're Republican forget about this guy the sexual assault thing does not stand up it wouldn't stand up to a relative in your house or a good friend of yours you would not accept it\nSo you saw his record you see President Bush making calls and constantly surprised backing them thoroughly pride Blakeman who work with them every single day you see the people that know him\nDon't get caught up and pay back for not ceding talking to Merrick Garland that is what the foundation of this\nAnd a lot of these people are liberals and see a change in the court and the change in the country if he ceded and they're willing to say yeah I saw him drunk maybe it was having a few beers and the whole way doesn't mean he did anything wrong\nAnd Deborah Ramirez says I have some people that will cooperate my story will see because if you're going to corroborate your story maybe you should have told the New Yorker because it didn't come up in the New Yorker magazine story a jealousy our news Ninety six five and a window Hey Joe\nHey yeah obviously the Democrats a realtor ... but I Do want to point out that when you're accused of the criminal act you should take the fifth and I think the judge was really stupid to uh give any testimony regarding this\nReally I don't think he had a choice what he wanted to lower the constitution but\nHe would say this is a criminal act as a ship or the ...\nI don't get ... what's the what's the point of view there you are in other words but if you're innocent till proven guilty and you're innocent why wouldn't you use that opportunity to show your innocent\nOr the point of the Fifth Amendment is to put it on the prosecution\nI'm not even talking about it\nBut you know we're not in a criminal proceeding\nNot in a criminal proceeding he's in he's testifying on his background where there was one of his three hundred nine cases or as a ten year was eight years with President Bush or his use on the on the circuit court\nThis is one of ... and now it's personal behavior these are just questions it's beyond a job interview which was supposed to be I get that but you can't say it's a criminal behavior I mean criminal proceeding\nThanks so much for the call or nobody should have taken the fifth I I don't understand from that um [noise] so ... there's there's a lot going on here the person that makes the most sense who isn't just a right wing zealots and a right wing\nOh since who isn't just a right wing zealots and a right wing or defense counsel is Lindsey Graham he has a really good idea he's if they want to mix\nThis entire thing if they want to just say oh we're not going to pass him if these Republicans will get on board we know this is ... by Jeff Flake he is out so he will not be a problem in the new uh with the new term\nWe know it's probably going to be Senator Rick Scott so that won't be a problem he will probably be chairman is Senator Lindsey Graham of the uh of the judicial branch of the judicial committee\nOf justice committee so it looks like grass is going to step aside and he basically says why don't we put it to the American people again let's decide who could control the Senate cuts Fifteen\n... an appeal from a political body to the people who put a the air\nAnd sea at these Trump state that elected President Trump and do exactly what he's doing I'm cutting taxes and appointing conservative judges they're okay with the decision there senator I don't think we're going to get there I think we're going to get fifty plus but if we found one vote short for the good of the nation\nI Would appeal to the people of the country and let them have a say\nAt the ballot box Joe listening in Boston Joe\nHey Ryan it's just it seems so profoundly juveniles if they're going back to high school and seeing how many beers\nYeah yeah and also the same time really hypocritical when in the last administration you had a president that admitted to cocaine use in his own books in that it at that age yeah exactly exactly so apparently you can't be a Supreme Court justice but you're going to be the guy that picks a Supreme Court shows\nThat is a great point which I'm not brought up before now some of the media say that he no longer has the credibility of the accuser it's about Kavanaugh approving his credibility which I think is scaring\nThe White House does say they will expand the investigation but they're not going to just look into how much he drank in college to look at incidents and it's not clear if he's going to talk to said you work or not\nBut they are talking obviously Deborah Ramirez all ready to talking to mark judge right now they're going to talk to Patrick Smith they could have done that already I imagine there are always going to talk to that woman ... who was friends with a doctor forward when they were younger ah I'm not sure how much further they gonna go\nCarl is you know like K O L T and Scott's bluff Nebraska Carl\nHello Brian love your show thanks so much Lewis honored\nYou back or just wanted to mention that uh the remember a Senator Reid out at a batter during the wrong the election and he brought up thing that he had information that they had ever pay taxes\nAnd it was not totally fall and if\nYou're totally false and in the end a reporter finally asked him about it some time after the election and his response was well he did get elected ... that's exactly what's going on here [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean in that idiot Harry Reid or from the Democratic perspective decides to make it a simple majority and nuclear option getting these judges passed\nAnd because of that now you have Trump doing the fifty one fifty one votes these judges get through despite the ... hour delay of game\nPer nominee from a Schumer and now it's Supreme Court justice you could have the new you have the nuclear option or else they would really have sway in this process because you would need sixty votes but that was all Harry Reid's a bad play Chuck loose on W. L. A. D. and Poughkeepsie New York hey Chuck\n[noise] yes which any Milo\nWill tell you my truck\nOh yes I Want to talk about the FBI\nSeventh investigations yep they've done six before as I'm told everybody stole you know what I say is that if they turn up something now or the seventh what does this say about the other six\nWarner of which are more willing to watch for them with our with their arms and legs of the president of the United states and all of world visitors for very long time\nSo I Would go back and look at the shortly somebody ought to go back and look at the previous six ah requires that they spin through\nWelcome to the Washington Post the president was not happy according to his advisors they cannot talk show which tentatively about drinking with his last hearing a and at the news conference Trump was somewhat under caught\nMight've horse was years ago but I still feel a connection with every guy that hires Cornell Cornell\nContact the domestic litigation from of Cordell in Cornell to schedule an appointment with one of our firms had Lana area attorneys partner men can count on for zero four seven nine three zero zero zero zero online at Cornell Cornell dot com that's Cordell Cordell dot com\nOffice it was Sandy Springs pay a bill Lawrenceville and Marietta\nCordell in Cordell one Glenn parkway northeast sweet nine Seventy five and a leather Georgia three zero three to eight\nThat when you asked me about ... er Cox media group station\n[noise] twenty four hour news weather and primary\nFive and am\nMe to\nKnow [noise]\nGot boring it's two o'clock I'm or cable line live from the W.

are well what do you refer to notice mark judge Joe you're\nYou know what I Wonder if anybody's NBC thinking or when they do the ... yeah ... exactly but so are are they are are they setting her up to go out and embarrass yourself for are they trying to sort of root for her to somehow work her way out of this\nKind of what is wrong I didn't pay the big the here's the smoking as the cuts are due to\n[noise]\nI got I got one to ever yeah let's listen to this one\nI was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault I Won it with horrible\nEveryone is wondering if one of those people\nI can not specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me\nIf you can't rule him out you you ... you use hailed yeah he's guilty if you can't rule out he can't be on the spring quite well\nI agree we have no choice guilty is you have is number ... ... let's say this is horrible if this happened to her and I don't believe anything she says because none of it seems credible but if this happened to urge terrible why she went to a party with a with groups ... going on ten times\nIs also worthy of a question you know I just thought of something also you know where was\nHe a the day that uh OJ Simpson didn't kill his wife right exactly you're right I think I think I mean I think you know ... and\n... what about all the time she didn't try to kill her [laughter] it wasn't get credit for that if the glove doesn't fit you must acquit right so if as long as there's nobody in her life that knows how well the thing she might be up to something I'm willing to believe Julie sweat Nick so what you see what her ex boyfriend thinks cut thirty three\nIf you ask me personally I Believe for a I don't believe that you know personally I don't believe her I really don't believe her no one knows better I mean nobody knows Julie so that I mean and I'm you know he said that the ones but the fact that I Know and that's what I came here to tell the truth I mean I Know how she is\nYeah okay uh as you have any more to say Richard ... thirty four\nYou know she was always wanted to be the center of attention on the show it was way to do something major show us went to practically wherever since she was telling me that she was joining everything if anybody knows Julie on the person I mean I Know because I knew what her\nChris or what we should all understand what we're going to get back from the FBI we're going to get a series of interviews\nAnd we're not necessarily get conclusions we're not going to say well it's actually more judges lying is um it's not going to be Ford is not ... not lying is going to be this is what we discovered in the interviews and the cooperation\nAnd the follow up but if you're going to lead a lot to interpretation which means a lot of grandstanding on the Senate floor regardless football ethic\nBut again you know we don't care about the opinions of Ninety five a hundred senators um they they were spoken for before now look\nThe way I Know that but they don't know that they keep saying the same thing over and over again this is Chris Coons is actually thinking about voting for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd he might not\nChris Coons actually might he's he's quite moderate and\nIf if the FBI comes back with a clean bill of health I don't know whether we talked about this last week or not but what happened with this FBI pro is the chances went up that Brett Kavanaugh would be cute and the Trump would have to pick Amy Coney Barrett or ... or another of the twenty four ah judges who are on his short list\nNot a very short list uh so the chances of that happening went up but what also went up where the chances that Kavanaugh would be confirmed with fifty five or fifty six votes with a bipartisan vote and that\nWent up because if the FBI comes back and says look we looked into everything here we can't find cooperation to prove or disprove this yes and they and and that's what they get if if we get back to\nA there is no evidence there is no way to corroborate their story in any way\nUh there's no evidence there is no way to corroborate their story in any way then we're back\nTo the chance that a cabinet and gets a bunch of democratic votes I looked at a poll out of North Dakota that was yesterday a Heidi Heitkamp to the poll said two things uh Heidi Heitkamp is not going to be a U.S senator for a lot longer but it also said that um the issue this is a galvanizing focusing issue\nFor a Republican and independent voters in red states\nWatching this happen has put a Joe Manchin has put Claire McCaskill has put Joe Donnelly in a very difficult positions\n[noise] interesting because Joe Donnelly came out right before Jeff Flake to reverse course and said not voting for him\nSo he took a bit of a political risk now now they're back and play that well I might change my mind he might change his mind but Chris but Chris you should know this I I always think Kevin guys like Chris Coons to be sober and in ... but Chris Coons wasn't no before it turns out\nBrett Kavanaugh drank in high school he was yeah that would change is by now that he yelled at him\nKnow that uh if flake so here's the thing about good well\nUm if people are are preferred belief about politics and our preferred belief about Washington and our preferred belief about the Senate\nIs it has been informed by a deep deep cynicism and I mean rank but Chris Coons is a guy who he got through ... he he was worried about having a primary challenge this year but he represents a state that's very moderate Delaware is has a strong preference for moderation ... no no extreme is a a\nProsper in Delaware politics and I I Would say this\nIs Jeff Flake extends to good well to Chris Coons to say you know what you're right and by the way\n... and fight for right if the Republicans would have tried to jam through a and start a votes of falling off the side as you get down to decision time Murkowski Collins or maybe others say I can't do it that's a real catastrophe I'm also a catastrophe for Republicans would have been\nGrinding it through with all the dad still in the air grinding it through with Mike Pence casting the deciding vote\nThis was a good this was a good compromise for the Republicans what somebody like Coons wants to do is generate goodwill so you go from a no vote to a ... vote to potentially really a yes vote if the FBI investigation comes back and their background check and they say now we got nothing\n[noise] uh you know what I think you're right in and of Jeff Flake if he is or if he is a conservative he might not be but I think he is a conservative who doesn't like Donald Trump which happens to people like George Will and others I get it if he if he's a conservative\nBrett Kavanaugh hits it it out of the park\nIf you're like George Bush and John McCain Brett Kavanaugh hits out of the park she like Lindsey Graham all off it goes against his party Brett Kavanaugh is not Donald Trump junior so don't worry about it so if he if he legitimately just wants to make sure he didn't insult the woman in high school\nThen I think capital is fine but listen to a Newt Gingrich\nA concluded and he knows how to make deals\nThey talked about this deal that comes to my coach cannot\nI mean Republicans sometimes have this passion for being stupid prank got nothing out of ... nothing so comes playing this game really bipartisan\nLet me see how Henry people often young Republicans would you please help me off a little bit because I feel so much better when you take advantage of people that there's a reason people get fed up with a stuff\nLindsey Graham leave that on a while ago\nHis me most affecting the Judiciary Committee told the truth and I think we have the ... American people got to stand up and say they don't want a country that has dominated by these kinds of people and I think it's a really serious threat\nThought that was new to that that's what I see and I didn't see the you know and and I think Scott ... great but I just wanted one question if he turned out to pass this FBI background report over the next seven days would you vote for him would your colleagues vote for him because the answer is no\nThat's the honest answer Blumenthal is that changing his mind nice size that changing your mind you know not ...\nBut can I call can I call a little malarkey call here so and um when\nUh people in and people in both parties do this and they say if only everyone would just do what I say then we will win if if only everyone would simply follow what their follow the the instructions and do what they're supposed to do then we will just went well guess what that's not the system\nThat's not how that goes yes obviously if the Republican there are fifty four I told you we talked before about the fifty for for this was really surprising to me um and it tells you something about our politics fifty four percent of Republicans said even if Brett Kavanaugh tried to rape but girl when he was in high school that he should still be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nBecause the argument here is nothing matters anymore just winning just smashing them in the mouth now the overwhelming majority of Americans say no no no no no we have three hundred and twenty five million people we don't need a guy who tried to rape or grow in high school or\nNeed a guy who tried to grow in high school or on the Supreme Court there are other options at hand\nAnd but the fact that we're at a point here\nWhere both sides embrace this concept of right or wrong just do it for your team and smashed the other guy in the mouth is ridiculous because that's not in Lisa Murkowski's interest that's not in Jeff Flake centrist that's not in Susan Collins interest nor Joe mansions nor Dean Heller nor a bunch of members\nSo one of the fiction that frequently gets sold to members of both parties is that the answer here is that everybody just quit thinking lash themselves together and go ... like a wrecking ball into the other side whatever the issue that's not how the Senate is supposed to work\nOr I Want you to hear or I Want you to hear what we heard yesterday let's listen\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running you know not attract and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to party there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nEvery bit of moral fiber a more you know what to say well he acted morally what was his conscience he couldn't do it any more he said well\nYou know the fact that I'm retiring is all allowed me to take on my party if I say I would never do it I I'm I was thrown out of my mouth\nIsn't that sad I Would I Would only do the right thing because I'm retiring yeah\nAnd that and that is maybe he didn't mean it that way maybe he meant it differently somehow but the take away what it really sounds like as a man who admits that he would have been craven otherwise\nAnd that is not a good look that is an eye on it it is depressingly clear about the way that our primary system\nA has made our politics so much worse than all of this direct marketing in primaries has left us in a place where people are the these these craven vessels of ambition or rather than people who are doing the things they think are right right\nAnd that's how I'm described a ...

there are two scenarios you're going to tune in that night which one do you want\nYou get to choose if you're angry\nAbout what's happening if you like the dramatic shift in the economy if like the

thirty minutes to just think about brushing their teeth\nIt's they don't move and now you've got\nThe president literally altering shifting changing the way things have been done these breaking a lot of dishes and he's a disruptor and he's iconoclastic and he fights but when he fights against you know even allies negotiating trade deals we're benefiting\nAnd the forgotten men and women the people that matter the most two years ago they're all benefiting\nYou know I notice now Trump's lawyers and allegations of fraud tax evasion they're now trying to dig up tax returns from the father how when did Donald Trump's father die was it two decades ago\nUm he'd he'd literally took on more debt than all forty three presidents before him combined the only president in American history to never reach three percent GDP Growth\nIn here and now the Trump economy is is moving forward it was pretty interesting Hillary's favorite economist is now actually admitting that the Trump economy is roaring hot that his name is Martin is handy predicted\nIn twenty sixteen that the Trump presidency would lead lead to an economic disaster he's now saying it's rip roaring hot it was on CNBC so that's the eight years of Obama you want to go back to that are we better off as a country that we were two years ago do you want this agenda because it's not about you\nIt's not about your family's it's not about

Trump Organization Trump taxes Trump this Trump that stormy stormy this one this one it's just never going to end\nThat there'll be no focus on oh and they want the crumbs back so you get the biggest tax cut in American history American families are are benefiting to the tune of ...\nThe first real increase in real wages the American people got the first wage increase\nSince Nineteen Ninety two and now they want the crumbs back and then they won't open borders and to eliminate ice and they want to keep that great designed playing cold Obamacare member keep your doctor planning and save a whole lot of money and millions lost their doctor their plans they're paying three four times more in some states\nAnd its bankrupting them now\nIn two years because we got the largest tax cuts in history in two years because we got rid of more burdensome regulation than the last five or six presidents combined\nIn terms of the the the burdens that we place on business\nBusiness has been leaving this country even Obama recognized these jobs that they're not coming back well they're not coming back for you because they can't make any money\nWith you being president that's what his incentivized companies to leave their home country and set up shop in places like Mexico and and other places abroad now the president isn't set of eyes all these companies to come back\nAnd they're investing trillions and when they said that oh he's going to start a trade war with Mexico and Canada well now we got a significantly better\nIn a trade war with Mexico and Canada well now we got a significantly better deal than we had before which means oh auto parts of going to be made by American workers with a minimum wage of sixteen dollars an hour oh and a half to help American dairy farmers and poultry farmers\nUm that's all jobs for the for the you know look the states that had suffered the most of\nThe the ... the Wisconsin the Ohio's the Pennsylvania is they're the ones that

fewer people on food stamps since the president was elected\nWe have the largest growth in manufacturing jobs\nAre in Thirty years since the president's elected we have fourteen states record low unemployment since the president's elected if you break it down demographically record low unemployment African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce lowest level and sixty five years youth unemployment now at a a fifty five year low\nIt's all because the policies of limited government lower taxes is incentivize business to grow and grow and build factories manufacturing centers\nAnd and it's only the beginning\nBecause the president allowing pipelines to be built in the United states again finally the president opening opening up an war with the vast oil reserves resources we have there the president singlehandedly save the coal mining industry industry West Virginia are you paying attention to\n'em and and Kentucky and some other states and then of course we can drill in the United states natural gas restrictions lifted this is going to create literally millions of high paying career jobs for Americans and it will give us national security
