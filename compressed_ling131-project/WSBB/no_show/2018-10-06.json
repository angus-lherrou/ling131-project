else and know that whoever you decide to do it to your being lectured down you're the one who struck with this bill [noise]\nAnd then the third factor blows my mind I remember this is one research study\nSo there'll probably be another one later the disagrees with some of the conclusions of the author of this but the third factor is that because of all the driving in a sprawling suburban area\nThere's higher pollution than there isn't a core of a metro area\nI always thought that the corps was where the air was really dirty but it turns out that that's not the case and the dirty air is what can lead to shorter life spans as well so\nThat long commute can be costing your health and costing you three years of your life\nLarry's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Larry how are you doing\nHi Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you got a credit freeze question for me\nI Do I took your advice to help protect from identity theft Auto IV for my credit and I'm In the process of thinking about applying for another credit card\nAnd before I started off all my credit I wondered if if I just need to fall um just for one credit and just faded or do I need to fall three\nThis is a frustration of mind because you should only have to thaw one and generally\nWhen a financial institution is pulling or a credit report to decide whether to grant your credit card or not they are pulling from a single bureau because they have to pay for every time they tap into one\nAnd I have repeatedly when I've had to sell on my credit for an application for a new credit\nAdd to sell on my credit for an application for a new credit card or because I'm getting a new cell phone service or whatever I have never ever been able to get someone at customer service\nTell me what bureau they draw from and which one that I Need to thaw and so I've had to thaw all three when I open an account for somewhere where they want to pull your credit or done an application for credit and that's that's silly\nBut I just want to run a pass you first\nI think it's worth I think it's worth you though Larry giving a call to the credit card company is one of the big issue worse yes do you happen to have a card with one of them right now I Do not\nBecause many times you have access to a some equivalent of your credit score now\nFor credit cards that you have and they'll tell you you know this is based on your Equifax reporter Experian are trends union they'll tell you which one and then you know who that bank or have a pretty good idea who that bank is going to draw\nA report from for credit out\nBut without that kind of source information if no one can tell you when you call in you know 'cause sometimes Alvin number you can call in to apply for a car to over the phone there'll be separate than their regular\nCustomer know service call a number and you might have a better chance with one of those people who might well no which bureau they pull from\nAnd give us some saws and then you'd be able to thaw it just that one\nAbsolutely would receive zero night knowing that I'm Better protected from identity without much credit for is a\nGood choice to do that and if you want to know how to do it yourself if you go to Clark dot com go read our credit freeze guide and just minutes you can lock down your credit from a criminal who might decide to pretend they're un open credited counts as if they argue\nMurray is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Marie\nHigh court how're you doing\nWell and some for John ... and I come across a company that she can she Adams links to someone that okay that's a legitimate way to make some money\nPosts links so you would go on like Facebook or something and you post links to something that supposedly would generate revenue for

watch\nYeah I've never heard of that I that's why I was asking you what do you have to do so you don't have to pay anybody any money\nYes that's correct known only\nAnd what kind of links are they having you post I mean what do they need you for what is it that you're doing that they couldn't do for themselves\nI guess just you know demand maybe my my time and enjoying it can they can get around today\nHuh okay so there there is a website that I'm looking at right now that says that that is completely bogus\nOkay and they can't really odd company too\nSo it's funny it says the article

show Hi Steve\nHow are you today who raised\nThank you Steve understand your yet another person who wants to take exception with me picking on Missouri\nSafety were misinformed is what I like\nWhat was that a little background for people who didn't hear me before well no we're we're talking about I got really upset when Missouri passed a law that makes it a crime to refer to things uh by words that might have meat into them\nAnd the only exception is if something came directly from animal flash it can be called meet\nAt is putting my flight but I guess as a lifestyle for days or Missouri\nI don't want laboratory grown meat late to train in a petri dish or lack of better term fizzy he'll say that's not a seal the product that is a science fair project so [laughter]\nOkay so I got to tell you a funny thing with this friend of ours was at a lab in California\nWhere she had lab grown chicken there was genetically identical the chicken\nAnd she said it not only did it you know the food in front of her look like chicken it tasted completely like chicken and it was genetically the same as chicken and that whole concept is where this could be and if you take the Missouri thing to its full extension\nThat would not be able to be called chickens I don't know what you'd call it\nIt has to do is they according to the law and like ... ... to hit more specific\nBut according to the ... on a case like that it would have to say in a label on the label and the name of the product laboratory grown chicken they still call it ... and I think that it would have to say laboratory grow\nTo where it's not the confused with nice it was raised on a farm\nUnder the under the Missouri law though you can't even use the word meat so let's say somebody ... grows and it's completely genetically be flight from a cow meat from a cow you would\nThe cow meat from a cow you wouldn't be able to call a meat at all he would uh I don't know what you'd call it you call it lab grown now and meet meet [laughter] I mean I don't know what would you all and\nThat's the idea the livestock producers are in this area and that and other people are pretty much to pass this law being passed and it it's more solid the national level have\nSomething similar to it so the lab facilities are always thought that is not called late ... of late and this goes back to a nice lady by law\nThe late ... and is very late late has to the lake is defined as they had them all thought out\nAnd you know if it's a lab grown even if it's genetically saying grown it\nWill have to say laboratory ... lab but for for the spell\nOf water so how long you been in the cattle business\nAll my life I'm a little bit older than you I\nCould you ever imagine would even be having this conversation\nNot right [laughter] yeah

debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops and the dollars have some experts say another crashes coming you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and then I arrive from Augusta precious metals\nAnd with the reality is this has really been popularized because of a or B and B that air being be\nTaught people there could be a different way\nAnd I have traveled in so many different era being bees around the world the R B Yo's or you know and I've stayed in all these and there are certain circumstances where it's been great\nHaving that versus a traditional hotel so now the hotel industry is like way way way what about us and one of the things that's happening now\nIs hotels are responding to the fact there are people who want a more affordable 'cause there are people who go in an era being be because they wanted to be cute or different or whatever and not cookie cutter but a lot of people go there being because they wanted to be cheaper\nSo the hotel business is putting up more and more properties that have smaller rooms\nThat they're able to sell at a cheaper price and I mentioned a couple of the chains in the past ... are coming into the marketplace the first one that I think came in the U.S was\nMoxie which was a brand from Europe I think is owned by Mary odd and now I\nSaw an item and the New York times about how many hotels are popping up around the United states with an emphasis on more affordable rooms and hotel rooms used to be at one time of standard three hundred and twenty square feet\nWas oh tell room now a lot of these rooms from the new cheaper hotels or as little as a hundred and twenty square feet\nThing about that that's a ten by twelve which is a relatively small bedroom and then there you got to get the bathroom and the whole sure bang and\nI stayed at a hotel in New York that is one that has micro rooms and after the second time I stayed there I was like I Can't do this any more\n'cause I remember to get around the bad I had to turn sideways I don't know how housekeeping ever makes them a bad in it so I just want you know it's out there it is a trend in the business when you see a new hotel on the line\nThat screaming ultra low rates go a little further and see what it actually is and see if you'd be happy\nAnd see what it actually is and see if you'd be happy\nWith a micro hotel room for me no moss not my thing Susan's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Susan\nHow cart or listening to you\nWell great to have you here and you have a question that is a dilemma that people posed to me from time to time\nAnd I'm going to let you tell your story but basically the ideas when do you use your savings to extinguish debt when do you keep both debt and savings\nRight [noise] so like Britain and I bought a house together last year and he has his job instability and his heart he um took out a thirty year mortgage with the intention of I'm pulling it off as quickly as possible and advertising over twelve years\nBut hopefully down to ... [laughter] oh okay huh but how does his job is to want it to make sure we had that Christian there\nIn case we needed to a lower those experts on that so now because I sold my house I have an extra cash it they have all that we are thinking of cutting down on as a lump sum on the march ... to try to get\nRid of that soon\nWe have no other tax we fully fund for lunch cache um last IRA and a traditional i._r._a. as well\nSo we're just wondering if that was a good idea\nWell [noise] okay so you know made me nervous as or an ...\nRight right so you make me nervous only on one basis and that is that this is unbalanced in the relationship\nBecause these are the proceeds from a house that you had to be taking that cash and putting it into a house that you two have together\nAnd it's a boyfriend girlfriend thing and not a husband and wife so I think what makes me nervous is you put it into a joint asset\nThat's money that right now is completely yours\nCorrect so that so if you ask me\nUm you can tell I'm getting nervous here is is to you [laughter] because I Would I Would tell you that that makes me nervous for you if you look at the two of you is just a unit you stay a unit that's your whole deal\nAnd you are going to sacrifice what you had from the sale of the proceeds of your prior home so that your life together is better financially\nAh [noise]\nWhat happened what happens if the relationship doesn't work out like you expect and hope and you put all this money on to something then he's going to expect half the equity at that point\nWell except that there wouldn't be a record that I put in any money so if they ever did that happen that legally we would have that issue handled\nI I don't think that does handle it I think I think it would have to be some kind of note that he would do with each other\nBecause I ... I hate this I hate being negative like this but I just you asked me the question then I Need to protect you so if you would said\nHey we had this house together before we sold it we have the cash from it and now we're trying to figure out who we should put it towards the the mortgage we have I Would be\nJumping right into well you got this you got that and the other but in this case you made me um worry a lot about you\nBecause it's your money you'd be putting in here so I Would want you to have a written agreement with each other and said that money is your money\nOkay\nAnd that when you go to sell it that that would be your money now let's talk about whether you should uh go on this trend line to pay off this debt so quickly what other stories are there in terms of debt and both of your lives\nNow than we have a we have three vehicles between us there I'll have a wonderful um I own a small business with now that I'm not great and we pay our credit cards off every month\nOkay I Love all that so the the rainy day you got in case the unstable job becomes unstable again for him so what interest rate is thirty year mortgage caring\nFor on an eight point went one two five\nAnd a four point one to\nFour point one to five so that kind of on the cusp of whether you'd want to pay any extra towards it so\nWe have the whole ... to ... in an extra thousand dollars a month already\nSure keep doing that\nKeep to keep the simple keep your cash put more money aside for retirement you own your own business or you fully refunding retirement accounts like you can through your own business\nI mean I only have a traditional i._r._a. and\nTaller than I I that's what I'd like to do that's where the emphasis should be is you really working on beefing up your own retirement funds\nAnd don't co mingled the money this way and then you have to deal with the uncomfortable topic I'm bringing up 'cause a four point one to five you're already to gather putting an extra thousand

down personally and professionally it's not the first time you've you think he's going to be biased on the court then you should worry about who's already on the court and already said in their statements that they're biased cuts Seventeen\nSixteen you at the theater Ginsburg interview the New York times openly campaigning against Donald Trump and saying she was gonna move to New Zealand if

no no no but that's what's causing me to go out and vote because I Want the Republican Party now understand that if they do their job but they stand up for what's right [noise]\nAnd you do believe

things such as sexual assault in order to you know have political\nGain or political advantage to what the end with with Brett Kavanaugh getting on to the Supreme Court this this that and and I hope that people understand that\nA couple of things you know there's a there's a few things going on out there and one of which were going to be talking about more next week the ramifications of the midterm elections it seems in now Republicans are over the top two Republicans on the one energize how did that happen\nTo have a very simply because you\nYou know I wrote a piece about this call or the rule of law versus the mob rule and when you look at what is happening on the on Capitol Hill where senators are being accosted you you just had Sheila Jackson Lee one of her interests got arrested\nBecause that person was putting out the personal information of Senate Republicans we'd know what happened to ... sent me this was just intensify and now we have a a report that Planned Parenthood has come out and said that they're going after every\nSingle Senate Republican votes or yes for Brett Kavanaugh the ACLU has come out and take a stance against Brett Kavanaugh so now the ACLU was\nSupposed to be about American civil liberties is just so politicized organization\nSo what Republicans and I think you know Americans are seeing\nIs that you have a mob aqua see that is taking over the United states of America and this being led by the Democrat Party and their accomplices and the liberal progressive ... that is repulsive\nIt is and a couple of things are happening right now you had a Senator Grassley I think it's been great do this using an impossible spot but he's been very strong\nAnd as it as has Lindsey Graham and you know according has been good too I think Republicans winning tee shot back being shouted on I think ... just sitting there docile being yelled at you know he was kind of stunned but I think Republicans but from Cassidy\nTo attach to Grassley has started to uh Lindsey Graham are starting to push back a little bit when you talk about uh being energize listen to a dance scene or set on CBS this morning cut forty two\nI think it will be a I've never seen more since truck really has been elected I've never seen more unity among Republicans will serve it is that right now\nSo there is a segment of the Republican electorate that's either anti Trump or ambivalent about Trump\nAnd those folks for particularly suburban districts some suburban congressional districts in certain states there's always been in a sense of lack of enthusiasm among those Republicans there was they couldn't distinguish between Donald Trump and the Republican Party the whole thing was chaos and the whole thing was frustrating to them and they don't want anything to do with it\nFor the first time in the last ten days I think the cabinet dynamic is transformed that brought all Republicans regardless of what they think the president\nAnd Lindsey Graham said the same thing I mean you didn't need convincing you don't say down sounds perfect but you you're a boy\n[laughter] well I Want to reiterate the exact same point this this is above and beyond Donald Trump this was about the rule of law the United states ... about due process is about\nThe future of our constitutional republic and when you're up against this that we are seeing I mean just look at what has happened since two thousand six said that these antifa mobs the mobs that we see up there on Capitol Hill when you have a personal\nAt Maxine Waters going out and telling folks to to go after people in restaurants or wherever they are people being told they have to leave restaurants being accosted in restaurants America people see this and they see the folks that are in charge of it\nThey saw how you know senator Spartacus Booker carried on and Kamala Harris or you look at someone like Richard Blumenthal you know I'm here at Fort Sill Oklahoma\nWith the first San Francisco division or a artillery reunion with bad shirt to Vietnam and yet we have a personal I Richard Blumenthal sitting up there talking about honor and integrity when he lied about serving in Vietnam this is what is causing people to come out and say enough\nIt is colonel is so interesting your book coming out now hold Texas hold the nation victory debt victory a debt refers to a William Travis saying that's the message erode well you know we're gonna we're going to fight to the end against the Mexican army who barely out numbered them or we will died they died and were burned alive\nAnd that is them the mantra but you talk about more politics you you worry that taxes could or Republicans could lose tax\nTakes you you worry that taxes could or Republicans could lose taxes and hence lose the country\nWell what I see happening has is is a repeat of what happened in Nevada and\nArizona New Mexico Colorado\nYou see the left coming in and they take over major urban population centers and success for ... but what is so amazing is that people are coming to Texas which is an economically successful state because of the\nCosts of social conservative policies on taxes regulatory environment and you know they're thriving but yet they want to have the same failed economic policies an ideology\nThat they uh ran from from California from Eleanor for New York New Jersey and I think that if the the left can take a state like Texas effected competitive\nAnd they go on the thirty eight electoral votes there that does not bode well for our country and that is what you see the strategy of the progress of social is left all across the ... is to go into a major urban centers it rich states it places that are economics will set a successful\nLook at Florida Andrew Gillum in Florida look at Stacey Abrams running in Georgia both of them to be governors\nTheir beliefs their principles of values are the antithesis of what his maid Georgia and Florida and then also you look at Texas successful so we have to sound that clarion call\nYou well yeah and by the way the first person could be against Ted Cruz although he has about four or five point lead a low over Mr O'Rourke who wisely the President Obama did not endorse that would have helped a cruise because he is not popular in Texas so whatsoever\nYeah and but about upon further review or rock shouldn't be popular he's talented he's got charisma but he's certainly doesn't reflect what I thought outside Austin, Texas represents a but we'll see Ted Cruz has got to step it up and maybe as a I look forward

had been investigation see if there's any cooperation if there isn't then we move ahead there was and he said that and now we move ahead\nI Believe right that's to you got Collins and Blake you need that would give you that would give you enough with Pence to put you over the top right because you now have the only one you don't have as Murkowski so then you were at fifty\nAnd if you're at fifty

you want but you know it happened I Know what happened God Knows it happened and he would have been the one saying well gee I don't know it was so long ago I went to a lot of parties\nAnd he you know their demeanor is for exactly the opposite for me to believe her story at All right I thought she was I thought she was that as the only party she went to where they attempted to rape her with a Democrat Party\nWell usually thing I'm not going to ridicule I don't know anything about her but just so much is at stake you got to just remove the emotion from it and say is it enough to destroy

supposed to back up her story is being pressured tobacco per story and she said as much even though they deny it out\nAnd you know if I could get if I could face the guy that did this to me it was I was at a doctor's office for Pete's sake and out there with no other person present he took me in an exam room without a an nurse president and if I could face him today I'd say forget about voting just suddenly have five minutes along with him in a room and let me let me a ... from\nLand okay let me get out of the well let me just interrupt for one second ... voted yes as I told you count just
