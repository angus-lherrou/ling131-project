are\nReally truly worth the money\nIt's actually cheap seven hundred and forty nine dollars I Know you're you're saying the Kim seven hundred and forty nine dollars is really expensive for a phone well not when you compare it to like eleven hundred for the latest I thought anyway just few luxury talking more about that but I really love to hear from you this show one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again as a way to join us\nAnd then there's Andrew been skiing the Kim commando show man cave hello there Andrew\nKim we're going to start with Karen and she is in spring grove Pennsylvania she lives spring\n... that sounds like a nice place to lead doesn't it doesn't really horrible place I Lived in spring grows right next to a garbage town Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas\nAnd she's thinking about switching cell phone providers currently she has ... and for home wireless 'cause she was in rural and she has it for ... the company that she was thinking about switching to use the rising towers so she's like oh well they use all the same stuff is going to be all the same kind of action and then she went\nThey use all the same stuff was going to be all the same kind of action and then she went [noise] what if it is water if it's worse\nFor tours I Need to call him and it's so frustrating though isn't it I mean when you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right\nNow is a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial you know I think I missed it by yeah you're right on the edge is that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't have say a fiber optic\nNext I mean that is now requirements like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedrooms and a fiber connection so that this way you don't have to worry about what's going on so so Karen you don't have all bars in all places that's what I'm hearing\nThat is correct [noise] and there's no way that you want to move to the big city or no no we're going to stay right here okay so so when you complained of arise and what did they say\n[noise] um they really can't get many answer I've been I've been with them and think twenty twelve okay but the past month it is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [laughter]\nSo I'm looking at switching to Comcast for my Internet and they can't can't say well we also have mobile and so I thought well that might be a great service but\nI'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same ... towers and would switch between for I think ours and Comcast hotspot [noise] you know I don't know\nI I don't I don't find Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise]\nYou you know what you okay ... you know what you could possibly get and I don't know ... varieties and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nIs that you may be able to get a little what's called a ... do self or your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I kinda went a robot Comcast is that if Comcast\nIs using other ... cells to increase your reception and you're in bars I don't know if I like that either um so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have\nSome type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house that will repeat the signal from the tower that you have nearest me so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers is that even though like varieties in and AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often use different frequencies in technologies so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay um and then they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell\nThe uh the towers and they don't have to carry that debt and they can make more money so the thing that you couldn't go back to Comcast with and say you know\n... which frequency is Comcast on a tower and how does that compare of arrives in so that this is nothing you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different of that one service might be better\nAnd I and Comcast senses of cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee\nAnd it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on poor gee you're talking about one gig abet a per second speed versus on five gee you're talking about multiple created this and so\nYou know couple of solutions that you might wanna try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have real real close neighbor from afraid of 'em [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage made very right and she could be you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain to Comcast what the problem is have Comcast turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works\nTo them I don't want to sign a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or see what I'm getting and you know let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now\nOn the war see what I'm getting and you know let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep current customers to get a customer so that he might have to escalate this little bit higher\nBut it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation again thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on\n[noise] hire you and I'm looking for an app that I can securely send\nMoney to a private party um [noise] I was in a small car accident and\nRather than go through the insurance company or send her a check um it's a friend of mine let uh take care of it personally sure I'm I'm just looking gr secure after that I can send her a loan\nPayments or I'm not a lot of the aisle use all the time that something I can carry out of college out here in the ... uh\nUh you know a couple of ways you can do it you know [noise]\nJust just a rule of thumb is when you're sending money to friends be you know you have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly 'cause they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you that Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the most popular ones out there now is something called the ... and all of them charged two point nine percent as far as to make this wire transfer\nA busy exceptional pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirty cents\nBut if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nAnd that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then mow it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call it the right where you are we have our money to coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the ... commando show [noise]\n\nYour memory among America's digital cameras on them\n\nOver the years I've tried and tested every way that average people can and should back of the dead on their computers I'll tell you that I drive is simply the best climbed back upstairs there is for big reasons why\nFirst it's the easiest he is I back up everything all my computers smartphones I pass tablets everything to one single I drive a ... second it's the most secure with I drive snapshots I'll never lose even a single bite of data never pay a penny because of ransomware\nAnd then I Am I have a ... legs smart clock okay\nAnd so when somebody books through ... I can go and I can put their name in and I can say this law is going to work on this I on Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre okay\nAnd you put the person's name in there and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise]\nUm and you can program this remotely program is right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the leg lock\nIf not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen and the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nIs that you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay and so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nThen within the next the hub where the where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you want to certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lights for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nAnd that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so one sure once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby started thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to this right yes okay absolutely\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome audio\nYeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart things so this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave in the bay and those are different standards\nAre ... and that works with the smart and things\nAnd burns a ...\nAnd that works with the smartest things next he uh everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next year so\nSo so that's what I'm trying to it so I'm trying to expand your horizons so once we had the hub what else can we do if this law took thanks yeah it's exciting I mean it's really cool to doctors all states with the holograms attorney\nAndrew or don't you think that you and I would I be excellent at doing like a theatre version of the Kim commando show absolutely agree making a musical\nWell I don't know I can think commando them he was one that I don't [laughter]\nI don't think we'd go past one night have no memory and Jesse so anyway popular demand one that I don't have a say in an grape in Kansas that was [laughter] we didn't even make it sound like like Broadway in Tempe that was it\nThat's off off off off his rocker sweater the ball it's more intimate yeah absolutely [laughter]\nAll right so the next ... has been set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month or I'd say that's it not a big deal so I'll take a look at the ... the show leg sense and connect\nOK okay the next year HUD is about sixty bucks the lock is going to such back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month\nAnd then it allows you to program all those shows get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could set it for twenty four hours and then in ... if somebody does do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code and kill to automatically there's no delay\nYou can also you as like\nYeah you can set up a code really ... you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely\nA really makes sense that you start looking at smart stuff and in order to be notified and get alerts and things like that hey Charlie thank you for your call and keep us posted on what's going on and great band and how that locks working out for you [noise] All right\nSpeaking of homes let's talk a little bit about

spirit of togetherness October thirtieth through November ate their matinee performances for students to schoolchildren at nine in the morning eleven thirty in the morning at the Puerto Sanford the third performing arts in community center a rainbow drive in Decatur, Georgia again this\nThis story this amazing musical chronicles the history of the people of South Africa from the very beginning to today so much to take away from it has been indeed an honor and a pleasure to host all of us here today looking forward to seeing the show I think I'm coming on opening night and\nNot that this was about me because it's not but a deed on my bucket list just like your trip was the ghetto here [laughter]\nAnd I must must get to the content I took one of those DNA test earlier this year and I know that at least on my mother's side of the family are ancestry traces back to Sierra Leone so I got a lot to do once I get on the plane and come over but I'll definitely be sure to look you guys up saying you're again congratulations on the show we're looking forward to seeing you all\nWhat they're the fact that what they did was fit the constitution into their social and racial issues that struck me as a terribly important story and a big\nCause all the current political environment I must say I'm there were publishers who might have not\nBeen so anxious to publish this not shied away from it they didn't think anybody would be interested in and now one of the really good things that are happening is that I think people are interested no democracies and unforgiving system if you don't\nKnow democracies and unforgiving system if\nYou don't get involved the other guy gets to run the show and\nI think that now maybe we are getting people to where they recognize the need to be involved and I think the stories need to be there to help them\nAbsolutely I I I Hope more than ever in these next few elections that people are waking up and they're seeing you know the demise of America kind of take place right before their eyes and do\nWe complain if you don't have anything to your right right right right\nNow so I'm used to this story um began in Philadelphia is independence hall with the signing of the constitution and so what do you mean by that\nWell the the way the constitution is is how people evoke\nIt and they don't really know anything about actually I'm\nFifty five fifty five delegates from twelve states came together in Philadelphia was called the state\nHouse then Rhode Island and send anybody and the biggest issue they had to deal with was the fact that these were twelve separate countries people didn't have any I any identification is being Americans they were north Carolinians or Georgians or or Connecticut and\nTo make the country work they had to deal with all of these issues that one side or another was not going to was going to need to be done in a certain way and the biggest issue was slavery and the economics that came from slavery\nAnd so many of the causes and the constitution the census for example when it's taken directly bears on the slave system so in order to make a country work they\nHad to put in a bunch of very vague clauses to allow the government after they took power to do whatever was necessary and they put off the question of dealing with slavery\nAnd time or Seventy five years went by and you went through Dred Scott and all sorts of\nIssues and ultimately the only way to decide it was for war and by that time there were four billion African American slaves flown into the political and social system\nAnd then the country has to deal with that and then much of this eventually ended up in the Supreme Court so you have to get a sense of how the country developed and\nWhy we didn't deal with these issues up front to get a sense of why they were so so volatile by the time they did come to the fore\nAnd the fact is we're still dealing with them today so so\nIt is it is all part of this picture that\nYou need to pay some people get a sense of what really went on\nDo you do you think it was so complex at that time that they just couldn't and and I know the passion about slavery or not we would just really wow it was high but do you think it was so so complicated that people just couldn't sit down and come to an agreement about it\nIt was very simple the southern states would not have joined that did not protect slavery\nWasn't complicated it All right so could they of compromise he has no matter of\nFact one of the places they did compromises on the slave trade\nBecause Virginia the south wasn't solid\nVirginia and the upper south grew tobacco and they had nearly ... ... they they hide far too many slaves and the lower south South Carolina grew rice were and and ... junior wanted to sell their surplus slaves to South Carolina South Carolina wanted to keep importing them because it was cheaper\nSo you see a clause that outlines the outlaws the slave trade after Twenty years that is a direct result\nOf the of the conflict between slave owners in two different sections of the country but in terms of slavery itself if slavery had not been protected there would have been no constitution\n[noise] uh it's really interesting I'm about um you see a will you tell them and how cold facts was created that was a really interesting story\nA wonderful story where we Calhoun was I'm the son of of very major\nSlave owners and he had this enormous planted five plantations and they at the end of the civil war he was he was a progressive kind of a guy\nHe and he donated this land which they called grant parish after president grant and the and the county see the parish seat was cold cold facts after scholar cold facts the vice president so this massacre took place in a parish\nNamed for the president and the northern president and and granted we\nHad a lot to do with defeated the confederacy and it is\nHad a lot to do with defeated the confederacy and in in a town that was named after the white vice president mhm so it was a ... and we would account for the rest of his wife tried to find a way\nTo allow freed\nSlaves African Americans\nTo participate in the social and political life of both the town the county to state and the nation and very unfortunately largely failed\nYeah and he said he suffered a lot for my father was a on the other side literally and and what will Willie took over ... it went a different direction which was really interesting\nYeah there's not there's not a lot on record of of really on his father but it must have fought ferociously because his father was notorious\nUm was a notorious racist and did not not only did not want average of slaves fried but he he was known for harsh treatment so here\nYou had and and really was in Paris and it has been very interesting childhood here you have this\nGenerational not just split buddy ferocious split so it it would have it it probably was it probably was quite something\nWhen they were together yeah yeah or or not together at all [laughter] I can imagine All right so let's\nTalk about you know and and then we kind of touched around a little bit how these cases affects African Americans today really bring that together for us\nOkay the case itself as I said\nBrought in helped bring it enabled the rulings that that started Jim Crow and\nAs a result the social system African Americans were not allowed to participate they were denied the vote which is another book I'm doing for scholastic vote was\nTaken away from them they were put into a social situation as I said that was slavery and all but name when this started to break down in the Nineteen sixties and Nineteen seventies to the degree that it\nHas grown now you had again a situation where the the ruling the ruling elite [noise]\nHad to absorb\nIf we're going to have a really free country the ruling elite head to absorb a group of people that they didn't want to absorb and grant power to a group of people they didn't want to grand power to and that struggle is still going on you know yes there were congressional districts gerrymandered to make sure that they were African\nAmerican congressman but by and large we have not resolve\nThe issues that started in Philadelphia we're we're dealt with violently during the civil war were dealt with her horribly by the Supreme Court in the late nineties and early twentieth centuries and are now still at the for\nEverything that is happening\nAs a result of it is\nSo interesting to know look where that came from you know that's amazing um for our young readers and what age would you consider this book for\nI'm certainly high school mhm certainly certainly parents and ... and some middle schoolers high middle school I'm not before that the material is probably too complicated but absolutely high school students\nWhat do you want the students to know about and punish murder what were you what do you what's the takeaway for them\nI Want them to know that\nHistory of the country is filled\nWith incidents and filled with hum of people\nThat they don't know much about ... and that they need to know about and that they should be talking about\nYes and hopefully the schools will pick up this but this is excellent piece of history\nI Hope so yeah so you say you know you're you're doing an outlet for scholastic this was in school you have to look so\nYes they did they were I I Am very grateful to them for being willing to publish a book\nWe help our veterans for spring the way that paralyzed

lottery and all you need to do is pay for as it's been all through the decades pay for their taxes to get your winnings\nAnd people do it again and again and again\nNo matter what the pitch no matter where in the world comes from and what I Need for you to know as as your parents' age\nYou got to get more involved over time they may have more time on their hands there may be getting lonely and they may be too trusting you got to be involved there's even a federal law now\nTo help federal prosecutors prosecute these crimes because they are such a continuing problem but catching the bad guys\nIs so difficult and the financial harm can be catastrophic because once they have an elderly person on the hook they get them to pay any money they call again and again with story after story about why they have to pay more and more money\nSo it can end up being in the many thousands of dollars you know what's going on now with my mom you may have heard me say my mom's saying was different shoes getting scammed by fake charities\nAnd we had to take her checkbook away whatever you have to do to protect your aging loved ones do it you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nSo far has your nine AM to noon and we say house Iran ws\nFeeding on calling us from Lawrenceville in all of the ... movie of the whole town ... on the grill on Lawrenceville wanting Roseanne be your invited to join us this Friday morning the details of WSBIU radio dot com or the von hustler doctrine official Facebook said\nHey you all as a lender Skelton and I'm sitting here with my good friend Carolyn red wine who's just had pretty lax at the ... clinic what was that moment I Know you had to have a moment where you were like I Am so tired of reading glasses I'm gonna go and have something done I think\nThere's several different things you know licking walking into a store looking at the labels and close you can read what the size of the prices were even when you were going to wash something licking label now yeah what was on the label\nSo why did you choose what ... clinic\nI talked to several people like you who had had pretty lax and I had been thinking about it for a long time because I was just tired of wearing glasses after I'd had the surge as like what we say waiting for I can see everything said clearly not it's it's amazing\nAnd what I'd like you to do instead\nIs allowing to your kids were that archaic thing called money give 'em money you won't have to pay any fees for it kids get the finite and is with actual money in their hands that they don't get with a plastic card\nAnd if you can afford to do a match like greenlight does when you allowance a kid if they're willing to save\nMoney that they then turned over to you periodically for you to put it in a savings account or put an investment account or something like that you tell them the incentive is every dollar they don't spend you're going to match with the dollar to create that concept\nSo somebody comes up with a free card like usa\nNow my kids grew up with usa spending cards or whatever they call them where you have parental control and all that and it's all free\nI get free I don't get paying for these things but ultimately I can tell you with my kids\nEven a usa spending card was not nearly as effective teaching the finite and has the money as cash Grayson\nAnd he as cash\nGrayson is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Grayson how you doing\nHow's it going Mr Howard\nOh great but please call me cart\nAlright clerk I'm I have a question for you I Am in high school are about to go to college and I just wanted to know what I should invest in 'cause I'm thinking about investing about a hundred dollars a month\nAnd I really want to start investing mhm\nOkay so most people are going to college you're only spending money how are you in a position you're going to be able to invest you working while you're going to school\nYes sir I have a part time job right now and when I'm In college I uh hope to get into another part time job\nWow so for example you so you're like Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen somewhere in there\nYes sir wow okay we're not related are we [laughter] no I don't think so\nBecause I started my first IRA when I was Nineteen years old\nBecause I really was working\nWhile I was in school and so the beauty is that when you put money aside as a white teen or in your twenties the money has a chance to grow and grow and grow because time is your friend your ally\nBecause you're working there is something called a Roth IRA which would be my favorite place for you to look at stashing you're a hundred dollars a month if you've ever heard of ... you know what that is\nI'm not sure what the differences between a Roth alright and regular IRA\nSo without your age you don't want to do a regular IRA because you're not going to a guy in a high tax bracket\nOr Ross IRA works backwards from a regular IRA regular IRA you get our current benefit on your taxes but everything that the money would accumulate over the decades for the next gosh forty years\nWhere did you grow tax free but then every penny you'd end up with would be taxed with the raw that's the opposite you get no current tax benefit but everything that that money grows to be over the years becomes yours tax free\nSo that's why I particularly when you're young doing the Roth is a vastly superior option\nIs er at Clark\nDot com I have information Grayson on choices I'd like you to look at to put that Ross money and you can put in up to what you earn in a year but never more than fifty\nFive hundred so you're a hundred dollars a month as long as you're earning more than that you're good to go to do the Ross\nAnd once you have a thousand dollars it's really easy for you to open one of the really great Ross IRA investment choices\n[noise] okay so\nGrayson if you go to my investment guy to Clark dot com I'll take you through how to set up the raw\nAnd then what you should invest in in that raw you know where you could do the raw and then based on where you go what to invest in and you're off to a great head start and I think that's really exciting\nYes sir I Want to start early just you know so I can have the money for retirement\nWealth you start as early as you're starting you may be able to retire significantly earlier than most people are going to be able to do so good for you David with us on the Clark Howard show hello David\nHey Clark famous you're getting married I Am well congratulations to you that\nThey get so much a June third [laughter]\nRate or another June wedding you know the people in the wedding business get overwhelmed every June\nAll of that [laughter]\nWell how can that be of service to you\nAs the advice of any marriage counselor I think they tell us that you know it's important that we\nEnjoying a bank accounts and I currently bank with one of the biggest banks\nAnd so basically you know we both used direct deposit we use a debit cards and credit cards for I Would say Ninety nine percent of all of our purchases and then you know what what we do put on a friday or we'd be able to pay off but\nRight now since we are going to be joining a bank shall we want to find the best and banks that's going to be for us whether it is with a major bank or something small you know we want to add that online banking option we\nStill want to have the option to be able to write checks if need be still be able to get cash from an a an ATM that's not gonna\nCash from an ATM that's not gonna you know hurt us with the ATM costs and is it those sorts of things we're overlooking for\nSo I got several things to say number one I normally don't recommend that you merge all your finances right away\nOh what I tend to white for a couple to do and I should ask first how old are you and your bride to be\nI'm thirty and she's twenty nine\nOkay so you've been out in the world for a while that's especially when I don't like for\nA couple to merge everything especially not at the very beginning I think there's an enormous advantage and having his accounts her accounts and their account that you have a household account\nWhere you take care of the household expenses like rent or mortgage or utilities anything that is a obviously and expense of life living together\nAnd then that you eat continue to have your own separate accounts as well and you agree up front how much each of you will put into the joint operating account because people come into a marriage with different ideas about money\nAnd I don't want you to be in a position where you assume one thing about her she assume something about you and then it becomes a flashpoint for disagreement about how each of you set your values with money and priorities\nOkay over time you may find that becomes necessary and you completely merge everything\nBut I think at first it's best to have his hers there's okay as far as is where I like for you to look at putting money do either of you do much investing\nA I Believe or you know we are both worked for the state so we uh we uh we invest in the retirement system oh man\nRichard don't you don't have like an investment account with the stock brokerage or anything like that no no no no\n'cause that's my first go to is usually the best\nUm accounts for checking and for ATMs and all that are with the stockbrokers but if that's not part of your life and your state employees I Would like you to look at doing your joint household account with the credit union are available to you in your state passed state employees okay\n'cause credit unions are owned by if you open an account or will be owned by you and your bride to be\nYou know you're you're an owner of the place so they're not trying to rip you off they're not trying to con you and they're going to offer you a jet straight up deals at the credit union and you may have an office or offices right near the state facilities you work out\nOK\nSo that would be my favorite and over time you'll know when it's the right time for you to um jettisoned having any separate account of yours or having any separate account of hers\nOh here and it's usually really advise that you keep each keep your own account if you have really different ideas about consumption you know what I mean if you want to be really loves to shop and the other would be happy never to walk in the store is that right either of your deals\nWounded warrior project [noise]\nWe never leave a fallen warrior behind\nMore your project out\nThe twenty Eighteen mid

W. saying oh now the woman's gonna kill him and it's going to be a powerful whatever actually it doesn't matter as long as it's a good story this is why I don't understand I don't understand this isn't just about the tenth sequel to Halloween and what they're saying is\nForget about everything else and pretend\nThat there was just the first movie and all these years went by and then there's this movie\nWhich you know in the marvel universe and all that because of the way they do the comic books you can buy into that they had these alternate sort of timelines and so you can buy into the rebooting and these sort of things but uh\nIt seems like they're taking that and trying to apply it to the Mike Myers story no matter all do\nCare about that they enjoy these films I never really gotten into the horror films but you know they're\nFollowing a good one I can tell you that Halloween I'm not a horror film guy myself\nBut uh I did see Halloween back in the day and it's it it that is in particular it it's a well made movie\nA and you just have to cover your eyes every once in a while because a lot of horror fan what you know what the mask on now is the mask in Halloween or whether you have the hockey's a hockey mask right or is that friday the thirteenth\nWilliam Shatner mask with the eyes a little bit bigger and then painted ...

yeah he's he's disagreeing with like ... who is the language Jared yes he's disagreeing with you and your philosophy what you've made a great point yesterday about that you said that it's not worth it to ... people over differences in Palo no I don't\nKnow if people are just calling your name's that's one thing but I don't think\nI think we're we have too many people who are silo now you should hear people who disagree with you and you should be able to make your arguments against them and I think the reason that people an friend over politics is because they're afraid that they're not able to actually make a reasoned argument without calling names back\nAnd so and I think it's a good idea to have people around you who disagree with you no matter where you stand on the political ...\nThey may be this guy will persuade you otherwise probably not\nGoing to disagree with you on that friends they are\nTo be honest with you if they believe the Hillary Clinton\nIs innocent and I believe that that balls the Ford lady was telling the truth and the Saudi Arabia and guy who just got killed is more important than the mayor of things that we lost ... did they don't need to be a friend of mine I base my favorite part character but not a factor they're tired\nOf the other day actually are based on if they're dumb enough to believe that stupid stuff I thought I'd let you know banks says\nExactly what I've been thinking that are far too many people you see what he said that he basically said on character so a disagreeing with that guy is not just a disagreement you reveal yourself to be of low character ... how this usually you hear this from like the Hollywood people on the left\nBut how great it must be to know that your right so firmly and so confidently that when someone disagrees with you\nYou don't hear disagreement you don't hear as if oh I Need to make my argument for this person I've got a good argument\nWhen someone disagrees with that guy they reveal their low moral character to him so for him I Would say you are right you shouldn't you shouldn't debate anybody because the concept of a debate is that\nOne's right one the other person could be right like nobody goes into debate thinking the wrong but the whole reason we have debates is so that people who are undecided could be persuaded by one side or another this guy shouldn't debate\nAn side or another this guy shouldn't debate anybody he's so one hundred percent correct as a matter of fact\nHe doesn't have opinions he has faxed everything that he believes isn't a belief it's an absolute fact so why would he engage in any sort of debate with anybody he knows he's right\nHe's so right that he knows the person debating him actually knows he's right so that's not a disagreement\nThat person's up to evil for them to disagree with something that we all know is right how do we know what's right 'cause that guy believes that\nThis was going to be easy from now on whenever an issue comes up we just get that guy he's infallible why he just told us that he himself he's infallible his thoughts\nHis opinions sorry using that word just to get the idea of Fox knowing of course these are not a ... this guy doesn't have opinions that must be wonderful he doesn't have opinions he just knows\nWhat's correct so I Would say to that guy yeah you need you you are so far above everyone else but there's no need for you ever to come down off your high horse and actually engage in conversation or debate with anyone you belong on that high horse\nPut a step ladder on top of the saddle and sit on that that is how high up you are why would you ever again to actually come down to earth with the rest of us who are still trying to figure things out\nWhen you don't have opinions you just know what's right I salute that guy man I Wish that must be great to walk around knowing your right all the time\nWe shop scribe to his newsletter because then we I mean we get all the fast and then I could just the parrot but he says I and I could just like knock off and go to the beach why do any research this guy and I you know I Know I think yes go ahead he\nTalked about the soldiers and thank God the versus the reporter who is just killed\nYeah allegedly yeah um\nHe's saying if you care about that reporter more than the three soldiers than he doesn't want to be your friend and that doesn't really have I don't I don't think that's right that's what the\n... well also is the reason people care more now is because it's in the news now it doesn't mean overall I think it's more important is what we're talking about now because it just happened also he seems to have denigrated disguise\nA you know the show he's not that important again I'm not going to not as important yeah I'm not going to question this guy but he he knows his stuff it's quite obvious who I\nWho am I to question them one thing I Would say in there that there's a bit of a red flag if I got off my sarcasm here [laughter] your sarcasm horse this is a this guy's not be he's beyond me as I've said a buck for others if you're trying to make your point\nIf you start using words that you heard from your favorite radio host in your point you lose half the room I Hope you know that because if you sound like a parrot for a moment\nWe're all going to assume you're just a parrot and so when you say balls the Ford up that didn't come out of your mind you didn't have the creative energy to think of that\nYou hurt someone else say that and then you adopted as your own which means you have no ability\nTo be creative thinker that's my opinion\nBut as we know my opinions are suspect this guy's opinions are gold right next to\nAll right let's have a little fun I think uh this guy he may well now he wouldn't have been in Canada but I think he might have been a enjoying or any legal substance when he left oh\nI was asked you know 'cause I I was that we do is a lot do we have any stoned open

[laughter] and I don't think he recognizes the important achievement of Reagan and Gorbachev on this\nYou know for good or bad a Trump is quite often simple but I mean that in a good way that is not going to\nGet all rolled up and the protocols and all of the social hey are they are they abiding by okay they broke the treaty if they're not abiding by the treaty there's not this is only there's no treaty but yeah there's there's it's not like they're seven nations involved here\nIt's two nations in a treaty if one decides to break it it's just it's not one void and I think that's really what Trump is saying here is if they're gonna if they're going to build these things then we have the right to build these things 'cause the world is changed a lot since the Nineteen eighties and so our enemies aren't exactly\nThe same as they were then it doesn't help us because China\nNot even a part of this so they can do it\nOther countries that we consider more dangerous to our interest now than we did in Nineteen eighty seven they're not party to this so I think Trump is just stating the obvious to countries are involved in a treaty and one of them breaks the treaty smelling boy next\nAccording to report from quest diagnostics more local prospective workers are testing positive for substance abuse or showing up stone to work than ever before\nThis is I Am executives by the way ... executives as well hang around host headline as employees execs are failing drug tests that shocking rate\nIt's a one hundred and fifty percent increase from twenty Thirteen to twenty Seventeen\nI'm not going to blame is on Colorado writing I'm sure and then how do you do this can be blamed on Colorado and sooner they blamed on Canada I'll go back to a conversation we had earlier\nPeople don't want to be adults anymore\nThey don't know the difference between work and play they don't have to police themselves\nYou know when it comes to recreational drug use heart drug use your on your own I don't know I don't know what you're thinking and I don't know what kind of joy you could possibly get out of that\nBut recreational drug use very simple fond Hester doctrine tenet question to ask yourself are you using the drug or is the drug using you\nDo you do everything you're supposed to do or do you cancel a couple of things so you can go get high\nRed flag second that happens you're no longer a recreational drug user\nPeople have to be able to police themselves it's a tough world there's a lot of things to get down about and by the way I'm separating out clinical cases people who are clinically depressed and that sort of thing I'm just talking about average average folk\nIt's real easy to allow yourself and his infant title to just fade away from the world and not deal with it and and you see it that was ... I think is interesting that in that headline employees and executives\n\nNot able to police themselves not able to get their work done and then go sit on their back porch or their back put their feet up and enjoy a weekend after the work is done\nOn this copiers ...
