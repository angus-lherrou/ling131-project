days on the beach oh very nice and wrote back and take it a couple of days on the on the beach so that was a that was a rough game rough game on Saturday I have to be honest here somewhere in the fourth quarter I just sort of drifted away I knew I knew was going to happen and uh it just wasn't looking good\nAs long as you patronized are a great advertises on the Georgia Bulldogs radio network always was okay for you to step away all ...\nAlways was okay for you to step away always uh where do you begin what went wrong\nWhat went wrong was\nGeorgia got whooped up front both sides of the ball and that's the one thing that Kirby sports is cannot happened and that's the one thing they have to fix going forward I've county uh we've we've\nKind of talked about George is not really dominating run defense like they want to against lesser ... like Mississippi and Missouri and Vanderbilt in Tennessee in a campaign came back to get them against a team that's really good so uh younger defensive line that's got some depth issues that some problems against LSU\nAnd Jake problem was not good at all and I was you know like a lot of people I was a little surprised that just in the fields and get them or shot they wanted to make from work through it and he could not do it and now you know the George has got some things to fix but\nHalf the seasons ago when they prove they can recover from that loss and they'll get to where they want to go before\nI Believe you laughed at me last week because\nI was saying when I was in the van de game I was still a little worried even though that there was a lot of scoring going on they were giving up yards in between they were giving up a lot of yard age and I am I think that when you're watching anybody in the SCC and you're not Alabama\nWhen you're assessing any game you have to be thinking to yourself what if they were playing Alabama and when I saw ... last week scared me a little bit and I and I think it came true with LSU they just need to tighten up and tough enough don't you think\nThat that's a that's pretty simple way to put it in your life easier said than done sometimes because the other guys are tough too but\nYou want to apologize to me for a laughing at me last week when I made that comment oh you oh you are laughing matter of fact I think Jay Black you were ... oh look at that he apologized to him and we don't have a lot of time here J. black and I know that you're on the beach and join yourself\nA but what'd you agree with me if you have two quarterbacks you don't have one quarter back\n\nWe'll see [laughter] it's not a great if not the ideal I Wish we had a lot but there was only one quarter back in the mail is you can't ... I I agree with that I didn't really work out\nBut he had another quarter back in his head I want to talk more about there's whenever you get off the beach and get back here I've got more to say about this quarterback situation in a in Athens RJ black enjoy the beach my friends say oh wait a second [noise]\nThis is Richard ... owner frugal kitchens are slogan as life happens here and we

you for your support [noise]\nTime the best high school quarterback in the country yeah Jake obesity so you have a situation now where fields has power we saw what happened at Clemson\nFields has power coaches are having to deal with this now but I think that this is going the wrong direction\nAs a coach purpose smart is great I don't want anybody here thinking that I'm saying is not great fun that I just think that this is new this is new and you have to just still pick your quarterback you're not going to keep both of these guys happy\nSo that neither of them walks away because even from could walk away if you want it to their their or if there are he couldn't go to programs the field to go to but there are programs that would take him a ... from is only one year advanced from fields right it's not as if he's going to leave in a year and then it's the other guys team that's right you still have to choose\nYou have to choose which quarterback you want for the next couple of seasons doing you're always going to have him from head oh anytime I get fourteen points down I'm yanked that's not a good way to take the field\nAnd fields is never going to feel as if okay you know what I'll stay here because they use me forty percent of the time\nYou have to make the decision which one of these guys just the quarterback for the next two or three seasons you make that decision and you let the other quarterback decide what they want to do you have different things that happen in Alabama jailing hurts decided to stay in Clemson\nThe guy walked\nIs new for college coaches that they have to deal with the fact that some of their star players actually have leverage and so there's nothing wrong with maybe not quite knowing how to play that out but if you have two quarterbacks you don't have one\nAnd you have to choose and I'm not smart enough to tell you which one they should go with to be honest with you you you know what from is you know what he can do he can sometimes be spectacular\nAnd then you've got fields who people think the ceiling as you know I'm incredibly high but you still have to you can't have all of everything you have to make a choice and I think it's hanging it's looming over this\nAnd make a choice and I think it's hanging it's looming over this team that being said offensive line defensive line that's where the problems are but I feel people this if you know at once everybody's ... our most people talking about the officer defensive line no why did we put fields in earlier why didn't we haven't been longer why'd they stick with from\nThis is never going to end unless you win every single game or you decide who your quarterback it\nWhich you you have to think that UGA still controls its own destiny if they went out and when the SEC championship only then scenarios they would go to the only\nOne thing matters in the FCC can you beat Alabama they stopped can we stop pretending that there's anything else that's the only thing that matters can you beat Alabama\nThat being said do you believe on Sunday I Know it's a week off or the Saturday do you believe that uh Georgia could beat Alabama\nNot at the moment no but I have the tools to to get to that level\nWell that's all that matters is not going to get the playoffs now unless they get to the conference championship and beat Alabama that's right All right let's

filled though it's either the office has a chance to women on the last play the game or the defense has to save it on the last play the game and they made him so\nI think I think it's an ex Everytime I every time I ... watching the falcons play who then that last play yesterday was amazing when\nTampa almost [laughter]\nDon't want it and that would have been [laughter] there's every fall because

pull the quick one for you a people Georgia our dog's drop for number two to number eight and I'll be late in the eight people mix and after the last ally shooting ...
