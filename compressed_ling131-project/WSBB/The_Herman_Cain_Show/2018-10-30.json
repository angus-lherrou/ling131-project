a ... mile either\nWhich is a this disease that is affecting mostly children right yeah it's really weird yeah Seventy some odd children in the country and its debilitating\nIt's not polio but his polio like Mm\nEating it's not polio but his polio the lake and ah the director of the CDC was speaking to CBS News and uh he said thankfully it doesn't appear to be transmissible I guess\nThe good news is that um it doesn't appear to be transmissible told you into him while I don't see clustering families [noise] um I Want to make it clear to the American public is not polio\nBut here's the thing so that's his way of saying\nYou don't have to worry because not transmissible but we've been working on this since uh twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen and we don't know we don't know why this is happening right so we don't know what to do ... to make sure that our children are safe right exactly [noise] uh I mean you are you're going to tell me to build up your immune system\nExactly right and if I'm four years old but the how am I going to do that as a\nParent you got to make sure the kid is taking care of stay away from the sugar makes sure the vitamin D levels are normal get they have every once you get the vitamin D tested\nVitamin D your vitamin D tests just like there's something on the side of the milk carton yes that I find the vitamin D to set ... equal yes the second one yeah the the two electric Google it I think that's right that's the one I go for\nThat or id to synthetic has to be converted into D. three and that we can use so that's why I say we need to use the three of the supplement Ninety\nTo what I don't understand the three ... which one are we talking about do we get this from the sun yes that's the best so that's not synthetic now that I'm guessing that organic UVB rousing more organic the sun and we agree on that agree on what something if I guess I don't even smaller with that one [laughter] so what is the difference like a deep to source in a de three ...\nTo a synthetic it's about five hundred times less effective than the three some study shows that\nUm where am I getting the synthetic too though I'm not getting the ...\nWell after they do they manufacture it well hey you know fortified with vitamin D it usually is already too which is cheaper than vitamin D three but the three is still so cheap I ... that was a little pills that you take two or three of them a day right yes that can be de three and you can get it from a supplement\n... again this is this is harming children more than anything I mean Hillary given supplements to children I Would say always every ... days in like an animated characters and jelly isn't too ...\n... on my website I have a doctor Joe's vitamin D three that's drops and it takes to

gay but at the end of the world kind of thing it's I mean you guys got\nYou got to be ready for a I'm a rapper revelation that happens assuming apparently well uh hopefully the CDC can they say that they think it's a single source\nRight or they don't so it's not transmissible but they don't know what it is I mean we don't know what is what does that mean they don't know what the actual virus that they can identify it lacks in my life is is a symptom ... it can happen from a variety of different things can caused this to happen to you\nThey're saying it's a thing but they don't know what

rang [noise] veins of this has always\nOh shut up I'm very into the Christmas spirit already I'm ahead of myself not here to Halloween I Know in our area that you'd have meant do I actually saw the\nUh there's a there's one commercial Christmas seem commercial I'm saying but it's a choice for talks commercial have you seen this from the single mother and the there's a tree is nothing underneath it and the single mothers just re haggard\nShe's young but working ours he's working hard I don't read jobs probably well it's you can't afford some food some gifts for the kids now are saying is the house doesn't look ramshackle it up to me to believe that the mother kid by a couple\nOf things you don't think she probably works all day at a couple of jobs income so in Queens I guess that's what I'm supposed to believe in the news here to shop\nOK maybe she can't afford the computer that would allow her to buy the gift of Amazon's afraid to go to her neighborhood don't get me wrong I think it's great work I just think that the house the inside the house and the commercial\nSays to me you get for adult\nOne bike so he has two kids for heaven's sakes only not that hard job but I'm really I'm really into Christmas this year ... we're putting together an amazing Christmas special this year although Pete spring's really thrown at me for hours at four hours but\nI have ideas and uh it's going to be quite sensational and it will be called the von tests are doctrine presents this this\nIs my kind of Christmas and this is going to be a blood is going to be magical I could tell you that\nGive me another numbers was that you may dance numbers there are dance numbers and Erich von ... or will\nSing the title song this is my kind of Christmas which I wrote a very drunk two Saturdays ago\nAnd it's quite wonderful or we're not going to do a Halloween special tomorrow\nWe're not doing a Halloween special because you know ...\n... about\nThis I don't enjoy Halloween to address a bit of ... no one because I'm an adult Halloween is a great holiday for children but you can weigh a hundred dollars tomorrow here you see the fire out\nDon't need a hundred dollars that any more [noise]\nLast\nYear the Dow Jones industrial average was up just over twenty five percent everything was so good even the self help experts were giving out investment advice but you also saw a lot of fear\nFear of missing out in fear of crashing\nBut here's the thing here is an emotion not an investment strategy if you're making your own investment decisions emotion plays a role whether or not you realize\nSo make twenty Eighteen year that you keep fear out of your portfolio make an appointment with a financial engines advisor today and get a solid logical financial plan for your future one that helps take some of the fear out of the equation because self help is for ... not your financial security and retirement\nKeep moving you so you're going to have a whistle and your job is to just tell people keep moving\nYeah just where my normal quote on the move in their time on TV for a few seconds but over get outta here\nAnd so uh and and then you you're excused and there's I'm doing my civic duty is not yet I'm opting out of Halloween I'm involved but I'm doing my civic duty that's pretty smart I wanted to but I wasn't gonna ask you about that actually in my to use this morning I\nWas telling people how I was saying that I Would let them know how social media is ruining their lives and I at least want people to think about social media that's really the point here I Want people to what is it been ten years so little but over since everybody's pretty much been\nSaid or did it and then Facebook picked up and then Twitter two thousand eight I I Would say we're we're like Fifteen Years\nYeah but I think for a most people being on it I think it's only like eight to ten years\nYeah but the the old people we finally uh yeah the old and\nYou know whenever it yeah when when mom ... my\nMy dad asked me a couple of weekends ago can you help me use Twitter yeah and I would say now how how old is your father that no ah Seventy your\nDebt Seventy years old by the way I just saw him on friday he leave fantastic\nIt was fantastic Seventy years old what you should say to him is there's no need to get on Twitter at the age of seven missed the golfers and yeah but it's touched that way but I Know your father he's a he's got political opinion and this is my point your father let's say you're on Twitter next week\nYour father within a year will lose three to five friends and not be it half of it will be because he decides he doesn't want them as friends the other will be because they don't want him his friends and that's my point about social media and others Gregor us he's never been on it he's never been on it and I used\nTo get on it well I was big into the my space oh yeah that's my account that tell that doesn't count account you just weren't aware of\nThat doesn't count account you just weren't aware of it I was aware of it I had my own my space page thank you very much but I'm saying is it's not Twitter do I still know what was your profile song or my I all I remember as I remember I customized in with a a red page 'cause I like to read uh-huh\nAh but you had to hate it when\nYou're not getting me that I got to tell you what I'm Talking about is we didn't really give our political opinions on on my space it was a different kind of deal I saying with the social media Greg you've never really been somebody who commented on things that are the passing\nParade as it were on online I'm when I Want to say is I used to make fun of you for that because I had fallen\nFor the narrative that everybody has to be on Twitter everybody has to be on Facebook and you have to be an especially if you have a radio show where you have to Brian's yourself and I want to say to people but that is not true now we do put this show on the von hesser doctrine but I don't touch that Jared I personally stopped\nUsing social media personally about six months ago and I'm here to report to you but life is a good first of all you should know life is possible\nWithout being on social media and so I Want to congratulate you drag but I Would I Would for most people after this eight to ten years where everybody's on social media just take a moment and ask yourself\nHas my life's gotten better\nBecause I contend that we now know too much about our friends\nIt didn't used to be that you had to know every single thing about your friend what they like to eat and all that kind of nonsense but also how they voted or how they really thought about every issue this being covered on television and radio we used to be somewhat blissfully ignorant of the details of people that we casually acquainted with\nNow we know way too much about each other\nAnd that and that in lightens us to know well there's more people to hate and Francis wants to build that wall [laughter] why why do I need to know that my great uncle wants to build the wall it's not really important he's still going to be my great uncle I'm Still going to use it doesn't matter\nHow would boomers I think he went on if they didn't have to [laughter] sorry go ahead\nI was gonna say will tell you this because I Do go on your Facebook every once in a while and I know in my interactions with that no you pretend to me I don't pretend to be you there's no pretending to be you know clearly marked everything is Greg okay\nPeople know at this point that I use years here and there I interact with listeners and when I Do I can make it a positive experience like the other night they traded a videos with one of the listeners she sang memory from cats and then I\nThanks Kimball shanks I posted a video of myself and I thought\nThat was pretty stupid maybe I'll regret this later but you know what overall is a nice ... at least\nPositive but the problem yeah then you're off then I'm off you had done for the night social media is always going to take us to I think\nThe negative and also this is a thing to social media is done to us it's a it's made us believe that what we think politically is really really really important in terms of relationships\nI don't think that really existed as much or anywhere near the way that it does with social media before social media we used to say you know don't discuss a religion or politics okay everybody knew I had to go into a party don't bring up religion or politics 'cause the thing that people disagree on\nBut if but if I'm not looking at your face\nAnd I don't have to worry about the fact that we're going to be in this room together for the next three hours that I can bring it up and that's all social media is is just\nI really have to announce it now you have to announce it now an hour and a lot of people use to ask your\nPolitical affiliation they used to ask what you did write you what do you do they want to know about your job you know I don't know if they're actually you know judging you on that or if it's just an easy conversation started but now it does feel like you have to announce your political affiliation so the group can decide if they want you to be in their ... well\nThat's right the whole thing to social media said is look the first thing you have to do when thinking about whether or not you're going to associate with somebody is judge their politics [laughter] and I'm saying this is new so many fleeing the two things I Would like everyone just to take a moment and ask\nThemselves that look if you're under thirty\nYou're screwed there is no way out of this I'm only speaking to people ... over who lived a life at one point where this wasn't going on if you're under thirty you don't know anything else and you're held bound for destruction\nBut hopefully I'll be ... when that happens and I won't be around but if you're over thirty and you live the life without social media ever I just ask you to take a moment and and just in terms of personal relationships is your life better\nSo is it still working for you yeah that's because people feel like they just have to be there well and I think we've gotten to a place with Facebook and social media in general that you need to filter what you're seeing because when everything is coming at you and you're right you are getting at\nIn opinions about people that you won didn't need to know right and to don't make you happy so let's he was like what is what do you take social media for is it something that's going to rally you up and do you want it to okay\nThen the political people you hate and respond to them and troll people whenever you want but if if you're on here to make yourself happy\nAnd to give yourself something to do that's fun then filtered I follow people that that you politically different than you and\nNot not just politically different but also post things that are like shame yeah but\nI I get that you do you do before I got on social media will last things are filtered was or anything autumn puts up about a damn kid [laughter]\nI had to go with the cost of ... that it costs to buy\nIs all of them well like I Know I post ... why do I do though especially you know I'm not I'm not judge I don't use the example you know the example\nOkay you have a four year old daughter and she did a funny dance four year old daughters have been doing funny dancers since the beginning of time why do not a dance like this what why don't you have to do this and I for some I feel like we're lose everything doesn't have to be documented\nWhat is the same thing is when people would go on vacation and then come back and show you fly\nEverybody hated that was meant to everybody that I'm not making it down and watch it and it's just not there if you'd like why this is what I'm saying\nIs I don't think that you and I'm not I'm not making it about you just you're the example right now for everybody well there seems to be a well yes you have to do this like yeah you do but but why I mean what comes of it what what what is what what makes the world better\nThan like just like you take a picture of something and you want to maybe show that picture to someone else it's the same motivation behind that I mean I'm not old but no one wants to do our old XP at all I Know it's not the world\nIt's over saturated now just photos in general yeah shame the army in them than it used to mean something it was like a snapshot of a moment in time and that still is but it's it's it's so\nMany of them but yet when you go out and lost value I don't think I've had this I saw in this new iPhone\nThing thanks for nothing Russia to buy my own iPhone to well fed this now for months I hear it has a great camera I've never used at once you don't take any pick I don't take any pictures 'cause this is what I found that I used to take all kinds of pictures and I'd have so many pictures and they'd be in a folder and I never look at that folder\nEver whereas in the old days you had to you know it'd be the send them off and get them back it was a big deal you know I\nWould go
