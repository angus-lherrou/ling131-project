Iraq what we call qualified money that you can't really touching to your fifty nine and a half correct right here's what I'd like to see you do I I Love happy retirees pay down the mortgage I ... or don't have a mortgage that's part of the formula for being happy retiree\nThe happy retirees are five times more likely to to pay off their mortgage\nIn the next five years than unhappy retirees it just uh it just said it from my research it's kind of half economic half psychological fact\nOf getting rid of debt it particularly mortgage debt which is typically our biggest debt\nFor you you're so young that I Would rather see you invest that twenty thousand dollars is something that is going to be worth fifty to a hundred thousand over the next thirty twenty or Thirty years when you get into retirement and don't just do it all down in the mortgage 'cause you it's almost like it'll just go away you won't feel that you've really done a whole lot with it\nRather rather because you're going to how now have this kind of a little bit of an economic cushion you can get to this money if even if you invest you get to it\nAt least you one extra mortgage payments per year so if you do that by if you pay every two weeks versus once a month\nFeel pay an extra mortgage payments for a year and that will really help\nGet rid of the mortgage early so in my opinion for your young age you're already getting started with investing invested twenty thousand dollars in a brokerage account and then pay an extra mortgage payment for a year now that you have that economic pushing love the call

confidence\nClip so this expansion is kind of like half its really almost like a half\nFeet\nPart of the reason we we used for so long this thirty nine miles per hour economy if you're used to driving at sixty miles an hour and you're forced to slow down to thirty nine\nAnd now drive on the highway for the next hundred miles at thirty nine miles per hour that's effectively what the difference here has been relative to what we're used to I'm used to drive in sixty used to drive in three\nThree and a half percent economic growth per year and then you and you come down to one point nine or two percent of its like slowing down to less than forty miles an hour it's frustrating\nAnd not his ... that is where we have been in jail this past year now we're we're back to kind of growing again it's sixty miles an hour maybe even a little more than that because we're growing it three and a half percent plus GDP at least we are right now\nSo if you look at the ten or twelve sub cycles and you have you've got to look at them both objectively and subjective all you've got to look at the numbers and you also have to say well OK here's where we think we are in\nEach one of these cycles it's again it's not it makes it says that exactly black and white where we are each sub cycle going to go through these autos housing different examples they don't move in perfect predictable patterns\nSo of course it requires looking at the totality of all these areas\n[noise] number three imbalances where are they that's the that's kind of the economic killer that typically ... uh creeps up and then brings us back into recession where the imbalances\nWell if you look at each one of the ... they they are the right now arguably there are no massive imbalances or areas of real access\nCould that change sure could but with where we are these economic cycles are sub cycles as a whole still point us being in the middle of the third quarter if it were in a football game in real time that looks like the your twenty twenty or ...\nTime that looks like the your twenty twenty or beyond not turning Nineteen not next year so let let's look at this uh from this is another ... is a research points in Davis research group\nIf you're evaluating the expansion in terms of the total amount of GDP created new real GDP granted if this were the typical post war expansion that was five years growing and again four point six percent\nGDP would've increase it over twenty five percent we're ... we're we're still shy of that right now\nThis expansion again very mediocre and if you look at the one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven expansions we've had since World War two this expansion is is still very mediocre coming in at number six on the list\nLess than half of the powerful Nineteen sixties boom and well below the forty three percent boom that we had in the Nineteen Ninety One or the sub cycles ... you've gotta look at labor so employment huge very important arguably maybe the most important or or a very important piece of the equation\nBut none of them in themselves are the Ares V indicator it's not just labor\nOr monetary policy or credit psych or profits for companies or auto auto industry the housing industry\nNumber seven commercial real estate industry number eight energy where were you in the energy psych number nine capital spending pretend trading account and current account\nWhere are we it was a current account deficit fiscal policy number eleven and then demographics number twelve ... twelve separate really important piece the equation to kind of look at it as a group and say where where are we in each one of these\nArguably where we in late cycle again remember if it's late cycle if everything were late psycho means we were in the end of the fourth quarter and we are we're arguably going to go back into recession sit\nAt the whole point of this exercise we look at each one of these and say if we early middle or late if everything were late so it looked like housing was it at the end of a cycle and labor was the end of the cycle and autos or the end of the cycle and fiscal policy the end of the cycling demographic at the end of the cycle then I can say OK\nLooking at all these together we're yeah we're pretty late in the game that means that\nThis whole thing has to unwind at some point soon and then that means that recession watches flashing red light hey here we are\nWell that's not the case eight out of the twelve of those sub cycles are either at a midpoint kind of caught halftime or actually even in early stages cause first or second quarter\nA couple of them are late cycle so we've got ... if you look at labor that's arguably\nMiddle to late cycle corporate earnings middle of the lights cycle auto autos late cycle\nCapital spending arguably middle to late cycle but the rest of that list eight out of twelve sub cycles were either at the midpoint or in the really early stages for example housing\nStill looks like it's a long long way from peeking\nThere there's actually a housing shortage right now\nAnd and no over building the shortage will probably not be eliminated intensity and that's something I can just change overnight takes a long time to get permits raise capital people make the decision and it takes forever to build something\nIf you look at the supply demand analysis just for housing in itself is one of these important sub cycles in twenty Eighteen shows there's a shortage of one point four million housing units\nWe have we're under bill in in America\nAs a result the current economic cycle much further to go now you might look around and your neighborhood in Atlanta and say wow that seems like a lot of building railroads we're looking at the country as a whole here yes it's might be might be a whole lot happening here and there might be a lot happening in Brooklyn and it might be happening in towns in California or Texas but as a country as a whole\nCan still really early in the housing cycle commercial real estate of the commercial real estate very tepid last few years in terms of price appreciation for commercial real estate occupancy rates are high but there has not\nBeen any there really hasn't been over building again the same thing you may not look like it here in Atlanta because the cranes out my window and it might be not the way he that that might not be the case in Atlanta or New York city but as a whole the U.S has not seen access in buildings cropping up\nFiscal policy what about fiscal policy\nAgain probably in the in the pre midpoint of the cycle tax cuts just began in twenty Eighteen we've only had ten months worth of these tax cuts and we haven't ... arguably it takes two years for tax cuts to really kick in some time\nIt takes two years for tax cuts to really kick in sometimes even longer than that\nThis ... the congressional budget office which is usually very light in under shooting what tax cuts will do they say that we were gonna see expansion from those tax cuts until twenty twenty two [noise]\nIf you if you take a look at the chart and says what the CBS was saying how much are we going to get in additional economic growth because of the tax cuts that we see additional growth because of them all the way out until twenty twenty two\nSo the tale when it's not quite the sugar hide in the media may make out ... and ... to like oh you have these tax cuts just good for one year tax cuts even though they could potentially get repealed or they it takes a long time for for that to really fully come to fruition\nHow about demographics another important piece of the equation well we're early in the demographic cycle here in the United states and and I I Love looking at the demographics I think is when this important pieces of the equation because it's kind of the fundamental tired of this economy\nI don't know if you remember us talking about the ... ratio but we've talked about this my ratio peaked in the year two thousand and one\n[noise] coincident with the equity markets\nProjections show that that ratio is it it can is continuing debase until you're twenty Twenty one and then it turns higher before topping out in the mid twenties thirties remember what the my ratio it's ... it's the ratio of middle aged folks to younger adults so am middle age\nOver why younger adults\nOr the my M. Y. ratio it's been and if it's a very effective predictor of\nSecular stock market trends kind of long term stock markets more middle aged adults in the U.S versus young adults leads to an acceleration in consumer spending think about it you're middle aged ... if you're thirty five to forty five you're spending a lot more and contributing\nEconomically more juice to this economy than you were when you were twenty two or twenty five\nAnd and the ratio of the percentage population in that middle age range is actually getting better and better and stronger and stronger\nBottom line on this whole economic picture when when money matters returns good morning you're listening to money matters quick traffic weather right here say tune from the bottom line on this economic expansion in recession watch your news Ninety five five and am seven fifty W.
