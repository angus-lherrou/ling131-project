year will be Ninety million dollars that otherwise would have been getting because those same offices and hotels will be built somewhere else in the city if if you didn't have this go skiing going on so it was two billion dollars a property taxes\nAnd then on top figure about half a billion five hundred million off um sales tax um they'll be talking at\nAn affordable housing is going to dig a plug for this so\nWe were talking earlier a little bit about that but whatever you can expound upon with affordable housing and why that is always the lure for these for deals of this nature what does that really break down to what does that mean what if the real deal that's going on with affordable housing\n[noise] well obviously the uh elected officials are run on a campaign promise that they are going to do something about affordability in Atlanta and that's very understandable because a home run some prices are going up pretty fast\nUm and there is displacement loom gentrification them to talk about that so you know what's sad about this is the we're being asked to give up all this money that would otherwise be available to pay for schools and\nYou know that would otherwise be available to pay for schools and cops and firefighters in parks\nAnd in return I mean you could barely cool these crumbs that they're handing back\nSo they have twenty eight million dollars into a fund for photo housing well if you're giving away two thousand five hundred million you're getting twenty eight back it's such a ridiculous disproportion it's an insult um\nSo yeah you get it maybe five hundred units side of the time um then they like to Trump is that there are two hundred units which is a again a tiny number a of of humid in the Gulch but then when you look\nAnd this convoluted deal as six hundred pages of verbiage when you look into it\nWatched shocking is it appears that after three years those two hundred units that are a slightly subsidized\nBut they can disappear they vanish and they get sold off at a price that people making twenty percent more than a area median income can afford so they're not affordable by definition so so I mean it's it's amazing how much bait and switch is going on in this\nThing against right within two years to you've lured people under the deal they move in there they are on section eight or However I'm sorry however the Affordable housing works within two years to now being affected well\nThree ... three years um and it's not section eight it they would have to show that they make eighty percent of area median income which is not nothing I mean these are not low income folks but maybe policeman or police families are teachers you might qualify um\nBut yeah ... so they would get a somewhat subsidized rent uh they they pay maybe three hundred a month less than a otherwise um and uh\nYes up to three years it looks as if see I Am or whoever they sell this deal to would be able to just sell these homes around ... thank you very much\nShame all [noise] [noise]\nUm [noise]\nAnd there were many boys [noise]\nThat night and that is senator Vincent for leading the charge of a very emotional you know please be around what

indictment come down around this whole thing when did you mean by that\nWell you know\nThis deal was uh [noise] well scheme was formulated over the last several years that didn't happen to the ...

the city of Atlanta and corruption in terms of like for for instance\nI myself along with other I'm concerned Citizens United of fat cat we've all discovered that this was done out of protocol outside of the realm of what's legal with regard to the city charter why haven't we backed up to that instead of arguing whether or not this is a viable deal well\nI mean we have the city council the mayor that were elected last year and we're just going to have to do a better job at citizens electing people trust [noise]\nA America in a city council that\nConsults developers for their concerts\nSix or seven people [noise]\nUh how towers developers is more important than what the people\n[noise] okay so I I took a couple of things away from the red light the Gulch meeting that that happened this past Thursday right and a church and he sent Lana often more land and ... and it was comprised of you know it was a mixed group of folks aren't if you're white faces mostly black and\nWhat I noticed with something I've never noticed before in a setting of activism I because I honestly I've never been subjected to a a setting with this level of activism whether it\nBe you know the shame and chanting and shouting um you do a one lady got up and said that she was tired of you know being subjected to modern day slavery here in the city of Atlanta because that's our that is our historical fiber here\nAnd you know the one thing that I really want and she didn't mean to offend anyone in the room and she prefaced her statement with that and I thought to myself well I'm not offended because he should doesn't look like me\n[noise] so you're modern day slave to a slave owners don't look like me in this instance with your city representative okay so I'm not offended by that but what I noticed was that intrinsically blacks are more concerned with fairness\nAnd whites on the other hand seemed to be more moved by their safety and their finances\nAnd so it's just they left me wondering\n[noise] one thing why\nIn the midst of painting signs preparing future rallies getting out to knock on doors and going to businesses why is it that not one person is talking about the basic fundamental issue of the Gulch while we're\nAll arguing about feasibility of the Gulf ... no one no one not one person is bringing up the legitimacy of the Gulf and when we come back\n[noise] and they
