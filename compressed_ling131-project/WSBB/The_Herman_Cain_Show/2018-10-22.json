I'm I I adults\nI Do hang on either side yeah doping is Sunday's are good for you who don't it's not a thing\nBy virtue of the calendar you are the ... the question is do you act like one there is no adult ...\nNow you got friday and the cat or dog and then Sunday is adult day Sunday Sunday and then the way your it and I\nDo it's almost like a west side story so you're an adult all the way [noise] an adult tang as it's known as a twenty four seven proposition there are no vacations from it you know once you're an adult you expected you act like an adult at all times\nWhen I go to ... I'm not at all things and\nSo you So Frank Sinatra and his gang weren't adult things like that yeah well so it doesn't surprise me but it is a problem look the reason that you have two different words work and play\nBecause they're not the same thing I work hard at play venue are useless or you work hard to play hard if somebody if somebody was so they're all working hard to play hard as long as you know that there's a difference between the two you don't bring your pets to work\nI Would pay millennials to not come into the office if it means I don't have to deal with their pets\nBecause what happens with people in their pets when their pets around their pets or Ninety nine point nine percent of the attention getters you're not going to throw yourself and do work with your pet and by the way if you constantly have to go the bathroom something has\nTo be dealt with why not even having to lecture people about I have ...\nAnd then my dad is actually what I was walking around me off where there'll be a state we have the ... we have this wonderful courtyard if I ever got a dog I'd love\nTo forget just what I Want to see out that window dog is going to the bathroom [laughter] that's exactly what I Want to see it was mostly\nGet over it plus my dog is super cute and small and like when he met her un love her and learning I work I Would I Would not when you see the money in thing as an agent that was cooking around\nHow he got it and it's still the flag and mom where's mine I'm like you really okay and try to plow yeah Enron Instagram hash\nTag a lot of people like the seatbelt law than Amy Schumer I\nWas a once great country I promise you [laughter] [laughter]\nOh yeah okay when was that grain when like when you were in charge now women are taking out you\nKnow I'll tell you what it was great it was great when everybody understood that they couldn't bring their pets to work and nobody questioned that well what did I Know when it rang changing a man or a dog a qualifies as an emotional support and ah\nThen I I mean seriously Jared like she knows that I'm not that I Know I'm On my bed and she comes up to me and she's like yeah with that in the ... I think it might\nReally are always there for me [laughter] takes care of you you like the more than people imagine [laughter]\nSometimes especially right now I'm Talking to you know what I Would pay millennials not to come to work that's what I Would do that was that the study ask a bunch of old men [laughter] they would take a pay guy if millennials to pay other people more not to have to work from home\nYou work from home [laughter] difference okay that's fine we'll do it I'm experiencing life shut up and get to work next\nAre not working out of this area this is not good for you or do you try to put me in a bad mood I'm just I'm just looking at another every team I ever cared about last yesterday come on automatic looking out for you with this next I think it's a survey or not working out is worse for your health than smoking in diabetes diabetes either\nOh than smoking in diabetes diabetes\nDiabetes according to saying that like adult diabetes\nDi di beating a this is new research from the journal American of the American Medical Association Santa yeah jama so this is not good man working out ... leads the donuts\nYou have you seen there are a kid but this joke together but anyway the punch line is gonna be ...\nAnyway uh work on it while I was only write this down ... yes ma'am I'm I ...
