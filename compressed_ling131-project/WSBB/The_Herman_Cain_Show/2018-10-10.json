Iowa who are in favor of ethanol subsidies if\nYou just shut your mouth about yeah right her own about any welfare program because you can't do that you can't do that you don't believe in anything unless you were willing to take short term pain\nBecause you believe it's the right thing in the long run man if you don't believe enough\nThat you actually turned down do one subsidy you believe you need then you don't believe a damn thing so shut your mouth\nOf you're not doing well I'm I'm looking at the trends your air the Iowa straw poll for I'm not you know a lot of younger beating me I think it's a little ... and this is not good you see I wouldn't I wouldn't have\nThis emotion I fight Elizabeth Warren goes to a ... says yeah of course absolutely I expect that\nBut don't talk about

wine in Georgia\nYou couldn't get it from another state I don't know if that's still true\nYou couldn't get it from another state and I don't know if that's still true but for years and years and years it was the spirits industry in Georgia we spent a lot of money a lot of lobbying bought a lot of politicians why to keep competition out and\nThen go around the call yourself a business person know your last that right man you're not a business person you're a business person you welcome competition if you don't welcome competition if you don't welcome the competition that that can be some of the most then you don't get the right to walk around the call yourself a business person\nYou believe in crony capitalism\nBut you're the business guy who is big enough to buy the politician that protects you good for you but you've lost the right to call yourself a business person\nAnd to any Republican from Iowa who believes in ethanol subsidies I don't want to hear a damn thing from you about one single welfare program horse subsidy that you disagree with\n'cause you're full of it\nGetting emotional like Lindsey Graham your photo crap\n[laughter] autocrat\nAll right what are we doing here what's next I think we have some ... lines and charts oh study surveys and others sundry items [noise]\nIt's very steady surveys and polls on the sun has played doctrine being a person by the way [noise]\nIs a state of mind [noise]\nIt's not just what's good for you\nKnow give me some studies surveys crafts lines polls whatever well this this study from the media Research Center oh there are good and\nNow they're kind of get a lot of research on on the yeah oh yeah they did they ... they spend a lotta time yet focusing on they're kind of conservative right or in very conservative and I got to get 'em all confused like wallet hub I Believe those are communist right now [laughter]\nI think that the socialist loving us right now [laughter]\nAnd if anybody\nFor the good people from while the tub that was just a joke [laughter] and apparently\nThe find folks that media Research Center say that the American economic boom has been largely ignored or by the media by the mainstream media and Trump's TV coverage has been Ninety two percent negative\nCan I say something boy I Hope it it's been a lot of money on that research [laughter] I just asked me I Would have said I made I've been able to put it down to Ninety two percent but I could have said well it's it's a it's above Ninety of course there's a there's a complete narrative there's a there's nothing wrong\n... there's nothing paranoid about thinking that the so called mainstream media is building a narrative against the president I mean it's just obvious\nI just wish they would cop to it I mean MSNBC cops to it right oh of course famous Fox cops to being a on the right CNN or the annoying ones\nOh no we're like the Columbia school of journalism and when they get right down the middle and you\nKnow you're about to these folks that's been a lot of time they they cover the economy\nBy the way is booming and we're we are by by omission by the lack of stories about that the narrative is it's not that important\nAnd you know in a way a lot of young people may believe that because\nRemember during the Obama era the idea was a a oh we're never going to get those kind of jobs back again ever that's it's a new world\nBut the days of every succeeding American generation doing better than their parents those days are over even\nThough there was a lot of that feeling around like yeah it's a new century things are different and no more manufacturing jobs yeah America's gonna have to learn to kind of be just another country\nAnd so there's probably still a lot of appeal to that idea I just don't know how far can go while the economy is on fire I mean how how how how important to you are a political public bathroom issues\n[laughter] compared to the economy\nIn the past that would be a slam dunk for the economy will find out in the midterms how people feel about it now I suppose and don't get me wrong Trump is quite often involved or I get that I get that or is he not people's idea of what a president should act like I I I get that\nBut look at the opposition and the last couple of weeks and the surrounding the Kavanaugh hearings it's not like you have saying rational people who are saying hey we need to get the presidency back into you know being sane and rational\nYou weren't persuaded by the people clawing on the door of the Supreme Court I wasn't personally you his thing and I were noted for what'd you saw them call I got the dollars like okay wow that's somebody that has the priority who'd you noticed that they\nBefore they started calling other doors they look to
