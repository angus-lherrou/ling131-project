this one I Would give it a no story no story here\nThis is a this is where hey hey hey come out of the millennials gather round the radio box time for ... knowledge drop\nThe headline especially on Fox the U.S won't\nGive visas to same sex partners of un officials anymore well the reason is because it is now legal in this country\nThe reason that they were giving them out before it was it was a waiver saying well it's not legal in this country but if you're with the UN or whatever we used to we always kind of automatically gave us visas to\nUh the spouse of\nWhoever was here for the un there was a problem when I'm gay marriage was illegal here and then the spouse would be the same sex when what was done there was what was in place was okay we can get that as things but marriage gay marriage is legal now\nAnd so for that reason there's no need for this because\nAll spouses are covered and even within this they said look if people happen to be from a place where it's frowned upon will look into each individual thing but this is a great example of any time you pass anything impossible to get rid of it when you don't need it anymore this was a carve out\nWhen ... gay marriage was illegal in the United states it's not legal\nIt's another headline that just it's completely misleading so next outrage\nRussian space agency says space station hole was deliberate sabotage oh deliberate said hold on to the space station they say happened during the manufacturing of the space yeah she's\nBeen a big thing is gone yeah teeny thing\nAnd uh the first time that first they thought maybe it was a little piece of space debris 'cause you don't thousands of miles an hour or so so like something a brain of sand\nCan cut a hole a then they realized that wasn't that then they thought maybe it was somebody who made a mistake on the ground and tried to paper it over somehow and that came loose now they've pretty much come to the conclusion that it was sabotage\nOn the ground intentional sabotage yeah which uh which is frightening for ... you\nKnow this is taking care of it was a very small we I guess ... they were able to not care of eyes of a drill bit yeah right yeah that's what I thought it might have been a mistake was paper it over at first\nBut right now if this thing was sabotage that guy or gal\nIs still working at NASA or the mosque out what is it called ... the Moscow\nYeah ... Ross Hamas Ross Cosmo comedian ... most wanted\n[laughter] wow the universe [laughter]\nAs though that if he fell [laughter] here today in the ... the new [laughter]\nSo a few\nThings we do the most ... I don't think we know yet and maybe I don't know enough about the story but I I Believe I don't know exactly where this just because we're hitching rides with Russians doesn't mean the way it was it made this part of the international space station was made their so whoever where I think it wasn't the actual station itself it may have been something\nThat was shocking but uh if it was sabotaging that means that person is probably still working and needs to be sucked out or we could have bigger problems I say the real sabotage is the international\nSpace station worse\nReal sabotage is the international\nSpace station worthless [noise] what what the hell do we\nGet out of this thing sabotage enough we found out that worms didn't well I Know it's important but it can be found out without an International Space\nBut they're certainly need to see how things and people and and objects and land land and we do things and we've been doing that for Thirty years ago when there's a hurricane they always have awesome pictures that come from the international comes from any\nSatellite instead [laughter] maybe not that good because they're only a hundred and some odd everybody thinks it's so far up there isn't that far up no was it a hundred and fifty miles\nLike you're a little jealous you know like oh they're not that far up saying [laughter] so great to have at least they're not\nIt takes a lot of money to keep this thing afloat I don't know we're getting out of it at this point I'd rather spend money building things to go to land on asteroids and tell us things that we don't know I'd\nBe honest with you I think we could probably create the international space station a lack of gravity on earth and and do all that testing down here I just don't think we're getting a lot

enough\nThat year with Taylor Swift beyond seas genius was not why does the where the ... even though we know he doesn't agree with everything Trump stands for\nIt's because he's a non politician never done it before ... back sixteen Republicans then beat the Democrats and everybody said was going to be ... so that's his whole if you look at it that way it's no you should appreciate who Trump is even if you don't even if you disagree with him because he went and did things that people said couldn't be done\nAnd Ilan Musk what is he doing he's doing things that people said couldn't be done and that now the problem is he lumps himself and as a genius who was not taken seriously enough or appreciated enough as well that kind of water debt waters doctors thing but\nI Love the fact that

percent pass the whole thing Seventy two percent and it's not a very difficult it's it's made to be an easy passing\nTest yeah you you have to get a Seventy percent yeah to pass which is what the usual yeah okay\nSo uh so you have to be a C student of American history to pass this Nineteen percent\nOf the population past Seventy two percent of respondents respondents either incorrectly identified or unsure of which states were part of the Thirteen original states now I don't know if you ask me off the top of my head rattle them off\nYeah name out there that would make it easy\nI why kill it but I mean I might mess up just rattling them off because I'm not good at just without seeing so but I Believe these people were showed a map\nAnd couldn't identify ... which in the map thing it's very easy 'cause it's basically all the northeast except for Vermont and Maine yeah do you think the way down like Ohio [laughter] yeah so I you know you stepped on me I was still giving people the the way to do this all of the northeast except for a Vermont and Maine\nNew York state in there and then all the way to Georgia on the coast right basically\nPretty much I think was in Vermont part of a part of that as well I don't think so but you know I mean you guys are fumbling I always say it's not it's not easy to say that first Dahmer statistic\nMakes a little bit of sense right Seventy two percent incorrectly identified the Thirteen original states and then it goes on to twenty four percent could correctly identify one Benjamin break at one thing Benjamin Franklin was famous for with thirty seven percent believing he invented the light\nBulbs thirty seven percent I Believe the Benjamin Franklin invented the light fault [laughter] well the thing that high or whatever and I was a little\nKid for a while until I understood the reality of the world I thought that he invests\nAnd for a while until I understood the reality of the world I thought that he invented electricity oh sure rather than figuring out a way to harness lightning yeah and you are\nCorrect about Vermont Vermont was the fourteenth state part of New York at the time correct\nYeah and there was yeah so I was young adults are here it's easy to have you see if you see if they say hey which ones you just you count don't count Vermont or main you bring in New York state all the northeast and then down to Georgia that's Thirteen original college whether or not I could just named them off the top of my head maybe not so great\nYeah twenty four percent could correctly identify one thing Franklin was famous for\nYeah thirty seven percent believing invented the light\nBulb present a of people thought the Cold War was caused by climate change\nWell of course it was too cold back then was the whole neither having a fight about yeah there is a big fight about how cold it\nWas you know we're laughing but this does twelve percent incorrectly thought World War two general Dwight Eisenhower led troops in the civil war\nOr boy I Would like to see how the the rest of the percentages of people under forty five break down by age yeah it's like if you're I don't know what I don't know what age they went down to are they going down to like Thirteen\nNo no I think there probably is probably adults eight adult thing I mean yeah I Would imagine sure you don't expect kids they know everything\nBut an Eighteen year old they might not be totally familiarity hell do we force people\nTo go through all these uh uh years in school if you if you don't walk out with the knowledge of this you know they all do no doubt that level that bullying is out of hand in this country this\nThey bring peanut to my school was actually\nBecause sometimes people just get a whiff of peanuts right they blow up\nThey don't like the hockey over the weekend and they came up and the kid [laughter] we'd heard the story this way no never bring peanuts the school but we were Ben Franklin was not so sure something about a\nKey recognized the name didn't he invented the five and dime [laughter] about if you did five ended die so that is the the you know were laughing about\nIt but you know you have all these people who were I was like all those people that trapped Jeff Flake in the elevator oh yeah I think everything needs to be stopped there has to be given this test if they don't pass the test get out of the elevator you ... you're not going to you don't have the right to decide what the future should look like unless you know what the past\nWas anyway next story\nA Sylvester Stallone is starting filming for Rahm both sides\nSo that's just loan I Believe is Seventy two years of age [laughter] hey you\nGuys they live in a guy that you guys do you view was you know\nYeah he's one of these yeah really a western but things were Rambo is just this character who keeps getting into these jams\nAs ... showed\nNo I mean there is a human trafficking fighters are so somebody near him on the ranch the their daughter gets taken and\nHe ends up going into Mexico or something with them or something like a little bit to that goes into Mexico or New Mexico I don't know where to get us but he ends up ah yeah he's a cowboy now is like a retirement on Iran somewhere in the southwest is\nRising or they are that you have to take things into his own hand though when he does his ... both hands acts both hands are used to use both this in this movie he gets to use but I Know in the earlier films you have one hand tied behind his back but at this one\nYou know this was the one hand\nI got I was just 'cause he's doing something else or the other hand like a cell phone call but anyway\nUh it missed one of the good like the character who just happens so I think it's a kind of a road movie for a little while while he goes\nWith the mother the father to try to find the kid man when he gets there boy he's five they uncover a huge human trafficking thing and the only way the only way to fix this is for Seventy two year old Rambo to kick some Fannie\nAllen Allen is so excited and Allen is excited to see the last ramble movie I didn't uh didn't that take place like somewhere as Irma\nFrom the drug trafficking in Burma and rubble whatever was going on there and it was just bullets and blood and gratuitous violence thing I just got to get out of it was the island like crazy was it fun was a good yeah it was actually not bad I'm Sorry\nIf not that long ago did you say here that rocky that creek came out so actually it was along with that I Want to I think there's probably even hen or something when eleven\nWas sixty seven no it wasn't the same year ... I think well maybe it was the same as ... it was it was shot right after he did rocky Balboa yeah okay well then I was the same year they're one of those and that same period of time and that was like eight years ago now though he was\nHe was a young the kids the emails always a good movie it was that's a that's a well done movie you know I started to see that\nThere's a rocky five just reminds me of those people who are in\nHand though fire oh Iraqi I'm Sorry to Iran\nAre in their MO father oh sorry rocky I'm Sorry to Iran but the fact that there's a new Rambo and all the Rockies hey ... what what we don't go after the rocky franchise it reminds me of someone who is in their thirties and still talking about their high school days\nWell only but what about pre which is known as a a great movie which I still haven't seen I have it I still haven't seen it my wife will watch it with me 'cause she says she doesn't like Sylvester Stallone stupid face [laughter]\nWow I Can't I Can't I Can't get around this we have as soon as she can't stand his face\nYour surgery has kind of settled yet it was a pretty jarring I think in the early to\nLike he's facing the original rocky she's never use race she thinks he has a stupid face I had this argument I mean we've had you would not believe the extended arguments about semesters to load my wife and I have had because I have\nUm ... the first rocky\nIs like a great independent small film you if you go back and watch that it's a great movie but you you can't know she now we know Sylvester Stallone and we know the dumb things and you know all the bad movies made you have to go back to the original rocky is nobody knew this guy was and it was a coal\nSort of independent small film that got huge and taking a vet level though the original rocky is still very good uh\nThe other Rockies aren't that great to me until you get to rocky Balboa\nAnd and then like I say I slept in pre cause I keep trying to get my wife to watch it with me and she refuses to look at a stupid face as she says to me [laughter]\nSo we should shut a why wouldn't you wish you were shot don't get that she's in the movie she's increase she's pretty dumb like Sylvester Stallone face and I it was another thing I said about Stallone who has been a lot of stupid things and some of the movies is written or like the written by ten year olds\nYou know everybody does he died you know whatever but he's done he's done a he's done great work does it end well Copland was interesting\nThere's a scene in there with him and to narrow\nThe narrows eaten a sandwich doing his message nonsense\nAnd Sylvester Stallone\nActs rings around Robert De Niro and the scene I'm going to say in the mirror overall is not a bitter actors and still own butts alone took that one seriously in the mirror was going to get in or something but if you watch that scene in that particular scene so loan out acts Robert De Niro by model\nShe has the ability when he decides and that's why I really want to see this movie creed and I have it you better 'cause ... coming up I Know recruit you probably won't be as goes for the same way rocketry wasn't as good as rocky oh the rocky too was kind of a kid but if you've done that it wasn't until rocky three when we first club or leg that was a good movie [laughter]", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "04"}
