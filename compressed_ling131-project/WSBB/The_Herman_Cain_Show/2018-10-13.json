free to point on Ninety five and I am seven fifty a couple of years as the hands on it depends\nAh institutional investors we have our own internal team as well and we can make cash offers on homes in close on them quickly I'm In a conditional issues aren't necessarily as big of a factor for a U.S than maybe for a retail buyer you know that by who's looking to live in the home personally\nUm and you know the the there is a slight discount to market value but it's not an extreme discount usually somewhere between um you know a Ninety cents on the dollar but for some folks in situations like Catherine [noise]\nIt's it's the right decision for them um and how we work it as we come out we present both options we look at the market value and we look at the a guaranteed offer value um so certainly good real estate agents that have been in the business of while should have a network of investors they can work with but um we could certainly uh help as well\nGathering at great All right thank you\nThank you for the call for all for eight seven zero seven fifty is the number I don't really get a hold them are staying realty we let them march Spain dot com yeah mark Spain out on his

calls get answered live in we respond right away\nThere you go and we're going to talk about this or that the deal that you have working at your advertising right now in a little bit got a couple more phone calls were still a phone lines are still open and for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty Mike is in Marietta Mike you're on the home fix the Joe\n... a whole a six year old three and a half bash completely upgraded and ...\nBass completely upgraded inside out new infrastructure ... cetera however uh got us thirty eight click a short little ...\n... a little lighter knew what so do I fix the pool a fire sale or do I just feel it in the landscape and go away\nYou know I Would probably recommend filling it in and landscaping at a really well it's probably going to be cheaper than completely fixing the pool and you know for most buyers or you know today I'm\nPools are becoming a little more attractive for for buyers because sometimes with dual income families in work it's just harder to get to the neighborhood pool or maybe the community doesn't have one um but you know I just speaking from personal experience you know that same other side of that coin is you know when you're both um you know a husband and wife or working or whatever\nUm you know it's not a lot of time spent in the pool says some people do look at them as more of a hassle\nUm they look at it like more of a liability um folks with young children sometimes obviously have safety concerns so um you know I Would really be a cost issue for me so I Would get a quote on repairing the liner and getting the pool and great working condition and maybe the filling in landscape and I would just go with whichever is less expensive that would be my advice\nOkay I appreciate that professional opinion because I did that and sell it in that contrary to what I thought is incredibly ... two to three times to cost fiction it\nOK radio than I Would fix the pool I think that makes the most sense it's just whichever is less expensive\nYeah okay so it's a economic as she thanks for your expertise\nSame thing I I wouldn't have thought that costs a dirt I guess as a you know more expensive than some would think if ah if I filled out there and if I went ahead and filled in a pool of course he's got a big pool and thirty two principal\nIf I had a smaller pool or an area like that and I filled it in and planet when I had to disclose that there's a pool in my backyard then I'd still man [noise]\nYou know it's not on the standard disclosure but I'm a big believer in uh over disclosing you know if there's anything that could be a factor that would influence the buyers purchase you want to make sure to disclose that um you know\nA once again it's not on the standard form of the specific question but I Would I Would I Would put that in as a write in for sure just because you don't want anything that could come up at the last minute that could give a buyer way to wiggle out of the contract\nOr are they started and after years ago we should put in a pool back here in right now already one there he just wanted to dig that dirt bag out you can probably spruce it back up for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty is the number Paul is in Noonan all started with Paul Newman there for a second but [laughter] what's up top\nThat I'm not the only guy in the studio and I think you're Paul Newman so\n[laughter] I Wish I had bought off money man I Wish I had as good looks\nYes late to uh I got a question in reference to I Know you've been speaking a little bit about inspections and everything mhm [noise] um I've been in my house about too much I headed inspect uh about three weeks ago I noticed I I have a courtyard with a a\nA you can put an outdoor kitchen there and it's got about a ... a ...\nCovered so to speak roof over mhm and I'm going to cost me about five hundred dollars to get it requires ... what happened was a lie inspector misstep\nOr solve rotten mhm and uh as an adult all I Want to do is just get it fixed and I know I'm going to have it\nBetter or does or does a purchaser stand on and then you know uh and shit like that\nWell you know basically in Georgia um it is somewhat of what we would call a buyer beware state so the the buyers afforded the opportunity inspect the home um you know what you could look at is a review the sellers disclosure that was provided um by the homeowner\nAnd if maybe there was something in there that was misrepresented\nUm in other words they said there was no issues with that particular I'm a part of the home or no a structural or would ride issues you could have a a case with the um you know home seller\nI'm the reality though is that at five hundred dollars you know the cost of a lawsuit or engaging with an attorney even just to have an hour consultation with some attorneys can eat up most about five hundred dollars so\nUm you may want to go back to the inspection company I mean most inspection companies have a lot of hold harmless is in sort of a ... attached to it but you know just from a customer service standpoint let him know that you know there was a missed and maybe they're willing to help you with that repair but\nI think unfortunately unless there was some deliberate misrepresentation by the seller I'm it would be challenging and then the other side of that is you know once again the cost of engaging with an attorney but that said no harm in reaching out to your agent and asking them to reach out to the you know the sellers agent and maybe they can talk to the dollar and see if they're willing to come together\nTo make that situation right um\nTogether to make that situation right um yeah\nI have I have reached out to the inspector\nA problem is they hadn't even returned my emails all out or anything like that\nBut I mean I ... I just didn't know where a purchaser which Danielle shot at so uh appreciate you know appreciate all that it can be fixed but and it's no big deal it's just a it was miss\nWell certainly frustrating but you know in in today's world you know we obviously have a a louder voice as consumers in\nThere's review platforms out there that are available to use social media I'm so since you're having a hard time getting that inspector on the phone you may just want to inform others about your experience him I'm either a you protect other folks or be it motivates them to maybe return that phone call and do the right thing\nRight All right well look a certain I'd appreciate it and are you guys have a great day\nActually the commissary Neumann thank you All right you're listening you know take the news Ninety five five and am seven fifty\nW.
