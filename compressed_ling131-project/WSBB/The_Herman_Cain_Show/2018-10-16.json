Terminator is and Captain America as well but the end of humanity AI and super humans could wipe us out\nKnow there's a possibility right I mean I very smart I heard of that and I realize I'm just saying it was a possibility any kind of technology has a good and bad that comes with it it it would go back to the harnessing a fire\nImagine how much better life became when you could harness fire you could have a light at night you could cook food people were getting sick but on the other hand third degree burns were happening as well as people would use them to set somebody else's place on fire\nOh people would use them to say that somebody else's place on fire and starting right they're all technologies can be good and bad you got a lot of good technology a lot of good things from land line telephones you also had perverts crepes\nCall [noise] there's always the outside\nYou know we all know the Internet means that every piece of information of all times at our fingertips and then we all know all the bad stuff about the Internet and just and a hackers and everything so I think now the Stephen Hawking is dead I think I can say to a Stephen Hawking you're probably right but it's pretty obvious doesn't take a genius\nTo tell me that like that with an excuse me let's like the dead genius have their say\nApparently it and it did make out as the melon Jeanette my foreign me\nOut of the people have warned us about a technology in the future namely Terminator two oh like when they fail I Know the love is the baby\nSo what what is the is there a scenario that he hits on that's going to be the end of the world\nWell with the AI there's the he fears the consequences of creating something a mattress surpass humans are we're limited by slow biological evolution we wouldn't be able to compete\nAnd then with DNA manipulation for example there's a a DNA has been manipulated create low fat pigs friday do this you can cure diseases such as cystic fibrosis but then some people like that like giving myself bigger muscles in a better in the rain and\nYeah and then rich people so rich people will start to design children with perfect attributes and know disease and at some point those people will be so much smarter than the other people that don't have this advantage because they will take over and they'll be able to sort of learned over the other people\nBut again you start with exactly my point because it's all starts with the uh the lean pigs and being able to get rid of some diseases so you have the good and then there's always the ability to exploit and use it for nefarious purposes\nCan you make an avatar where you can put your brain in it but then now you're human where where everything is perfect\nWell don't ask me ask Greg rush to host of tech Tuesday\nGreg could I make a better version of myself\nOr eventually oh good I don't know the ... the ... the correct answer that you're talking about taking an avatar so you want to upload your brain

doing exactly the story that are coming off a little flat it's this I was very excited about this technology at first but yeah life right yeah that first year Beatty life is exciting and it's ... it's

mid thirties and you just fell in love and you just started your life together or you have a couple of kids you don't want to let go out this I'll tell you this uh\nThat go out this I'll tell you this uh the sex robot's saying this this story in particular has led me to believe that sex robots are going to be become for animals or the future [laughter]\nPeople have comfort squirrels they have but if you were if you weren't able to replace a lover who died suddenly at a young age\nAnd the person's like hey I don't have to go back out I don't have to get a deal with rejection again I don't have to restart this whole thing I can just for the rest of my life be with my favorite person and here's the great part it's everything good about her [laughter]\nCan make them better known ... no matter

know this could be a future that's very different\nI think it's a future where guys there will be a group of guys who just decide you know what I don't need the sex thing\nI don't need to deal with it I don't need to deal with the rejection I don't need any of it I'm I I've got a great way to never be accused of being inappropriate ever in the office place or anywhere else\nIs I just you know in in Japan you have a man who are marrying a Lowe's pillow cases that looked like animated characters so we know if it's\nGoing to have those they are ... feet not it is actually is a sex robot [laughter] that would be my own fall of humanity this is what Stephen Hawking missed yeah decks robots or the end I'm using for seconds is a fire truck or an MBA\nAre you so you're saying that that would be because at some point we no longer appropriate because we realize it's better just to have an animal lovers who don't bother us\nThat's the end a game of this but leading up to that just everyone's isolating and removing and not know how to interact and then with walk that's already happening because they're they're scared rejects you it's already happening this that I\nWas smart enough to her

I'm ... you think\nI appreciate somebody somebody finally thank me for my football sacrifice of show business I Do this for you\nAnd the audience so I haven't seen Monday Night football yet this year and I grew up in the bald guy are gone right and it's Jason Whitman who who's who's with Jason what and I don't know that guy's name I just don't you win and Bulger foreigners down on the field I haven't seen that he's like sits on one of the\nI'm One of the camera amounts or something right debates I have seen enough Monday Night football to see that so\nDebates I have seen enough Monday Night football to see that so I'm Jason Whitman apparently is not that good is this what you're telling me\nOr the Twitter verse the Twitter verse doesn't like him I've watched it a couple of times these awful okay\nSo he's a mallard prop guy in ... I don't know a nice guy no I Know but now that I'm saying ... always like President Bush then he messes things up to me you know the people not knowing them out of Providence is hard to put food on your family [laughter] when you mess up by max some kind of thing gotcha\nI say man and fish can coexist peacefully now that's just saying something stupid or a a mallard prop would be boy that took the wind out of our sales yeah\nNo no actually I Know that's an idiom amount of profit would be boy that took the sales out of our when Iraq or something like a cheap washed last year for that would be a ... that was right [laughter]\nSo uh I don't even know these are ballot problems are just stupid things so in this one he's first of all he refers to Aaron Rodgers who proved again last night I saw the highlights that he's probably the best quarterback in the week uh but he referred to him as what Sam Rogers [laughter]\nSam Roger I'm a I'm an either or that I thought he said do you say Aaron but do you hear the second time he says Sam\nSam Rogers okay so I got that wrong and I guess this is the part of the game where Sam Rogers is bringing the Packers back yes and uh and he says he uh pose a rabbit out of his\n\nActually pulled a rabbit out of his head while review the Green Bay Packers back on Monday Night football here is really is a truly is the best quarterback out their chase a buddy at the same\nTime they're gonna have to go back to the ironing board no they're going [laughter] drawing board [laughter] it's like to bring in more than they could drink [laughter]\nAnything crowds these last few go really hit the nail on a hat [laughter]\nHere's one where he says they gotta stop I'm kicking themselves or the ... yeah\n[noise] ... Cisco cannot [noise] themselves in a foot\n[laughter] comes to grade to page you can't judge a book by its price [laughter] as charity automotive points out these new yeah he says he's got his ... he retired last\nYear but here's what I thinking okay so last year Bruton John Bruton was in the booth correct Jason wit and was on the field but the Dallas Cowboys\nJohn Bruton left the boots went to the LA raiders I Believe they've lost all but one game they've been blown out of at least three of them\nAnd chasing Whitman apparently is terrible in the booth and the cowboys need them so I got an idea halfway why don't we just go back to the way things were I'm finding that Bruton off the sidelines back on Monday Night football get written down there so that a deck has another\nWeapon do you think it could be ... I don't know I think some people just I think he's probably kind of nervous you think it's hard to start their right Monday Night football you know it's great that we've got something Tony Romo jumped right up there yeah some ...\nSome people do that Tony Romo his obviously always been a good conversational rabid and gab he's got the gift of gab did you hear about that lady or whatever she identifies as I said\nShe's right they actions speak louder than hair [laughter] chasing when you got a little [laughter] All right but we have we have stepped on\nYour WTO or who they are my goodness gracious it's like the lady has one segment and the men\nThey take up for seven minutes of port yeah I was just making noises there for a moment to moment here to me\nI Wish I smoke one of those languages amazed by this but people that can tick tock that kind of language like yeah\n[noise] yeah you have you make a sound on either side of the click then you really sound like you're doing it go ahead like oh wow wow what's that mean I I it means um when you're speaking to a male Peggy\nOkay is that what it means [laughter]\nAll right go ahead and give me a story for WTO something I Want to leave\nIf you're a single Republican in a very big liberal city dating can be difficult no new called Donald ... has been created promising to make American date again\n[laughter] Donald day there is there you go to sue these people for no\nI Love it intact here's a cut of the things I like it better than they are the only as you had to swipe right [laughter]\nYep it'll help you build a wall of ...
