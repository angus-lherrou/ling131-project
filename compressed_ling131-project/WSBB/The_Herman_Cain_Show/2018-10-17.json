it's nice because we didn't have a candidate with ... and and now that we have we used to have more yeah candidates with ... in this country and those teams have gone away I think it was a it was a sign that the aristocracy yes from the old English days people in a big old like the candidates like\nTed Kennedy maybe guys named Ted\nI don't know I'm learning I read his platform yesterday seems like a decent candidate caused the libertarian platform right yeah I'm all for it to Betty doesn't have a chance to when\nYou think November fourth is a little too close to election day there because obviously would vote on Tuesday Wednesday Thursday is today you for it if you're not decided by that Sunday\nAnd then out and they say there's very little uh well that's his commentary\nAt General Motors said\nShould know by November fourth no and I wonder if I didn't write it probably should have been a week or two earlier and\nIf the polling is correct on this race there are very few people who are undecided at this point the rate among does raise or are you undecided I Am ... and I was a mess that you're thinking uh ...\nWell now that I'm ... now that he's in the mix I I guess we're not going to vote for ... sounds like a gangster friend like\nThat he met [laughter] like he's really into\nThat I'm a I was going to say\nIt sounds like a baseball player but not because of the Mets at us with the best baseball player names or their model ... for the first name and the and the last name or well okay\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI don't know what he's talking about what over my head [laughter]\nSo yeah you're probably right two days before the election thank you well you know I might have welcomed I might go get a beer\nI might know by November fourth which is what I was getting it yeah it's my birthday\nHow do you not know how do you know there's such a a a fine line here well I Know you're not going to vote for Mets and I and and uh we met Stacey Abrams a few weeks ago seem for like a very nice person I don't take the policies I'm not rejecting her as a person I'm not saying anything bad about it I'm just saying I don't like those policies\nAnd I'm not a fan of that so but in in in reality I could either vote for the libertarian candidate just to keep libertarians on the ballot for some unknown reason perhaps at some point they'll decided to try to actually win that's vote for Stacey Abrams and they could be\nMud turning toward Brian Kemp which if I vote for Brian Kemp there won't be like wholeheartedly I like guys who point shot guns that teenagers kind of thing you're going to be our I'm just like you know less taxes you know basically generalize but I got to tell you\nIt's Brian Kemp is running I sucking no campaign\nThat it was even walking through the same way I keep expecting the ad blitz to start at any time\nAnd he's going to have and that maybe the whole thing is to just drop a lot of money in the last week or two gas which might be the smart thing to do because there's a lot of national money coming in from the Democrats I'm not so sure there's a lot of national money coming into the Republicans is there no there probably should be because they could lose a I'm a red state\nYou know two states could go blue as far as governors go\nGeorgia and Florida right here on a you know last year at the bottom of the she brings out enough voters than the house could go ... well that's another one that's another one that you get a Brian Kemp could hurt\nA candidates lower down\nOn the ballot if if people are excited about him and they don't go out if people get excited about Stacey Abrams you know there's the historical park yeah it doesn't mean anything to me this is America I assume leaders are going to come in all varieties and flavors in America but its history if she's the first African American\nNot only African American governor but female\nOr and the same things going on in Florida and so you've got a lot of lot of blue money coming into the state will go and if people go out because they're excited about the idea of Stacey Abrams yeah while they're there they're not going to vote for Republicans in the house as well as long as it is it all over the Democrats so\nAnd that candidate that the Republicans have in Florida and very good\nUh uh oh yeah he seems to not know what he's doing now is it the worst two Republican gubernatorial candidates ever and these two states I mean it got to people I don't know Stacey Abrams is being smarter she is not running around calling herself a social life\nBut Jill I'm I don't think he's got a Bernie Sanders is coming in his burning for Stacy I\nKnow well let's bring in light of Warren was here I don't think a Sanders has been in\nThe state you know did Warren do the old a ... test lawsuits I hear the sea submitted it I didn't realize this yesterday but she submitted her saliva to be tested for Native American origins here in the state of Georgia really I Wonder if it was while\nMaybe Idaho's ... after she was hardly anyone over there at Clinton state\nYeah a bit oh yeah [laughter] another another gets the audience go in like a Q tip that [laughter]\n\nYou know there's the wheel spin the bottle [laughter] boy she's cooked yeah\nShe's completely cooked everybody hates or I've rarely seen a politician that makes a move that everybody hates the left is mad that she stepped on the midterms no matter what happens\nThe right is I think correctly mocking her for saying that she's a Native American 'cause she might be one sixty fourth at best a and then uh the uh the Cherokee tribe is mad at her for\nExploiting them for her own purposes and you all lives about war and you always see my ...\nBut I Know are you and it's been a couple of days and let me tell you it's close to ... which means no God\nIs and what a while you'll ever you're speaking to your Lakota you call yourself a Cherokee well this is actually wish chairs back and forth but she's an Indian out the Cherokee and yet [laughter]\nYou don't include me God donate which which is everyone\nA let's just war did you just run a marathon or something you're always out of\nBreath I don't know what you mean like the ... I think running a marathon is a great idea I think maybe\nAlright [laughter] being a Native Americans who are you going to pass them\nI'll play you know I Can't imagine ever having a president who doesn't go their women horse races [laughter]\nNeeded at least\nI think she was called the her with face of horse or something might be something like that very well you're doing a very\nGood job oh you're not my native culture you're not the only one who could speak charity I I I had share albums when I grew up [laughter] it was a ... year it was last year for\nThe Cherokee people Cherokee try review and the raiders so proud to live so proud of the\nWord always out of ... just went to a bowl reviewing the raiders Joe I gather there are still hot are exciting no Elton John\nMovie oh boy oh\nListen to them more and this is going to be a campaign the show\nAre you tired of politicians who aren't Native American\nRussia you know I Am [laughter] I'll vote for me to vote for change\nWhat did you above the ...
