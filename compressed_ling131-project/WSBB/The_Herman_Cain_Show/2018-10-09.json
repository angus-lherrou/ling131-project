million dollars and then immediately self destruct dead by shredding itself within the frame\nYeah I'm calling uh this is I I don't know I'm not buying the story I mean I'm not buying the story\nI Banksy if you don't follow this guy he's kind of he's he's a real artist but he's also kind of an Andy Kaufman type with the art world and believe me the art world is snobby and ridiculous and they deserve to be ...\nWorld is snobby and ridiculous and they deserve to be parity so I'm not against him but uh the shredder like\nIt had it happened as soon as it was gaveled closed at Sotheby's one point four million dollars and then they started shredding itself I'm On the wall there had to be a lot of people in the room who are in on it first of all somebody is in the room to push the button to make the shredder activate\nHe ... he ... he put the shredder in there when he when he framed it a couple of years ago so there was somebody in the early and I knew more than that I think that Banksy was a part of whoever pushed it over a million\nBecause the ... isn't as good if it's seven hundred and fifty thousand the ... the stumped as good at a million or more um but the uh the art industry\nIs the collectibles the collectors are so ridiculous that there are people who are now saying it may have doubled in value now that it's been shredded I mean what do you own your own art\nYou you're you're just hoping that as time goes on people value this as much or more than you did so sometimes you can download it on somebody else\nBut you know so he plays a game\nWith the with that industry and I appreciate that game but there's something about this one people are just reporting on it like oh my God this thing happened I think that there were people in the room I think the artist was involved a lot deeper even in the bidding process\nThan people think and in the end they get the story that he wants but I don't think it was as good a prank\n[laughter] somebody has other great pranks you know he he will quite often because he has this name\nThat his stuff sells that's how it is in the industry you just by names basically most of these collectors don't even appreciate it and then just like it's an investment with that's five and so that name the artist name means something and\nWas unfortunate what like the art art school students or like from scat and stuff that actually but I'll get stuff\nWell that's this is what he does that I like is quite often he will take ah some of his best works because most valuable words and he takes them out and puts up a\nCard table on New York city streets and he sells his stuff for like six dollars and then [laughter] and so in a way if you're a socialist or something that's a way of like almost like giving money to the poor because once they find out they have a Banksy they suddenly for six dollars have\nYou know a hundred thousand dollars worth of something and I liked that stuff I was just something about this story I'm just not buying this happened over the weekends I there's something about it I'm just not buying is too too complicated with a shredder built into the frame\nSo uh but hey if those snooty idiots to collect ... got a little egg on their face I guess I'm all for it\nThat kind of I don't even really know why I'm excited for someone snooty to get their come up in\nLike the money they're gonna you know\nWell there are the people who collect art or some of the most annoying people and maybe that's what it is also the it's a it's a known fact by the way that you're just as likely to be by the fake as well as the real thing but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because as long as enough experts say it's the real thing it retains its value\nAnd the arts in that way as a little bit like wine yeah right where they wind blind tasting and yeah ... will claim that a relatively cheap wine is something very expensive\nYeah exactly ... and ... wine at least you can taste right I mean a painting that so many ... artistic case yet but they don't have the taste it's just that some expert tells them it's great\nAnd I think all my paintings but see how they ... if you need an expert to tell you whether or not you should buy a painting you shouldn't be buying a painting is the only reason you should be buying a painting skills he think it's awesome and you want to look at it a lot that's really the only real reason to buy a painting but\nAs we know it's more of an investment it's like buying a stock that you hope is going to keep rising over the next twenty or twenty five years
