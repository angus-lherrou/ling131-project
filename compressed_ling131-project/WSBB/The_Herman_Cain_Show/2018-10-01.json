basically says your opponent is in favor of pedophilia does anybody believe that and just that the point\nThat I Begin to feel a little bad but I think it's not long now I mean I I Know for us I mean I don't know no but I Would imagine that they've had conversations and the Arabs camp when does the right time to pull out the racism\nCard but do we need to oh oh hell yeah we will if we think it will help us\nWe will and so it's very likely that by the end you're going to have one candidate calling the other one uh in favor of pedophilia and then the other candidates going to be calling this

by another gang member\nAnd you feel bad that gang member and then you start realizing yeah but if you would have got shut off first he would've killed the other like they were involved in this sort of thing together\nNot the same story is gang member kills single mother walking to the store\nAnd so as I get older you know I just becomes it's weird or to me again I Can't get over the ads against this guy David Schaffer\nDuring the primary uh Jeff dominating and David yeah those are I I Want to get Jeff talking on the show but he has to repeat himself about David Schaper now now that he's one now that David Schaefer is not his opponent I Want this Jeff talking to come on and say yes\nCertainly I stand by it he was he's a shameful human being and I want him to use those words because you shouldn't and re in reality you shouldn't say anything about your opponent during a campaign but you wouldn't otherwise\nAnything about your opponent during a campaign but you wouldn't otherwise say after the campaigns over or hey he was been saying that for years\nBecause and I don't know David Schaffer I Know nothing about the guy you know a shameful I I Know that now I Do these commercials led me to believe this guy Schaffer not only shouldn't win but he should be jailed\nImmediately as a menace to society Jeff Duncan was allowed to come on this show if he will say with the same venom the things that he said about his opponent during the campaign\nI wanted to call for him to be jailed because that's the idea that I got is there anybody in the ... campaign that really believes what animate Stacey Abrams to be in politics and be the governor is to open up more clearance for pedophiles\nAre there are no actual issues that affect the state is Georgia so well run that we have nothing to talk about\nOur our transportation issues for the next ten to Twenty years just nailed down\nI'm supposed to vote for a candidate to stop someone who is going to remove\nAny restrictions on pedophilia this is what I'm being sold\nSo it's just sick I get older and I'm not picking just on camper Abrams as I get older and a little softer I find it to be sick that people are willing to assassinate the characters of their opponents for what power\nWhich seems silly to me who wouldn't want it but look at the last mayor I mean people love power they love being the people who can yeah I'm going to give you thirty six thousand dollars for the ugliest\nChristmas sweater it's taxpayer money but Avon power I'll do it sounds right ...\nYeah it seems to be a good expense sure\nSo as soon as you as you hear my commentary on things over there it's really the backdrop of is after all these years of really being under the scrum I'm getting older and softer and not really relating to the idea\nThat it's okay to assassinate the character of I what I Would love maybe these are mythical times when people said during debates I disagree with my worthy opponent\nLike those days are way gone but at the same time people used to kill each other in tools and beat each other up on the floor of the Senate so I guess there was no wonderful time I think really the genius of the founding fathers or I Would say the founders the fathers and mothers\nWasn't taking new that politicians were scum bags and so they boxed them in\nAnd make sure that we're always checks on them because they knew they couldn't create a system where just the best hardly people came forward\nI Can't imagine if Kavanaugh didn't do these things I Know we can't know because we weren't there but imagine if he didn't do
