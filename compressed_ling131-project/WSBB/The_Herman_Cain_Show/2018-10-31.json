I don't know how my cell phone number that out to the politicos\nBut I keep getting a text messages from President Trump and the Republicans look hey I'm a holdout I vote on election day I\nKeep getting about twice a day from President Trump oh we see him in my mind that the Trump looking over the voting rolls and\nGeorge I have to do to yeah there and it's done to your early voted yet you're busy worrying about fourteen or whatever [laughter] what am I what about the ... vote on election day I'm like you get a few weeks now go vote on election they're going to forget I'm not going to forget you may get picked up by President Trump himself but he comes\nTo a and it got really made me ...

SP radio out\nDoesn't the constitution apply to United States citizens\nEric ... somebody has a baby born in America from somebody that it's not a U.S citizen then I don't think the constitution would apply to them that might be the loophole\nOr no it's not true I and many other cases a and a lot of people don't like this and different cases having to deal with many different subjects are the Supreme Court has ruled\nAnybody in the United states of America is covered by the constitution and the fourteenth them and that's just the general the fourteenth amendment specifically says if you're born here\nYou are a citizen it doesn't and then subsequent Supreme Court rulings that we've as we've shown one and Eighteen Ninety eight one in Nineteen eighty two I Believe as a footnote by Brendan expanded the fourteenth amendment so all I'm saying is the first thing is this no matter what your opinions aren't anything\nYou should want it to be difficult to change the constitution the constitution can be amended it has been\nTwenty seven times I Believe but there have been I think thirty three or ... attempts twenty seven well ten of them went in at once\nBut there are five or six of them four of them I think are still out there there's a weird thing when you try to amend the constitution it doesn't go away four of them I think are still alive like equal rights among the IRA so it's it's it's a it's it's got its own logic\nIt's got its own logic to it but\nI just want to address this idea that I'm I'm hearing on Fox News and and other radio shows that\nThe Supreme Court has never ruled on the fourteenth amendment it's simply not true it's been ruled on it's been extended out and that being said\nMy opinion is it's being used as a loophole is being exploited\nAnd I don't like that and if we can change that the legislation I think that's a good way to go possibly but my overall opinion is and should be yours no matter where you are on the political spectrum it should be difficult to change the constitution the United states even the president by saying executive order saying I'm changing it\nHe's not saying\nHe's not dealing with the different language and saying it it doesn't mean this that you have to do that the legislation that's what Lindsey Graham is talking about how far that legislation would go I don't know but you know what a lot of people want to be equal rights amendment\nBut it never became an amendment because it's difficult to change the constitution and Republicans hated the equal rights amendment by the way\nI mean the name it's like if you're against it you're against equal rights yeah come on ...\nHey Eric as to the birthright citizenship\nIf Trump does an executive order there will be lost faith and then the courts will finally get a chance to decide whether this provision will apply to all children born here or exempt children born of illegal immigrants that are not here regularly\nI don't think that that is the truth I think that the Supreme Court my opinion would be that their ruling would not have anything to do with the substance they would simply say the ruling would be if they even got that far with if they took the case would be the president doesn't have the right\nTo put out this executive order and it would stop their legislation something passed into law and then someone on the left challenges that and it goes up to the court system and get to the Supreme Court yeah\nNow you've got something where you could actually rule on the you got the uh the fourteenth amendment versus this new law than the Supreme Court can get involved in a real way\nIf I may say if I get this right Jamie free believes the fourteenth amendment was passed so that a hundred and fifty years later a Mexican woman could swim across the Rio Grande river have a baby in taxes and that baby will be a set of a sudden a\nWell depending on how pregnant she was that'd be a hell of a tragedy can swim there [noise] um no that's not what Jamie's you pretty sad\nUm no that's not what Jamie's you pretty said see people get involved this is that gentleman suffers from what goes on a lot in this country on all sides my opinions or opinions their facts which\nMade your priest tried to tell you is what I just told you it's difficult to change the constitution I've been telling you all morning yes this is a loophole and it's being exploited but\nThere are loopholes middle loopholes when their constitutional loopholes by design they are difficult to fill\n[noise] I don't want to prejudge or some I've never met this gentleman I Would imagine that he's all for the second amendment\nYou've never heard the left make the same argument oh I'm sure when they put together Second Amendment or they were talking about the idea that you could basically have an armory in your backyard and ah you know have the ability to kill lots of people at once\nWell they probably weren't thinking of that but it's in the constitution\nYou know you start going around with language and amendments people who who love the second amendment should be aware of this whatever you know when you were aware of on your\nIssues apply it to people you disagree with every time there are plenty hey do you think let me ask you this do you think that uh the the uh the people put together the first amendment did it to protect pornography\nYou figured even occurred to them but they were that they didn't know what a hustler magazine was but he certainly didn't know what a online culture was going to become\nBut in fact if you hate pornography you have to deal with the fact of the first amendment protects pornography again\nYou are stuck with the parts of the constitution you don't like and you should be happy about that\nWell maybe this lady can bring us all back together here\nArid thank you so much for calling out both sides on trying to change the constitution why did people choose to be Republican what is the point is not that you want that competition upheld and all this for us it's just crazy thanks so much weight a guy and I appreciate\nIt but again I Want people to understand I Believe it's a loop hole I Believe is exploited and I wouldn't be against what Lindsey Graham wants to do I don't think it would go that far but Lindsey I tell you what are\nYou going to be swearing and everybody all the other side and found them and the guy hadn't come down there and kick your you know [laughter]\n... family re as they are not going to say bad words on it and I don't know what did I tell you a million bloom lately and fired at them and worry I used to be like Tom Reagan comedian now I'm a Sam kennison [laughter] they switched to get ten years younger over there", "year": "2018",
