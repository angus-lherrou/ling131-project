I mean\nNothing unusual so anyway I just wondered if you had any insight\n[noise] no I think and what I mean I think he did absolutely right with the sticky board you're knocking down the population and you shouldn't see as many numbers next year so I Would encourage you obviously in the winter you go ahead and take that trip down and then once we get into springtime which is typically April nowadays\nGo ahead and put them back up so you can knock that population down when they come back out after diet pause in the spring keep 'em up keep that population knocked down in the spring and I think you'll have a lot better success and then the next year\nOr something in their eye on Diane next year at the numbers go and see if you had more spiders\nRight well I haven't seen in ... dollars for a while but I haven't really seen a lot of spiders I I don't know it's so it's kind of weird but I Will be alert and thank you for the ... but\nI think science thank you keep us up to date for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty is the number so the answer marching to buy two I did like to hear that song would come out of the break okay there in the kitchen and one\nDay that they totally gone not a sign of anti one not a dead end not a or didn't didn't do that I don't want to hear that and that's an inflation so\nNot a sign not a young we add twenty five feet of an super freeway now not one sign of ants I go outside later and going up and down my\nMy doubts about the ads twice as many as over before just going up and down the drain uh the the uh down style\nI did know that's what I called the ... guys and but the day after that\nNot a thing that's when you guys got there of course there is no this is how it works you know I got this I got this and you get their comedy that's Britain and there's nothing so I've had him in two different places ... millions on them and it just disappeared for no apparent reason\nWhile you ponder the answer to that I'm not pondering I'm ready he's writing while well we got James and Tim and some others while save that answer this will be the ongoing saga of Dave's ants\nI called them all and Judy was handed a home fixes your news Ninety five five and am seven fifty ws be the home of the dogs [noise]\nNine forty eight nickel re carrier ws be twenty four hour traffic center crash on the connector north out past exit two forty nine ... pine street still has a left wing bloc that's less you back I twenty left lane also blocked by roadwork on eighty five in both directions you're highly three sixteen they're in the process of shutting down for right lane Seventy five north bound\nFor windy heal up they can't really starting to see delays in that area right lane closed in both directions on two eighty five\nOn the Southside between fifty one voter crest wrote an eye twenty the hawks are at a new State Farm arena tonight against the balls at seven thirty expect increased circuitry traffic downtown before and after the game Jill Nelson WSBIU\nYour drought just reading it I did a near sixty degrees with a mostly cloudy guy for Sunday mostly sunny low forty six hundred sixty eight\nAnd well even CNN flux of new jobs fifty thousand across the state most to limit communities like ours\nRon give who's running for governor is against expanding Medicaid the has NO PLAN for mixing our health care system it all his website already has seven words about here yep seven words those of us in Georgia are losing eight million dollars every day and watching our communities up all the lack of access to basic health\nCare at all because Ron camp and the Republicans in Georgia have refused to take action Ron camp bad for Georgia he just can't be trusted\nTo have them there was an eagle delivering for torture pay for the Democratic party in Georgia\nThat when you ask me about ... er Cox media group station\n[noise] twenty four hour news weather and five and am seven fifty\nAsked me to\nNo good morning at ten o'clock I'm Robyn will landscape live in the W S P twenty four hour a new center with our top story this\nHour we do believe that we've got the right guy we see unbelievable work like this on TV and in Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to bowl that's\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on the serial Melbourne suspect who left plenty of evidence behind including his fingerprints and since he'd been arrested ten other times he was in the system more now from ABC News\nPackage bombs out there and as they look into the background of suspects these are say President Trump is talking about what happened this week he held a rally in North Carolina last night here's ABC's ...

S. B.\nBellamy strict with Chevy Buick GMC her\nAnd we\nWe work hard every body of fair shot why everybody keeps coming back visit\nBellamy strictly Chevy Buick GMC or Bellamy strictly dot com find new roads\nWhat's the most important feature in your home comfort right adding lower electric and heating bills and bam you got a topic that\nYou've chosen the perfect ... remodeled your kitchen in bathrooms all with the goal of making your home more livable and comforting however one of the smartest changes you can make in your home is to improve your family angel gift physical comfort it may surprise you butt\nSo I'm not a reason I say that and ask those questions is because the biggest mistake that professionals Andy I wires make is they put out too many pheromones traps and then you start listing them in from outside\nAnd so I sit there and say sometimes the pheromones traps can work against you because you'll get rid of the problem and then you lure them back in from the outside so that you're the thing with your\nUm pantry moss is the cold hard truth you have to find the source and it gets frustrating for ... and that can sense that from youth throwing stuff away putting stuff in the freezer or you're just trying to find the source but what people neglect and forget about\nIs things like ...\nThey get into ... the pantry moss um they get into chocolate so it's just one of those things when one of my technicians walks into my office and and basically says what you just said is I grabbed a box of doctor when I called Dr gloves latex gloves and I put it right in front of him and I say leave the pesticide in the truck\nPut on knees and go to work because that's really what it is as you have to find the source and that can be frustrating for homeowners to find the source so it's literally every covered every door we have to go through because the pie return products yes they'll kill the adults but we have to find the eggs you know and\nThe sad part is is sometimes they just have to eat through the food source because we had one incident one time same ... situation is is\nPantry miles everywhere we cleaned out everything there is still there well what happened was is is underneath the stairway you couldn't get to\nSo they made an access under the stairway under the stairway was dog food and the malls were in the dog food and have the dog food get there who knows when they were built in the house\nSo you don't neglect certain Boyd's maybe\nThat could have been under construction like under your cabinets the kick played area is there are things under our kicked played area and how easy as it were to remove our kicked plate and to get under there and to see\nThose are the nuances to where it it it does get frustrating but you just you can't give up don't put out too many pheromones and I may even suggest you do away with those pheromones in the short term\nIf you do away with those pheromones in the short term and just to make sure you're not lowering them in\nA rush trading\nI mean I it trust me it's frustrating for our guys too because we'll go out to your home\nAnd then we won't find it and we have to schedule another appointment just because we're not going to back down we're going to find them we take it personal and you know we have to schedule another hour and a half to come out to the house and then we you know the same guy goes out there and you just start understanding of the environment and you start understanding certain areas certain void certain crevices\nAnd you you eventually find it but it's there can be don't forget you know your spices\nUm they get into spices to I've learned that the hard way uh but they'll get into spices\nWe had some in our house once dried flower arrangement yeah I mean we went through everything turned out to dry flower arrangement in another room\nAnd they were just everywhere we took care of that and well that's a great ... go ahead sir freezing\nStuff it'll it'll kill the yes it'll kill the eggs it'll kill the adults are but mainly what we're trying to do is get to the eggs it's just leaving in into the freezer long enough\nSo I always say you know ten to fourteen days leaving your freezer so you don't have to start throwing out you know wasteful food that they're not even in this food but you know heck I'm frustrated I'm just going to throw everything out and go to the store again\nWell now you're bringing in a new food and they are going to get into that food\nSo I Would say you know it and don't forget\nA pasta noodles I'm so things like that they get into grains or they'll get into anything that you know is grain they'll get into so that's where it's just utilize your freezer and then again maybe try to do away with those pheromones traps for a little bit or just go down to one pheromone trap\nOr get Tom and Lula who called earlier had some he shot him with a with a rifle\nSo you got to be pretty good shot for that do Chris thanks for the call sorry for your troubles for all for eight seven two zeroes seven fifty is number don't forget this hour\nAre within the Next Fifty minutes or give away a pair of tickets to

L. O. alive in concert friday Joe Hi fifth at State Farm arena tickets go on sale Monday at ten am had lived nation dot com but we're going to get away a couple of tickets today\nAnd don't forget the Atlanta Journal constitution Sunday Edition what's in there Matt right or that we liked so much three hundred and twenty three dollars and coupons over three hundred and twenty three dollars and coupons\nPlus news all the up to date the latest on the governor's race crossword puzzles cartoons something for everyone in your family is in the Atlanta Journal constitution\nI dare you to refute that for all for eight Seventy zeroes seven fifty is the number it's ten forty four on your Saturday morning let's talk with Lee was in the long ago Lee I'm guessing would be a woman\n... hey I'm a winter [laughter] go ahead lay\nWas winning your advice on how to get rid of squirrels and and any static area\nSo number one is you know when the temperatures change like this they're going to come inside because the canopy the leaves on the trees are dropping it's getting cold or we had rain the last two days so that's why they say the heck with this we're going to go find a warm dry place and that usually are addicts basis\nSo what you don't want to do is just you know higher company or D. I. Wyatt and seal up your entire roof line because you're going to trap the squirrel inside\nA sometimes the good part about gray squirrels is most of the time during the day they're outside but a day like today they might not be outside because it's cool it's it may be a little ah rainy where you're at so those type days they store food they don't have to go outside\nSo what we advise is ... ... we find their their entry point and it's pretty easy to find 'cause you're gonna see chew marks and we put up what's called a one way\nWhich allows it's kind of like a one way dog door it allows a squirrel to humanely leave but yet the door closes and they can't get back in now it may try to to a new way back in but that's why you have the bright Orange County and we fixed that we cover it and you're not up charge\nBut then you've got to seal the route flying the construction gap is the biggest entry point for squirrels so were your roof pecking meets your face you\nIf you have gutters your gutters are attached to your face you if you lift up those shingles that are going into your gutters you're going to see a gap anywhere from one inch to four inches builders really don't\nCare about that gap because they know the shingles are going to overlap it okay so that's the gap that we seal and then you have to you know look at your ... and those are the areas that we see all too\nBut you we use a really thick metal and that's why we have the warranty that we have because squirrels or dislike rats you put up too thin of metal they're going to see right through it so the drip edge that you get at the big box stores way too thin they go right through it we use a very very thick metal and then we seal up the entire or refine\nHere's their warranty Italy not come out and clean out your house or erratic then they'll fill it and then if you get more in your attic they'll come out and do the same thing again for\nYou get more in your addict you know come out and do the same thing again for nothing correct\nIt's under under your warranted and it doesn't matter if they choose a new entry point because we're about to get into a gray squirrel breeding season once we get into December we're still a little early for it\nBut if she's got young up there and we put up that one way door she will chew a new way to get back to her young and sometimes we can hand remove her young and sometimes we just can't physically get to them\nAnd so that that's a that's an issue sometimes a but really stealing up that route flying at your corners outside corners inside corners ... just don't understand the importance of how to what we call rapid corner and that's really what separates us as understanding how to wrap\nSquirrels always look for inside and outside corners I Can't explain it but they always look for inside and outside corners you know by looking at him leave but he's quite a rapper\n[laughter]\nSo is all your work done on the X carrier or is it done on the inside an addict or about both\nBut the vast majority is on the outside the only time when we come inside we're going to clean up the um he go Dave the critter waste critter proof\nAnd so we'll clean that up all disinfect it will use a ... a vacuum cleaner so we're not spreading particles throughout your addict with your furnace up there so we clean all that up get rid of all their nesting material all their acorns in shells because that's going to attract other insects we clean all that up and then they the vast majority of the work to seal your roof line it's outside work\n[noise] so you're heading metal you talked about is that heavier than it is it a solid cases the heavier than outdoor screen or chicken coop flyer\nYes it is a solid piece of metal that has been on it I Can't tell you the angle ban 'cause I just don't know is really no I just don't know the angle ban a but it's about a six to eight inch piece of metal okay and it has been done it so part of it goes on your roof deck and part of it either goes to your ... or goes into your gutter\nAnd when I say that the only metal out there that sticker that we've seen is Tony races and they use incredible metal in the room yes Finley riffing on on the um on the what we call on the construction gap\nBut not knocking Tony 'cause we've had discussions off air about this doctor Tony a good bit is just wrapping up the corners that's just roofers have to put that drip it covered that drew a construction gap right now\nBut they don't specify how thick the metal has to be let's be truthful your day what how do you think they metal obviously the dinner the metal the cheaper the price so I mean that's that's just the cold hard truth and that's why you know I'm you know we come behind roofers\nIn wool either go over there metal will rip it off put up her own metal or we'll just tighten up the corners there you go ... not only are represented a heavy metal\n[laughter] All right thank you thank\nYou for all
