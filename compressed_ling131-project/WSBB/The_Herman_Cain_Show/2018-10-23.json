we're going to share information we know we're going to win right we pick certain numbers\nAnd we'd get up there and we take out all the numbers that aren't those numbers and then we just put those

I'll tell you this I don't I'm not I'm not excited by either of these candidates I think they're both boring and neither one of them has said one single interesting thing about what they're going to do of the future of this state\nAnd and I don't care what race people are that's not history to me this is America My assumption is if America doesn't blow itself up or\nSome see news if America doesn't blow itself up\nOr cannibalizing itself and sticks around for the next hundred years we're going to have every kind of skin color this for that and the other thing and gender because that's the way it is we're going to have more black presidents we're gonna have female presidents were going to have\nEvery kind of governor as a matter of fact if America is around long enough\nIt will come full circle and we will have I guarantee you a Native American president because it's America I expect that from America it does not impressed me in the middle east\nThat somebody who's going to be the next governor has vis skin color or that skin color outside of that possibility I haven't heard either of these candidates say one\nSingle interesting new innovative thing about what the future of George is about because neither of them at this point is this about the future of Georgia it's about winning this election\nBrian Kemp was all about guns in the primary I hadn't seen one\nThat that stopped being important or did you do research behind the scenes that you spend a bunch of money and find out that white suburban women don't like it or something like that\nShe truly is a progressive and knocked some of her primary competitors for not being as progressive and all of a sudden she's for tax cuts I'm supposed to believe that\nNeither of these candidates have said one single interesting thing about the future of Georgia because neither of them care about that not right now\nThey're both spending money to people who don't live in a state to poll people have asked them what they want to hear and then these to show up and read courage to take that right back at him well you want to hear okay I'll just vomit it back at you there's nothing interesting about that\nAnd this

charts I think there was just one chart I'm like the top tend to be the Beatles Frank Sinatra fifth dimension\nAll kinds of different types of music would be one short and didn't you say that they they they count differently now than they used to back to the same thing\nBack then there were um airplay right airplay and radio ads that I Believe Radiohead more control\nOver it at a time and now it's all strictly based on sales\nAnd and and with Drake it'd be download you to view YouTube loads yes dreaming streaming yeah\nYeah but but here's the thing though I I think Drake has the unique ability to cross over to so many different genres\nCause you'll beetles were the crossover activity they were but you're a heavy metal yeah my mom couldn't stand yesterday they weren't ready you\nKnow it's hard to believe but there are more and shot or isn't now and there were when you are so hard\nHard for me to believe that's what I'm Wondering about is is the is it easier to do it now

just push it purchased the album once\nRight but no and the very beginning it was airplay on radio and and what have you ads you know what that means you probably don't you're in radio now but they haven't been for snow and dad is a when you actually start playing so I as a nation so how many more stations would start\nPlaying a song radio controlled and Jared or you would get the record of ...

K. thing that he took himself to dinner in front of her with her consent\nValue so you're saying oh there's no Sarah Silverman and a boy C K have known each other since way back right but they came up to go to comedy so like when they were doing it that will do an open Mike nice to get that together that's how long they known each other so he had to\nBasically they've known each other for so long like you said that he was doing that back then with her as piers contemporaries so no power play involved\nRight so he was doing that Louis the casing yet and she would give the consent which I still find strange now I get her point her point was there was no power situation we were just friends and it was a weird thing that he liked to do and so she says has happened like ten times\nHer sisters that it happened I think twenty I Can't relate to this during a along a road trip she doesn't have a long road trip I can not\nRelate to this at all I could I Can't even imagine asking somebody this not only that I wasn't you know in a real full on relationship was\nNot even a younger Erich von Phoenix wow you didn't reach a couple of times\nErich von Phoenix did what did you just say [laughter] good name for the la Phoenix is a bird yeah even the great Erich von Phoenix would not do such a thing I find this to be so strange you guys do this a lot of my out of the ...\nYou guys do this a lot of my out of the loop on this I don't really know if they do they don't talk about [laughter]\nI wouldn't say guys do this a lot I think that there are some guys who do this and that's the point\nI'd I'd be so embarrassed yeah I I just I Would just be ... I Would feel I Would weird myself out to the point that I that would be impossible to watch me pick my nose yeah [laughter]\nJim Andrews what up just say I don't think you'd be as a barrel but I'm not saying that you've done this or a I make I urge you and your life\nWhere I could see some consent knows about consent do you think Sarah Silverman may have been flattered by it you know I think that's why we're friend and she would she said like yeah I Want to see that sometimes and then other times you know that's gross get out of here what's strange sort of quirk\nMhm to have\nThat some you know when I first of all there isn't that a little loans thing I think I Want to watch me pick my nose it was invented as a I'm Alone thing and I think that's where it belongs quite frankly [laughter] it's just weird if if if\nYou're not doing the real adult thing when you're together in someone's just it's just odd to me and I'm tired of talking around it 'cause I'm On a family\nShould kind of like a really quick she made a good point she said can you love someone who did bad things can you still love them and I totally understand that there's people in your family that have done bad things there's people in your life that have done bad things are things that you don't like about some and but you can if you do feel like they may change or do feel remorse you can love them still\nYou know washing your only write the most give me her question again can you ... what is it can you love someone you can you love someone who did bad thing well the answer is right there Eva brown proves [laughter]\nAnswer is yes [laughter] he only did it all the time I went to a monologue trip [laughter] that's right All right let's story I have another dirty stories that are a a good mix it up so someone who's not dirty they're All right now to think that uh\nThis is some kind of dirty show that you can't listen to the whole family\nOkay I Am an actress on both human Rhapsody is responding to some backlash over straight washing uh in the new Freddy Mercury bio pay\nThose are the kind of New England was because of genes I have started washed you say you never know what's really going on in there and have that\nAs I Know [laughter] really heterosexual help out to dry cleaning or more under my ... like ... [laughter] so this is we were talking about this the other day that uh it was such a bearing down on ... ... for some reason his name\nI mess it up Sasha Baron Cohen a was supposedly\nSided mercury and he pulled out because he he was saying that it was sanitized that they weren't really getting into any of the darkness surrounding Freddy Mercury and now this is another one saying\nUh first of all I don't know if anybody's seen this movie this is based off a trailer and then the trailer he's a teasing and flirting with with a woman but in real life he was engaged to be married right he was he was gay but he was bisexual\nSo uh this is all based off of a trailer which is a minute or two of the movie so we don't know how much it was actually straight washed also my understanding is it's from\nThe point of them are merging and a queen right becoming popular to the live a show in Nineteen eighty five\nSo you know they can choose to show whatever the but this is the problem I don't know if it's straight washed or is it sanitized here's the problem I just find it weird to watch actors play people but I actually saw in real life\nIt's just weird to me because you know that a lot of these things didn't really happen and if these things didn't really happen then what do we do want to hear\nThat I I brought it up before there's a scene on on the commercial I'd better your wife is six minutes is an attorney do you do you ever say that\nWell they did the buddy Holly movie where a UC got the Oscar nominated at least the doors\nWhat buddy I didn't see buddy Holly in real life in my age buddy Holly died in the fifties I was born in the sixties so my point is it's weird for me what to see an actor play someone that I saw in real time\nAnd he went to school with buddy Holly's me it was the big bopper [laughter] oh that's a guy did lose low area [laughter] every morning it was a great way to go to school\nAll right so you know I think the director mentioned about the dark nests in the movie that you said that it might be like that Sasha Cohen said that it was lacking 'em and they said that ah it's more of a celebration and in the road to him so they weren't really looking for\nAnd the thing to remember is that the members of cleaner behind this so that they're not going to put out something that looks he was a human being like the rest of us and he had a good side maybe a dark side of the I'm sure they'll get into the drug use and and all that Elton John said he was the only person who gets\nThe drug use and and all that Elton John said he was the only person who could take more drugs that him and still be awake [laughter] so I mean I took a lot of drugs but then again and that kind of boring like All right that's I spent forty five minutes on this I mean everything you know so everything about rock stars goes there\nSo they made a fun movie it'll just be a fun movie go here a bunch of great songs by queen and maybe get an idea of\nHow is it going to be cleaned other is he looked sinking goes you know buddy Holly lip sync up are good because the buddy Holly story Gary abuse he did a great job by the way young kids the suspect of ordinary abuse was insane [laughter] and he was like a parade or the head injury you know he was a great great actor a buddy Holly story he\nSang and he played and it worked\nAnd because of that after that some of these other ones you had people playing and singing when they shouldn't have been but\nLike walking Phoenix singing Johnny Cash or\n... that was the last movie you know I Love Johnny Cash do you do that with Johnny Cash died\nI cried for a week my street but found myself in places about seven straight days but for seven days I found myself in moments like on the fourth or fifth day after he died my wife walked by my office in the house and she's like alright get over it and you know you've never met the dude so that's how much Johnny Cash meant to me um\nAnd I thought that movie was awful Joaquin Phoenix did not capture anything about Johnny Cash he wasn't a dumb hillbilly right who somehow stumbled into fame which is the way that he comes off as a just a year and then moving so uh yeah I didn't like that\nAnd I just it's difficult for me to watch said it before you get an actor playing Lincoln I'm On the line when Lincoln was alive so it's easy for me but whenever I see these things that are contemporary\nThen I just think well does that actually happened 'cause I Know how storytelling is do you take four stories and six character isn't it collapsed them into two characters in one scene right and that's how storytelling has done otherwise the movie the eight hours long and ...\nSo I guess all that matters is\nIs it fun to watch but it doesn't have to be accurate is probably not\nGoing to do that in that he really did say that just because the the band members are behind the movie okay well let's find out which\nIs why we want to see the guy who gave him his sickness that's we wanted to [laughter]\nAnd needs to be real I think the actor should the the actors\nPlaying him after he should die at the end of the really really real agent is really high
