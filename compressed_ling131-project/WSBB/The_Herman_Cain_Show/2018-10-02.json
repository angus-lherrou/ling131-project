because you live in a state that looks like a pan\nYeah where do you live in that ah especially handle you live in this bachelor you know\nI hear your story All right this is what I was worried about we're all we're all in such a good mood we're going to have a crappy radio show takes\nThree movie passes the bacteria and rolling some former subscribers into the unlimited plan\nA so MoviePass upsets set this up you had the problems they almost went under five ... hold on I don't even know if everybody knows what MoviePass MoviePass was a subscription service where you pay ten dollars a month and when it first came out you could see one movie a day unlimited unlimited yes yeah every day you can go see one ...\nThen what happened was and we talked about this you remember the two of us I predict what would happen one of the big companies like regal cinema AMC AMC just started their own version and then immediately there was trouble with MoviePass and by then they've been they've been on life support\nFor I don't know acknowledge the trouble the trouble was while you pay ten dollars in a movie where I live in New York is Seventeen dollars to sing one movie a month already costs more than what I paid you for the month okay I'll go see three\nThe idea was never going to collect data and give the cell that back to the movie companies who's buying two already had already they already know who this is the process the data they're going to have tech Tuesday\nThey already know who this is the process the data they're going to save tech\nTuesday let me uh give some advice here okay here's here's the thing with it's great to be an innovator it's great to have these ideas but you're they're teaching the attack one on one I Know as the panhandle university but here's the thing is that if your idea is just something that if it works some bigger company can just do it\nJust duplicate it it's it's not gonna last long so you end up being MoviePass uh was proof of concept\nThat this can work and as soon as AMC saw it happening they went oh well we can do that\nAnd they created a movie club right so and AMC you can see a lot of the movies that are out there so um that's the that's the tax lesson here you know Greg I often like to advise angel investors and I they asked me all the time Eric what should I put a million or a\nBillion dollars and and I say nothing that can be co opted once it proves to be a good idea and that's where MoviePass was MoviePass made the mistake of not selling themselves the something bigger when they could\nAnd uh and now this is a scam because people let me tell the story and also let me I'll do your job prayer\nI Would also like to say that my own line professor is very impressed by you right now only like you to be a guest lecturer\nAt the panhandle State University yes okay spatula Haim in women are okay so so what happened [laughter] I'm doing it for my basement [laughter]\nWhat happened with MoviePass everything we lead up to that uh then they change their plan you can see three movies a month and they limit the number of movies that you could see he was already\nPaid your subscription so it was the same price\nI was there was monthly yearly or so they changed the plan you had to opt into that new plan if you didn't opt into that plan they stopped charging you but now that people who didn't opt into that plan there are ... enrolling\nThey send an email out that says basically because they've got your credit card information even though you let the subscription lapse\nThey're basically saying hey we're now in rolling you in this new plan which any old plant and you ... you have to opt out in order for us not to charge you this is criminal activity I Believe from what I Know of this of this story\nThis is criminal activity you've you've had people they give you in good faith and credit card number for your service and then they don't ... up\nAnd you still have the number and you send out an email that says hey we've already up to you have to opt out in order for us not to charge a credit card I Believe this is criminal this will be the last act\nOf MoviePass to see what I did the last\nAct that really would have been better if it was plays but I mean it's pretty close you got to give me some credit it's like a gym it's hard to get out of gym memberships they charging you have to go there with a no drop it on their mind my aunt\nCan't tell you my wife cannot stand the month of January and February because my wife goes to the gym five six times a week every week and what happens is and there's a lot of things in the ... come in they come in 'cause their New Year's resolution is to you know lose some weight\nAnd then er you know what you know what the New Year's resolution should be to be a unique and have creative ideas that are different than everyone else does\nThat's what their threats ... mine every day they don't go to the gym well that's so my wife can't find a place to work out for two months because it's full of people who don't continue on and on their ... and they don't know the protocol they leave the sweat on the ...\nIt is the same subscription idea that's why they they know that January or they can really get people in the gym so they get you to sign up for a year knowing that maybe Seventy five percent of the people who sign up are going to\nBe regulars per month and a half and then they get to keep the rest of us who subscribe to a gym take a walk [laughter]\nOr another sidewalks in my subdivision oh I'm Sorry about\nThat I think about every kind of any time I go to a gym I just got on the treadmill and I think I could be doing this on the street\nYeah you could be walking down the street however you're less likely to be shot\nDepends on what she's read at your walking around here I Am the only way to go to the gym fair shot I'm afraid of people yeah so this is why I go to the rain to um yeah how 'bout that will be on a gym\nYeah I I met a ...

already ... and then what is it like that [laughter]\n\nWe're all on the side and everything and I'm pulled over in my van and I heard that beginning with a D minor Chopin Andy miner or substantially I only I get I think it has the minor\nOn on his ego yes autumn on her in her spare time has deconstructed every Barry Manilow side so happy that you're going to be so to start crying I just said this who is this person really yes it's an angel ... besides the My Lai how I felt he was spending time in New England\nEven now I remember all of that\nI don't know Tim managers this summer so you've got

it the intermittent part of the fat in the desert out all these are the fasting part is what works you know I\nDecided no yeah okay so most cancers I think I Know the Senate okay most cancers though do you have to free radicals right correct and you get mutations ... very good and so uh your your your body working memory eight stuff mhm so the more you eat\nThe more work your body does there for more of a chance that a mutation could happen yes so I don't know about intermittent fasting but I Do know and I'm way past this this can't happen with me\nBut if you the best way to avoid cancer and tell me if I'm wrong here okay my idea is the best way to avoid cancer is that you would only eat every day\nWhat you need to survive that there you go because your body does the least amount of work which means the less it does the less chance you have a mutation\n... number one consumer of energy we have a human's is romance will keep it clean ha ha ha okay\nWe'll get out of your you know what he may even knows he'll play but this is my first Barry Manilow cog okay go ahead\nNumber to consumers energy is digestion yes as far as using up energy and what happened is what we're finding now with cancer it's we we the research is showing its metabolic issue mhm the cells the ... metabolism to sell changes the DNA alters and you start producing\nAbnormal cells mhm and then the cells can grow and grow and grow and your immune system doesn't recognize that and why the immune system it\nBut my my idea of your body doing less means less of a chance for not happen and and now I'm not saying that you should try to be anorexic or any snow right you need ... whatever it is\nFor sustenance yes to actually not be with you know ...\nSkinny skinny to be the the the ideal weight yes for
