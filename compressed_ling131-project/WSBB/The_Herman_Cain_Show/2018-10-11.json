CNN can stop down\nTo tell you what the actual definition of the word mob is I can take a moment to explain the new ones to believe this is a zero Raz commercial\nAlready got a story yeah the American Music Awards set a new record low in t._v. reading this by Taylor slipped out\nOn America didn't drop everything and tune in as we celebrated Taylor Swift for the three thousand seven hundred and

business\nSo not on a long look this is it is it is kind of song\nWorkout [laughter] not real\nFit in one night and say they\nSome\n\nThe reason the pushback figuring you can understand it from the Democrat Party because I think they think that might be a winning line and they need to push back on it the revealing part if you if you can still be surprised by this\nIs wow isn't it interesting that the same concerns that all the anchors have over at CNN is exactly the biggest concern we've heard from the Democrats\nIn the last few days the andme a word where does this fall out of the sky from three weeks ago with anybody in America think using the term mob was somehow a negative\nNow here we are was today the eleventh yeah that's correct of October ... do you want to have your voice lady on October eleventh twenty eight team is pretty apparent that if you use the word mob\nYou're probably a fascist a racist a massage gymnast and all the other is that matter\nYet three weeks ago nobody thought of it you get a push that comes from one party and also most of the media\nEither it's so obvious and they're all absolutely right and on top of it we need to be lectured to about what it really means but like I said before\nI don't remember people stopping down with lectures about a presumption of innocence until proven guilty\nBut interesting that the CNN people have to stop their shows every time someone uses the term mob\nExcuse me I'm word the N. word I Know it's really I mean he's saying it [laughter] what mob Baldwin is still fun [laughter]\n[laughter] I mean\nIt's a shocking every time he says it's shocking to me that ... and then the rest of them can't be more subtle than this\n[laughter]\nIt's shocking to me that they're not better at this\nGive it a few days changed the words don't just ripping read from the Democratic National Committee and just go on with it\n\nIs very important that people are fair to liberals and Democrats in the words they use it how they explain things but as I just said before accusing a man of gang rape without one shred of evidence no problem\nNo problem\nEditorializing isn't always a rant like the one I'm doing now sometimes it's just the angle on this story quite often it's the stories that you don't see boy that footage\nOf what I Would describe as an angry mob stopping commuters in Portland and harassing them for being white isn't showing up in a lot of places\nCNN has twenty four hours now I don't watch them all day long\nI watch very little of any of the twenty four hour networks like watch them when I'm here at work I haven't seen one round table panel\nOn what ... what's going on in Portland the fact that apparently\nI haven't been there but apparently people have been to San Francisco are talking about how there's human feces all over the place\nBlessing that'd be a story to cover\nWhy would it be a story news is something different San Francisco was not always a place where do you see human feces all over the place so that would count as news\nOr maybe if they had more public restrooms there wouldn't be so much feces I Can't I Can't\nDebate it until you put the story up there and as long as you're not telling the story\nPeople that are creating apps so you know where to not go ... in San Francisco yeah but but no young enterprising reporter at CNN\nIs interested in that but if you say the word mob if you use that term\nAbout activist on the left\nAt CNN stands up right this is the red line no one shall pass\nLook let's get this straight this is important that's odd use of words are important just like they are on college campuses over in the social sciences department\nIs there anything that influences CNN Washington Post all the rest any more than the social science departments\nAny more than the social science departments on our college campuses ask yourself that question I as a real question for me I'm beginning to wonder if there was any saying more influential\nAt CNN if I'm a host I Need to know what are the parameters of dialogue of debate\nWhere do they get that from well\nIt's just so happens\nEverything they adhere to is exactly the parameters that come out of the social sciences\nOn campus that's interesting that's either influence\nIt's a hell of a coincidence\nAnd by the way why did Don Lemon shaved his head what's that all about I don't know yet life that's not true I don't know that's fake new [laughter] it's not like you had a lot of hair [laughter] what he meant to say what I heard yeah right the nine percent that are going to get to look at the world\nWe live in now it's uh it's okay to accuse a man of gang rape without a shred of evidence but you cannot allege that CNN anchor one satellites you cannot be [laughter] that is wrong I Want to stop it right here I Apologize Don Lemon you should my friend what's the deal is Don Lemon ... is he\n'cause at CNN seems to me that they try to pretend that they're still\nNeutral host to some kind of ... and if you're listening to the uh what are you not even though I'm just saying they tried to pretend I thought that was the deal over there they they don't have Sean Hannity or Rachel Maddow ... it's not the ideal for CNN I think\nThat there's a reason why he's on later at night and that's because that's what I Want to know\nHas it been just is it ... it is has has\nThat horse left the barn Don Lemon is an advocate who has his own show on\nCNN pundit you can't hold on\nWe'll but he's the host usually the host Neil ... is the host and he has pundits on sure Sean Hannity\nDoesn't hide the fact that he's an advocate for the issues that he believes in and he has his own show he's the host of his own show that is a mission oriented show and the mission of the show is to try to get more people to to uh to vote Republican\nBut that's not hidden everybody knows it Sean Hannity says that's what it's all about I'm an advocate I'd never heard him I\nDid I miss something is Don Lemon now saying no I'm like a Rachel Maddow I'm a because that's the way every clip I get from his show\nIt isn't him being an anchor with other people giving opinions he's one of the panel he happens to be the anchor but he's one of the talking heads that actually gives his opinions all the time so was that\nI think he's steering that direction for sure maybe when he first started the show he was trying to be an anchor like what you're saying but but then it was just too much right so he allowed we actually and they all just like he has a mission to do with the show and that's a to be on late night I'm Wondering\nCNN can we get somebody and he just kind of state and from seeing that I'm not I'm not judging it I just\nDon't know where am I supposed to believe because I feel like this would seem that it's trying to get across our anchors are neutral but this presidency is so out of control that even to report on it in a neutral fashion\nThere are certain things that just has to be said as a matter of conscience is that the way they're playing this because Sean Hannity doesn't pretend that he's not an advocate\nRachel Maddow out I Am what I Am Erica it's right\nRachel Maddow out is not pretend that she's not an advocate for her side that's\nMy weird thing with CNN they want us to believe that the oh you're just getting the straight stuff from these people but hey you know this president's so out of control that every once in awhile human beings just need to stand up and speak because\nIf people start using the word mob for just any gathering of people well who knows what's next but accusing a man of gang rape without a shred of evidence that doesn't bother us at all [laughter] doesn't sound like there's any editorial leaner slant there whatsoever to me were you able to find anything\nWhile I'm looking at his career he said and I'm not about him I Want\nTo do some see an end what do they think what do they think are they now competing with Fox and MSNBC 'cause I think they lose the both the right now they are yes so have they made the decision hey look anchors let's see what you were let's hear your point of view you get out there and you advocate for the things that you believe in I just wanted to be up front\nBecause I Know with Rachel Maddow now I Know what she's doing and she admits to it and I know with Sean Hannity I Know what he's doing and he admits to it CNN tries to have it both ways here's the mayor\nCNN's mission statement at CNN our goal is to deliver accurate information too\nAt CNN our goal was to deliver accurate information to our viewers would speed so that they are well informed at all times okay that's pretty generalized [laughter]\n\nI just I just was I don't mind that I disagree with Don Lemon but he needs to step forward and say I'm an advocate now and stop hiding behind\nExcellent that's honesty that pride and workman ship I trust these guys and so can you stop procrastinating
