this is Wes your own money matters how's it going hey well\nLet's talk for a sale athlete when the market got faster than because I think and I'm going to retire at years younger I wouldn't have thought it would\nIf I was younger I wouldn't have thought it was very shortly now I'm Wondering when do I get back in the market here I said well some of the money that I don't want to see it but I don't know when to get back in the market\nAnd then the analysts call in and we never whale transportation world regardless of our current events stock always draw\nDown as scared what about it\nYeah I Know it's one of those weeks a kind of smacks everybody almost kind of smack the upside the head and makes you nervous about investing in general are you when you say you're about to retire like ... where are you in that stage are you a year away or ... where are you in the the phase of\nRetirement\nSo you're five years before you even retire right yeah okay so just this is just a friendly reminder on this and I and I think it helps to talk this through is that when you when you have five years until you retire and then when you're in retirement what's called on another twenty right\nExactly tactically you've got twenty five years and this is a tough thing I think when you're headed to retirement\nYou really think that you've got your time rising gets way shorter but it doesn't necessarily I think psychologically it feels like oh now I I Can't lose today because I'm here I'm I've arrived near retirement but really you've got to say well you know look I've got Twenty years I've got twenty five years\nSo you still have a ... a long way to go which still allows you to recover from these inevitable depths that we go to another scary and the unsettling\nBut a couple of things I mean you can you we have the choice to kind of be in and out of the market and let's say right now you're out but let's say you get back in and it may be the time he was a perfect and maybe it's kind of bad\nAnd then the second option is to be in and out and in that and in and out back and forth and back and forth and that's guaranteed to be bad right we know that that's not that

we're not going to continue to drop stocks will continue to drop one earnings do really well typically\nAnd again we're getting to the mid term election cycles that typically good for socks getting mid term elections out of the way so let next couple of months really November December typically really good for markets\nAnd what I said to him was look I Know that it might be not the perfect time to get back in but I can tell you what I I can almost guarantee is not good is not hopping in and out in and out and then now back and forth\nAnd trying to time this market because that that's almost a a sure fire way to not make money over time\nJust because you're headed into retirement and the next couple of years doesn't mean you're time residents really it's a it's not a three year horizon you still have Twenty years you know have twenty five years I just want to remind all of us that we've got a long time we've got to think about this\nAll of us that we've got a long time we've got to think about this in terms of years not days and weeks\nAs as a reminder find a comfortable allocation again talking Pam should probably help him over and talk more but find a comfortable allocation that you could live with\nYou know this is okay I can live with fifty percent inequities and I'm OK ... really well I kind of could have done better if I had Ninety percent of socks you got to be a live with that side of it\nYou've also got to be to live with the side that if things don't go well\nThat you're fifty percent inequities is down ten percent\nKnowing that the other fifty percent of the portfolio something that's remain really steady other thing is funny to me this week is that all of this about you know all this carnage and bonds bonds this is the first week ever where stocks have gone down but ... didn't go up at the same time\nBonds aren't working bonds I'm working that's nonsense\nThat is absolute nonsense bond war bonds worked really well this week\nIf you owned relatively short term treasury bonds or short relatively short term bonds they didn't go down this week they may have gone down a quarter of a percent and there's a lot of bonds that went up a little bit this week so flat\nOn one half of my portfolio if I'm Pam and I choose half in stocks and the other half in bonds if I have a week we're stocks go down three to five percent but my bond stayed flat and steady\nThat's working that's good that they don't always have to be perfectly counter cyclical we're going to give their beards and we're not working doesn't mean that they didn't go up by five percent to completely counteract stock the stock laws flat\nIs okay that's exactly why we owned these things I'd like them to go up like ... to make money in a week and ... but for them to remain relatively steady I'm okay with that it doesn't mean they're not working [noise]\nWe've got to go to the phones here my goodness I got a lot of great cause I Wish we had more time this morning or let's go to start with Leon in Logan ville Leon what's going on how can I help my friend [noise]\nAre you more on how you doing today I'm good thanks for the call how can I help\nMy four one K. is changing I guess you'd say companies are going from one one for what for okay for a company to do another yeah\nAnd they're they're wanting me to if I stay and manage firms that it's going to go into a target fun but I'm not sure if I really want to go into ... the the the the the farms I'm and our door really well so I just didn't know the difference between the two\nWhere is just give me a ... a bigger picture prospectively on how many years how old are you\nI'm fifty two ...\nYou have a way it was so long time before you're thinking about retirement could be ten Fifteen Years correct\nUh yeah I guess you could say\nWhen the and this happens all the time ready even foreign K plan and you have no say so and that's usually and the company you're your company changes out providers and says okay we're going to get rid of these people and you get a new four one K. planning when that happens you typically get what's called mapped\nTo securities that are similar to what you had\nHave you had a hundred percent and equity funds us in the international you'd end you'll end up with new funds typically that are us and international now sometimes it ... I've seen these plans where they're trying to get more people into these target date funds\nJust kind of almost for liability perspective they want you to have some balance and they're going to automatically map you into a a target fund\nBut ... and and that's not necessarily a bad thing Leon so yes I actually like the a lot of these target phones the only problem I see with target date funds is that they are very can be very heavy heavy in international the view of a target date fund that says Leon not retiring until the you're twenty thirty\nAnd you know twelve years from now it might be Seventy five percent of stocks and then of that you can have thirty percent in the international\nThat that can be really really tough so the if you look at it a lot of these target date funds over the last few years the reason they haven't done very well and this is not all target date funds are the ones that are really heavy in international markets\nUs has done ... arguably very well international markets have done terribly\nAnd it is and when you're twenty thirty forty percent of their national that can be a real killer in these target date fund so just be careful make sure when you look at the target date fund it you'll get a break down and they'll say I've got forty five percent of us stocks and twenty and international and the rest in bonds\nIt's it's not not all not all target date funds are created equal you got to understand what the makeup is it's going to be an automatic allocation between us large mid small international different kinds of bonds and that's a good thing that that's automatically giving you some asset allocation it automatically get ...\nAt that automatically giving you some asset allocation it automatically get slightly more conservative over time\nSo it migrate to become more conservative too so that when you're sixty five and you retire it's probably half in bonds and stable value which again that that's that's a good progression and that's why these companies want employees to be an easy because it kind of forces you to be diversified ... good thing I think over time for the majority of folks\nSo so it's not a bad you're going to get mapped into a ... a a a target date fund which is okay\nAnd as long as it's not overly heavy in international I think I'm fine with that option be would be you go back in and relocate of course all your options and say look I don't necessarily want this target date fund I Want to choose four to five different phones\nI build my own allocations for you Leon and that's what you stick with so just because they're mapping you in putting you in a fund in the beginning doesn't mean that you don't reserve the right\nTo change it on your own\nLeon from Logan bill my friend thank you for the call for over eight seven six zero seven fifty the number of the studio where do we continue to go Ryan I'm just taking direction from Ryan we're headed to Ken in Decatur hate Ken welcome to money matters what's going on how can I help\nOr the morning mist of all I'm In my retirement years I've become something or like yourself or your recommendation of income investor fear much willing to look at all areas like ... cheese cheese topping stocks [noise] all those good things\nAnd one of those hunting grounds that I've grounded are closed and mutual funds\nI liked that hunting grounds their income we're hunting for income can indicator is on a hunt and search for income cool I like that\nOkay and those closed unfolds at the moment ah I've been looking at um floating usual phones now I Would have thought that it I rising interest rate is far that that would be amenable to those sort of ... uh\nBut when I look at them I noticed that many of them are closer to their fifty two week low button or a disconcerting is that many of them they're distributions are dropping which is ... of what I Would have to pay that and I wondered if you had a fall on that\nYeah so if you look at some of these closed in funds that are so Jay a J.
