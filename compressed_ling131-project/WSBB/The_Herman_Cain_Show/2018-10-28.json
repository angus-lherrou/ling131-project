middle ground when you have a six hundred point drop in a day\nAnd it leads me to kind of think through what is that middle ground what is just kind of reality what do you need to work through when we

seven fifty\nSo to the phones here let's go to the phones\nJim Jim who joins us from Indian land South Carolina Jim what's going on how can I help\nYeah so I'm about to retire\nAt the end of this year and four one K. and some expected income from Social Security and\nA former employee I'm considering moving a some funds and find the four one K. over into a a median income inequality and of course even to the rash in a a moderate typically concert market I wanted to get some feedback is whether that\nIs a good strategy for consistent income a touring Gish er ups and downs of the market and I'm going into retirement\nSure so how much we do and immediate annuities just for folks listening you've got your your decided to take a portion of money it pretty much just turn it over so that that's obviously the the downside of this is you're given up some liquidity but you're in return you're getting a payout typically for life right\nNow so it's all hands on the numbers the number one the first my first rule of thumb is you want to ... never do any more than twenty percent of your assets in one of these immediate annuities because you don't want to give up sure you can get a pay pay out\nAnd it might even be attractive habit you can never get to that money yeah do you it's only for a pretty limited amount of our percentage of your overall investment assets I'd say no more than twenty percent first rule of thumb secondarily what are the numbers jam or maybe if you put a hundred thousand and this would give you for life or how much you thinking about doing\n[noise] um I was thinking or somewhere in the neighborhood of ... percent um which way she would give a somewhere in the neighborhood of about a two hundred I'm Sorry two thousand or more per month for a lot\nOkay but how much life for ... yes it was that two hundred thousand you'd have to put it in or how much he putting in\nA yeah I Know that would be about three hundred thousand okay so and you'd get about two thousand dollars a month okay\nSo to ... said twenty four thousand divided by three hundred thousand it's about an eight percent [noise]\nEight percent pay out it's not a guaranteed rate of return\nBecause it doesn't necessarily count how you can live for five more years you live for thirty more years right\nSo that's part of this question so hang on this is a good question will go through more of these numbers Jim from India my in South Carolina just hang on the line here will be back talking about immediate annuities is a payout worth it or not what are some of the things you should consider when money manager\nI recently had the same one in four hours a week on line every small business owner and the same kinda Kathleen manifest showers and found\nThat with that and I got\nTo have come a name like mine mine are all kinds of restaurants around I\nHigher and that was in Google Search had [laughter] any time even at my\nWith no I don't mean I think I'm during our and when I Need to have their own\nLane twenty four hours a day every\nDay and make your own facts are free at ... dot com and happiness on line\n[noise]\nDo you hear voices those nagging little voices in your head the voice that remind you every day of all the things you need to do\nMaybe you've been skipping your twice yearly maintenance on your friend is an air conditioner not good\nSo you have now just given the annuity company you've left on the table hundred and eighty thousand dollars and that's a that's obviously the downside of these immediate annuities you've got to turn over the money to the new company\nFor the promise of getting paid forever so you've got to live a really long time in order to get at least just to get your money back\nAnd that I think is the tough part about doing one of the news you've gotta so so we've got to live twelve Thirteen Years just to get your money back let alone what interests you could have gotten during that twelve year period of time it today by a ten year treasury bond now for well over three percent a year\nI'd rather give if if you're going to lock money up and do something ultraconservative I'd I'd rather just do a government von ladder that truly has no risk if you were going to hold him maturity then put the hands put the money in the hands of an annuity company\nThen we'll a potentially habits so that your spouse or your heirs don't get a whole lot in return\nThat's obviously if you do the life often there are a lot of other options for these fat so you can do a lifetime income\nOften there are a lot of other options for these fat so you're going to lifetime income uh which is what we were just talking about or a lifetime income with a cash refund lifetime income with a with a guaranteed period of time\nThat the one that I typically see folks doing this is whether you're thinking about getting a pension payout or and meeting new to pay out these are the same kind of decision you have to make do you do a life a out\nDo you do a joint spouse so payouts and it covers your life and your spouse's life or did you uh period certain the very least when you when you look at one of these options I I think you've got to lease look at a period certain\nPeriods certain of at least a Fifteen year period\nA so that you get if you die and you're five you get at least ten more years Fifteen of payments to at least here families say we've kind of get your money back\nUh and and these are kind of these things you have to think about when you do\nWhen you're getting an an immediate duty path I Love multiple streams of income so if you have a pension great you have Social Security great mania do ten percent of your assets in in immediate annuities haven't yet another stream of income but when you start to get to twenty five and thirty percent of your ... liquid net worth\nAnd your turn it over to insurance company that effectively has that money now forever and your family doesn't that that's a calculus it I don't love from a planning perspective rather just rather just spend my money down maybe get a three percent interest yield\nFrom something like treasury bond at least in my the money still stays in my family a ... and ... and the money in that context to last a very very long time so those are some of the things you've got to think about as you\nAre as you consider doing any sort of a new product yeah that is is that these are new to companies are not guarantees they give you a guarantee they say are we guarantee you this but that's a guarantee coming from a company companies\nInsurance companies any sort of company they they don't act there is no perfect guarantee that they're going to stay in business and be able to make\nGood on their promises so the the only true guarantee that backs up everything and the United states is the full faith and credit the United states government which also then goes back to the uh FDIC which insures our bank deposits and our CDs for the most part\nThat to me is the only quote real guarantee out there and even that's a question mark at some point with our national debt that is called ... trillion dollars in climbing so just be careful when you're when you're looking at a quote guarantee from any company because there's rarely in life any real such thing\nGood morning welcome to money matters or what will continue to take your calls and your questions here in a in a super volatile week for socks\nUh we we we we just we had another week were had six hundred point negative day on the Dow Jones industrial average down three percent for the week down almost four percent for the S. and P. five hundred NASDAQ dropped in similar fashion that four percent\nAnd every time we get one of these periods of time where we get a bunch of gains wiped out in the ... you probably read eight eight trillion dollars lost in the last couple of weeks to get people nervous again and and and I and rightly so we get new period of time or nobody likes to see\nReally difficult weeks you look at your portfolio look at your phone can you've lost that arguably thousands of dollars just kind of it it hurts and and I'm going to walk through\nThe difference between knowing that we investing is a mix between what you think will happen in stocks will say I think stocks will go up over time\nVersus what you could really ... well you can tolerate that actually happens meaning that in order to get that writer and I've got to get them through some serious\nPotholes I've got to go over some serious speed bumps in order to get there and in some cases that is ... ... it's maybe not\nIt doesn't work or your portfolio is just too aggressive for what you can tolerate doesn't mean it's too aggressive over time if you add an iron stomach it might be too aggressive for you to handle and you and you can't sleep at night and then investing\nA becomes uncomfortable and it's and it's and it it kind of as a ... it's self defeating and then you ultimately break\nAnd make a bunch of mistakes and and I don't know what you do that so it kind of talk through this concept\nAlso a phone lines open we may have time for one more calls have you have questions about your particular scenario whether it's an immediate annuities or any sort of a new day or a pension or a lump sum versus a pension or a a ... regular Iraq\nWe're here in the studio until ten o'clock so that I give us a call in the studio the number for oh four\nOr eight seven to zero seven fifty for ah for eight seven to zero seven fifty if you're in Georgia or one eight hundred outside of Georgia one eight hundred WSBIU talk us one eight hundred nine seven to eight to five\nSo again let's talk about how much how much risk is too much risk\nYou know this is a nervous months for a lot of ...\nSo you know this is a nervous months for a lot of folks not everybody reacts the same to the cells not everybody ... react the same to bad news which makes investing again this mix between what you think is going to happen versus what you can tolerate\nThat actually happens for example you and I both know overtime\nThe best place has been at least over this is over a hundred plus years\nBest places but for your money between stocks and bonds and cash is is that what he's US stock market overtime by far and ten percent rate of return versus five for bonds versus two for cash\nYet in the last you have an iron stomach you likely a ... you you likely have some sort of mix of all of these areas and not just stuck because if we know it can get so alone\nYou don't you don't have a mix or does asset allocation we did a show on a couple of weeks ago you don't have a mix to maximize your returns you do so to dampen just down nasty these corrections get this ... at least the stock corrections get\nSo ... so you you may know that you should be eighty percent of the stocks and this is again I have a lot of conversations the last couple of weeks of folks that families that I work with that and they may have fifty percent in stocks or fifty five percent and socks and even even we go through the period of time like this that even gets a little bit uncomfortable for them\nSo you you may know that over time\nYou should be eighty percent ... percent stocks but if you go through a week like this or a month like this and among like a ... this month of October and you just can't sleep well at night then it's okay to to get nervous in fact it's in fact it's important to do a real gut check\nOn what your investment balance really needs to be or should be\nMaybe sixty percent in stocks is too much for you\nIf you have you gone through three weeks and you can't even sleep and you you feel nervous everyday you turn the TV and the market's down and it freaks you out then yeah you probably have too much exposure stocks doesn't mean that over time ... that's still not the best thing to do\nBut you've got to do with the context of what you can handle because of it is investing is far beyond just the math it's far beyond just in the science of investing it's the it's the side of the deals with emotion how much you can really handle\nMaybe fifty percent of sex is too much for you maybe forty percent is\nA better place for you to live and I think these these periods of time when we go through these got checks for markets I still don't want people to run for the hills panic sell everything 'cause that's what we know that's a losing game to sell everything they're trying to get back into soccer then sell everything back\nBut it may be a time for you to readjust the good news on readjusting today versus a year or two ago is that the safe side of the equation we just talked to a treasury bonds that are now paying over three percent\n... even junior bonds are paying close to three percent so even short term ultra safe investments are actually paying you something now where is a year ago and five years ago they're paying virtually zero\nSo so today actually have some options if you want to get a little bit more conservative I still don't want you run for the hills but it may be a time to do a little bit of a gut check\nAnd reevaluate what your overall allocation is it's okay to do so\nYou are listening to money matters good morning when they find me the money matters team go to ...
