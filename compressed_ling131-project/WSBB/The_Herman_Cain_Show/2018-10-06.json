me\n[noise] what we're talking at the break you know I think that for the average um real estate agent you know they really are and they're commission once we go under contract so um the the inspection period um where the buyer has an opportunity to inspect the home and come back and request repairs\nIs generally way more stressful so you know leveraging a realtor to make sure you get the best possible deal during this inspection period\nDon't forget bulldog football tonight Georgia versus Vanderbilt how many teams from Tennessee do we have to play before we can get into real football

simply roofing that came out for a free roof analysis and couldn't have been nicer more informative they use the drone and got up on the roof for personal inspection\nThe good news for me is rough is fine that gives me peace of mind and drives home the point that simply roofing will never tried to sell you something you don't need\nThat's why I recommend Findlay roofing family in roofing sets the standard for roofing excellence there locally owned and operated and nobody replaces all repairs more Atlanta area roofs that's why they're Atlanta most trusted and recommended roofer\nYour roof is

couldn't make it any easier they bring the samples to use it you can see that in your life and with your decor\nAnd fifty four really shines on the day of installation they move your furniture all the way your old flooring clean up\nBut allowing the buyer to do the inspection and working with a strong real estate agent with good negotiation skills who can help you navigate that inspection process and look out for your best interests um but that would be my recommendation just you know paint carpet some of the simple things easier things that are a little less expensive that make a big impact in terms of the home showing\nThere's a real estate agent and when asked this question for Catherine does a real estate agent know of people who are flipping houses and would be interested in buying a house like that they kind of like a\nYou know you go to a an art dealer and he knows that this guy likes then goes he's liable to buy it and go because he knows he can sell it to another guy do does a real estate yeah I Know of people who are doing that and he was like got an eye out to to say\nYou know this house is a little under market navy and they want to get rid of it and so I Know that these people are going to want it I can help me the pipeline and they're\nAbsolutely so you know it marks been real estate we have a product that could work um you know it's we work with some um\nAh institutional investors we have our own internal team as well and we can make cash offers on homes and clothes on them quickly um and conditional issues aren't necessarily as big of a factor for a U.S than maybe for\nSara Lee as big of a factor for a U.S than maybe for a retail buyer you know that by who's looking to live in the home personally\nUm and you know the the there is a slight discount to market value but it's not an extreme discount usually somewhere between um you know a Ninety cents on the dollar but for some folks in situations like Catherine [noise]\nIt's it's the right decision for them um and how we work it as we come out we present both options we look at the market value a and we look at the uh guaranteed offer value um so certainly good real estate agents that have been in the business a while should have a network of investors they can work with but um we could certainly uh help as well Catherine\nThat's great All right thank you\nThank you for the call oral for

away\nThere you go and we're going to talk about this or that the deal that you have working your advertising right now in a little bit you got a couple more phone calls were still a phone lines are

infrastructure H ... cetera however uh got us thirty eight ... a short little ... ... or\n... or knew what so do I fix the pool a fire sale or do I just feel it in the landscape and go away\nYou know I Would probably recommend filling it in and landscaping at a really well it's probably going to be cheaper than completely fixing the pool and you know for most fires or you know today I'm\nPools are becoming a little more attractive for for buyers because sometimes with dual income families in work it's just harder to get to the neighborhood pool or maybe the community doesn't have one um but you know I just speaking from personal experience you know that same other side of that coin is you know when you're both a husband and wife or working or whatever\nUm you know it's not a lot of time spent in the pool says some people do look at them as more of a hassle um they look at it like more of a liability um folks with young children sometimes obviously have safety concerns so\nUm you know I Would really be a cost issue for me so I Would get a quote on repairing the liner and getting the pool and great working condition and maybe the filling in landscape and I would just go with whichever is less expensive that would be my advice\nOkay I appreciate that professional opinion because I did that and do it all on the contrary to what I thought is incredibly ... two to three times to cost ...\nOkay where you go then I Would fix the pool I think that makes the most offensive just whichever is less expensive\nYeah okay so it's a economic issues thanks for your expertise\nSame thing I I wouldn't have thought that costs a dirt I guess as a you know more expensive than some would think if ah if I filled out there and if I went ahead and filled in a pool of course he's got a big pool and thirty two football\nIf I had a smaller pool or an area like that and I filled it in and planet when I had to disclose that there's a pool in my backyard then I'd still then [noise]\nYou know it's not on the standard disclosure but I'm a big believer in uh over disclosing you know if there's anything that could be a factor that would influence the buyers purchase you want to make sure to disclose that um you know\nI once again it's not on the standard form of the specific question but I Would I Would I Would put that in his a ride in for sure just because you don't want anything that could come up at the last minute that could give a buyer way to wiggle out of the contract\nOr are they started in after years ago we should put a pool back here and right now already one there he just wanted to dig that dirt back out you can probably spruce it back up ready\nFor all for eight seven to zero seven fifty is the number Paul is in New name all started with Paul Newman there for a second but [laughter] what's up top that I'm not the only guy in the studio and I think you're Paul Newman so\n[laughter] I Wish I had bought off money man I Wish I had as good looks\nYeah when they do uh I got a question in reference to I Know you've been speaking a little bit about inspections and everything mhm [noise] um I've been in my house about too much I headed inspect uh about three weeks ago I noticed I I have a courtyard\nWith a a a you can set an outdoor kitchen there and it's got about a ... a ... covered so to speak roof over mhm and I'm going to cost me about five hundred dollars to get it requires mhm\nGoing to cost me about five hundred dollars to get it with ... ... what happened was um my inspector ... a ... ... and a ... I'm Out of\nAll I Want to do just get it fixed and I know I'm going to have it but if the orders or or does it stand on and then you know uh and shit like that\nWell you know basically in Georgia um it is somewhat of what we would call a buyer beware state so the the buyers afforded the opportunity inspect the home um you know what you could look at is a review the sellers disclosure that was provided by the homeowner and if maybe there was something in there that was misrepresented\nUm in other words they said there was no issues with that particular I'm a part of the home or no a structural or would rod issues you could have a a case with the um you know home seller\nI'm the reality though is that at five hundred dollars you know the cost of a lawsuit or engaging with an attorney even just a habit our consultation with some attorneys can eat up most of the five hundred dollars so\nUm you may want to go back to the inspection company I mean most inspection companies have a lot of hold harmless isn't sort of a ... attached to it but you know just from a customer service standpoint let him know that you know there was a miss and maybe they're willing to help you with that repair but\nI think unfortunately unless there was some deliberate misrepresentation by the seller I'm it would be challenging and then the other side of that is you know once again the cost of engaging with an attorney but that's it no harm in reaching out to your agent and asking them to reach out to the the the sellers agent and maybe they can talk to the seller and see if they're willing to come together\nTo make that situation right um yeah\nI have I have reached out to the inspector a\nProblem is that even we turn my emails all calls or anything like that but I mean I ... I just didn't know where a purchaser which Danielle shots like that show up appreciate you know appreciate all that it can be fixed but and it's no big deal it's just it uh it was ...\nWell it certainly frustrating but you know in in today's world you know we obviously have a a louder voice as consumers and\nThere's review platforms out there that are available to use social media um since you're having a hard time getting that inspector on the phone you may just want to inform others about your experience him I'm either a you protect other folks or be it motivates them to maybe return that phone call and do the right thing\nRight All right well look a certain I'd appreciate it and are you guys have a great day\nActually call Mr Neumann thank you All right Ellen was Woodward forests horrible for eight seven two zeroes seven fifty is the number is nine forty eight and a half you're listening to the Olympics is Joe and news Ninety five and seven fifty W.

runners warehouse taps hundreds of Web sites they but thousands of potential runners\nIt's burning the dust off to eat exchanges in the ... is a dangerous not at all it's the only way to get rid of it is just let it run and it'll it'll burn that smell away\nVery good so if you haven't had that smell don't worry if you've got good insulation in your home\nIt's very possible you haven't had that yet because it takes correct properly insulated houses have you talked to add again innovations of Georgia and had a properly insulated house than they no longer you go before you get that smell the better off you\nAre you at your house is properly insulated it should not get cold on a Ninety degree day\nAll right so is it we're we're moving in the first season we're getting there it's going to be eighty eight today and tomorrow but then it's going to eventually not be eighty and then at night is going to dip into the fifties and forties it happens funny it happens every year does that mean that air conditioning units are now on sale\nYou know after after we go through one during the winter coats if we go to spring or winter costs are on sale to get rid of the ... winter coats does that work\nWith their condition well them in their cells throughout the year and different specials that go on but not not necessarily I Would say probably Twenty years ago it was a little more consistent with the seasons but there have been so many changes with the EPA laws tax tax credits things to that effect that it really doesn't\nYou really can't judge when it's going to happen but saying that the sooner the better because prices generally don't go down historically speaking\nAlright for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty is the number number for you to call so what's keeping you guys busy this time of year we talked about it right before we came on the air and got really goofy is the maintenance deals right and they're always on sale maintenance deals are for sale\nUm per unit it cool ray it's like a hundred and fifty nine bucks\nThey start off at a hundred and fifty eight and worried her way up depending on how many systems you've got\nIs something that everybody in Atlanta if you're listening to this and you do not have a maintenance agreement on your system at your house\nHave a maintenance agreement on your system at your house you are way behind the times it's a hundred and fifty dollars that runs for twelve months it it's just a one time a hundred and fifty a you're not going to charge them that I'm a one time a hundred and fifty eight dollars what do I get from my money\nYou're getting two visits per year where we come out and we service your heating system in the fall and we service your cooling in the summertime in charge of those visits a you're already when you pay that that one time the it covers both of those visits now if we have to come back throughout the year for a no cooler no heat you you are going to get\nA discount on the service call and then any repairs that are needed as well and you are a priority customers so if we're a week two weeks behind on demand calls we're going to try to get you that same day which\nDoesn't sound like a lot but when it's a hundred degrees outside that huge\nWhat are you going to do when you come out to my house for regular service call\nFirst thing we're going to do is is find no boots booties on your feet on the little booties on the feet and then come in and ask a few questions to try to get in a very good idea of what's going on and they were going to diagnose and then determine exactly what the problem is and then a present you with the solutions\nThat doesn't have to be a problem you know right I mean you can just come in and you change the filter use the squirt some oil here Larry poor little bleach in the right off you go if it's good\nIf we are doing a maintenance visit then we're going to be proactive and make sure drained her clean filters are changed and make sure everything's were running efficiently and most of the most of all safely\nThere you go and you keep track of that that's not my job to keep track to that and call you correct keep track of that\nThat's one of the benefits to the customer as they don't have to remember it we're going to call them and and stay on top of that and get it scheduled within\nThe beautiful thing about this isn't this this is the other question that I get quite often and and emails is\nWell yeah it's already October I've already missed the spring one so I'm I'm getting ripped off from my hundred and fifty eight dollars but that's not true it starts the day you start to system so if I if you'd call cooler a Monday a\nSeven seven four seven and one cool if you give them a call Monday and say I want him to the the the maintenance agreement that I heard they make are talking about Saturday that means you will start on the eighth of October so you'll get your furnace checked this this year and then in the spring of come out and do your air conditioner\nCorrect yeah and the coverage with all the benefits it lasts a twelve twelve months a year from the time we start the agreement and then we're going to come out those to visit again like you just stayed and we're going to come out this fall\nGet everything everything are ready to go for winter time and then we'll be back out in the spring changed filters in service everything there but you're covered for\nTwelve months and I think I Believe I just kind of commercial gee I don't know if I can say the shed because this is this is insider knowledge maybe okay we're gonna we're gonna splurge that sound a little bit I I just did a commercial for you guys were you can lock in for five years are you familiar with us from my preaching\nDie you know what I Believe I heard this on the way in this morning\nOh so do you do not want to talk now I'm not leaking big news ... but not big news you can lock in Korea for five years and get and it's fully refundable if there's a problem right\nI you know what I Believe so I Know there there's a credit also towards the any breakdowns you have I think I don't quote me I think it's two hundred and fifty dollars\nMr Kyle on the hill and we'll hear from him in our humanity Iraq will decide on that but there's a deal for a five year deal and that that is the best I mean you're going to do it anyway you might as well and then you want to have to think about it every\nCheaper the longer you extend it out and it is like I tell customers it needs to be done they need to be service twice a year whether you're on a maintenance agreement no matter who does it needs to be done twice a year but the best the best deal and the best benefit for the customer is is a maintenance agreement absolutely\nAnd this is not to be confused with an extended Warren ...\nNot at all or no this is being proactive maintaining your system this is try to try to prevent\nBreak down this is not also be confused with a home warranty that you would maybe by from one of these uh yeah there are going to hear their care for these companies that come and they take your about five hundred dollars a year right in and say hey when you're first breaks down now you're covered you'll\nGet ... you get very minimal benefits out of that I'm not a huge a proponent for whole warranties but again this is not a home warranty this is a maintenance agreement where we are maintaining being proactive and there are benefits if you do have any any problems throughout the year\nGenerally if you're out there buying a new system this time of year people will say oh give you a you get one year free maintenance All right I like to tell them I'm not buying unless I get two years free maintenance [laughter] I Know I like little look on your face in it but you're going to tell me that you're not going to give me one more year free maintenance for a new system\nEver hurt staff come on\nYou know ... if you said to me\nYou know whatever her status if if you said to her heating in our company and they say no way you give me a call at least right now out for you\nAnd you will get that new system for two years free maintenance right to just go from there absolutely will true or false right before we go to a break and take some phone calls for eight seven to zero seven fifty you only fifty dollars oh true you're already answered okay\nNow I forgot the question oh true or false getting a maintenance agreement now even though I haven't had one for years will help extend the life of my aging system absolutely so there's no point that it's too late now man overboard\nNo I mean it makes it a little bit more work when we come out because we may have to clean a little bit more do a little bit more work to your system but we're going to bring it up to optimal operating a conditions\nSo any any email you send me that's the first line is I have an Eighteen year old system comma and I you know my first question we do have a maintenance agreement on it a maintenance agreement will help whatever's wrong with that Eighteen year old system immediately\nIt will yes only in early ... do better yes if it hadn't been maintained in a number of years then anything you do to it at that point cleaning\nAnd maintenance wise is going to benefit that system because if they had been maintained even in just a couple of years and it and very good chance motor coils are dirty drain if it's not stopped up it's very close to it so anything we can do to it's going to help it out and extend\nThe life of it there are some things that I Would not due to an Eighteen year old furniture and I'll tell you what those are but first we're going to bring you up to date on weather and traffic than more than ... right here
