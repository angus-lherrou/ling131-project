Bush was wrong [laughter]\nI'm like Austin's dad 'cause that's how I ... for it to them as all of them get at the at like a kid around them and all that and\nThe governor has not been president for ten years can we move on to something else or Mike yeah here's the lady\nHey Eric Honda mainly law I Would consider I Would suggest that she may be um read a little bit more into it there is a lot of unintended consequences wet that law and the presumption of innocence for those who have not been convicted\nI'm also plays a role in that one it's a constitutional amendment to something that's already in the statute and so I'm concerned when we start opening the constitution and adding extra things to it that there may be some issues that while it may seem good it's not healthy for us as a whole just thinking\nYou know I'm Glad that ah she called him with that I was thinking myself before I heard that up Macy's law is using Kelsey grammar on TV and the poor lady who was an ex boyfriend or husband who threw acid in her face was acid I think I'm a\nAnd the idea of Macy's law as I understand it is when someone that has harmed you is getting out of prison you get a heads up you don't find out about it later you get a heads up or even beforehand so that you can go up here it was a parole situation you can be there and you know make your argument known\nBefore she spoke or she left that open Mike I was thinking you know one downside could be\nVigilante isn't\nSo if a if somebody raped my daughter say and they had they got Fifteen Years and and then I was informed that that that that are getting out\nAnd and then I was informed that that that that are getting out before they got out\nOf it you could see where there'll be a potential for vigilantism if I'm if I'm Still so emotional about that that I don't care that I'm going to go to jail as long as you pay the price that I think you should pay a so there is more to think about\nWith Macy's law but it was the only one I was going through all the amendments and referenda\nAnd uh [laughter] I figured I had to be for one that won some good enough [laughter]\nEverything what did you say something about the presumption of innocence ... yeah well this is the reason they already in\nJail she sounds to me like she's read uh the actual writing of the rest of the uh ... the bill bill it's a it's a\nReferendum no the other thing referenda law never mind the\nOther thing you vote on besides people referendum amendment yet I don't maybe yeah Macy's law was mostly called [laughter] I'll look it up for some reason I'm blanking right now or let's do this [noise]\nFrom making spirits St Louis death in ... as it is [laughter]\nIt is in fact a constitutional amendment\nYes sir alright what I Want on the conspiracy despot\nToday is this caravan\nThat by the way to managers tells me it's been pushed off the front page\nThat's why he thinks seeing some of these bombs were a some sort of hoax to push this off the front page the care that do you know when I said the Jim Andrews Jared and on um what'd you say I said a wake up it's twenty Eighteen there's no such thing as a front page anymore\nWell virtual [laughter]\nPushing it or how much they get out of sight United States trends would be your front page on Twitter\nPushing ... yeah exactly so the caravan there are many people who believe now here's my question about the care of and I said this yesterday or asked these questions yesterday what I Want to know is who is behind it\nWho are the sheep dogs that's all you have to find out when you got seven thousand people that are all along the line there are sheep dogs there are people going up and down that line conveying messages getting ideas across explaining things putting things in context this what we're doing next who say\nWho's funding them\nAnd who in the United states\nIs behind this because these poor people are being used by all sides of this is a humanitarian catastrophe\nThat's in the making here and I believe whoever's behind it is behind it for political purposes but that doesn't seem to be a lot of a rubber Taj our energy going in that direction to figure out who's behind the seven thousand some people don't just come together will know the focus is the people\nThemselves and what they're doing while they're on the on the camera yeah because you're eating and whatever yeah and the narrative is\nBecause the most of the media\nBelieves that they should just be allowed into the country right or I don't even know what the media things but they were when things were sure as you shouldn't be harsh\n... or anything like that and so the media is going to go in and do the lazy thing not that it's not important at different times but the lazy kind of reporting is if I go into seven thousand people who are in a migrant caravan I'm going to go find the people who\nHave who are worse off the worst off right and I'm going to highlight their stories\nAnd as a way to say that uh there should be more compassionate let me just say I believe\nI don't follow the rules that are put out there by everyone else I Believe that it's OK in your mind to both be compassionate\nTowards the people and believe that it's bad policy to let them overrun the border also a little thing for me is they're deciding to go a lot further farther\nThan that one right hate that further father thinks they're deciding to go a lot farther than they need to to get in the United states well I think about a thousand miles extra so they can come in a suit California as opposed to Texas so California's a sanctuary state\nSee none of this conspiracy theories to me these are just yeah they had my head I'm Wondering whether they're choosing to go almost a thousand miles further on foot rather than try to enter through Texas or the state that they'd be entering through has declared itself a sanctuary state who who's going to be waiting for them lawyers\nWell but more than that who the advocates they're going to be a waiting for them and are they in any way funding this to me that's the ...\nEating for them and are they in any way funding this to me that's the interesting stuff should we be compassionate\nTowards the people absolutely uh most of them are coming from horrendous circumstances but we don't give asylum based on a while you're countries just crappy ... you have to come in and say look if I go back to they're going to kill me that's one of the main reasons that we give asylum\nIn reality everybody there is dealing with gangs and basically if you if you want to not be killed in Guatemala and Honduras\nYou have to pay off gangs right so\nWe'd have to let everybody an under that criteria so go ahead and give me some of the favorites 'cause I don't think mine of conspiracy theories I just want to know the answers who's funding this\nWell rounded Campbell Soup executive Kelly Johnston well George saw which by the way that Campbell Soup people distance themselves from this opinion song George so that was I was on his own Twitter have now you know the official Campbell yeah maybe chunky 'cause it's full of a lot of garbage George Soros is open society foundation is\nOrchestrating the migration helping them find bathrooms and offering them\nA an army of immigration lawyers waiting at the border they're not as Saudi is yeah and this is also supported by representative Matt gets a from Florida\nSo they're saying that opens I didn't know what SARS is done in Europe with his open society as help bring north Africans and sub Saharan Africans to Europe to Italy and and that's worked out a well yeah not for me it was\nGreat for the European Union yes been royal that up at all no uh so I don't know this is what I Would say about that\nI don't know George Soros is the one they denied certainly has a lot of money I don't know and does he have an organization called open society right so they're denying it but somebody\nIs funding this at some level mhm this isn't just getting charity water and a few chips as you walk\nFrom some long ass walk\nFrom Honduras to California so that has to be it will be like sticking to think that this wasn't funded an orchestrated in some way would be like a just sort of happening to show up at\nA Coachella and thinking oh this must have just happens like organic all these people got together with these rock bands and they're having fun like it's just a just spontaneous thing well\nOf George Soros as in your cup of tea the president himself tweeted last week that the Democrats are running it really offer any other uh speculation as to who I Would\nImagine whoever's funding it is a Democrat or a leftist uh-huh but I don't think anything out of the official Democrat Party because if they did it's an issue that so far has not worked in their favor it's more galvanized Republicans and Trump hers", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville",
