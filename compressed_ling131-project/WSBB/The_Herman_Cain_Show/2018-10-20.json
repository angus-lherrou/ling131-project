sure explain why the laminate floor is a lemon and actually is a picture of would you know you have a composite surface or with the image of wood to look like whatever it's trying to mimic um and then you have a Cold War you know a composite core\nA and went to the laminate itself you know it's protected by that outer shell and that's what gives it you know unlike a lot of cases the lemon is that we have right now that are waterproof\nYou know give them their waterproof protection as well as they're extremely high scratch resistance um but it's way different from a piece of wood and you can

underfoot a when you're walking on it um it's kind of feel a little more realistic uh like I've got\nYou know everything from their entry level we tease up to the sticker products that even had a cork backing a but yes they can easily go below grade they're made for that and there's there's a lot of products that can go and that's probably one of the most popular especially\nIf you ever did have an

know obviously the if you have us out you know everything we have is\nYou know is is going to be something that that you can rely on but there's a lot of you know cheaper made products out there so

guard foundation solutions I liked that the founder of the foundation that's it you invented foundations and I just had to call in the last segment nice lady her front steps were sinking and I said you need to talk of guard because you have a system for that\nI might have not called poly level for some reason I Can't keep a level in my head\nBut I said you kind of float steps back in the position and explain all that to me so well no better\nIt's our it's our newest division called poly level and and basically it addresses settling in sinking concrete that could be a ...\nThis settling in sinking concrete that could be a driveway as I say it's not just stares\nNo sidewalks driveways patios pool decks steps carport basements labs\nYou know where you see this a lot is the little patio that they pour outside your basement the walkout basements right outside those French doors everybody has an you open the doors and you got a little slab of patio there and they always seems to have sunk and they sink toward your house yet which encourages for hunters to your foundation right\nThrough those double doors so it's a it's a very common problem and you know people get mad at the concrete but it really isn't the concrete the whole problem is the soil underneath that that's what causes the problem and that's\nBack to all kinds of reasons typically you know we're back to that improperly child roof water a lot of times poor drainage or improperly challenge roof water or whether it be a driveway or any of these pieces a concrete we're talking about it washes out the the soil underneath\nThe soil is what's supporting this lab so this lab shuttles so the way this process works is we drill about a dime sized hole in\nThe concrete and various sections based on and what we're trying to to left and we pump this two part polyurethane falling under this lab and it fills the void and then it can literally lift the concrete back into place\nSo I'm not that far off when I say floated back into play you always kind of grim is when I say that but yeah that's what you're kind of doing you're lifting it back into the way it\nWas and when you look at it being done in action you can literally see it floating back into into place and they use that word the cool stuff\nThis can lift a lot of weight too and it's not just has to be a little ... to ... know inches thick in I mean you can do the stairs and do\nWe if there is a heavy structure like a lot of steps or going to use 'em some light duty peers in conjunction with the poverty level\nUh and and that that gives it a really good a result in a in a good fix 'em I mean this process Dave is used residential like we're talking about this we use the same process\nOr we do DOT work a bridge approaches storm drains municipalities sidewalk so this is a a a process that is very effective has a lot or uses but\nFor homeowners or you know this concrete everywhere and this is a great solution a and much more economical than replacing the concrete if the concrete is in good shape if it's all cracked to hack then it doesn't make any sense to to to try to do with that but we're going to let you know when we look at it\nOur estimates are completely free no obligation so we can come out and tell you if it's a good candidate for this process\nYou know or I see places that need this a lot is the the sidewalk going from the driveway to the front door and it creates a hazard actually a walking has been where you could trip over it\nDoes a lot of times that because that soil was the filter that they put back when they over excavated for the foundation and uh so the story was never really compacted well in the first place and so that's an accident waiting to happen\nSo if you see cracked and settled concrete or if you have any foundation issues with your house you need to call my guys I tested them I Try to and they've been in my house I loved them aqua guard foundation solutions seem on the Web

[laughter]\nYeah I mean if they're the metal boats and they're extremely rusted um they can be they can be a bit frustrating to get off\nSo uh uh sometimes will use a reciprocated saw there's there's other little tools there's one called the jam bar it's like a little slim Jim for boats and it slides and underneath the the the little plastic cap grabs on hold with little tiny teeth and keeps the bulk from moving so you can use a you know ... or or channel walks or something to\nGet rid of all these balls off she put new bolts on every level or\nEvery time anytime anytime you do anything with plumbing you should replace every single one of those little parts [noise] 'cause if you don't that's it just becomes more frustrating and for the extra five ten twenty bucks in in those little parts it will save you hours of hair pulley\nOkay is this is easy is I'm On a sitting bolt taking those out having somebody straddle the toilet lifting it up and then putting in the ... and all that guy holds it up and just sending it back down if\nYou want to torture you know like if you if your son's there and you want to hang on and you have to agree to all the old black town he asked on the toilet can't touch the floor until it's ready to be reset will have him standing there holding the toilet that's that's something we would do to one of our\nPractice so it's kind of ... you have to be all all the old wax off last off last on kind of thing\n... first yeah he got the wax off than you Exxon\nOkay the or\nSo but it's hard I mean some of these little tunnel installs in these new houses where you've got the door it's got to be it's a tough go to get that because you get as straddle it when you left and then you're kind of Chicken Little two steps back your way out or does the wax they'll have to set for a while or\nThe wax is just it shows waxes it molds into place immediately and it stays whack see its whole life um if there's movement to the toilet overtime that wax is going to pancake has the toilet moved back and forth across the wax and then eventually the wax is not going to make contact with the toilet and then you get a leak in league\nAll right very good good luck Mohammed have or have you better have\nTake a video of this while you're doing it [laughter] pleased with us and that does this is something Mr plumber would come out and do\nWe do it on a daily basis but I don't get me wrong it's not an easy task to do because there's a there's there's there's always things that can go wrong and always things that you should look at that and that\nThat was actually one of my questions today replaced toilet the or why what's the hardest part and what's the most likely thing to overlook what's the hardest part about doing your own toilet replacement\nUm [laughter]\nI mean as a plumber or as a homeowner has a home guy trying to do it in South All right so so I guess the first thing you know is this taking is is knowing how it all comes apart watch watch a video or something for us to see the whole process\nUm lifting that toilet is those things are happy there there you know anywhere from Seventy five to a hundred and twenty five pounds\nEspecially with the tank on just got water and it will be even more so first thing shot by shot back out all the water sponge it all out\nThen lifted toilet put it on to drop off somewhere else so you can clean up the whole area of take the tank offers um if if the parts in the tank or in bad condition yes because once you start moving that toilet around and you go put that toilet back in there is a good chance that may start leaking from the tanks now\nSo if it's an older toilet hasn't been rebuilt in a long time I probably add that to the task many [laughter] um it's an awkward moved around a ... or move loosely\nYeah [laughter] I mean I mean you you do your straddle it and you got to a news or body like a crane and you just like lower you live there I don't ya ya wattle a couple of feet you place it down to four\nInches up and you're kind of the ... to ... to ... make the corner and get out of that little room yeah set it down\nIt will replace the or replace the boats and then put a put a new wax on it put a new supply line on it bring it back in the hardest part is when you're bringing a toilet back in and you're trying to look over to the side to line the ... with the ... the little tiny holes in the bottom of the toilet and\nThen once you get it set up you push it down you sit on it and you're bowling back down back down with the nuts and bolts and washers and you go and uh hook up a new supply restore the water tests it and then once you're done and everything's fleet free then you walk around the base\nJust like that you're a plumber dislike that overnight for all for eight\nSeven two zeroes seven fifty is the number ... in Canton gain a year on the home fix the Joe\nHey hey Danny hey I've got a\nUh got a problem with my water lines in the house and\nIt occurs just about what they you know running water in the house whether it's a fake shower a flush a toilet you know fill up the washing machine and it's probably started occurring or I guess about probably four or five months ago\nAnd I'm not really done a thing you know changed at a fixture has anything to you know precipitate that that is it a loan or a high um\n[noise] ... Danny yeah is it a low Hummer high hum\nA it's kind of a low ...\n... yeah can you imitate at first you know while you're pipe Tom Danny\n[laughter]\nI don't know the word I use that and now you know who actually do their over Thirty years in jail [laughter]\nMost likely most likely you're culprits going to be the P. R. V. the pressure reducing self\nSo first thing I Would do is is that on your boxed or by ten Fifteen dollar water pressure tests gauge and it comes with a little a host connector on it so you go you can go out to your ... hook it on to it and turn on a I'm Sorry\nI've done that the all the pressures are right about sixty PSI\nOkay and uh do you know how old the P R B is\nA it's probably twelve to Fifteen Years old or I placed at least want to build the house\nI got ya yeah they do they do less on average probably ten or Fifteen Years and and even though you you may have correct pressure that's typically still the root cause\nOther things that ... that would that would always be the first two step is is update that to make sure to rule it out of the equation and then the next steps will be there could be individual valves a valve in the in the line somewhere that has a rubber washer that's just [noise]\nOld and flapping in the wind is water passes over it and make a harmonic sound that that that ah that that home so to speak with a mostly have anything to do with\nMaybe the uh the water heaters expansion tank or anything\nWith it it it would ... I mean it could uh\nBut uh typically if it's happening all the time and not just intermittently like if it was your expansion tank and and pressure was increasing because you're expansion tank failed it's going to be after a majority a majority of it's going to be after large uses of hot water\nSo ... you know you take a good long shower and then the next half hour your water heaters reading nobody's use water in the house that pressure builds up\nAnd then you release that pressure you you may get that home but it wouldn't be constant so it's like you flush a toilet and run water throughout the day randomly you're not using a large amount of hot water and it's happening all the time my eyes would be on the pressure reducing ...", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "20"}
