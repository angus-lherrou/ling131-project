diagnose treat cure or prevent disease\nDiscuss this information with your own physician or health care provider to determine what is right for you\n[noise]\nEverybody Dr Joe here so we spend a little time together and we're talking today about hardy of the arteries and heart disease and what causes it and this is the thing that gets me every day patients come in our office at thirty four years now they just come in and they'll say doc I've been diagnosed with blank\nOsteoarthritis is a good one [noise] and I always say you know what causes it no hey if you don't know cause it how you treat them and so I answer them\nOsteoarthritis is a mechanical condition Bones Are out of alignment rubbing up against each other the body produces these specific white blood cells to attack the inflammatory reaction that occurs when the bones right a place and it was white blood cells are not cite specific which means they go all over the body\nAnd they attack your hip and your knee and you're ... you're all your joints but the most freely movable weakest joints in the body suffer the most damage which aware your fingers\nSo people oh doc I got off right after my fingers chances are it's not the primary site at the secondary site and so we got to go through the body and then find out where the primary site is that's causing the inflammatory reaction and from a chiropractic standpoint if we can adjust those bones back into place and when we do that that's when people get better\nAnd so that's why we try to get to the cause of the problems and not just treat the symptoms\nWe talked about oxidized oils in the body and oils especially probably an saturated oils like ah olive oil and not all of\nA corn oils soil or canola oil they oxidized because identical ranch and before you eat them or are they getting your body and they're exposed to free radicals which oxidized them and that they they can borrow into the walls of the arteries and causing inflammatory reaction\nAnd then the body starts to lay down cholesterol to kind of protect that area and that's how you get the ... and then the body can start to clot in that area and you start to narrow the arteries and that becomes a problem\nAnd so we can do several things in his surgery is just amazing for this we tried to take out that blocked artery or we can go in there and kinda rotor it out and kind of clean it out like you would drain and it's amazing blows my mind what we can do with surgery\nBut my concern is no one ever gets to the cause of why you have to begin with so if we can get to the cause of the problem and not just treat the symptoms wearing a much better place and that is we're talking about today lots of callers we have a question aid for for for for Dr Joe let's see Brett you've been holding the longest how can make your day better\nBetween aquifer thank Carter's they'll use highly forty one there or the express lanes a little bit further south they're heading north bound right now as your alternate ... also blocked on the ... to ... he found between ... Parkland Seventy five causing heavy slow down there as well just\nBetween ... Seventy five causing heavy slow down there as well Jill Nelson there'll be a speed\nListen to Dr Joe the five most dangerous words in the English language are maybe it will go away stumps suffering you start getting well Dr George ... views on when you asked me if I talk\nTo Joe here so glad you with us today we're talking about how the arteries and cholesterol buildup in the arteries and\nI see it so often in our patients we take an extra ... can we take a side B reading some front fuse we see it and we see the cholesterol buildup and sometimes it's called ... which is actually we get a little ... of the main area\nWhere the valves are are you get the heart of the arteries and and ... if it's bad enough it's called the Ayotte again your resume dissecting or the ...\nAnd it's a big issue and I thought I really need to do a show on this and tell people why they're getting it and that's why we're talking about today so if you're just tuning in the show's going to be on our website Dr Joe dot com and you could listen to this and the hundreds well over a thousand hours of other shows\nAre we have it on SoundCloud so it's an audio version so you can download that if you want and then we have the video versions of them and those are on the website Dr Joe dot com and you could pick any topic you want and I really do recommend you start doing this and one of the things we teach ... when I teach students on how to study study techniques is review you know every day\nAnd the more you review it easier it's gonna be same thing with the shows listen to his show that you have an interest in maybe listen to it several times listen to shows that are similar to it so that you can educate yourself so that you can actually get well and say well I got a few callers holding let's get these folks first Patricia how can we make your day better\nI listen to your show every day oh you're a good girl [laughter]\nI I'm I'm forty five years old and I was diagnosed at ... called ... yes I Am not a diabetic I my precious normal I don't have any other issue it's not in my family I don't know where it came from what can I take a ... and I do it that they that based diet now\nExcellent okay so you do a plant based I have a walk home\nNow I have macular degeneration and so I started taking super Marines in central source but whatever eight nine years ago and mine has gotten about sixty or Seventy it depends on the way you look at Seventy eighty percent better\nOr what you just unheard of in in the world a flock of macular degeneration it never gets better and I could be blind by now and is that I'm getting better and better every day and every year so so what did a lot calmer you got the pressure build up in the eyes and so something that might help\nIs taking some digestive enzymes and again no guarantee it on this but take in between meals we have one on my website Dr Joe dot com Dr Joe's enzymes support\nAnd take them on an empty stomach with food they can actually digest the food they kind of work on the food that's if you take on an empty stomach they can absorb it into the blood system and if the ... case may be able to get into that area and help breakups them build up that you might have behind the guy\nSo that would help and then the other thing that might help and again these are all mites is high practice care\nBecause if you have pinched nerve the blood vessels in the back of the neck those are the nerves to control the ice and if you do that that may help relieve some of the pressure as well and if you being a good plant based girl that's the way you want to say because you want to make sure you have good circulation\nSo you might want to consider Dr Joe's nitric oxide support as well to increase circulation throughout the body\nSo I'd say the super raise the essential source of nitric oxide and the enzymes support might be a good a good start for you are and see what we go in there let's do it for four or five six months and see how we do\nThank you thank you\nMy pleasure Patricia and once again folks I Can't tell you to take drugs are not take drugs I Can't tell if surgery not take surgery but\nI can tell you the things that I've seen at work in my offices and things that I worked for me personally because I wouldn't lie to you why would I have no reason to lie to you and all those products by the way are on the website Dr Joe dot com let's talk to Chad how can we make your day better\nPaid out your show um I was reading a book a ... for your blood type yes and I have to have a blood ... and uh so I Know I I crave a lot of me so I like\nThat and I don't have a problem with it before but ah I hear you ate a talk about race and uh you know he tells me broccoli and stuff like that butter\nUh stay away from late ... and he felt read now okay hum that try to keep my weight as right uh-huh uh do you think about that\nWell spelled is still a form of wheat and soy has gluten in wheat gluten as glad and in gluten in so it's so cause allergic or inflammatory reactions stay away from the dispelled Brett if you could I'm the type of blood type Dr de Dahmer wrote a book you based on his father's research your base it on a a Dr Kelly's research was a dentist I think in the thirties I'm not don't quote me on that\nAnd what Dr Kelly found is that people that were very sick and they had type o blood seemed to do well or better if they ate small amounts\nOf raw organic meat well who when the book we don't talk about small amounts of Ronald ... books fine I'm not knocking the book at all but what I Would say is if you're going to eat meat it's gotta be small amounts\nBut what I Would say is if you're going to eat meat it's got to be small amounts\nIt's got to be organic and I've had many patients with old blood I'm In a positive but people at with old blood who do very well not eating animal products\nAnd if you read the book doesn't say you should eat meat it says you can eat me a big difference so um so my feeling is if you're going to eat any animal products and again I'm a realist I understand not everybody's going to do what I say at least organic if we can and all\nThat kind of glad shove the eating in a\nWhile and fortunately there isn't a good bread out there because all the bread even if they're gluten free still break down into sugars so here's what here's a little inside scoop for your child because you're listening you get the inside scoop\nOn when you start change your diet when you do things like super greens and essential source you eat more a salad at least once a day eat try to eat something rod every meal\nEventually you don't need bread anymore because bread just breaks down into sugar and sugar stimulates the nucleus occupations and your brain which stimulates the doping receptor sites and you get high from it so the only reason you need bread is because you get high from it\nSo once we start to cut the ... get the nutrients in the body that you need the bread is easy to put to the wayside it's not that big a deal you just got to get to that point in your life okay\nI sat for each call and folks if you want to make an

we have in this country we have a lot of cancer and heart disease and a high blood pressure and strokes and a lot of those\nDiseases or diseases of access what that means is we\nGet we have the ability to eat a lot of bad food and processed foods and modest sodium glutamate I'm gonna try to cover that if I can to a lot of time but my sort of glutamate and how the body has glutamate receptor sites I guess kind of covered anyway and the glutamate receptor\nSites when a fire off can cost free radicals to occur free radicals can now attacking oxidized ... low dense your liver proteins and cause them to borrow holes in the artery walls and leads to things like heart disease\nSo processed foods have a lot of amount of sorting glutamate in it and the reason is that monitoring glutamate stimulates a taste but in your town called ... taste but if you've never heard that word it's relatively new word\n[noise] when I went to school and Dr airs went to school we uh we learned about assault sweet and bitter and a sour\nAnd those were the taste buds and that's pretty much it and recently in Japan they discovered a new taste bud called the mommy taste bud and that's the savory flavor so if we put ... glutamate ... gas it in the food it stimulates do mommy taste buds and it's a\nFlavor enhanced her\nAnd so that's what's happening it's enhancing the flavors\nAnd people like the food borne so you eat more but that can cause free radical production in the body and it's an exciting to talk to the brain can cause the brain them ... miss fire or fire off more than it's post
