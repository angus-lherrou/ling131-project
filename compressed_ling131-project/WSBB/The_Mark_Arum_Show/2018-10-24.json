be cheese baking ketchup\nMayo but right yeah this is down down at the baking classic double it the more ... by it or approach bottom to top it but be she beef cheese and then one layer bacon lettuce tomato pickles\nAnd then you're softly softly right up onto the river the top on there so you got to be careful that you don't think it's on the bottom you got to do it on top\nSo what difference does

enough in the fast food world let's be honest the only reason he get the Big Mac is because of the special sauce right otherwise you're like what am I doing with that they're in the middle no one wants to do that without the special sauce and no one's getting the Big Mac I think sauces that might be a new trend here\nDifferent sauces to spice up your fast food burgers lung or a like a jalapeno sauce Longoria mess off of seafood now exactly nacho cheese sauce sometimes makes an appearance or at Wendy's um so I think that's a that's a trend we need to look out for is that the sauce trend in
