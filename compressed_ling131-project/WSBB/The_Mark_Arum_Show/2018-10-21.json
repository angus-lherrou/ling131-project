Sherry we have the responsibility to make that right\nAnd you know again mistakes can happen but if it's a serious one you kind of have to analyze woe\nIs something going on behind the scenes at that

blend the worlds of music in finance together here his friend of the show financial advisor and musician mark Lloyd with ... ... the\nMiserable connection here on today's edition of the financial symphony and I'm Renee such mark loneliness here of course in the mark doors fans we've been talking about today and during his music\nWhat we can learn about retirement planning from the doors most popular suck that of course light my fire Jim Morrison indicated on several occasions in his notebooks than he hated light my fire and hated performing it\nSeemed to resent the songs popularity because he'd had just a small part in writing it\nBut if there was a little nurse assistant here that you know this is Jim Morrison ... but of course he never blamed on publicly because he feared he could've hurt the group and naturally\nAnd my question to you is it knowing that Jim Morrison was kinda crazy in a way but knowing that Jim Morrison felt this way about that particular song but he didn't lead on publicly what is our financial connection here\nOh boy this is an easy one Ron this is an easy one\nAnd I hate this I hate this when I hear these types of stories\nAnd I hate it for our industry but I let me just say that the government has gotten involved in our industry\nAnd we're for do Sherry's and produced Sherry's mean that we work for our clients\nWe don't work for stockbrokers we don't work for banks we don't work for new people in our ears telling us what we need to recommend we worked for our clients and that's the way it should be but for years and years and years Ron I'm On my soapbox I'm Sorry but for years and years and years it wasn't that way\nBut for years and years and years it wasn't that way there were brokers stockbrokers out there selling products you know selling securities and some of them just build the products were bad they just weren't good but they sold it for this bad word I'm getting ready to tell you you're ready okay\nThe the word commission oh yeah yeah commission you know maybe it's because it paid them the best maybe because they were trying to win a trip\nFolks you don't need to be working with people like that\nAnd again our industry is in the it's evolving and they're trying to clean this stuff up but it's a hard lobby to beat people up there in Washington right now trying to be\nTrying to fight against it and let me just say that here on the financial symphony we have surrounded ourselves with folks that chair\nThat care about you and care about your lifestyle and care about your needs and care about your goals and care about your dreams and that's the way it should be this is a service business\nWe serve our clients and it's not about what pays off the most\nAnd the folks who don't think in our industry like that the the ones that are greedy when we hear about greed round the first thing that comes on everybody's mind Bernie made off right ... exactly and that's\nThe extreme that's a crook yeah and there's plenty of crooks there's there's a laundry list of crooks that have been in our business you know for centuries you know and I I guess it's just a century decades but at the end of the day that's not what we're talking about I'm just talking about the person\nWho might be greedy the broker who might be greedy\nAnd might just kind of turn their head a little bit or turn their back and say you know maybe it's supposed to be okay because this will really help me if I push this model I push this product I push this solution I push this strategy\nAnd that's the way it should not be that way Ron\nIt should be what makes the most sense for our clients\nAnd unfortunately in in twenty seven years of doing this I've seen folks come through our doors here that have been hurt financially because of greed and I feel so sorry for them\nI mean I'm willing to do back flips and do anything I can do anything I can help these folks beyond the call of duty 'cause I feel so sorry for him\nAnd I can tell you all of our financial symphony mice does feel the same way we were here where people service business and we want to make sure that the recommendations we're making makes the most sense for you\nAnd that's our commitment to you that's our promise to you so folks who have come in and listen to this radio program for a long time maybe you haven't picked up the phone because you don't know if you have a need or not\nMaybe someone has not given you a second opinion of where you're at\nAnd you just open up their statements and you're saying well my bounces going up I think I'm doing okay but are you really doing OK or maybe you're really close to retirement and no one has educated you on how to take that lump sum that you've got accumulated and how to turn that into a fishing income\nHow to turn it into an income and also do a complementary stress test on your portfolio to make sure that you're not\nOverly exposed to too much risk this close to retirement people pick up the phone and make a call and I promise you you will learn something from taking the time and meeting with us Ron tell the folks how to get in touch with us\nJust pick up the phone call eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight you can get a complementary review of your financial plan just call now they take advantage eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nWe all see the finished product of a music superstar the sold out performances the TV and why didn't\nYou don't often see his way to get to that stage hours and hours of practice traveling the critics the improvement\nAll these little details happen in the background without noticing and you know what your financial maestro mixed together financial plan for you in much the same range may make the process easy for you on the Internet and you'll get some more of a product your plan but don't forget about the all important details in Africa\nGoing on in the background to press your financial master remember your plan should be bringing duty combat that when\nTo me a retirement as a thirty year window\nYou know I Want to see my clients go all the way the age one hundred without the fear running out of money that could be thirty five to forty year window it is a marathon so we need to have\nSome money growing long term to keep up with longevity and to make sure that we're gonna have money when we get into our seventies eighties nineties or whenever\nYou know and then we also need to have income buckets buckets where we can supplement our Social Security\nBecome buckets buckets where we can supplement our Social Security even if we have a pension it may be a smaller pension or maybe there's no cost of living on your pension and we need to be able to pull income interest and dividends or you know maybe some structured income to supplement\nThat Social Security check it's critical that money does it need to be risky we need to have that money more conservative because the last thing we want to do is be drawing income from a bucket of money that's losing money that means we're locking in law says that will never get back every time we cash a check\nSo it's critical that we have the risk under control we can have some risk in some buckets but some doctors need to be safer so when we have folks come in we talk about the power\nOf having different buckets of money where you don't have all of your eggs in one basket we've heard that term forever don't put all your eggs in one basket it's critical that you don't do that\nIn retirement you're listening to the financial symphony and we certainly appreciate your being there and and Mark I'm I'm not talking about you here but I'm Talking about listeners out there who may be marathon runners I'm guessing man if you're a marathon runner you probably have a pretty good diet\nAnd uh that's one of the reasons that I'm not American [laughter] just one of the many athlete in general yeah actually\nI had an opportunity to meet Michael Phelps when he was training for the Olympics did you read one time the amount of food that man I had to eat\n[laughter] to have all the you know and how many carbs he ate just to have the energy to swim all those you know races and everything [noise] any kind of training like that you know you got to make sure your body burns cards more efficiently than it burns fats I mean these are things that athletes will tell you all the time in retirement planning\nYou need to be paying very very close attention to your portfolio in the years leading up to retirement\nSo before this correction that we've had here recently and the month of September\nThe market's hit an all time high we hit the longest Bull Run and the history of Wall Street we used to say that was in the nineties not any more it's now we hit the largest Bull Run in the history of Wall Street where back in March of two thousand nine to last crashed we had\nThe Dow Jones industrial close it's sixty five forty seven that was the low and then got the twenty six thousand in January gave some back then got backed up to twenty six thousand again in September has given some back bottom line is that is the largest Bull Run in the history of Wall Street\nNow there is no calendar that tells us that the Bull Run is over\nBut we've got to be prepared that in case there is something going on something blows up there's a you know bubble out here that burst we do end up you know not being able to come to a agreement with China and then that trade war accelerates\nYou know something happens geo politically\nI read an article where the scrolling through a Yahoo Finance and I read in the headlights of the article is to you know Donald Trump junior be ready to go to jail I mean like ... you know something like\nHappens you know I'm not wanting to get into politics I'm not going to talk politics but it's something think about if something like that happens what effect does that have on our portfolio\nWe need to make sure the closer we are to retirement that we had no exactly or at least how they stress tests performed and know the impact it's going to have on our portfolio going down because we don't want to have that happen when it's too late when we've lost our paycheck\nWhile we're talking about the parallels between now running a marathon and preparing for your retirement and you know experience marathoners notice that you can't go out and start to fast you have to pace yourself but if you're a beginning marathoner you might make that mistake of starting to fast and that can put you in a whole heap of trouble\nOh exactly you're a burned out and you know you see that happen every time the Olympics on the longer races where somebody's come out of the blocks and they're setting the pace and then someone in the back that there was not even in the picture\nComes out of nowhere and takes over the lead because the person that had to leave the whole time starts falling back into the pack they went too fast right\nYou see that horse racing too right yeah it can happen in horse racing\nSo same thing in retirement sometimes is tempting just uh hey I'm retired and they oh\nI'm going on a world cruise I'm going to be doing this going to be doing that only spending all this money up front because I've got a ton of money I have worked hard and I made my goal you know maybe that goal in your mind was I Want to be a millionaire I got a millionaire now and I can spend anything I Want to spend with the truth of the matter is based on your lifestyle that you had while you were working\nBecause maybe you had a six figure income and that's what you're used to\nThat spending way over what you should be spending at retirement make the biggest missed\nWhat should be spending at retirement make the biggest mistake you could make because now again we got to make this money last let me kind of backtrack a little bit round because I don't think that retirement means we turn into being a miser no matter\nWhat it does mean though is we need to have a plan we need to have a strategy and when I talk about our financial road map where I plug in the expenses of my clients I plug in inflation higher inflation and what we have right now I plug in higher inflation\nI also plug in your rates of return what the portfolio should go up I lower those expectations I Want to have some gravy here I Want to have I Want to have you know some cushion here\nI plug all of that in and then what I Love about the software is I can sit down with my clients and say you know how much are we spending some of my clients have a really detailed budget some don't\nAnd it's OK the ones that don't I just sit there and say okay I mean your paycheck that you're you're bringing home how much are you get a positive way into the bank\nHow much out of the what you're depositing in the bank argue investing somewhere else you're saving it and then the answers none than I Know what their lifestyle is there's your expenses that's how much you're spending and that's what I might start at and then in the beginning stages of their retirement I might add some expenses because I Want them to take trips\nBut by software is going to tell me am I going too much or is it just right or do we have a little bit of wiggle room we could actually spend some more it will tell me that and when my folks I think really appreciate releases of what I hear\nIs that when they come back in we are constantly redoing that financial road that we're updating it and we're making sure that they're staying within the guard rails are staying in their lane so that we don't run you know off into a ditch somewhere and with our retirement and we didn't track it\nSo by having a system of tracking it and ... and maintaining it and making sure that we're not you know overly spending but at the same time enjoying our retirement I Know that our clients feel really comfortable about that and I love sitting down on a regular reviews and going over that with them but you know what it took her on why\nIt took them calling in\nTo take an hour of their day and visit one of our neighborhood offices and let us do like complimentary review their situation\nWhere we sat down and we looked at their savings we looked at their retirement we looked at their Social Security numbers we looked at their expenses we looked as if there was a pension how much that was and we plug all of that into the software and say okay can I retire when I Want to retire\nAnd by sitting down and looking at everything holistically we can make sure all those bases are covered and then that then you can make that decision you can say well you know\nI think I still want to work but I sure do appreciate knowing I can retire if I Want to\nYou've got the power to retire when you want to retire not because you're worried whether or not you couldn't afford to retire

bit more anyway about what's in the food I put food and clothes or your eating and then what you need to do to make better choices because it's all about you and being healthy that's the whole shows about how to naturally\nGet you out and keep you well here's the thing\nWhen patients come in our offices were chiropractic team we have officers in Marietta Duluth and Stockbridge Atlanta area and patients coming our offices we if you have a picture of you have a bone out of place muscles bass and maybe your stomach spasm to push up the inter diaphragm you need us to do that\nYou need us out to the team of divert chiropractors to work on getting the the body back in place physically but from a nutrition standpoint\nYou have a hundred percent control over what you eat and you have to eat anyway so why not make a better choice and here's the kicker it is so much less expensive to\nEat the way that we're trying to teach you to eat then it as any other way so you'll save money you'll feel better you'll probably live longer you'll probably have a lot less diseases statistically you'll you'll have substantially less diseases you'll save a ton of money long term and short term on healthcare if nothing else and an food\nYour kitchen doesn't think it's easier to clean up there's no downside to eating a healthy diet except one and that one is a lot of those bad foods taste really good\nRemember those days it's been thirty two years I've been vegan plant based for thirty two years now not asking you to do that I I get you may not be ready for that if you already that's the ultimate goal\nBut when you start making these changes and you see the difference and people say wow you know you you have an age at all well made a little bit but you see younger\nAnd so there's no downside to doing that so let's talk about some gross things in grocery stores like hamburgers or dance I used to I remember hamburgers yeah what happens is unless you're getting a real high quality ground beef will say beef to start with many times they are mixing it with something called pink slime\nWhat pink slime is they'll take all the cheap cuts of meat a scrape the meat off bones into cartilage and things like that and they'll make it into like a basically a slurry and it's called pink slime to become spank and many times they'll use uh cleaners\nTo Joe here so glad we spend a little time together we're talking about gross things you find in the grocery store and I want you to understand when you're in the grocery store when you're picking up these products you go oh my God this is gross\nAnd they make it look pretty and that's another thing that sometimes to somebody asked me about bananas one time and uh they spray gas on those bananas or to make them raping\nAnd they pick 'em so green that they have to sprays at night nitrogen gas and not even sure I Can't remember the gases now if you if you if you know to call it and let me know and um so that's an issue but that's spring it on the banana but with meats and things that many times they'll add die to the meat to make it look right\nAnd so you just gotta be careful with that as well and it's I think it's another gas they can put on a beach to to make it look right as well\nUm so that's a little trick that has been done I'm not saying grocery stores do this but there has been some nefarious activity where meets about to expire they just you know spray down this gas make it look read and slap another ex expiration date on it so\nI'm not a fan of me and I understand you probably are and that's perfectly fine and I want to be your friend that I I I have one friend in my in my my world so\nUm so I totally get it\nIf you want to eat meat just make sure it's organic uh try to make better choices when it comes to what you're eating here want to talk about heavy metal\nYour oatmeal but first let's take a call if you have a question give us a call for for for for Dr Joey for for for for D. R. J. we that number by the way race or to my office when I'm not on the air so if you want to have a question make an appointment you could always do that raw and make your day better\nDoctors do a good evening [noise] um I have\nA little bit different question for you than the stuff that's in the grocery store and regarding um eczema that I've struggled with for a four or five years now on my hands my these arms\nYes and uh\nI've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on different ... humans visiting Germany colleges and uh I think I've just based on YouTube and some of your materials I I've kind of a self diagnosed it is uh like um either leaky gutter inflammation something like that\nAnd I'm starting to change my diet it's been um\nTwo or three months and I've uh I've done a lot of changes to my diet but I still really haven't seen any healing in that and uh so I just wanted to call about that and see if you got to be any advice on you know a nutrient or\nLike that ever I see a skin condition eczema or psoriasis I always think liver\nOr that's always my first thought and in fact if you even go on something like Web MD and look up ... and one at at first liver signs that'll come up liver issues is skin conditions itchy skin next semester eyes to things like that I'm so when it comes to that you got to take the stress off the liver so of course the seven deadly sins need to come out of die\nAnd take the stress off the liver so of course the seven deadly sins need to come out of died I mean surely their coffee so not official sweetener um you gotta get delivered he'll now the good news is with the liver is is the fastest healing organ in the body\nWe can remove about sixty Seventy percent of our liver and it grows back so and you survived so delivers really quick to heal which is good ah so what one thing I'd recommend you stay away from Ron is dairy products and that any dairy bread of butter cheese yogurt eggs ice cream anything that comes out of your end of a cow I Would stay away from\nThe second thing you've got to stay away from it all the wheat wheat barley and rice specifically as grains I'm because that can cause the inflammatory reaction and the guy has gluten which has elected and election collecting causes inflammatory reactions um but most people when they give up the wheat and dairy products start to see a change in in a couple of weeks it's not going to happen tomorrow\nUm and you see nice a nice things happen and that what you want to do is get some extra virgin coconut oil\nAnd rub that over the area several times a day actually it absorbed really quickly coconut oil\nAnd that will help it from an external problem but the problem isn't an external it's an internal problems is coming from the inside out\nSo by cleaning up the diet um that should help tremendously but cutting out the wheat and a dairy products can be the two things I really want you to shoot for\nOkay fair enough fair enough I can\nI ask another question based on what you were talking about a second ago about being vegan yes\nGo ahead I'm\nOn my other friends has encouraged me to come and go down to the pound has she has been on the same power so I guess that that you had been with uh the vegan diet or one of the challenges she ran into was indeed very active lifting weights things like that trying to get enough protein and the vegan diet\n[laughter] it has to happen or either Garrett [laughter] every\nEvery single salaries show is that you wrote the Internet as a vegan you buy only needs about eight to ten percent of its total caloric intake protein anything beyond that stress on the kidneys and deliver what do we have a problem with you probably live or issue or so a lower protein diet is actually better and in fact a lot of professional athletes are going ...\nUm yeah yeah no definitely yeah we've seen that happen\nAll the time professional athlete and it was just somebody who won like a a mega monster marathon or something like whatever it was like the highest sport ID I see new headlines all the time yeah and it's you know v Vietnam wins you know in record time smashes all records and everything a lot of professional athletes even football players are going to a plant based diet\nBecause more protein is not better\nThat's that's where everybody is wrong you know if I Need some protein to build muscle now you can only use so much of it uh I've been to begin thirty two years now I have a no no animal products and thirty two years I'm fine\nMuscle strength I got energy my brain works fine um so the thing is that everybody gets too much protein not quantity over quality I'd go I've never and all my thirty two years of being a nutritionist and a chiropractor I've ever seen somebody would have protein deficiencies and I've had diarrhea and vomiting or something like that\nSo uh you're perfectly fine you're going to get all the protein you'll ever need any plant based diet a promise\nCool [laughter] appreciate\nIt All right we're going to go to a man we got a few minutes here I'd or if you're if you're on hold keep holding folks Ross I see you're up there to uh if you have a question give us a call for for for for Dr Joe aid for for for for D.

E. and you can get through the studio now and if I'm not on the air that rings due to my office as\nI promised you about heavy heavy metal oatmeal okay sounds like it sounds like a band right\nA heavy metal oatmeal what happens is a lot of times if you make an I use oatmeal just as as a joke here but if you buy free sweet and foods\nMany times those pre sweet and foods are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup\nAnd its interests you've heard me talk about high fructose corn syrup in the past and like if you knew listener or you want to stay away from it because fructose has to be converted into glucose in your liver in order to be used as a fuel the body can't use fructose it has to be converted into usable form glucose in the process your body produces your gas it\nNow your gas it gets in your joints and it hurts\nThe chiropractor my team of doctors and I we look at pain patients not every day every minute of every day and so we want to give you the best chiropractic care we feel it's available we hope it's the best\nBut you have to help us and that's why every patient that comes in our office we do a nutritional work up as part of the protocol because if you're doing things like high fructose corn syrup or ... which has way more fructose and high fructose corn syrup the fructose converts into glucose and gets into your joints ... for those who wrote the glucose trade your Hassett your gas it gets in your joints and it hurts\nYour gas it prevents the body from producing nitric oxide nitric oxide opens up your blood vessels now one of our biggest most popular ... popular but we have one called Dr Joe's nitric oxide support which opens up your blood vessels\nThe brain few reproductive Oregon's nudge nudge wink wink you need that circulation and as you get older blood vessels become weaker and I've done many shows on this in the past it's on my website Dr Joe dot com\nBut the other thing we found that sixty five samples of high fructose corn syrup and found mercury in about a third of them that was three times higher than the average woman should consume in a day now\nYou shouldn't get so any mercury so I laugh when I read that statistic it's like no Mercury's zero consumption you should have none but what they called the allowable levels\nIn his ear oh consumption you should have none but what they called the allowable levels three times you allowable levels in high fructose corn syrup\nAnd one of every three products that you don't know where you're high fructose corn syrup is coming from so that's where I Want you to really stay away from the high fructose corn syrup for many reasons but I go to break if you have health care question give us call it for for for for Dr Joe\nMy website Dr Joe dot com lots of information air podcast we have well over a thousand hours apart cat there audio and video\nA follow us on Facebook follow sudden Instagram uh we live stream a lot of these shows and then we put them on a website too if you want to see them afterwards and if you want to make an appointment come see us for ... nutrition if you've ever been in a car accident if the car was damaged you would damage stop suffering folks that came back pain shoulder pain make the appointment Dr Joe dot com they don't go away we'll be right back [noise]\nW.

J. O. E. and the website of course his doctor Joe dot com lots of good information there and my blog is there you can send me questions to the website if you want but they might gross things in the grocery store\nToday how about shrimp I don't eat shrimp of course once again Moses said unlimited his donate Trump or pigs a food safety experts they say imported shrimp is about is dirty or as a food you can get and it's not hard to see when you consider what's happening in an antibiotic cleaning chemicals\nAre that are used in farm shrimp pen because they've ... cleaning chemicals to clean it out residue some ... toxic chemicals banned in the U. S. pieces of insects\nI saw one story I was it some way I don't want us to maybe Vietnam or somewhere and micro knees ya where they had a village where they had um uh they just flush the toilets and when is it a shrimp ... pond and that was part of the shrimp food\nAnd so if you're going to eat shrimp I don't think you should but if you're going to eat shrimp I'm going to strongly advise that you eat domestic shrimp because only about two percent of all the seafood imported into this country is inspected\nBut if you're going to do it at least do domestic most of the shrimp in this country has caught\nIn the Gulf of Mexico much better choice then going overseas so make sure if you're gonna eat seafood or specifically in this case shrimp and think about grocer things are just make sure that it's a local local but in the indigenous the United states\nUm I don't eat fish ... most fish has mercury and it especially farm raised fish if you're going to eat fish I recommend wild caught\nSo wild caught shrimp wild caught salmon if it's as a land tick salmon it's farm raised if it says Alaskan salmon it's wild caught\nSo that may be a little term because somebody sent me an email the other day about that and they said well I mean while quarter land accent no you're not [laughter] you lied or because the wording means a lot in this business and the food business um and that's just my opinion what what you do is always up to you I can never force you to do anything\nBut if you have to eat anyway\nWhy not make better choices why not make less expensive choices why not make healthier choices\nAnd when you're hungry remember you're not hungry for food you're hungry for nutrition\nAnd so if you give your body lots of nutrients you're going to eat a lot less food and that's one of the easiest ways to lose weight is starting high nutrition\nLess food and that's one of the easiest ways to lose weight is starting high nutrition food things like Dr Joe super green Dr Joseph central source loaded with nutrients\nGet messages all the time from people all over the world order this stuff and I said doc I Can't afford not to take this stuff in the first time I got that message I didn't understand it\nAnd if the dock when I eat when I take that it took me awhile took a couple of weeks for the body to readjust so I don't eat as much I'm not hungry so saving money on food so I'm saving money by buying your products I said that's pretty cool I more gross things in the grocery store Mercer\nHard to treat antibiotic resistant infection not a joke man\nOr these

low grade antibiotics especially of bacteria in this case or they can mutate\nAnd they mutate and you take mutate now we've got these diseases that nobody can fix and in fact I was a guest on uh my
