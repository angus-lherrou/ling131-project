discuss this information with your own physician or health care provider to determine what is right for you\n[noise]\nHave a doctor Joe here\nDr Joe here so glad we could spend a little time together [noise] interesting show today my father died of a heart attack and I know a lot of you had people die of dive heart attacks and your life\nI Want to talk today about what really causes hardening of the arteries and that's one of the ways to hearken stop if they get clogged up and what really causes and you've heard about it hardly ... a plaque building up in the arteries wide as it happened\nThat's the key what I always try to do it all my shows will give you the why we want to explain to you a\nLogic 'cause I just tell you how ... and and as a chiropractor we take X rays on our patients often and [noise]\nTwice a day maybe maybe three times a day we find hardly the arteries that's how common it is and it blows my mind because patients come in and I'll say you have how many of the order hardy and come back arteries I didn't know that\nMy cardiologist never told me that my internist never told me that and I showed them on the X rays and they say well there it is it's not a lie and every now and then several times a year but not every day we find one that's so bad it was called the dissecting you ought to Kenya with them and if it's over five point five centimeters a fifty five millimeters\nIt's a surgical case and sometimes we find them real close to that and we say you need to go to your surgeon now\nAnd they always say but I feel great doc and I'm fine I got an appointment six months no no no now you have to go and I'll call their doctor and I'll say listen you gotta get Bob in right away we have a five point five dissecting would again you're ...\nOh yes get them on the phone we need to get 'em in right away and inevitably there cardiologist whoever says well how did you find that because we've been treating this person for years\nThey never looked they ... they check the heart rate and they check the pulse and they check the agency and um they'll they'll they'll check to see if this is talk of information in the body\nBut they don't do a basic scan like an ultrasound an X ray and so when they see it then I have to talk to the patient say listen this is what we have to do to reduce the blocking and we do that by reducing the inflammation\nSo what happens is and and the number one reason or number one drug people come into the U.S is blood pressure medication the diabetes\nAnd cholesterol is right up there and we have a drug called stat and drug and I'm not saying don't take your sat and drugs please understand that if you're taking sat and drugs the goal of this that and drugs is to stop your liver from producing cholesterol\nThe cholesterol and your blood is too high so we want to bring down cholesterol makes sense and we give you a pill that for just off the production of it that should lower your cholesterol usually works pretty well some of the problems that occur with that the same ends on the same area of the liver the enzymes that produce the cholesterol also produce something called co enzyme Q. ten\nDoctor show I'm busy\nMom knew Ninety five and a um seven fifty don't you have to be a factor\nJoe so glad you're here I Do appreciate you taking time out of your day everybody's real busy uh important topic today talking about how the arteries what causes it will cause it's lacking the form and why does that eventually can break off and cause heart attacks and strokes and a lot of it back to almost all of it the hard part is self induced\nYou did it to yourself so why would you do something that you know has a very very high likelihood of causing real serious damage and maybe even death\nAnd the only reason I can think is that you don't know that\nFamous guy once said forgive them for they know not what they do and that's so true every day patients tuned in to our website Dr Joe dot com and we have well over a thousand hours a pod cast their audio video and people walk download our shows listen talk shows and now they know what up to that point they didn't know\nSo if you don't know you don't know what to do about it so we talked about bad fats and how those can oxidized probably an saturated fats and those are usually I'm the fat that are also high and something called omega ... fatty acids\nThe corn oil the soil because all the oil and the omega ... fatty acids cause inflammation\nOmega three fatty acids bring down the inflammation and in America will in the world was supposed to have about a one to one ratio one omega three to one omega six maybe to omega six just want to make history most people in this country major majority of them are about twenty omega six is two one omega three\nAnd so we just live innocent flame disease state you don't have to do that anymore because I'm teaching you how did not do that others are taking calls you have a question aid for for for for Dr Joe here in Studio and we can get you on the air that number by the way things are in my office when I'm not on the air\nSarah how can make your day better [noise] I think I can you know there are a common interests\n\nWere dropped her she disappear or therapies that listening I saw your questions about acid reflux and that's a very good question\nI'm Talking about this every show the number one reason we see patients in our clinics in the Atlanta area of officers in Marietta Duluth and Stockbridge is for pain were chiropractic team neck pain back pain shoulder pain arm pain car accidents I've never seen a car accident ever where the car was damaged and the occupants warrant\nYou are not tougher than your car so if the cars damage unique get effect so if you most of the reasons we see ... number one reason is for pain than ever to reason we see patients is for acid reflux\nAnd people come in our office would ask her or there's oh stairs back let's get back on your there Sara\nHey I just wanted to tell you that I have\nHey I just wanted to tell you that I have had said reflects well on taking something for it but it only makes the no as that don't have the what the very dictation Ralph whatever sure but I have a lot of pain ... ear like\nLike on Santa my faith shore\nAnd then at times in the morning I Can't even hardly like Muslims in the upper part of my legs hurt real bad\nShore okay well so the acid reflux is usually worse in the morning because when you're standing up gravity is pulling your stomach down and what as a reflex is you have a sheet of muscle called your diaphragm you have a whole diaphragm into food drops through that whole the whole closes it falls into your stomach you digest the food and you pass it on the small intestine\nWith patients would acid reflux heartburn bourbon gas bloating I was a guest on the show earlier today a chronic cough a inflamed a vocal chords the stomach is pushing up through the diaphragm an acid is coming up into the throat\nAnd so what we need to do is physically in most cases massager pulled his stomach down away from the die for him and with my patients my team of doctors and we check them about eighty to eighty five percent of the patients we check have some form of this so we need to physically move the stomach back to its normal position\nAnd that's the key 'cause you're taking medication to treat the symptoms\nBut you're not getting to the cause ...\nThat sort of normal ... year old shot them at face\nYeah if it's on the left side is going up what's called the Vegas nerve because the Vegas nerve controls your digestive system and so we can shoot all the way up into your head along the side of your face absolutely um but it'd be a good idea to get that fixed because if you don't it's going to lead to a it could lead to things like we got syndrome 'cause you're not a breaking down your proteins properly 'em\nAll sorts of problems along those lines so you get it fixed come see us if you're the Atlanta area come see us we'd love to check it if it's there will tell you if it's not we're going to tell you that too We're not gonna lie to you so it's a pretty cell process okay\nThank you I appreciate it another call the call and you take Medicare patients and supplemental insurance the answer is yes we do accept Medicare or one of the few doctors I think left in the world is still takes Medicare and we take most insurance is now if you come see us this is a common question\nMany times you don't see how many times you may not see our name on your insurance list\nThat's because you may have what's called out of network benefits\nAnd many times you out of network benefits are better than he ended up work benefits\nAnd I got to say this I got to get on my soapbox year when people ask me questions about insurance don't let your insurance company dictate your treatment\nPeople say well it's not covered by my insurance I Can't get that surgery I had one of my co workers asked me today uh she had diarrhea for four weeks and now she said well I don't know what to do and they recommended like a ... a bowl of calling us could be well my insurance doesn't cover it well if you need it\nDon't let the insurance company dictate your treatment plan because their job is to not pay your bills their jobs to save money and the less they pay you the more money they make its business it's\nCapitalism but that doesn't mean you should let that dictate your treatment and I always tell people it's very rarely that people don't get treatment in our office but if they say what are you going to do if you don't get treatment here ... and so you're just going to suffer oh no I think you should\nIt should be affected not suffer because the problem is it's it's probably gonna get worse and worse supplements that's why we try to keep us something that costs so low and in fact I was talking to a couple of my producers before the show and the super crazy essential source they said are a fourth of the cost of a similar product that's being sold out in California\nIn a multi level marketing group and they said ours is as good or better than theirs\nAnd it's a fracture the price and we try to keep up prices on supplements as low as possible so you can afford them and the minimum amount of nutrients you should be taken every day it is Dr Joe super greens and Dr Joe the central source I take it every day\nSometimes twice a day if I have a couple of radio shows to do if I have a live appearance by by the lectures I'll take a double dose one in the morning one in the evening\nSo those this up at the super crazy central source there on my website Dr Joe dot com if you're not going to do anything else please do that\nBecause we're talking about hardy of the arteries today and the reasons the arteries can get plaque buildup is because free radicals that kind of like pac man can eat away and oxidized oils which can cause an inflammatory reaction the way we fight free radicals his number one we don't produce them\nSo by eating a good diet thing keeping the body's stress free\nIs a very good way to do it but then taking antioxidants anti accidents neutralize free radicals before they can do their damage and where do we get antioxidants from fruits vegetables nothing seat so the super crazy essential source or an amazing source\nOf anti accidents and that's why I take 'em at least once a day but we have to stop cut down the production of free radicals\nAnd so when it comes to your diet ... please I'm going to ask you stay away from the Polly an saturated fats the corn oil the soil the vegetable oils that can all oils because of the high content of omega ... fatty acids\nAll the oils because of the high content of omega ... fatty acids and in fact when you get into what we what are called black belt nutrition\nWhat I teach you on the show as always round bell nutrition could use a black belt stuff today when you're ready to go to black belt nutrition you want to stay away from most process oils anyway was whether it's olive oil coconut oil it's still process it's not the whole food\nBoth go to break lines are lighting up if you have a health care question give us a call for for for for Dr Joe a for for for for ...\nMy website if you have questions if you want to read my blog if you want to\nUm follow

for for Dr Joe and do your favorite tell your friends about the show don't go anywhere ever going to be right back [noise]\nA lot of people have life insurance through work is a great short term benefit but is it enough\nA lot of those policies only cover a year's salary\nNot enough to pay off mortgages or send kids to college with things life insurance is meant for that's where solar quote comes in to quote is your personal life insurance got multiple quotes to find you the best price from the highly rated companies they represent\nJoined us thirty six and an excellent how figure and a half million dollar policy for under twenty dollars a month life insurance about peace of mind about a false sense of security which are you getting calls select quote now and one eight hundred eight eight five forty six forty six\nThat's one eight hundred eighty five forty six forty six or get started at ... dot com one eight hundred and eighty five forty six forty six so like we shop you say the full details on the example policy of quote unquote are complex commercials are quite clear depending on your health insurance company ever facts ...\nMy friends like you I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women to protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends with me Henry\nAre holding their fifth annual military salute give away the winner will receive a major hindrance retriever utility vehicles that's right a brand new read my hindrance retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my hand and you could be next\nAnd when that inflammatory action the Kurds don't go macro fascist come in ... just about how you want to say it and they gobble up the oxidized oils\nAnd that's that starts to create this inflamed area where the body starts laying down cholesterol to encapsulate the inflammation\nThe body is protecting itself it's very good\nSo the oxidized oils are caustic and they kill a lot of the macro phages which then when they die they can release the toxic chemicals they have inside and that kind of like a garbage truck\nAnd those types of chemicals and are released again so you kind of get caught in this cycle and if the stable plaque if the if the body lays down his cholesterol around it and it's stable that's great but if that cholesterol becomes loosened breaks off that's what we call a blood clot and once again we said earlier goes to the heart is a heart attack goes to the brain it's a stroke\nSo you got problems there so it's a plaque fails to in case the information that's when it starts to break off and cause problems the oil is so caustic it triggers blood in that area\nToo quietly and now we start building up this the the the narrowing of the blood vessels\nAnd that's not a good thing so what can cause this problem we talked about free radicals where the free radicals come from how 'bout infections obvious infections but also sub clinical infections which is a clinical effects you're not aware of it\nIn fact I had a root canal done many years ago and I've got a little metal rod up and my two ... you know in into my gum and if you take an extra you can see them it's real clear\nBut the problem with those are that when you put that metal bar and there there's little side canals and your tooth where the roots were and no side canals can harbor anaerobic bacteria anaerobic means they live without oxygen\nAnd so you have this low level sub clinical infection all the time\nAnd so that's what I have in my mouth and all of you who have had to have a root canal put in and in a in a two foot and you have this sub clinical infection all the time and so to some political inflection infection can create free radicals\nFree radicals again to like pacman through things or immune diseases can cost free radicals and that's a big problem too and so if you have lupus if you have to defy burrows is a dead body can be reducing these free radicals exposure to pesticides\nPesticides and herbicides herbicide kill plants by the way and pesticide kill bugs can cause for radical reactions exposure to toxic heavy metals mercury aluminum lead you need zero amounts of heavy metal in your body\nAnd what happens is when they get into the body some people can get them out of the system some people can't and if the body has these\nHeavy metals in there it can create these free radicals I just take some more callers if you have a question give us a call for for for for Dr Joe unless I can make your day better\nAt low\nI can make your day better at low hello\nYes Dr you'll hear that Lisa Lisa I'm Sorry I said I'll lease to okay got they got so happy you're calling I'm doing well\nUm I was a well no I I had a kidney disease and he said I have to go on dialysis and I was wondering what I could do not have to go on it\nOK well a couple of things that I you know when I first started in practice thirty four years ago I hardly ever saw patients with kidney disease and now I see them sometime I Want to watch a week it's very very common so a couple of things I'd recommend number one you got to get on a low protein diet\nLow protein most of us taking way too much protein protein has to be filtered out through your kidneys yeah so plant based proteins much better choice an animal based protein yeah how how much protein\nSorry if you're eating mostly plants you don't have to worry about\nUh-huh sneeze coming on trying not to sneeze you're on your um so if you're eating plants you don't have to worry about it um I I I've been I've been plant based now for thirty two years I'm fine my muscle mass is fine my heart's fine so you don't need more protein need less but if you eat and eat\nI Would definitely cut out the meat uh-huh absolutely very very hard protein to break down and digest\nA second thing is uh you want to make sure that the nerves applied to the kidneys are working and this is the one thing that we as chiropractors can offer\nThe nerves applied to the kidneys for a woman is I kinda right below the bra strap right in that area uh-huh that's the nerves supplied it goes into the kidney so if you have a pinched nerve there that can adversely be affecting your kidneys and then you want to make sure you eating lots of\nNutrients like super greens and a central source salads
