I don't know why called ... that aren't organism but that's what it is many European countries recognize the dangers and have rejected these crops\nAs have most African countries so if you go to grocery store in Europe and one of my weird things whenever I'm Out of the country I like to go to grocery stores I like to see what's there at the of chemical\nEspecially if it's in a country that's a not not as well developed to go into stores I just find it fascinating but you'll find about eighty percent of the products you're on the shelves in the state you're not going to find\nIn other countries and one of the reasons if they ban genetically modified foods and one of the reasons there is a lot of foods have high fructose corn syrup in it\nWhich not only is bad for you and can cause issues with liver but it can also uh it's made with genetically modified court so like soda for example if you get soldiers that you like here in the states many times if you go to other countries do not sweetened with high fructose corn syrup their sweetened with sugar\nAnd in fact one of the major soda companies now and I I got to give them kudos I think it's a good thing or the light brand of beer soda and it's sweet and ... and half\nSugar no not happy with the sugar but at least it's not high fructose corn syrup which makes me sort of happy I think we're kind of going in the right direction there I'm not sure\n[noise] so that's why you're not going to see eighty percent of the products that you'll see in the states in other countries and if you do see the same brand ingredients are to say\nSo a lot of countries in Europe and Africa or little little head to head of the curve here and I'm very happy to see that and I had a patient come up to me the other day I did a live remote with one of my friends here to station and he came up to the doctor Dr listen to your show he says and I gave up all my week and I felt great he says I went to Europe and I treated myself I was in Italy and I didn't have any reaction\nWhen eight week well\nCould be it's a different type of wheat first of all 'cause we've we haven't a genetically modified wheat we've hybrid icy and also many times they'll spray life has said on the wheat products\nHere to states supposed to go to break if you have health care question aid for for for for Dr Joe aid for for for for the R.

I'll give you a ... I don't I don't remember\nSaying that but I I I Will accept you okay nobody but the point I was trying to make was that radio in general uh people are under are underpaid I think that but I Do you think people are underpaid tradition absolutely they are\nThe only people that make a lot of money or the people right at the top ... you know that going yeah yeah exactly right because you love and exactly right exactly right I'm OK surveying yeah third\nThing is a piece for Asian people started migrating to the United states\nOkay yeah ... Jewish people opening stores and bad neighborhoods OK okay they Jewish people are the most educated hard working\nA well that's nice of you know family\nOriented people ... and because of that uh you know they would open businesses anywhere just to have a bit so they go into war ghettos in New York New enjoy\nAnd they'd open up a little a convenience store or OK okay and that's just before the the Koreans started doing that the Chinese\nAnd you know the the black folks\nThey didn't really liked that because the prices were high they don't understand it costs more to do business in a bad day for her\nAnd the resentment started with that\nAnd then the other part of the bigger part of the resentment of that is they know and even though that Jewish people lights you best is when they can assume they only really try to buy\nWhen they consume they only really try to buy from other Jewish people they'll take the money and and the ghetto but they won't spend their money and they\nGot on the ... ... people off like a okay skate and markets better off for a long long time\nMayor enough I think when it started people\nGrow put that little kids go up and and over pay you know pay a dollar for a soda convenience store it and they hear their parents say yeah that show's those Jews rips off but we don't have a choice to remember that yeah\nAnd I guarantee you that this not job from Pittsburgh and\nGot to got to bad end of a song type\nA transaction or a couple of transactions from a Jewish person yeah something had happened ...\nBlue blue is shop and he couldn't take it anymore now it might not have been a Jewish person's fault mhm but he shaved that oh once again the Jewish guy got me gotcha enable gasket okay do you think that's a plausible explanation for what happened\nI'm trying to understand why I see so I hear I hear your complaints a lifestyle the money or the the are going into the guy I understand what you're saying you\nSee any validity and how that creates\nI ... I can understand why ... why couldn't understand why why why thinking that ... can create hatred of Jewish people I I have a tough time taking the next step Joe were saying well uh I had a bad a business dealing with a Jewish person so I Want to shoot up a synagogue that that's where I lose well of\nCourse yeah yeah it's only ... you know one or two sure one last job in the whole world that no but I I got\nThis feeling a lot of people feel it but in today's environment you can even come out and say that yeah but a lot of people feel that and you know\nIt keeps Jewish people from really being in the mainstream a lot of time and that you know Jewish people like to live in their own neighborhoods because they have their synagogues air and they are\nBut traditional like oh they don't really trying to get in for a second let me get it for a second they haven't really tried to make sure\nWe haven't tried to assimilate okay Joe I'm gonna let you go I really do appreciate the call that was a that was valuable information\nUm I I'm not I'm not going to break\nThis down line by line um but but the third part you you talked about and that's pretty that's historically with any immigrant group so whether it was the Italians the Irish the Mexicans the Jews um when they when they came to this country\nThey all live to gather and opened up a you know stores in their neighborhood and that's\nYou know if you went to you off of Ellis Island the Irish all moved to one section in New York and they all stay there and you had Irish on bars in Irish own stores that that's just how it works is you you congregate with people you know\nAnd and you wrote in from there and Germans did the same thing exactly\nRight um but I I think you have a valid point I think a\nPart of the Jewish culture not so much now but back in the day was a open your be your own business you know be your own boss kind of thing\nOr that's how you make it great in America and I think historically that has as proven to be true and I think you've seen Indian immigrants and as he mentioned Korean immigrants really latching onto that\nUm instead of working for someone you work for yourself and you open up a small store or a dry cleaners or a nail salon or whatever but ... Joe I I truly mean that I Do appreciate the or the inside their um Daniels in Marietta Daniel welcome to the mark M. show\nHey thank you for taking my uncle I mean let me explain your how uh\nI mean ... any ... generally my grandmother in Mexico growing up but may need the concept of a Jewish people and make the choice eighty five percent capital ...\nAnd I was raised in a capitalistic ah I'm home a ... please don't ask questions your capital IQ that's it but when my grandmother used to tell me 'cause I work in I was very little\n... as you say how much money you made a temp and so it's okay a bite me they've now I'm not going to do anything I'm going to save money\nDo you are you Jewish away\nAnd then and then uh I remember I was a fight it when my sister and I\nBeat all my sisters don't speak of people don't use either Jewish people we don't use those Chrysler and he wasn't the cross in may and then they ... people killed cry you know I go okay so then uh if I was a you'd probably like\nTo save money I was a ... if I have a when it to be ... if I I mean everything ... they greedy side of Jewish people\nAll eyes a lot of stereotypes you back there there's I mean and vain I I learned more about Jewish people here that they used to work for advantage radio here in America made a lot of ah based shows are owned by Jewish people and I suppose that when I read I have these people and how they describe it yeah we need we need to do there are people who they are\nIt's quite a bit yeah we need we need to be ... will they are that didn't matter the relations I think ... that have these things like that because there's ...\n... that's that's possible and I think a lot of it and and you I think you realize now Daniel as an adult that a lot of that um was was out of ignorance you know just if you don't know you know if if you don't know any Jewish people and and thankfully long gory you now know at least one or two large house\nUh that that once you gain that experience you can kind of break free uh\nFrom those stereotypes\nSo I appreciate that Daniel thank you buddy a Gary's next in the marketing so hey Gary\nHey buddy I'm Glad to get a ... just get right to\nThe meat of it okay Yes sir okay\nThe Jews are how do you ever heard of the slave labor in your\nFavor ain't fear here was not you know I've never heard of that now\nIn other words what that means is you can have paper\nSometimes we'll just have to look people and it just the way the the the cars a level and it's not clear okay gotcha okay yeah I understand in a in a while you said they raised it okay I get it now\nAnd that's kind of like what happened with the lord and the Jews okay the Jews are guys is apple of guys\nThey were his chosen people mhm\nOkay and and he gave ... ... and he made it Hubble was able to him Isaac you Jacob yeah\nDoes he will leave less you but at the same time\nYou gave them also responsibility to be example but the whole week mhm okay uh so by the natural you go okay they didn't really ... response was lord\nSo the expectations that were set out for the Jewish people we've not met and and that you think breeds among the or the ... I don't listen I Can't speak for the entire religion but I certainly haven't met expectations are I'll take", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mark Arum Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "29"}
