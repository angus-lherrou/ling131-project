right place don't sell everything\nPull back to the right place before we really go into something like a better market if that were to happen\nNobody knows but it's now is a great time to be ready for it real quick what are some of the factors you think that are leading to the declines in the markets gathers all sorts of things going on so one of them would be you know Trump and his friends would say it's a fed raising interest rates that certainly as an impact people don't like Trump are saying well hey it's it's it's ... well that has an impact\nBut overall there's just the reality to that we've had ten years of the market being up a drop is not unexpected and it's really how you respond to that drop it could be a great thing for you\nIn the long term you could ask Chris Burns your

I had this fantasy world you know I could I could disappear to my fantasy world and be the happiest kid in the ... you know whether it's pretending I'm playing center field for the Yankees or I'm quarterbacking in the soup you know you just escaped to a phase or like uh\nI I missed that as an adult I don't do that very much\nOn occasion I'll fantasize about something even thought about baseball [laughter] um\nWell you know what I'm saying like we we missed as adults that that magical time where\nYou just you just close your eyes and you're like oh yeah I could see myself baton lead off and you know ripping a double it is you know and like my parents are in the stands and they go like that was that was a great part of childhood and I'm sure like Deb fantasize about being a\nA star rock star you know exactly like you can close your eyes at eight years old picture yourself at the at the ... you know ... or whatever [laughter] you know you're a near the lead singer of kiss or whatever like I don't I'm [laughter] whatever your fish she fits in fact that like that\nWhen he did you not have those fantasies as a kid like you you just fantasize about things that that\nWhenever I was a dancer for a long time so probably like dancing in the New York ballet academy or something okay yeah\nChuck in in Montana growing up what what's the fantasy what is it a ten year old truck fantasize about [noise]\nClipping that the the the she was ... or whatever the hell are you talking [laughter] to make him realize that dream you didn't have to say no I didn't have parents like when you're a kid what were you what would you fantasize about I'll probably just like play in major league baseball yeah I played a lot of it but I was about it I I didn't have [noise]\nI've tried to have a vivid imagination now knows All right so here's one again this is a fantasy world was a kid playing a cowboys and Indians yeah like I did that and and connect I remember my parents got me this I'm like is it a vintage toy gun ... it was like an old a revolutionary\nGun ... it was like an old a revolutionary rifle and it was metal and what I loved that thing I remember being in my backyard and pretending that like that the Indians were coming out of the woods and [noise]\nLike [laughter] and stuff like that I'm assuming you don't see that in Montana right cowboys and Indians Longoria grown up\nObviously coming to you [laughter] you don't need them to enemy no longer with [laughter]\nWhen you're growing up I was the one of the country for yeah that was the heart of a setting out across the river was a dream that they had to have them that seven out learning how to swim that seven thousand person care of and um or no the other side from that what what what did you what would you fantasize oh basketball like Michael Jordan a lot so so you're like you know taking\nThe last shot yeah definitely see we I think that we need that more as adults we need that fantasy once in a while I'm not saying she\nDaydream all the time you know while you're doing show prep for the marketing [laughter] you don't get it for ... days I mean do you pay your opening for Pearl Jam and better and better [laughter] that's not okay [laughter]\nUm but I I mean I Can't think the only time I fantasize really in my life as an adult is is the time when I by the time when I buy the mega million stick it to the dry\nBecause there's nothing else to fantasize about we know but we don't take the time to do it because we're too busy were like All right I've got to pay bills I got to go to work I'm going to make dinner I'm going to take the dog out I got to do laundry now you have to do real life yeah real\nLife but but I think and I I mean this is just a theory I'm throwing out there but I think our lives would be more enjoyable if we if we took five minutes out of every day and maybe that's what part of um\nWhat does that think people do meditation maybe that's what meditation is they're just fantasizing while [laughter] it's all there yeah and I think so like seriously so\nToday at at ten thirty am I bought those twenty tickets and then I go to bed at like you know I'm In bed thirty minutes later and as of drifting off to sleep on like All right do I buy a beach house do I ... you know [laughter]\nIt was it was nice to escape reality in for two dollars that's not a bad thing to to go to sleep with a smile on my face going\nOh man All right what am I going to ... well I'm going to have one million dollars right away and it's going to blow I'm going to go bananas with one million dollars you know I went through a party and I'm going to bite everyone that I like and I'm going to specifically tell the people I don't like you can't come [laughter] yeah yes yeah\nOften at a company wide email these ... people are invited to my mega millions party the if you're not on this list I don't like\nYou I think it's better if you actually sent out the list of people who
