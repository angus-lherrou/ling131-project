with us for a while thanks for staying with us and\nWe're talking today about gross things you find in a grocery store kind of a cool topic isn't it um and there's a lot of gross things in a grocery store and and and we've talking before about something called ... a ... a chemical and it acts like estrogen when it gets into the body it's called an endocrine disruptor and most of us don't need more estrogen we need less estrogen\nBecause estrogen growth hormone\nEstrogen could counteract testosterone testosterone you think about testosterone as the hormone or as your muscle building hormone or your sex drive hormone absolutely that's what it does we talking about building muscle not just your biceps and your triceps how about your colon\nHow about your heart how about your blood vessels all of these are muscles\nAnd so when you started putting these these foreign these these you know estrogen foreign legs you know phobia fewer foreigners you know estrogen foreign estrogen into the body they can be two or three hundred times stronger than human estrogen really causing adverse effects in the body and blowing out your immune system and blowing out your\nHormones just and so\nThis would always a big issue and its use a lot now in Cannes they line cans with it and you'll see baby products now BPA free which is wonderful I'm so glad we finally got the message out to that um friend of mine I was there the other day and they have little tiny baby and they said okay time to feed her and they took a plastic bottle\nWith formula put it in the microwave and\nThat's a great line for ten thousand maniac song on the line is he's your kid do as you've seen fit so I'm not here to tell anybody how to raise their children um so I keep my mouth shut\nAnd but it drives me insane because I'm not a fan of microwave in any way shape or form I've done many shows on microwaves in the past but never ever put plastic in a microwave don't use your microwave ever unless you're gonna put your sponge and it's really good at the end of the day if you have a sponge it's full of viruses germs bacteria fungus throw it in the microwave for a minute to make sure it's wet so doesn't catch fire\nAnd um it'll kill off the viruses germs bacteria\nBut if you put plastic in the microwave it will leach some of that plastic into the food and you had a zero need and your dietary requirements for ...\nSo a lot of cans of have this from LA and if you're starting to see more and more products thing BPA free some of them tried getting sneaky any sort of ... bbs in their personal asked as opposed to dismantle a which is bad for other reasons and I hope that\nPractice has stopped I don't have any documentation either way on that ah but that's pretty gross because it can cause abnormal cell growth BPA exposure is very dangerous it can cause abnormal development of reproductive organs behavior problems in children cardiovascular disease metabolic changes or insulin resistance in which can lead to diabetes\nSo please please please please if you're gonna do canned foods especially acidic foods like tomatoes I'd rather see you get it and glass or make sure it's BPA free now a lot of organic products have gone BPA free\nFactor Joe here so what are you there because we're talking today fun thing gross things you find in a grocery store I feel a play on words we have there on if you're not following us on Facebook and Instagram please do that because we live stream a lot of our shows we video and we take those videos and put them on my\nThat because we live stream a lot of

we have a new social media groups and the more we can get this word out so we need lots of follower so please do that are also said that your email address\nBecause we set out to a newsletter about once a week and it's a lot of good information on there and a lot of that information you're not going to get it anywhere else will have some time special so the supplements or are we have maybe something a grand opening in one of our offices or something along those lines and you're going to get that if you send us email address it's and and the website you can send it to us on his doctor Joe ... dot com\nSo this one I have to answer because I got a lot more to talk about what's gross in the grocery store Rhonda who they are you are how can we make your day better\nThey got to go yes said\nSomething that you were talking about before the break if you think about that journey on all the products that we pick up and can't handle at the grocery store oh yeah back on the shelf and you don't think about that you know some sense though it had those little handy wound pitching wind down\nYour your cart can end up happening carts and buggies and stuff where but anyway I'm not when they're cold snap and ... and up on it are there any specific um black cat supplements vitamins that we should be taken to help our interests and before we catch the flu or severe cold\nYou know when it comes to cold and flu season and I'm ... I'm Amazed we got this far into the showdown of asking that question we usually get it right away or the answer is a resounding yes round and last year I mean the flu season was so bad people dying and I was the worst ever and you know right around and leave the country I mean it was crazy I didn't even have a sniffle\nAnd the reason is you've got to keep your immune system strong now we all have flu viruses I have it in my throat right now Garrett sitting next to me as an his throat Ahmad has it ah but everyone has it um so what do we do to keep the immune system strong several things number one uh I take five thousand international units of vitamin D every day\nI take it from fall to spring now in the summer I'm outside a lot I don't necessarily take it as much but five thousand units if you go to my website Dr Joe dot com we have a liquid vitamin D it also has vitamin K too and it which most of us get no cake to in our diet we need that for bone health uh I take five drops of that every single day\nAnd you should too okay well I'm not\nI'm not a prescription that eight thousand units wants to wait\nSure and that's vitamin K ... vitamin D to me\nThat vitamin D to vitamin D to have to be converted into vitamin D three so my thought process is the reason is prescription is it's it's synthetic and we can put a patent on it and I I'm I'm a capitalist I think everybody should make a living but vitamin D three is the form that your body needs he can only absorb so much of anything\nWhether it's water or vitamin D so fifty thousand I use\nI find my patients do a lot better myself as well taking five thousand every day of vitamin D three exist already informed that your body needs so that's my opinion on that and get 'em ... always consult your medical doctor major prescription I never want to take you off your medications but that's what I Do\nUh we I take Dr Joe's optimal probiotics\nBecause the probiotics eighty percent of your digestion of your immune system is in your colon she got to make sure you have good bacteria\nI take of course super breeze and essential source everyday that that goes without saying I take adrenal support because the adrenal glands helped produce anti inflammatory score profit landings which helps control information\nAnd so that's a a active step proactive step is uh the ... the ... three the probiotic the super breezy a central source and you'd renal support now on a a a a ... not to do a passive thing you want to do you got to stay away from sugar\nAnd when I say sugar breads cookies cakes donuts pastas if you haven't read or one of my books one book I wrote a it's called a prescription for dream house and that's on the website all my other book um\nSugar will blow out your immune system and when we eat the most sugar drunk cold and flu season\nHalloween and Thanksgiving and cookies and parties and cakes and drinks and and then Christmas comes along and then you get drunk on New Year's eve and Christmas and New Year's day and you\nGot to stay away from the sugars bread cookies cakes donuts pastas because those are the sugars that you just put 'em in your body gonna blow your immune system it just is what it is and then sleep is very important to you got to get enough rest and\nSo keeping the body hydrated or making sure drinking lots of water a T throughout the week throughout the day um and then the supplements and no sugar and chances are very very good oh one more thing I'm Glad I just thought about this new research out\nNutritional yeast also call brewer's yeast nutritional east they did studies on children they gave them a quarter of a teaspoon of nutritional use everyday reduced their risk of flew by about thirty percent\n\nYeah would you take that in a powder form or how\nHow you could put you put on a powder I use it every put it on salad soup tend to be savory so the cost to do that to help reduce flu and children\nFour cents a day while\nNutritional you should be part of everybody's diet especially in the winter\nSome nutritional you should be part of everybody's diet especially in the winter months um when it's cold and flu season so you can do that and nutritional used to get any grocery store and I use it every day and all of the\nFlavor of nothing else I just love the flavor too so they go okay I could have done a whole three hours on that one right\nSo in nutrition research is just so cool that came out I just read a couple of weeks ago and I I I did a report on in fact I was the gift that my friend Belinda show a couple of weeks ago and we did a whole hour on nothing but uh you know keeping the immune system strong nutritional ... is just so big and nobody talks about it and get about four cents a day\nHow ridiculous the easy is that that's pretty cool stuff so anyway we're talking about it and taste great exactly I mean I have nothing else I use it 'cause it tastes great so and that's all on my website Dr Joe dot com for an archive radio shows a nutritional used that we don't have a doctor Joe's nutritional east but any grocery store any health food store would would carry it helps with so I left if there's a health food section what's\nThe rest of the store ... and they think about so excited about gross things at the grocery store if you have a question give us a call a for for for for Dr Joe and that numbering sort

I'm Wondering on her on a bus or Deborah in Mali yeah luckily someone brought in from out of yeah but you didn't make those right now now now did where did you get them from I got him from Texas\nThose or Texas yeah ... yeah and did you make that lead in cake also of course not who made who brought in LA here no I haven't been there since It's MORNING It's MORNING high that's fine\nCake doesn't go bad does it look histories this next in the marketing show held Lucas\n[noise] hey what's going on mark how are you sir I'm good and plenty to talk to you know like ... what's going on\nWell not much first off or sorry to hear about the guy that got shot this morning after a while so fully goes through and everything's good with him\nNo doubt um [noise]\nI guess man I could say I'm I mean I can I say I'm I'm One of the great so I got a seven years under my belt that are the same store now for ...\nAt a waffle house yeah so are you a cook\nI did it oh man I no longer there I'd I'd gone to bigger and better things but I mean I had fun with a man I take pride in it and a seven years at the same store\nHeavily bound and ice let me ask you a question because this this always baffles me how do the cooks and waffle house remember the orders\nBecause we go to the nicest restaurants you know the best chefs in the world they're not you know the waiters aren't shot in the orders Adam they have something to look at how do waffle house cooks remember the orders when there shouted at him\nIt's real simple man they got a a good marketing systems so basically it's just like having a ticket next year I'm everything is marked on the plates so everything has you know it means something so basically all you gotta do is look down the line\nYour thing has you know it means something so basically all you gotta do is look down the line and look at the plate and you know exactly what goes on there\nSo give me an example so long gory orders 'em a cheese omelet with bacon sausage and country ham and uh and white toast but how do you mark that plate\nWith a man that's a difficult one but not so I so jelly horizontal on the middle west side of the plate with two slices of cheese that would be the cheese omelet right there ... uh for the country ham you would just put a butter cut down on the plate that would mean country ham and eggs a piece of ... around in a piece of whatever economy he got on there\nUm if not usually I Would like to put an ad in doubt another butter cup regret\nSo when when they won the waitress shot that long ago writer she's like Mark\nShe's my hand banking sausage ... house ... and then they said then so as they're calling it out you put down on the plate and exactly the way to get a what's the economy put on for cheese eggs\nSo cheese eggs it would be basically show again like a Chihuahua is horizontal so if you were doing the egg it would be um [noise] I guess right side up and they'd be at the bottom of the plate that would indicate scrambled with a little piece of cheese on top of the actual if it's raisin toast you would use the apple butter\nCause for some reason they always give me a little thing grape jelly might get this great generally out of here or am I putting ... million yeah you know if that was a it was a marker\nYeah it's all markets all marked on there so whenever there's like three guys kicking early in the morning when it's really you'll have one guy that just\n... like they drop hash browns or whatnot what about a ... you ... an onion right\nOr you know you'll get the two pieces of wheat bread go ahead and the butter it put it on the plate with a TV show the cheese and tomato pack on\nTop that would be ... ... ... beach on down there yeah interesting\n... ... if you had the ...
