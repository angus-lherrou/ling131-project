talk to Joe here so glad you could spend a little time with us today if your first time listener welcome we get so many new listeners all around the country is so all around the world actually it's so great and I love when I get messages from you guys I Know some of you if you're different parts of the country the parts of the world\nAre you have questions send them the way through my my website Dr Joe dot com and I I just love answering your questions if a lot of fun\nAnd are we talking about today is I'm going to answer a question that I get every single\nDay and I've gotten every single day for the past thirty four years that I've been in practice\nAnd the question is why won't my pain go away\nDoc I'd been all these different doctors I've had shots I've had a a physical therapy whatever their project on maybe they've done nothing and ... my pain just won't go away\nAnd I need your help help me help my pain go away so that a lot of different reasons why people have pain\nNo the chiropractor we always talk about bone pinching unnerving as an inside scoop\nIt's a little more than that if a bone moves out of place their swelling at the F ... joint ... where the bones come together and when the swelling that irritates the the the proper ... in the kennel receptors and I'm a ... of the ones that fire off pain signals\nAnd so you're irritating a nerve andme anytime just swelling that can do that that sends an impulse up into the brain saying that it hurts\nAnd then a brain sends a message back down that nerve impulses along lateral spinal lamb attracting it's fine and it says hey your pain here do something about it\nSo pain is a good thing I Know that sounds strange but pain is telling you that there's something wrong and when you ignore it that's when you start to have problems and I see it every day\nPatients coming our office doctor Dr had pain for two weeks ten weeks two years ten years twenty or Thirty years\nAnd I say what have you done for it and sometimes they've done a few things sometimes it's nothing but the the killer is when I take their X rays and I'll take an x-ray look at an MRI and I'll see that the disks between the the the spine to the spinal disks are starting to wear out\nAnd when it this way around it a lot of different words for that spawned a low sister gender of this disease or arthritis osteoarthritis degeneration\nAnd at the disks are wearing out that's telling me that it's been there for a long time\nPatient comes in the office and I see arthritis in his mind I can tell them it's been there at least ten years it takes at least ten years for arthritis to show up on an X ray or an MRI wow\nSo they've had injuries for a long time but nerve damage for a long time well it didn't hurt that much doc it was just a little stiff sometimes well guess what that's a problem we got to get in there and we got to fix it\nFolk Dr Joe here glad you're there 'cause we're talking today our history question today why won't my pain go away\nAnd it's a question I get every day in my practice all my doctors and we have three officers in the Atlanta area Marietta Duluth and Stockbridge and we get that question every single day\nWhile McCain go away and so when we become investigators we've and we've got to dig around now here's the thing I Would love for everyone listening everyone watching we we stream these on Facebook and Instagram our a podcast is called for the health of it while podcasts are also on my website Dr Joe dot com\nHere's the thing if you come see us and you've got a problem chances are it's not going to go away and one visit I just can be real honest with you so don't expect miracle and sometimes miracles happen we've had patients in my daughter's gonna take a long time and we do it and it's amazing and they they do great\nBut if you come in and expecting me to solve the problem or my team of doctors it's going to take more than one visit in most cases and you're going to have to work with us that's why push the nutrition so hard because you have control over that\nYou can control what's a lot of your pain problems a lot of your nerve problems because remember Ninety percent of the nerves don't feel pain so we're talking about uh repairing inflammation and we talked about the micro ugly a producing side all kinds of his inflammatory an anti inflammatory cytokines and those are chemicals that either cause inflammation or fight inflammation\nAnd what am I ... kind of haywire they're producing too much of the inflammatory and not enough the anti inflammatory so how do we re boot the nervous system and we talked about sleep which is important we ... that was right before the break\nA lot of people I sleep issues because their stomach is push up against their diet for him and a diaphragm espoused and then it's not dropping down when you breathe the diaphragm drops down you suck air in when you exhale it pushes air out\nAnd that's how normal breathing goes that when you're standing you have gravity pulling your diaphragm down for you when you are\nLaying down you don't have gravity and so the stomach and push up against a diaphragm and you don't get enough sleep talked to a friend of mine yesterday in a while ago he and I were at a party and we got ... got hotel room because I didn't want to spend the night party\nAnd he stores like a sort of a gun and I'll Try to poke 'em and would wake up and so what he did it got an app that there's an app for that and he started recording himself and he says I Can't believe it I was snoring like sixty percent\nThemself and he says I Can't believe it I was snoring like sixty percent of the night Seventy percent of the night so now you can actually monitor yourself if you live alone 'cause he lives alone in this time of course one room and um he said now I gotta do something about it\nSo if you're not getting a good deep sleep it could be that you're not breathing properly and breathing is a big issue a lot of people mucus number one ... producer what is it dairy products what's the number to me because producer wheat\nSo here's a simple little thing especially as\nWe go into the cold and flu season you want to go on an anti mucus diet which is also an anti inflammatory diet by the way same thing you want to give up the wheat and the dairy products\nBecause we the dairy products produce mucus and that can give you that that that full feeling you blow your nose in the morning in Fleming your throat\nA and it also can get in your lungs you're not going to be able to breathe as well so you got to give up the wheat in the dairy products those are the ... very inflammatory foods and that can help you get sleep once you get you into our EM stage which will help your body he'll\nStart

I wouldn't live no benefit to lie to you folks\nI really there's no reason why I Would tell you doing these things because I I don't sell carrots and I don't feel stake so whatever you're going to do is totally up to you and I've learned to things in my life one of them is don't argue with patients\nAnd so if you have to if you want to discuss it amongst yourself that's great if you want to try it right but don't knock it until you've tried it that's my request from till you get a shot and see if you have questions they for for for for Dr Joe was the number here\nUm we had a Seventy call in and they want to get on the air and they said they must you also write us osteoporosis um and what was the other ones are is a couple of other issues they had there and they want to know what to do it and they're already on a plant based diet and they wanted to know what's that ... ... we gotta Yeah Dr Joe I have osteoporosis\nArthritis in my shoulders and nice and I'm also vegan is there a plant based cure for the pain yes and the answer is um you gotta if you're already plant based that's great that's your your direction you're going but make sure there's a difference between Vietnam and plant based we talked about this last time the economy's you don't eat any animal products\nGood for you I like that but that means you can meeting sugar and brownies and cookies and cakes and doughnuts and pastas and lollipops and a candy corn in all these other things I guess as we can candy corn I don't know but that doesn't mean it's healthy plant based means you're eating food at the way it was designed by nature close to the way it was picked from the ground\nIt's designed by nature close to the way it was picked from the ground so in someone like that if you have osteoarthritis there's always a mechanical component means Bones Are out of alignment rubbing up against each other that the chiropractic issue\nAnd there's not an exercise in the world are that's going to put a bone back in place and is not an herbal supplement than even Dr Joe super greens and Dr Joseph central source of magical supplements of the universe in my opinion aren't going to put a bone back in place so if there's something physical you need to get the bones put back in place and that's when you come see us\nFrom a of a nutritional standpoint you want to make sure the body is slightly alkaline because when you go into it I asked a diet was going to cover a little bit that inflammatory and we're answering the question today why won't my pain go away\nSo minimum Dr Joe super greens and Dr Joseph essential source minimum amount of supplements you take every day we come back we'll give you some more advice on that if you have a health care question the lines are lighting up for\nFor for for Dr Joey for for for for deer jail eat\nMy website if you want to order supplements if you want to make an appointment to come see us we have lost his Marietta Duluth and Stockbridge Atlanta area\nDr Joe dot com or a for for for for Dr Joe\nRings through to my officers folks are going to tell your friends about the show me right back [noise]\nShowing us leave Marja arrow removing tropic every morning and entertaining talk every evening current day stuff but not any political way does the local daily talk show more\nDoesn't really get a job of making it really the whole\n... is plugged in every day at least nine ... ... am when you asked me a lot of people have\nLife insurance through work is a great short term benefit but is it enough a lot of those policies only cover a year's salary not enough to pay off mortgage is worse than kids to college but things life insurance is meant for\nThat's where so liquid comes in to like ... is your personal life insurance guy get multiple quotes to find you the best price from the highly rated companies they represent\nJohn is thirty six and an excellent how figure and a half million dollar policy for under twenty dollars a month life insurance is about peace of mind about a false sense of security which are you getting close to quote now at one eight hundred eighty five forty six forty six\nThat's one eight hundred eighty five forty six forty six or get started at ... dot com one eight hundred eighty five forty six forty six so like\nWe shop you say get full details on the example policy is liquid to accomplish commercials or ... depending on your health insurance company another factor on I'll stick [noise]\nAnd so my prediction making it today so that I can come back and quote this\nIs that the next big craze if you will in medicine or health care I should say is going to be working on the nervous system already happening but it hasn't quite hit mainstream yet and it will\nBecause we get doctors all the times referring to us we had doctors and hospitals a neurosurgeon the vascular surgeons and general practitioners and gynecologist and you're all just because they can't do what we do I can't do what they do\nIf you need a I don't know your prostate exam I Can't do that for you go to your relatives and get that checked\nBut we check the nervous system the digestive system and the diet and so many people we we're justice fine and if you have acid reflux or Harper and we can pull the stomach down away from the die for him in most cases and by the way I've never promising results just so you know I'm never guaranteeing anything\nBut I can tell you after thirty four years in thousand ... say millions of adjustments that I've given we got a pretty good track record\nBy pulling stomach away from the diaphragm relaxes the whole intestinal area and it's stimulates what's called the Paris sympathetic nervous system sympathetic speed you up Paris sympathetic slow you down and by doing that people sleep better they go to the bathroom better their love life improve that focus in improved in most cases\nSo we want to get the nervous system working at the digestive system working and then get a good diet and the minimum minimum amount of nutrients you should be doing everyday is Dr Joe super greens and Dr Joe the central source I personally take adrenal support because everybody asked me that every show I take adrenal support that's on the website to Dr Joe's B. complex\nNitric oxide increases my circulation as you get older your circulation gets a little weaker blood vessels get the aren't as a pliable or flexible as they used to be\nThe nitric oxide helps open them up\nAnd so I have a series of stuff and I said I take in more than happy to put together specific protocol for you but folks please the minimum you should be doing a super greens and the central source and the two patterns they taste great a month's supply is just over two dollars for both of them I mean two dollars a day\nI'm so it's very inexpensive and in and try it and if I'm wrong I'm wrong but I'm not ...\nI'm Sorry to hear from callers here for for for for Dr job we got a few lines open Christina how could make\nYour day better yeah it's nice it's a pleasure\n[noise] um yes I have the gentleman who's I'm\nPicky six years old uh-huh he has states for COPD ... fifty six and COPD that's not good night with a whole list of medications I just was talking to him today\nAnd he has a list of medications he's taking a toll\nAnd today and he has a list of medications he's taking um he's on oxygen twenty four seven right\nAnd on what else he says he eats pretty well that I did not get it and we'll get to the gym at this point um but I Know there's something that can be done he's he's dying here\nIs I read the state for COPD and fifty six years old and on oxygen on a bunch of medications it you're not kidding he's dying he's this ... this is the bottom but and I have two outs yeah\nSo what do you deal with somebody like that well if they're willing to make the change and here's the thing if they're willing to make the change I Would get them on a plant based I had to get them super green to central source I probably get them on nitric oxide monitor make sure he's okay\nUm I get 'em on probiotics that could be the medications take his probably killing off the good bacteria and it's Colin I get 'em on Dr Charles probiotic supplements\nGet 'em on adrenal support to help with the information a chiropractor care of course to open up the nerve supply I get 'em off all the mucus forming foods which are the seven deadly sins alcohol meat sugar dairy coffee soda in artificial sweetener\nRight and I have people come in with all the time desperate and they say doc I'm dying like like your friend\nAnd most of all listen to what we say and most of them get very good results some of them don't listen to what we say\nAnd a hundred percent of them don't get good results\nSo it depends if he's wanting to make the changes or not if he is I Would love to meet with him and I'd love to be the person that he can say twenty Thirty years from now these people save my life but if he's not willing to make a change I there's nothing I U R I or anybody could low yeah forgive them you know not what they do yeah\nOkay okay so how did you ever dealt with something like that\nOf course absolutely yeah we see all the time we should we have people from all over the world come in with everything from acid reflux to heartburn to at the high blood pressure COPD and we're not medical doctors were on board certified in chiropractic worth of predicts pain management doubled board certified in nutrition\nSo we don't treat medicine we treat the body to get healthy so you don't need the medicine so that's why we managed to case with their medical practitioners and say hey listen we did this monitor that we did this check that and then we worked together\nAnd doctors love that because they don't know what we do and I don't know what they do when we it's really informed two of us come together and help the patient get well some\nWell definitely if the doctors on board and what you're trying to accomplish because you know most of 'em want him on the all these medications\nWell years ago the doctors and the holistic practitioners there was a battle\nAnd ... years ago after when I first started in practice a medical doctor couldn't even be seen in public\nWith a chiropractor with somebody on the health food store and according to weigh the law ... even a nurse because anyone who couldn't prescribe medicine who was treating patients and now I mean you know Gary it'll tell you I mean I I get invited to three dinners a week for the medical profession so it really is change which is kinda cool I'm gives call and get them set up\nThank you so much much folks I'm Dr joyous but you know the number here in Studio ... for for for for Dr Joe my website Dr Joe
