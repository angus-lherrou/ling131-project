yet I'm as\nAs is often the case it takes awhile for that news to to circulate a you know for the longest time nobody was out for good reason\nThis was a strong storm winds well over a hundred miles an hour and and then you know after that and the rescue crews are able to get out and when it's safe to go and survey the damage to see if anybody was hurt or worse and as\nOf right now I've been following the um the bay county sheriff's office on Twitter I haven't seen any reports of of any of fatalities\nUm and at that time a city pledged to see if anybody was hurt or worse and as of right now I've been following the um the bay county sheriff's office on Twitter I haven't seen any reports of of any of fatalities\nUm and I know of Panama City beach police are not worried about Hooters day I don't know I didn't hear a a peach report but um that's a big concern now\nAnd there is a a curfew and place over there um so yeah so far so good which is remarkable we see some of those damage is amazing but people heeded the warnings and and took shelter\nI get hit land John as a category for what is a fast moving storm you were a bunker down in in the hotel room how long um was like the worst of the storm going by how long it'll yeah in ... was it\nWas about two hours when you know when the wind was so bad that uh you know that it would knock you off your feet so I Would say about two hours from beginning to when it really started to subside where you could you know see see see in front of you if you will um\nSo yeah and I and as you mentioned this was a storm that that really the wind is the story you know we we were up in forests\nCouple of weeks ago and that was really a rainwater storm surge that but as you mentioned this was a fast moving very powerful when tax\nStorm and so now we're dealing with wind damage power is out everywhere I mean not just power lines down but power poles doubt it's going to take a long time to get this thing back up and running again or just because of the infrastructure damage that was done\nThat's a long two hours though John with when you got the the category for hurricane going overhead what was it like in a hotel room I I'm assuming no power right eat new unit photography\nAnd snaps and luckily the polls didn't break but you know how that campus saying they're designed to break away that thing broke away and made a loud noise and then we could hear a really the rules kind of being killed a little that I Would say the roof being killed back but sections of\nOf uh the roof or being killed back and so the hotel staff told us that much of the search for as a badly water damaged in fact it was a room on the first for the water coming in from the ceiling so that tells you is\nComing all the way it's\nAn honor to be honest our hotel fair pretty well I mean we have no power but there are some hotel that have um entire sections of the walls with a ripped out like stucco was\nYou know for three stories up was just pulled right out of a section of that hotel roof spin ripped off um so yeah this all tell we're fortunate that also tell 'em did okay certainly better than many\nI don't know what your schedule is for tomorrow but we've had a bunch of calls I'm telling now from listeners telling us about Mexico beach got absolutely obliterated which isn't too far from Panama City so I don't know if you guys are
