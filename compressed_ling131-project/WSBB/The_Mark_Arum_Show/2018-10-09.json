big challenge to grow he's a spouse is the sense of insulting\nTo negatively judge the motives of your spouse\nAnd some of my biggest improvements has a husband came when I listen to my wife's

time I I went down to the panhandle is like a it was amazing Clearwater it's warm as well as the first time I went down there like well I'm gonna retire here\nBut I've always been worried about buying something and then you know hurricane but then the panhandle was so calm there hadn't been any hurricanes and now this\nJust by your island and Canada besides that that is probably going to do I'll just read\nBy the way the world's going into twenty thirty\nYears ago twenty twenty thirty I saw that some yeah somebody but listen here's the thing I I legitimate believe that there is climate change um I don't know if it's manmade or not but I I I the data's there the earth is getting warmer so my thought was we should all chipping in by like\nCheap cheap land in Maine right because if the if the world gets hotter means going to be like oh livable you know to be like a true yeah so we should literally I mean you can get a hundred acres of forest in Maine for six dollars or something [laughter]\nYeah you're right we should do that and then twenty thirty will be fine you know it'll be scorched earth south of Delaware but we're going to be\nMean are we I was just nice and temperate I like my little inland though just in case of water yeah no yeah exactly and there was nobody on the coast yeah yeah and uh do you do in the middle of it in the middle of the state yeah yeah then we'll have Detroit product can hunt for us yeah I'll fishing the streams where\nDabble gather berries an advocate of farm for a long time and I'll get are you a million Gloria will grow jalapeno there you go I guess we're all said All right well we have dogs and running around I mean that's a good retirement good we're good that someone would do now Linda joins us on the market and she'll hello Linda\nHi there too high we just bought a house in Cape ... to go just like eight oh no thinking that the Gulf Coast but it's nice and peaceful and the hurricane let's less likely to come and now it's going to be a nerve wracking twenty four forty eight hour I can\nOnly imagine so do you do have anyone down there um that can check after the storm are you guys going to go down there how are you going to find out\nWe're going to go down this weekend the same thing we can get and we can get there a place that trace it and so forth but\nWhat's the deal with the uh so I you know one of the biggest problems of buying a place on the coast is the insurance is usually pretty high and you guys made a lot in insurance\nBut about ten thousand a year and ... where in ... four hundred yards\nFrom the beach oh y'all have fortunately flood insurance um that our house is of course up on stilts yeah shit hello fingers crossed tired said oh I feel bad for you for forty eight hours I feel\nOh I feel bad for you any for forty eight hours I feel so bad so is it you and your husband\nRight we have a college aged on\nSo late whose whose whose idea was to buy the house yours or your husband had to say what's not OK so it was easy gloating now or is\nHe blamed just say yeah well hopefully nothing will happen that's that's just awful if you don't mind Linda calling back next week and let me know how things fair for you guys down there\nOkay yeah right well thank you so much\nI'd love to hear from you and um you know lord well in the house is still standing we'd love to stay down there next spring so\n[laughter] I'm at ... or join in your backyard prayers are with you seriously thank\nYou All right see that's the problem I Would buy a house like Linda and then two weeks later ... hurricane Longoria is barreling down on the coast\nThat happened to my aunt and uncle they lived in Michigan forever and they decided to retire down in Florida and then was what was the one that just came to Florida not long ago\nI don't remember when hurricane Bobby Christine whatever it was right and it came like right by their house and they came up here and stayed with me for a couple of weeks and then they just so bad and moved back to Texas really actually didn't want to deal with hurricane yeah because\nThere was this is a time in the in the late nineties early to thousands where it was every every single season there was four hurricane just pounding both coasts of Florida and people are just like you know I'm not rebuilding again this is the insurance is through the roof\nAnd that was the time to go down and by places because they were dirt cheap and I didn't do that of course\nUm but but now after a long period of calm in the in the Gulf Coast people went down there now it's expensive again and and now this comes through that I Know that what happened to me you're right stick with Maine [laughter] the worst the worst that could happen is I'll be attacked by a bear\nBear attack yeah bears beat Battlestar Galactica alright Chuck you had to you you had a major accomplishment this week and let's talk about the Chicago Marathon ... put those calls on whole cause I talked to a truck here uh this is your second marathon yup and a first off how'd it go\nI'm not as well as last year time wise or I'd\nThe race was better and that I didn't cramp up and have to literally crawl across the finish line how how much lower this year where you didn't last about twenty minutes why why do you think that is well I had a baby and it's really\nHard to training with a baby yeah was it was it was hard to put the mileage and I I I Will say for the record there's a Ninety eight point five percent chance that I Will never run a marathon yeah um and that might even be too low\nI can see ... you know some of the best we I bet you a million dollars you can share that I Would trade for I don't know if I Would finish it or not what what's the toughest part of of running a marathon\nThe last the last six miles really there's there's a point where\nEverything on you hurts ... it's hard to explain and they should do but there's a point where everything hurts my feet hurt I literally thought I was breaking bones in my feet yeah my back hurt my hips hurt my neck is so sore today 'cause eventually you just get so tight from running for so long like 'em\nAnd all you want to do is stop is only one night a regular person who's with one of my doing social stuff yeah but I don't know there's some\nAt any point do you walk I oh yeah yeah a guy had yeah no I so at like ... Eighteen I started to get a little cramped in my ... which I was like crap [laughter] yeah eight miles to ... I'm In trouble yeah\nAnd uh [noise] ... yeah I had I had\nTo stop a few times not that I was out of breath I probably was [noise] I've laid on the couch and had a higher heart rate than I did do that I'm not kidding yeah because I was running so slow but I had such bad cramps everywhere that I just I had to stop\nIt during the race are you argue trucking Watergate arrayed what's the I did last year I was so excited and there was so new I skipped every water station for ten miles by the time I realized that it was too late\nTo like keep hydrated silver this year I had every single one like everyone I take a little sip water will suffocate or as you keep going see I think I could I could do a marathon no problem\nBut um I'd have to stop at the bathroom like every four miles I did I had decided to stop like at mile five I think one or two and four or five oh just never will see a problem although they're they're ... [laughter] how much of a sex should say but we ah [noise]\nWas probably like miles [noise] Twenty one or twenty two where they start giving like bananas and like other little\nDance to eat and I was like\nI got to go to the bath [laughter] and I was running and I couldn't figure out like [noise]\nThis just like a little squeaker I can get away or something like I might need to peel off and go to the you know what I mean I might need it and I was like you know I've got me every hour yeah my life I can totally relate to that I I just I thought you know a week or I don't really think I have to go but I don't want a chance it I've just got a power\nYou don't really think I have to go but I don't want a chance it I've just got a power through so I\nI just I just kept you taking the beauty of the course do you recognize like how I did yeah yeah yeah I don't know if you're so focused so you don't even realize like oh I'm running through downtown Chicago wow you feel good\nYou notice everything um 'cause you just you can kind of look around\nWhen you fill your body starts to break down and he started to hit the wall it becomes harder to look around where you're just pretty much looking about three feet in front of you sure so that it's just three feet into ... versa getting your head up and you're like oh my God that's like four miles down you know you can there's stretches\nWhere it's like four or five miles [noise] let's let's talk about a pre and post race meals what did you have before the race\nUh let's see I had a lot of pasta and spaghetti and salmon\nPasta and spaghetti sauce like even though it was like a lot of stuff I was like a pot a different policy option in a big boy that is that's a legit people tell you the ... before yeah but now ... no I was very ... very like like a little olive oil and garlic\nVery light Mariner on the and then and post gave meal what do you do it even eat after that did you see that picture I put on in ... oh man I ...
