drinker but have found some good wine and had take on it and sometime after everything was over we're cruising down back roads and run across some signs and Russian\nYou first thing you can rent you rode out of Germany and Russia\nThat was my first thought but say we're station right outside of breath and beer which is a big training area uh I don't I don't I didn't know but some of the other ...

story we were that\nThey prepared because they're the south it's going to come over and ... come across the line and take over which was politics but or when you're on a strange land you take it with

luck store and go across the street\nTo a can't call they the the um\nTo the hotel where the guy was and the guys at the very Frank got to the door open the door it got about three steps into the parking lot as the shot started\nWe all just turned around and ran back in the building it was really weird as within minutes of not knowing what to do what's going on where do we go to we go back to her room so [noise] yeah well we like that to the ground\nWith at no time at all which is so bizarre slight comes through and literally spread out it was like hurting everybody back\nOutside through these other side doors away from where the shooting happened so now we're out of the parking lot we have no idea where we are they locked us out of the hotel we can't get back and we don't know where to go [noise]\nNobody knows who want to lock you out of the hotel\nThey didn't know how many more there were and they were trying to get people cleared that were in the public areas smoker as what we're told later but at the time we don't know whether they were like there's been shut out there and we don't want to help\nYeah no that would have freaked me out at the hotel walk it was terrifying\nIt was terrifying meanwhile you're still hear the noise there's parking garages everything that goes there's still no he was going on that sounded like gunfire you don't know what it is you don't know how many shooters you don't know where they are you don't know who they're after it was absolutely insane so my group ran across the street into a parking garage and literally crawled under cars\nHoly crawled under vehicles and lay there until I got got quiet um we got out finally and went and read\nBack toward the hotel which time the police were ushering is underneath this box
