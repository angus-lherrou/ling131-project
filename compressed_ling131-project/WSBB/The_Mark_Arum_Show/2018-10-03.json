I Love those things by the way do you how much those things cost no ever going to get one of the building I I wanted to get one once for my ex um for your home yes I got home version of the\nThe the Coca Cola super thing whatever first so I as somebody that coke and like listen I Want to get this for Christmas by law\nAnd he's like hey you can't you can't do it you know they're not for personal sale be you can't afford it I'm like oh come on\nAnd he goes to the smallest one is fifty thousand dollars I'm like you're right I Can't afford to have to keep it filled up yeah yeah absolutely right fifty fifty thousand dollars now it's like ten years ago it might have changed but ah but ... so I'm actually okay was sneaking\nBut ever since I was a kid I\nReally dislike people sneaking candy and food into movie theaters like I used to go to the movies in my ... my ... at the best friend at the time fill fill up we were like eight or nine or ten or whatever and his mom ... used to take it to the movies and we'd stop at Kmart\nAnd she'd by the like a huge bag of whenever gum drops or whatever and stuff\nOf whenever gum drops or whatever and stuff for them in her purse and I'm at eight years old and my parents they're very good job of of teaching me right from wrong and I'd be like this is wrong\nI I wouldn't eat any of the gum drop she brought in my early yeah like there are signs no outside food or beverage okay and an eight years old I mean not in Colorado and on and I didn't need it and like you evil mom but I was just like no no I'm good I'm going to go\nSpend three dollars an junior meant I get the candy is rarely expend really accent yeah and popcorn but that's the thing to like movie popcorn is movie popcorn yeah you can't really so you can't replicate that but I mean even as a kid still to this day\nI refused if you try to bring in food or beverage to a movie theater I'll I'll I'll drop a dime on you I mean yeah I'm a sticker when it comes to that okay you want to put\n'em scotch and ... [laughter] okay I Know that makes no sense but I'm actually okay with that so this this is a crazy story out of east Cobb again a plus or creativity for the mom on coming up with a ... device\nOr I think you're going to see a lot of the Stanford Stadium that she actually um 'cause that's the genius that's brilliant\nJust to have a ... who ... I don't even think TSA checks a sip a cup they just assume don't give any more I can I just as the TSA they're they're they're pretty hard but I mean if a mom if you send her baby right and there's a ... I think they just\nPut the ... on the conveyor belt or something I don't know\nI I Will say that I worked in retail and that was the number one thing they always told us a check his mother's with strollers because they ... they hide stuff and they and then they're like oh let my child didn't know what they were doing they just accidentally grabbed it that they were the number one shoplifters in retail because they were just seven on the stroller\nThat's a good yeah that's I didn't know that yeah so I Need to get a kid a stroller as ... and ... begin my life of crime or so here's I Want to ask you do your listener um your your thoughts on this crazy story by the way in east Cobb County which is I just can't imagine being a mom\nPeriod but if I were a mom to bring or dad to to get waste that the movie with your kid can you have to drive them home exactly and the kids crying and and and that's the worst in the theater yeah oh God yeah that's that's probably what happened the they got the her fellow theatre goers probably were like get this kid out of hand and then they discovered the mom was wasted\nFrom the ... juice um but your thoughts on that and what have you ever use creative ways to a sneak alcoholic beverages into a place I'm reminded of that Seinfeld episode where Kramer\nTries to bring his own ... and he sticks that the ... and his pants and it spills all over and it gets burned and he tries to sue Starbucks\nUm what are some creative ways you can sneak let's let's be helpful here with my guy ever this out what are some creative ways you can sneak booze into places where a that are boos free and what are your thoughts on bringing in outside candy to a movie theater I Am\nA I'm strictly against it I don't have a doctrine per se but if I did that would be that would be it in the in the paper work don't sneak\nOutside candy into its weird that's where I draw the line yeah what it comes across in law do not bring in um enjoy or mountains bars liquor yes liquor yes because you can't get it there\nBut you can buy a amounts bar you can buy 'em you ever do you ever find like again not to send obese Joseph\nBut if you go to like a regular movie theater shame like the regular movie theatre they just have the snack bar does anyone ever get like the nachos or the hotdogs there in order to the wrong fingers have you have you done that if you die and on anything besides popcorn candy\nOh not me but I'm always sitting next to the person with the nachos\n... yeah and that's the problem I suffer from ... which is a mental disorder if you couldn't tell but and I if people are eating popcorn loudly around a movie theater with me I have to move seats it's just it's\nUnless it's a really loud movie than I can they're going to get through ... yeah All right so that's a that's what we're discussing we're trying to MacGyver this out creative ways to sneak alcohol into venues that don't allow it to and what are your thoughts on bringing in outside candy do movie theater for all for eight seven to zero seven fifty one eight hundred\nDouble you asked me talk on Twitter and Instagram at Marquette from a and also your thoughts on this on this or
