I don't think that that means he's unqualified I certainly still like him I think he's a very good judge\nBut his jurisprudence is very original is this now I realize we don't get into this uh topic on on a regular basis but a bride bear with me here as I Do a deep dive just for you just so people understand though what I'm Talking about here and what Brian starting about the Fourth Amendment\nIs the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers in effect against unreasonable searches and seizures\nWarrants have to be issued but about only upon probable cause supported by oath reformation and particularly\nBut if I only upon probable cause supported by oath reformation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the person or things to be seized the Fifth Amendment is the grand jury double jeopardy self information due process and taking provisions\nAnd capital ... very firmly with the government all these these very Sam Alito like family does very much side with the government on matters of crime and terrorism\nNow ... where I went ahead with this is I think most people don't realize that the United states had income taxes\nBefore the income tax amendment there were examples of the United states government imposing an income\nTax on the citizens before we had an income tax amendment\nAnd the way the government did this and the way the Supreme Court said it was constitutional was war powers\n\nSeat the war power the Supreme Court has ruled essentially Trump's all other powers\nBecause at first and foremost we the people of the United states in order to form a more perfect union can't have that union if it is dissolved because of external military forces\nAnd so during the civil war Lincoln needed to raise taxes that he couldn't do it himself but Congress was able to the Spanish American war as well Congress was able to vote and they were small and only affected the really rich but it was still an income tax\nAnd at the time in the government did not contemplate did not allowed to not permitted income tax but the Supreme Court said it was fine because of the war powers because national security trumps all else and that's where capital as an originalist comes from is in this vein that the the section was the article one section eight powers Trump everything\nAnd\nSo many things depending on circumstance can be derived through those via the war power\nThe war power and the necessary and purpose clause or read together under this constitutional framing so that the things necessary to make war or appropriate and one of the things necessary to make war is a greater latitude and surveilling the enemy no it doesn't apply to us citizens although there's a lot of suspicion\nThe government looks at what us citizens do but this is where it comes from is delving into\nNo what foreigners do as their electronic communications route through the United states being able to spy on them that because of the national security war power trumps the Fourth Amendment that as long as we're looking at ... at electronic surveillance that occurs abroad\nIn his pass through the pipes and wires and communications infrastructure of the United states we can look at it a lot of libertarians don't like that I get it and I leave their way\nBut ... view is it from a position of being hostile to the Fourth Amendment it's his view of originalism that the war power really is the foremost power in government and when the executive and the legislative branches come together to make war that trumps everything\nThat's that's his view I Hope I have explained that well without confusing everyone Rand Paul and libertarians are deeply squeamish on his positions although he did tell he and Rand Paul did strike some understanding and compromise\nOn how he reads it and in fact capital has evolved I guess you could say overtime as as war has scaled back he is naturally taken the position of the original is that you do when the the precipitating factors of war go away the war power itself must recede and he is Jewish ... prudence\nHas accordingly responded so there is some consistency there
