about you don't talk about each other and of course ... was trying to win from the other Stacey the primary what she did so we'll see they're both they're both going to be very well schools on how to handle each other\nHow to open a good one\n[laughter] well I just hope that they both do their homework and that the voter actually pays attention so yeah All right I'm from the Colombian thank you Jeff that's a ... way in and yeah we're going to have the ws be debate I Believe on that Sunday will be both on TV as well as on radio so uh that won't be in November the for this brings me up to early voting which I Believe officially starts\nThe sixteenth it's usually three weeks out maybe the maybe the seventeenth right around the next week early voting would start\nI Am not a fan of early voting can I tell you I actually hate early voting I've talked to an election supervisors from counties I've seen numbers I've looked at the data\nWe do not see a statistically significant increase in the number of voters what we're seeing is the same number of voters that somehow managed to get out the day of the election now spread it out over three weeks look I get it there maybe some people who said but that one day I just couldn't get out okay fine but\nDo you really need three whole full complete weeks to figure out who you're going to vote for\nAnd how often and the further out from the election date you get you find that there is a number of people who are interviewed who are who are polled to say I took advantage of early voting and then the week before something broke something in the news made me wish I had held off because I Would have changed my vote\nThat bothers me as well I don't like this idea I've never liked the idea of three weeks out it is the law currently\nSo folks whichever side of the aisle you're on\nIndependent which side of the ... and again do you prefer you you better get out and vote and I'm not talking about absentee I'm not talking about provision I'm Talking about get out there to the polls whether you do the early vote or you go to your polling on the Tuesday November the ah November the six\nTo vote in this upcoming a big time mid term not just

want to text the word Red Cross to nine zero nine nine nine each time is a ten dollar donation\nAnd that'd be fantastic if you want to help out with that um what our callers actually brought up an interesting thing it looked like either an absentee\nBallot or maybe a request for an absentee ballot but that request had just a slight change of information seems kind of odd and I'm going to go to the phones because I got another person to start from Canton Samantha checking in with us here on it lends evening news Samantha ... good evening\nGood evening I'm so I my husband actually received one of these in the mail yesterday on and ...\nAnd ... at night you know for Brian Kemp or anything but it is in a row for sure and it was an ad in the ballot ... and then had my ... and ...\nOur address on it and then it had an additional one like it he wanted to hand it off to your friend or something they instead of having the name that he has on his ID card\nIt's just it's first and last name so no middle name\nAnd that just slightly different than what would actually be on an ad in a ballot shack he actually\nDoes it show 'cause we're supposed to by law who paid for which campaigner which organization\nYou'll actually get paid for by um it's that are asked else that Republican they\nUm\nUm they ... it up as a second ago at a a Republican state leadership committee\nRepublican state leadership committee is paying that particular ad that's interesting so it looks like an anti Abrams but it doesn't have your husband's full name trying to help him out request an absentee ballot as he normally request absentee ballots or is he done that before that they would have sent you\nKnow we're actually very similar to the elite hickory let\n'em really voting early voting absolutely and that we ... you can't get out the day I think you don't care\nAbout it because I I agree with you on that one Samantha we'll thank you for bringing that to our attention so maybe both sides think Samantha maybe both sides are playing fast and loose with some kind of\nI don't know new way of trying to scam a little bit or maybe I don't know what's going on with this because this is the first I've heard of it I Can't tell you can't tell you all little secret now I Know maybe these mailers work\nOr maybe there's folks out their campaign strategist they're getting paid a whole lot of money to convince candidates to spend money and hey both these candidates have record amounts of money that they're spending right now is Stacey Abrams is burning through her as a lot faster than Brian Kemp\nBut they both have a huge war chest to spend but I Will tell you\nRegardless of who I support or don't I don't think in the last eight years probably ten\nThen I have done more than grab the flyer from the mailbox and throw it immediately in the wastebasket as no disrespect it's just\nI've got sources of information sending me a piece of propaganda in the mail one way or the other is

Don Lemon over what he's calling racist Kanye West criticisms\nAnd this is the start the part that I was going to go down before this whole Stacey Abrams thinks kind of just started to blow up about her trying to get Brian Kemp to break the law\nBut what you've got here is folks on CNN you had bakari sellers took a jab at Kanye West or the segment which featured a ... what they're calling racist
