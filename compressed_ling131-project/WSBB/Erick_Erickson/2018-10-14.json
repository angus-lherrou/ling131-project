[laughter] yeah that's a that's a great clip\nYou know so that we commonly say is the S. and P. five hundred it it takes the escalator up but it takes the elevator doubt right\nAnd the reason being is everybody's a little jittery right now that the fed says we are going to raise interest rates again by the end of the year and three times next year\nAnd as interest rates go up that hurts the market because everybody says okay now I can get so much more for my CD I can get a better bond I'm pulling money out of my equities and I'm going to push it over to that so called safe haven\nAnd that's just going to pull money out of the market and I get it it makes complete sense but does should the fed had that much power and should they be doing that that's a question for another day the question is what do we do about it Dan [noise] well you know rainy this is\nOne of those perfect storm topics if you will right now I mean we could talk about this alone for five hours and there's so many things that are happening right now\nAnd to really hone in on that one point it's people having the misconception right the urban myth as as you could call it that moving over to bonds is automatically gonna bring safety to the portfolio\nOns is automatically gonna bring safety to the portfolio well I Wish it was that easy but it doesn't work that way because\nThe inverse relationship with the fed to the interest rates those interest rates continue to rise well the values of bonds are going to continue to go down you know as you mentioned there's been three rate increases this year\nSo if this continues to happen and we see\nThe various things with the trade war and all these other things that are happening right now there is just really no certainty so you know that's where you've got to step in and you've got to commit and say All right I've got to really take a look at what are my options right now mhm so\nAs far as looking at where are the safe havens I mean the Christ would say there's three places to put your money you can put it in the market you can put it in the bank you can put it with the insurance companies you know I mean that's three places you can go\nAnd if you look at the market you got all the risk if you look at the banks you get nothing and if you go to the insurance companies there might be an option there to find that safe haven so I mean that is something when we talk about bond alternatives were looking at alternatives to that stop on mutual fund\nKind of a model yeah absolutely so you do you have those three places that you can go well the market after what happened this week enrich her own risk right\nWe never tell someone you need to move everything out of the market right that is just a poor recommendation you know we like to utilize as many avenues as we can but you know we can't be all in in the market right now my all time high everything that's happening we we can't be all there when you look at the banks well\nLet's be honest I don't have much to say about it [laughter] what percent yeah I was at work and if they're going to pay you one percent I you're you're not making any money at the bank and then that brings us to our third option which is the insurance companies\nWe like insurance companies right now for bond replacement because we have the protection that we're trying to find in bonds but is not available to us\nAnd we can still get an adequate return\nAnd people have a lot of misconceptions when it comes to using insurance companies as a financial instrument that they give up all liquidity or they're they're not going to achieve any good returns or it's it's all high fees well I'm here to tell you folks that is not always the case these products have evolved\nAbsolutely they have evolved and just like any other you know business industry\nCompetition is healthy diet and competition is what drives prices down it's what drives companies to get competitive to try to beat out the other companies that has happened in the insurance business and\nThere is a lot of great places that we can go as I mentioned to protect your principal to get some really good returns and not always give up your liquidity one\nOf the things that I don't know that people realize when we talk about the interest rates going up it hurts the prices of bonds but as the interest rates go up some of these products that are within the insurance world become more attractive\nBecause the insurance company obviously they're they're taking your money they're investing your money and they're giving us a rate of return they're not doing this because they're just generous they're doing it because they are going to make money to as the interest rate goes up some of these products become\nMore attractive Oh absolutely and you know it's it's funny I have had three people asked me this question and the last week and this is in the last week alone they say to me\nWell how is it that the insurance company can do [laughter] how are they making any money how is this possible yeah and and you know the the thing about insurance companies that I always remind people\nWell let's talk about you said that person who's getting close to retirement there was an interesting article in entrepreneur magazine and the guy obviously was English and he was talking about soccer matches and boxing matches and he said if you got to be offensive if you're going to succeed if you're going to do well you've got\nTo be offensive nobody wins unless they do the knockout punch nobody wins unless they had good off ... nobody gets rich by just simply saving money which I disagree with\nBut let's talk about our fence and defense do you believe that or should there be a mix the two or are you a person who comes at it from a protectionist defensive standpoint what do you say to\nThat Randy I'm going to tell you it just like I think every single coach I ever had growing up told me\nThe best defense is a good off Kay All right so you have to be proactive on both sides right I mean if if we related to sports you know we're in the middle of football season\nWell if you're a defense is not on you're going to suffer if you're a fence is not working you're going to suffer so you have to have a mixture of both right you have to be able to pay a bit and move with the markets and and that's where things like quarterly meetings come in and actually\nHaving a real partnership with your advisor\nBut absolutely you you have to get on the offensive and you have to make some choices and you need to to be the one to steer the ship because nobody cares about your money as much as you care about your money mhm right I mean that's simple I mean we we care a lot about our clients money probably more than than anybody could\nBut it's ultimately up to that individual to make the decision that I Need to be offensive here\nIt's interesting you can be offensive about being defensive right now [laughter] yeah and\nIn some ways okay earlier in the show I played a an audio clip from Scott minored in Scott minor does very well thought of economists and analysts and he works for a Guggenheim\nAnd he talked about what kills a bull market and he said the fed shoots the market in the head you know with their interest rate hikes that's what's going to slow us down that may be happening right now so you ask Scott minored\nWhat are you doing right now where do you see us on this cycle and this is what he said\nI Am a for mature and to\nThe advice that was given by bearing on or off child when I asked the question of what was the secret of his great well I said I sold early\nSo you know where we've been taking risk off and we will slowly continue to into the early part of next year and and then be hopefully assertion correctly or for the next town\nRight last year at the same time Chris was talking about I think we're going to hit a market high I think that we should start\nPositioning our clients towards some more protection and he started that last year we had a good run up and now we're starting to see that crazy kind of viable action that he was talking about Scott minor to seeing the same thing he's calling for a forty percent decline in the market in twenty twenty\nNow whether or not bad happens everybody does their predictions\nAre you ready for that if it happens if it doesn't happen you've got to have some sort of a strategy within your\nPortfolio are one hundred percent and you know rainy I like to always paint a picture for people to to be able to take it a different viewpoint on these things so you know let's look at a casino for example and right\nWhen you go into a casino\nThe entire places built for you to spend yeah right and the casino the house is ultimately always gonna win and you know why the house always wins Randy the odds are in their favor they built it that way or they are\nBut people don't know when to walk away or okay that is the classic human condition you know if you will we always want more we always think I could do a little bit better I see it from people all the time well I'm ready to make these moves Dan but\nLet me just give it a couple more weeks so that ... get out a little bit higher\nI got to wait till my account gets to six hundred thousand I just got to wait and just just just let it get to six hundred thousand and said I'll do something then it's almost that I've been trying to do this for thirty seven years I ate a meal you it's an almost there yet and you know what\nI hear ya I I Do I can empathize with people all day long for wanting to hit that number it's only natural but\nIf you were to use this sound strategy where you go in with a certain amount of money right just like you do in the market just like you would at a poker table well once you get to a certain point if you put a strategy in a plan in place\nYou need to start taking some of those winnings off the table because by doing that\nYou are now going to be less susceptible to the market and if something does get real heavy or things do start to get really volatile we've now position due to be in a place where you are protected this goes right into our financial house approach\nAnd we also know that we can generate a level of income that we need\nAnd that's not going to be jeopardized of things do get really hairy so what's\nLosing twenty percent on a hundred percent of your money or losing twenty percent on thirty percent of your money so that's I mean you got it or you got it All right so you're listening to money unleashed with ... financial group Dan Mallory is in today's one of the advisors at the Hoffman financial group and meets with you\nEvery day I mean this is as I said to end doing appointments with people all the time and your ... as well and Kyle does and Eric does the whole team does for sure but it's good to have their perspective when they come in here every now and then of course we'll be back again next week\nBut one of the things that we talk about on the website and it great big bold letters it's talks about your four one K. and it says stop passively\nManaging your biggest retirement as that this is the time to look at that Dan because the four oh one K. over the last ten years you may have become really more in the area of risk the market's been going up people\nOr in the area of risk the market's been going up people have been pushing more toward the market and now when the market starts pulling back you can lose even more than you did in two thousand eight\nYeah absolutely the four oh one K. being the the biggest asset and it seems to be the most passively manage there's a lot of truth to that rainy it blows my mind how many people I meet with on a weekly basis that want to ask\nMe can you just take a look at my four oh one K. and tell me what's going on here 'cause it's just been sitting there\nIt's sitting there people aren't really sure what's going on with it they don't really know what investments there and because it seems like it's one opposite or the other there's very limited choices or there's way too many choices and they just don't know what to do with it\nAnd that is the key is you can't be passive about your four one K.\nYou have to get strategic you got a review it on a regular basis quarterly I'm telling you right now especially in this environment has to be reviewed quarterly you know we have clients who are still working you know they can't even do anything with their four O. one K. they can't assign it advisor to it they can't do a roll over they can't do any of that stuff but\nOne of the things that we do with our clients is we still help them manage mhm accounts that they may not be able to do anything but we don't even charge anything for it the reason that we do it is because\nIt's a part of the overall plan if and if you're in one of those positions where you think wow\nThat's me I'm not getting any help I'm not really sure what's going on you gotta give us a call you got to get on the website and are in your information it'll go straight to us and somebody from the office all reach out and we'll start digging into that four one K. and see what we can do to help stop\nPassively managing your biggest retirement asset it might be you you may have most of your money in a four O. one K. and it's been doing well but now all of a sudden take a look at what it did last week maybe not so much you don't want that to continue to happen let's talk about a strategy for your four one K. give us a call and ask\nFor the retirement roadmap there's this ... for all for nine zero eight eight eight this is a financial plan if it's simply a four O. one K. and that you want looked at that's OK give us a call for all for nine zero eight you can text the word road map to that same number\nFor all for nine zero eight eight or as Dan said go to the website hit the contact button there at the top of the page

don't forget to head over to Facebook Like is that bulls and bears radio see some of the behind the scenes some of the stuff they don't hear on air but yet they can see\nOn a on the Internet yeah it's great we have a ... year old son so a lot of\nThe stuff that doesn't make the air which is the most entertaining stuff goes to Facebook so look us up please follow us like us even if you don't like us like us to say so\nGym you know we talk about this every single weekend bulls and bears a lot of people whenever I meet someone that says Adam I've been listening to you and sham for a while and I I hear you know weekend and week out that you can make money in a downward move with the market people get confused on the idea of short selling they think it has something to do at times\nConfused on the idea of short selling they'd think it has something to do a time they don't realize has something to do a direction but to keep things simple and the fashion that we always do is people can make money when the market is falling and I want to take a moment I Want to talk about one of the best in the world to explain that let's talk\nAbout shorting good week to talk about it Wednesday would have been a great day actually this week if you look at the S. and P. as a whole yes and the five hundred and most people benchmark the health of the broad market at the stock market as a whole\nBy using the S. and P. what's great is that there's a product out there called exchange traded funds ATF is the acronym and that ATF tracks the S. and P. it's ticker symbol is SBY now the SP why is something that we can trade up or down in other words if the market collapse as we can profit when it falls now this is the difference\nThat Wall Street doesn't want you don't understand the wall street wants you to think that if the market goes up that's good enough demar goes down that's bad\nAnd people are trained to think that way and who do you nose waiting and excited about to collapse in the market I mean really at their hands just went up here in the studio\nMost people aren't because they think that the market goes down that's a bad day but it's not a bad day because it's a natural progression of price movement\nAnd someone profits on that moved down to think about this for every dollar made as adult law so if you lose money someone makes so if you lose money and a four one K. because the S. and P. fell\nFour percent this week somebody made that money didn't disappear didn't vaporize it went to somebody else who was short your position in other words they were expecting the market in the fall they are prepared for it and they profit from it you realize you can do that folks\nAnd Wall Street doesn't want to understand how to do it because now you've got to compete with them for the money and what's great about that as we have living examples and test among those just from this week you could have treated the S. and P. and made money this week even on a week with the S. and P. fell and what's neat about that is that that's what separates the wheat from the chaff in the market that's what truly separates\nThe most successful traders investors people that understand how to make money regardless of director of the market\nFrom the masses and let me tell you something folks the masses are not where you want to be when it comes to financial success they really don't have any money and for the most part they only know how to make money when the mark goes up when the ... goes down that's a bad day is not a bad day it's just another day\nExactly and that's the key thing to understand the market goes up the market goes down the average person out there knows how to make money in and out market they wonder how to make money in a down market and when you take that idea\nAnd it's not difficult is just different all of a sudden you know the opportunity every single day every single week every single year two thousand eight was a great year for some of the people I Know two thousand one and two is a great two years for some people I Know and this next correction it's gonna be phenomenal first again people that we know chip\nAnd what a certified financial planner resident vessel vital somebody's trying to get you to give them your money to manage they want you to think that down as bad and it's not and so let me give an example uh current example from this week\nIt was a product called the SP why we talked about earlier it attracts the S. and P. and the SP why you could have sold that at the beginning of the week\nAnd literally just brought it into marketing sold it at the price it was that it was around two hundred Ninety bucks\nSo let's just take one share for example\nLet's just say it's two hundred Ninety bucks to share you decide that you want to sell it now here's the difference and this is where a lot of people have a disconnect when it comes to shorting was short selling\nAnd all we're talking about is selling something to open a position or open a trade see the problem with many people as they can't fathom how can I sell something if I have an already bought it well in the financial markets your broker allows you to use their shares to sell into the market\nIn the anticipation that's going to fall in price so let me give you an example of how this would look let's just say on Monday you decide that you wanted to sell the SBY\nThe S. and P. exchange traded fund that's a ... a symbol SBY so you went to the market sort of a two ... you didn't know that you sold your brokers shares into the market your broker allows you to use their inventory to sell into the market at the market price well on Monday was two hundred Ninety bucks so Monday you sold is you have a two hundred Ninety bucks and you waited\nAnd then was a week would buy you bought it back on Wednesday maybe Thursday\nAnd he bought it back for two hundred and Seventy bucks because they've fallen twenty dollars a share\nNow what did you just do will you stole something at two Ninety and you bought it at two Seventy see the key to the market is to buy low and sell high\nThe differences you did it in reverse order you sold to enter the position at two Ninety now you didn't own the sheer you use your brokers shifts they allow you to use their inventory to sell into the market at two Ninety\nWant to know why they allow you to inventory 'cause they charge a commission silly goose they're going to charge a fee to use that it's a small fee could be a dollar could be ten bucks depending on the broker it's a small fee but allows you to utilize their inventory to sell into the market because they're commission based in other words they get paid when you executed trade they want you to hit that button\nSo you're hitting the button to Ninety selling the shares into the market\nNow you're short the stock that's what the term is called your short the position you have to buy this years back and replace it back and you broke his inventory\nBut your goal is to buy it back to Seventy well when it fell to Seventy you bought it back to Seventy you bought at the moment you bought it went right back in ... broke his inventory\nAnd I guess what happened the twenty dollars that was left over because you sold it to Ninety you bought it back to Seventy the minute you\nBecause you shoulder to Ninety you brought it back to Seventy the minute you brought it back to stock went right back into your brokers have been tore you keep the twenty bucks in a week on a downward moving the U.S in the middle of the market fell you profit no one should that's twenty bucks on a hundred shoes at two grand\nOn a thousands years that's twenty grand\nYou realize that this opportunity to make money regardless of direction of the market and this week you could have made money in the U.S in ... when it fell and if we get the major collapsed which are calling for a major move down the U.S and the you can be prepared to make money all the way down\nThat's what show it in his shoe or something it's a game changer folks\nAnd it's not that difficult sea wall street wants you to think you're not smart enough to make money regardless of direction of the market and that's a lie\nWe keep talking about that you need to learn the skills of shorting and when the market falls take the opportunity that the best trait isn't investors the Goldman Sachs the buffets DePaul tutor Joes the best traders they're taking that moved out and making money and the masses are losing\nGet out of the masses they don't understand how to make money regardless of direction and most importantly the most successful traders take control their money\nAnd make the decision themselves given that control to some institution is telling you down his bed be careful folks there's great opportunity but you've got to learn the skill of shorting and short selling and they'll open up whole new avenues for you\nHave ... and a lot of people think up as good down his bed and just as you said champ up is good down as good if you know how the short sale and that's why online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears\nThey have a class specifically on short in the market now have you been in the market you've never shorter maybe you're new to the market and you want to learn how to capitalize on a downward move this is a unique

background is what your skill set is if you want to learn a different skill\nThe markets can change the game for you and what's great about that it's just so many ways you could approach is you don't have to have a ton of capital\nTrade currencies are futures are crypto currency is was virtually less than a hundred two hundred bucks some cases and start to get some traction start to get some

people most importantly given that chance to make that ... income and maybe supplement and more importantly could turn this something bigger down the road\nThe best thing about the market doesn't care about your age doesn't care about your sex doesn't care about your race it doesn't care about any of that\nAnd no one's ever going to tell you what you're worth you go out there and earn and that's

collapsed so a lot of great concept please like us follow us whatever's going to take\nAnd exactly exactly champ talking about a variety of things right now though I Want to check in with our sponsor online training academy we have ... on the phone right now Chris what's going on\nThey buddy a man it's a it's great to be back and I argue just representing doing a Facebook Live session about shorting the market will hold a great time to short the market you see what happened earlier this week obviously\nYeah yeah I mean getting crushed the dial down three percent on Wednesday just amazing to watch you know what people do to do and we're here showing them you know what there's a way to make money at least not lose when this happens and that's why we're banging the drum here\nWhen I hear it man I I hear it all the time and and I've heard you say there is a senior coach many times before you know there is no better time to be a part of the academy what a great opportunity was missed for so many people that don't understand how to trade in both directions unbelievable\nYeah and what's amazing about the academy and I know that you're down there right now just people love the fact that the market falls I mean we were just talking about how many people do you know out there really in your everyday life and I'm Talking to the listeners right now\nThat are excited about the market going down and they say hardly any but yet there's tremendous opportunity if you understand the system of trading in more poorly in that direction doesn't matter\nYeah well you know what chance speaking about being excited\nUm there's a lot of things going on at the campus and just that you know and all my training academy as a whole were actually gearing up and again you know this we're gearing up for our our international conference where you know we're all of the campus does have an opportunity to gather together and start focusing on some of the new innovative technologies and things that are coming out and you know\nRepresenting the school clearly I'm proud of the fact that all night trading out he was up for technology innovation award for some of the process of the procedures we put in place again this is no better time to be a student at the school\nYeah it's amazing because I remember two thousand eight when the market collapsed the last time\nAnd people were flocking into the academy saying I don't know what to do I don't want to get crossed I Can't lose forty percent of my nest egg in my four one K. and a straight down moving the market is starting to sense that a lot of the students that are coming to the academy and maybe begin to realize especially with the last couple of weeks it more so this week\nThat maybe that's not the time to not understand how to be safe and the markets and most importantly how do I protective it does go down and you start to see that more and more people will be a little bit concerned with that Chris\nWell you know unfortunately people are scared they're ... they're afraid and the fact of the matter is fear really shouldn't be a part of your decision making process but for so many people they don't understand the opportunity\nSo they're only left with fear that they're going to lose their money you know where you're you said banging the drum about you know self directing a do it on your own rather than handing it over to someone who's going to charge you an arm in LA\nSelf directing a do it on your own rather than handing it over to someone who's going to charge you an arm and a leg and then not put you in a position where you can profit is price falls\nAnd seeing it day in and day out with students at the school to come in and you're saying I got to figure this out on my own I Can't afford to lose that money I'm paying way too much for poor performance in one direction or biased account I mean\nBack to the matter chant online trading academies process is going to work at any market condition in any marketing any timeframe if we can just learn to set aside a set of rules and and apply that systematically\nThe sky's the limit and back to the matter is we gather together as a as a school or going to be looking at all of the you know all the new things that are coming up for students to take advantage of all the different resources that they can have at their disposal all the different things that are going to be available to help them with this process of education and and just ultimately do better as a whole mean fact is\nTwenty two years the schools that are they're teaching people how to make better decisions and I said that people all the time that show up at the academy for the first time that you know where do you then we've been here waiting on you trying to teach you how to make make better decisions we've been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's amazing because what really is fun to watch is when they really begin to see that it's not as difficult the wall street has and believing that they're not smart enough to not sophisticated enough to manage their own money to make this isn't themselves\nAnd then they begin to realize that it's just a process that anybody could follow just by learning the skill and we talked about that earlier skill building process\nWhat do you see as far as people as as far as generation I mean do you see that more the older generation the baby boomers and maybe some of the forties and fifties roles are seeking more so this information or is it kind of across the board\nWell you know obviously different stages of life different concerns going forward you know a lot of baby boomers are concerned about losing this money again because they don't have the time to recover um but what a great time as it you know as a young individual to learn actually how to handle that money long term\nBack to the matter is I actually had a student just recently um that had this I ... it was just an eye opening moment they said you know for so long I've been led to believe that these markets are so complicated but they started to realize through the process of education that they're the ones that have been complicating it\nAnd here we are out there giving people a set of rules to follow a strict guidelines so to speak do this do this do this minimize risk here's how you know regardless of age people have some of the same concerns you know about getting involved in the market\nAnd those concerns can be alleviated by following a set of rules and I'm telling you the student had this ... moment just I've over complicated this so much if I can just simplify it down to spotlight set of rules I could eliminate the emotion I don't have to be afraid anymore let's start taking control\nWhen I started doing this our own I mean it's just back to the matter is anybody can do it ... you know that better than most\nMen that gives you a lot of great value on the inside to Chris thanks for being with us and what's amazing Adam is that you know we talk about the academy and they constantly focused on introduction to trading for income", "show_name": "Erick Erickson", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day":
