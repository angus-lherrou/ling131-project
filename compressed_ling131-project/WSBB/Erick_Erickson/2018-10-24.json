various media outlets breaking the news over the suspect the culprit the individual responsible for the bombs again a is multiple media outlets are reporting this this afternoon I Want you to listen to this\nI mean the targets are fairly obvious they've all been either a brought up by the president or were opponents of 'em and different context\nI was in ...\nAnd some of them in different contexts I it was an ... thing with my former colleagues at CNN and they're scared and one highly former colleagues said this is what happened when the president called the enemy of the people it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed you did go on to call it an egregious act\nAnd he did something interesting and it's something we rarely hear this president too\nHe called for civility and unity but he did not at all that he is often the ones selling all these divisions\nFor the reality is suspend belief and not see the context of what is occurring today with a president who has repeatedly suggested that the press the enemy of the people\nI was just that there is no disputing that targets as these particular devices as we've been reporting so far\nAre all connected to individuals that the president specifically and his political allies have been attacking\nYou know we we are in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president can the United states and it hasn't gotten a by I thought\nThat was from the view Fox News hadn't gotten a bomb yet a Fox News's gotten plenty of of problems with the past few years from left wing hate\nThey just don't advertise it I I Want to say this about ... the situation I worked at CNN for a number of years uh I Am over there now frequently on television are not as a paid contributor just someone who goes on I'm On a number of networks have been on Fox I'll be on meet the press this coming Sunday\nAnd I got to tell you guys\nThey're really good people at CNN who do really good work and I've been republic with my criticisms of various anchors were reporters there a including limited in increased Cuomo and a bird Baldwin of late\nBut\nThey don't deserve to be considered the enemy of the people and I know some of you disagree\nBut I don't believe they do\nThey spend a lot of reporters into harm's way to try to find facts on the ground around the world do I think there was a liberal bias of the network I absolutely do and I agree with Jeff Zucker he released a statement today saying that it is this violent rhetoric\nThat is so pervasive in our politics that is causing these sorts of things and the president and the press secretary should take ownership of it in this is where I have to break ranks with Jeff Zucker on that\nAnd Jeff Zucker and CNN and I had been critical of them on this they it Jake Tapper will Blitzer where exceptions and John King but by and large the network anchors at CNN move very quickly away from James Hodgkinson when he committed in mass assassination attempt on Republican members of Congress\nThey MSNBC or the various networks there is news outlets they didn't spend a whole lot of time\nTalking about a shrill rhetoric from the left when that clearly inspired James Hodgkinson to attempt ... nation on Republican members of Congress\nIt is I think one of the reasons so many conservatives distrust the media\nThat when you've got a ... a target on Republican members of Congress depressed takes a pass on the harsh rhetoric from the left but when the bulls eye is put on them from the president there suddenly like oh this terrible rhetoric this terrible rhetoric is terrible well it is but it is across the board\nThe press is not the enemy of the American people but increasingly I got a hard time defending depressed because they of maliciously gotten so many stories wrong the late but none of that justifies sending the bomb the CNN there is an interesting wrinkle on this though that I Want to cover after we check traffic just\nGot all the problems gridlock alert or five forty board that you would have to be prepared to go down bus here eighty five north north of Jimmy Carter boulevard onto the right they just

set out all the trouble that I just don't think we're really doing a number\nThank you very much ah you also the the bumps into CNN Today was sent to John Brennan the former CIA director and\nHe does not work for CNN he was on CNN and he made some of his many controversial statements about President Trump while on CNN but he was never pay contributor he's a patron to return MSNBC\nSo whoever did this is not well informed but I also do think it is worth pointing out hey I have great deal of sympathy for CNN but the fact is it was an individual who does not work at CNN who was targeted it was not the network itself targeted and I do think that there's a level perspective that needs to be put there I'll tell you what else though I think we need to\nThe prospect as it needs to be put there I'll tell you what else do I think we need some perspective on I Do not by the idea that this is a progressive targeting Brock Obama Hillary Clinton George Soros CNN or air and Eric Holder using Debbie Wasserman Schultz return address\nIn order to mobilize Democrats or turn people off when Republicans I've got some very dear friends of mine who are pushing the story today I Do not believe it\nI Do not believe it because I Do not think any progress a political activist is smart enough to do something like that number one number two I just don't find it plausible a it fails the ... or ... or test or frankly to me it just seems very very\nFar more complicated to believe a series of events that would let people\nBelieved that an orchestrate hand deliveries because many of these were hand delivered in all these locations as a democratic plop to help Democrats I I don't think that's the case I think we need to wait and see before we make presumptions about who did something like

I'm seeing a lot with the cable operators and that is raising the cost you pay for pay TV\nIn addition to raising the cost of Internet the irony is the cost of providing Internet to people is actually declining because I'm improvements and the way data is transferred but companies are squeezing more money out of you for Internet\nWhile cable companies still enjoy a virtual monopoly on the Internet access in most of the country not just metro Atlanta\nAnd raising the cost of TV need to give you a special warning\nIs more and more people bitch traditional pay TV from satellite or from cable companies what happens\nIs that the people who remain instead of being rewarded for loyalty or punished for that loyalty we've steadily higher prices people are converting to streaming services often using a Roku is like a central hub for television their home\nAnd is more people do that cable companies trying to pump up the revenue numbers simply raise prices on those that remain behind the very
