welcome\n[noise] hey good afternoon thanks for having me on shore\nA quick point and um [noise] I'll jump off the air but with the um with all of the inundation of messages about voter suppression um what are your thoughts on the possibility of things maybe getting a little out of hand or even some violence if the election doesn't go a certain way\nLook I think is a let's just take the house of representatives I still think the Democrats are the odds on favorite for taking back the house\nUh but I think that if they do if the Republicans were able to hold it in its possible by the way it's not probable but it is possible Republicans could hold the house of representatives and I think you're going to see antifa groups out there causing violence uh\nI Do see the you're probably going to see protests here in Atlanta I Do think that the ... campaign is working very hard on a grievance campaign for why she didn't win\nA I Do see for example all of this talk about voter suppression in in uh keeping people from being registered and what not none of it is true but it's going to have the effect of incentivizing people not voting um and then of course you know it's so brand cube was asked for example and\nThirty nine after the hour the Brian Kemp Stacey Abrams debate happens it a little while and there it leaked audio has come out today or Brian ... a telling supporters\nAre that are in the use of absentee ballots by the ... campaign quote continues to concern us especially if everyone uses an exercise is their right to vote\n[noise] common cause Georgia left wing group and others are coming out saying this is the the secretary of state\nAre trying to suggest that he may do something because he's in charge of what should you use other they're trying to say oh those are the conflict of interest I get this from people that do you really want a bureaucrat in charge of elections we have secretaries of state who were elected to hold them accountable\nFor running elections among other things and they're trying to play up this whole angle of of he's abusing his power they built this entire narrative structure the media's ... none of that they've reporter has been through the media to walk back numerous things like for example the Associated Press\nReporting that lady who had the the hype in his last name was a pending voter because of her hyphenated last name and it turns out no she was a pretty voter because she'd already registered was an active voter she registered again slightly changing the building of her last name of the flag did as a possible duplicate voter which was\nIf you actually listen to the audio and let me see if I can find the ... this leak out of you here Rolling Stone left wing group at Rolling Stone is playing this audio let me see if I can get this up here now I'm a delay in case there's something else here\nAh let's see on mute turns on all the fly are always doing we're\nGoing in our early voting was literally tens of\nMillions of dollars they are behind you get out and voted ever there they are a lot out of that ... they ask us for a number that was on the\n... or by\nA unilateral sizes they're the ones that you can also allows we got out the also that\nYou hear that there is nothing\nYou hear that ... there's nothing suspicious about their brain Jim\nAsked about how he he stack up it early voting to Stacey Abrams gives a matter of fact the answer that are campaign and outside groups are spending millions of dollars to turn out absentee ballots in early votes and his campaign's got us stand up to that\nHe's answering the question now the secretary's day but as a candidate about how his campaign shapes up versus hers in early voting and ... and then it was all she does is the secretary of state he suggesting he's going to suppress the vote\nNo he's not this is hysteria from the left that has tried to build a narrative that Brian give us suppressing votes and everything they've done has proven to be a lie\nFor example they claimed that Brian Kemp has thrown three hundred thousand people off the registered voter list\nWhen they leave out that makes this ally twisting the truth so much\nIs that the process is automated in Georgia and it's in compliance with federal law it happens in odd numbered years it did not happen this years they've claimed\nAnd it was people who haven't voted for seven years that the secretary of state and local boards of election have tried to find they cannot find those people and they've taken them off the list presuming they have moved if those people show up\nThey're able to vote\nThe other is the uh what we went over ... yesterday on the program is depending voter file pinning voters or people who may have had a a duplicate registration or they're not get Eighteen but they've gone on and father registration because they will be Eighteen or by election day\nBut Seventy five percent of the people on the voter file or people who put in wrong Social Security numbers\nAnd twenty three percent of those people\nWere generated by the ... campaign it was the ... campaign or rather than you Georgia project that submitted that paperwork and people I've talked to the doctor's office beyond the secretary tell me they think it was the New Georgia products ... staffers who actually filled out the paperwork themselves and they got the information grown up the voter\nThey're leaving all of that out there trying to shape a narrative and it's a fraudulent narrative and yet that's what they're trying to do to cast doubts on ... and I think the perverse effect as it's going to suppress the Democratic vote people say why bother\nIf you leave a bad taste in people's mouths this is Stacey Abrams yet again trying to divide people instead of unite people to try to win an election is very Obama like now let's go to travel just for\nYour writing here and the forty four of us do any by by at least then think about what down the road for any much clear for four hundred over Seventy five but to anybody about seven minutes from Seventy five now died\nWhen he was expressway but again I don't know what do you mean by that you would have\nTo leave me on that highway Seventy eight thirty nine but nobody wrecks\nThank you very much you know there's there's other Wendy Davis you know abortion Barbie from Texas who ran for governor there a few years ago I I Want you to listen to her spin on the Democratic campaigns and why they're not going after President Trump\nYou know I think Democrats are on their message and they understand what hasn't there at artists and I've had it right now they know that veterans are motivated fast on education on local property taxes as we are and during the highest imagined a law here in Texas\nYeah you see they're they're focusing on taxes not Trump but listen to this part of her statement\nWe had record turnout and our urban areas here in Texas Dallas County saying or three hundred percent\nIncrease from ten thousand and fourteen Dallas as in ... county ... county Harris County Travis County every one of them as deeply blue town as our counties that are saying extraordinary high turnout on the first day of early that and we expect to see that all the way for it to election day\nDo you notice what she's actually saying there\nWhich she's actually saying is that they're having turned out an already blue areas the Democratic party a Nancy Pelosi tougher as the chairman of the DNC and others are starting to walk back all of the rhetoric about the blue wave\nYou see I I've been telling you guys for a while and I said it again last night that I think there is going to be a really big blue wave in this country but it's only going to happen in already blueberries\nSo the problem for Republicans is that all the swing districts right now Republican districts\nAnd Democrats only need to win twenty three of them take back the house and so the odds are the Democrats take back the house by narrow margin\nBut this massive blue wave that we're seeing this already happened in democratic states it's happening in in urban areas it's happening in San Francisco it's happening frankly is happening in Atlanta that's why you gotta go turn out and vote for breaking up\nTo offset it there are more Republican than Democrat\nYup ... there were more Republicans the Democrats in Georgia early voting for Republicans looks good in these areas but you know you got the situation Florida with hurricane destruction there in the panhandle highly Republican area that may hurt rich gotten around to Santa Rosa Sanchez is hurting themselves\nBut the blue wave is coming it's just coming to an already Democrat area so it really does it matter\nRepublican areas are holding their own Republican voters are as energized as democratic voters and the early voting is starting to show that Republican voters are doing very very well the only state a swing state we're democratic voters are outpacing Republican voters right now is Nevada\nAnd that's to be expected given the trend legend about it but that doesn't mean they're voting Democrat because a lot of Democrats voted for\nDean Heller last time and the odds are based on the polling mercy none in Nevada he may pull it off again a but otherwise Republicans attorney now so yes there's going to be a big wave in November just going to be in already Democrat area so what does it matter [noise] Atlanta's\nEvening news era Gary\nUser militias accurate that'd be fine day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes to double you asked me\nTo help
