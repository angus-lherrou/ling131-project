it's it's all about Fifteen miles inland from there yeah\nThat's that's the way these things go their compact they're strong but they move right along\nAdjusted it's these storms that you know haven't grown up in in South Louisiana there's these storms just always\nHave fascinated me and it looks like I mean we're getting obviously the rain and and what not right now in the Atlanta area whereas further south where I Am we're going to get clock cleaned overnight it looks like according to everything I've heard but I mean what what do we expect right now in the metro area\nUh well that's right or not far to the south of us and uh we're still expecting hundreds if not thousands of ah ah trees and power lines to go down a but for the most part the uh metro Atlanta area pop or gets off a relatively a scot free but not completely\nIt looks like a if you go along or south on the line from Athens to le Grange\nAnd that includes ah some of our far eastern south suburbs anywhere along or south of there is where the worst of the rain or flooding and the power outages where will be a north and west of that area\nA power outages will be more the exception of rather than the rule but we're still going to get the wind and rain guts increasing overnight\nAnd into the first part of tomorrow morning\nAh we're already seeing eighty mile an hour wind gusts in parts of southwest Georgia as the center of the storm the high if you will as right around the right now ... about the border of a\nA Georgia Alabama and Florida in the southwest continues to move to the east and north east uh so we still expect\nA one to two inches of rain on average a isolated amounts over three inches in parts of the metro area the far northwest suburbs will get the least wind and the least rain and of course the south and east summers will get the most rain and the most wind\nBut uh after this uh by tomorrow afternoon especially a late or we could actually see some piece of sunshine as this thing I kinda slingshots off to the northeast and then of course we have some really gorgeous at long last fall weather coming in in time for the weekend\nNow that was the part that I wanted to get to hear I I was kinda shocked I realized that we got to get our propane tank filled because we're going to have like fifty two degrees for overnight low it a couple of days yeah that's\nRight that in fact as early as tomorrow night or in the metro area we're looking at Lowe's and forty seven fifty four and a pretty much the same for friday night Saturday morning as well and I even Saturday Night Sunday Morning still going to be quite cool so everybody's been begging for it\nAnd ah unfortunately we have to get through a tropical storm hurricane first\nBut it is coming so all of the leaves that are left after the hurricane blows through that or green or just immediately gonna fall off we're not adding color yeah [laughter]\nYeah but that's part of part of the problem when you go this late in the summer that's also part of the problem in terms of the damage from hurricane Michael in central and south Georgia as well as Florida because of this warm uh end of summer started fall we've had a lot of the trees still have plenty of leaves\nOn them and that then they get wet\nAnd then there are still on there to act as a a giant umbrella for those windows to grab on good grief look thanks very

headlines and pulling as well here's the interesting thing I'm In the warning dumped terrible section me till seven pm this a tornado warning is until seven PM\nOr so to just be careful you got about twenty minutes before you can call 'em down\n... interesting thing here or there is much ado about there\nBeing up to Seventy seats in play in the house of representatives I think that's garbage\nAnd the reason I say it's garbage is because I've been looking at where the money is being spent in the house of representatives and the Republicans hold roughly a twenty three feet majority and the money is in play in twenty nine seats\nTwenty nine seats that's enough for the Democrats take it back and if it's that big it if there is a democratic wave\nOr they will pour there will probably be some ... seat majority and the money is in play in twenty nine seats twenty nine seats that's enough for the Democrats take it back and if it's that big it if there is a democratic wave\nOr they will pour there will probably be some seats that fall in with the Democrats are\n... anyway uh whether or not uh they have a big wave just you know ... out of party power out of part out of power parties during the midterms tend to do well\nAnd so the Democrats will pick up some seats will they pick up enough they're only they need about two dozen seats to take control of Congress is certainly possible the Capitol hearing though has certainly inflamed Republicans and we can look at these swing districts Karen Handel ... looks like it may be off the map now for the Democrats um\nUh what's his name seat next to Karen Handel um ... his seat of the technical name I'm\nA lenders old chief of staff what oh my goodness gracious I'm Sorry folks um so focused on the tornado um anyway um ... it looks like the Georgia seats maybe at a play now for the Republicans are for the Democrats\nBut there are some seats even in Texas that the Democrats are hoping they can make gains on a let's go check traffic real quick with dogs on\nTheir own jump right here in in a tornado warning part about that at the end the forty or do you ask me and I were watching it on twenty\nFive is normal\nNormal or\nThank you

heavy rain in the Johns creek area and it's about to get even worse than the Johns creek area the Duluth area of the ... coming you're about to get very very heavy rain coming into your area I'm now
