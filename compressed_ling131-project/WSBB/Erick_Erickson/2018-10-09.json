let's get into phone calls uh\nLet's see who am I going to go to first huh yes Aubrey in Canton I wanted to talk to you about the Senate welcome\nHi how are you Eric how are you\nGreat um I called a couple of weeks ago when you express the opinion that Republicans based on the rate we're going to lose the house in a way that\nYou already stated that you believe that will lose the house but maybe not yes so you've answered my question I like\nYes so you've answered my question\nI like issue you would challenge that All right\nIf the Republicans keep both the house in the Senate\nShave your head on TV [laughter] you can't shake my head on TV [laughter]\nI Believe that strongly that we are going to keep both well listen if people will not war the Democrats bay\nI is so here's where I stand on the house I I think that the house of representatives\nIs going to be very very close and it's going to come down to about two dozen racist\nAnd it's all going to depend on ground game and I am afraid from some of the Republican consultants I've talked to a those involved at the national level so Rodolfo house representatives months ago that they badly spend their money they didn't spend it on ground game they spend it on TV ad buys because they make more commissions there\nI said like two and a half weeks ago that things were turning in the Senate and the Democrats may get an advantage in the capital situation reversed it\nUh and has given Republicans more momentum in the Senate so for right now for example in the Senate Republicans were thinking they were gonna lose Arizona is now to point race the Republicans behind but it's very doable\nRepublican so they were going to lose Nevada Dean Heller is now my head in Nevada\nAre Republicans weren't sure Josh how he could beat Claire McCaskill in Missouri he's now pulled solve all the editor for\nNorth Dakota is gone for Heidi Heitkamp Jon Tester in Montana is suddenly in a fight for his life he will probably win but it's not guaranteed Joe Donnelly looks fairly solid in Indiana until uh the capital situation you voted against capital and now he's tied in the polling\nJoe Manchin is safe\nMarsha Blackburn was in a tight race with Phil Bredesen into the sea she's now solidly ahead and Rick Scott has now ahead in Florida is looking like the ... could make gains in the Senate\nAh which is a month ago when I was telling you it looked like he can make gains now than they had a bad month and Kevin ... basically a saved the GOP in the Senate\nAnd the house situation now the generic ballot is terrible for the GOP but individual races actually they're not that bad right now there are about twenty four twenty six seats are that are really at stake if they go for the Democrats and most of the looked like they made the GOP is going to lose the house but they may wind up with a five seat majority\nIt'd be ungovernable but that's where we stand right now I'm Will know in less than a month now we need to go find traffic we checked with do survival and don't just say you know it looks like a twenty five of us outside becoming fully engulfed in rain here just about five minutes\nBy that or like to hear the

sitter and Stacey Abrams comments today\nYou know ... I think what they need to focus on is records I think they've already got evangelicals they don't need to fire up evangelicals anymore are evangelicals have the highest propensity of a group of people to go vote and they tend to vote Republican\nOr whether they need to do is a particularly in Georgia for example with Stacey Abrams a highlight crime issues there is a growing sense I think among voters of the country is destabilizing\nA when you highlight that the people destabilizing the country support Abrams that she has a bad record on crime that she was a bad record on fighting human trafficking she was a bad record on taxes are in their brain kid was actually good on all those things\nI think he has a compelling message there is a real gender divide in this country and the Democrats are trying to answer that up in in divided even more one of the of the things I think Republicans really need to do is they need to actually find some issues that appealed to moms and I think they have one handed to him on a silver platter\nThat the Democrats would accuse even your son a sexual assault if they thought they could get a political advantage and you can't reward that the Republicans need to hit that message\nEvening news very Gary breaking\nNews or militias accurate event will find day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes\nFive day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes don't you pass me [noise]\nHelping us these Clark Howard is on every weekday tend to die here I'm definitely as his Clark Howard ... his funds here by selling headline has only diamonds [noise]\nThis is our ... our mortgage rates have been marching higher\nAnd higher on both thirty year in Fifteen year mortgage rates in fact the rates of the highest they've been at any time in the last seven years so what are you going to do about that\nWell one thing is why don't you do what you can before you go through the process of buying a home and taking out a mortgage\nTo raise your credit score I Know that may sound crazy right but actually you can bend the rates you're going to pay simply by many cases just changing some basic behaviors about how you handle money if you sign up with credit sesame or credit karma\nWith both of them you're able to see what changes have you can make it will give a booster shot to your score is not unusual that you should be able over a matter of several months to raise your credit score as much as forty or fifty points where the big saving an interest [noise]\nForty seven done terrible the other day as the only the robot lady by north of the crowd there before families are correct for about seven miles idiot what do you find that break loose that don't but I'll do\nThe right there was a deal for everybody that even going oh well you might have cleared highway twenty even those low in that area before and after twenty Alex Williams school recover your\nSkills sluggish wander north bound from two eighty five of the newer strings Marta station then you're off to the races Seventy five north bound greatly improved trouble off to the right five Seventy five north ... causing some delays their\nMission for rocky by cameras in RV visit campers an RV an app worth and Tucker for them they're monster or they fail they're slashing prices on top model RVs these prices are so good they're scary does it can present already today campers N. dot com triple the traffic W se\nNo other vehicle while I was in Nineteen Mercedes Benz she LA as you go to the NBA\nUsa dot com and see for yourself or er visits or in the area dealer to schedule your test drive today\nNow I saw a tweet from ... not long ago where you had pretty much hot at with glass as what was the moment where you said that Donna I'm not doing this anymore\nWell basically golf I think that was the biggest problem because I can not follow the flight of a golf ball after three hundred yards and I couldn't see it sailed into the woods and I couldn't see it landed in the lake\nAnd waking up in the morning and just opening your eyes and there you go seeing clearly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Erick Erickson", "city": "Doraville", "day": "09"}
