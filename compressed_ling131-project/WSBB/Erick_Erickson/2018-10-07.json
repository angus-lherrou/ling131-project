may help you with\nYour money and your retirement and that actually is what we're talking about in this segment there is a um a article out there from marketwatch this as the best way we can improve our retirement system all these people who aren't ready for retirement is to start teaching financial literacy in school in classes\nAnd Chris that's not there so it almost becomes your job as a financial advisor to teach people what they need to know you're very active in that aren't you\nYeah we are and I think it's a\nIt's a shame that we have to get to a point where we're that\nKnowledgeable and educated on individual investing I mean nothing's on auto pilot as we move toward retirement I mean literally if you look at your portfolio and how it's set up\nWhen you move into retirement those assets have to be moved around and managed to fulfill your income needs and protect your legacy and not run out of money all those topics weigh heavily on the retiree the only thing that's on auto pilot is Social Security and that's not enough to live off of\nSo it is important to educate we do a lot you know we've got those we talk about the dinner seminars where you can come out and about half of that is education on things you can do to your portfolio immediately\nThat we think are areas of exposure and uh we have multiple people at those events said and you know we ... the fact that you're going through things that aren't just have come and sign up and become a client but\nHow do we leverage the current portfolio that we haven't even have engaged conversations with our current adviser\nAnd then we do workshops so outside of investing the things that are tangential to building a good retirement plan like Social Security in ...\nMedicare annuities for dummies Hattie it analyzed insurance products those types of things and then for our clients we have a different type of set of workshops that they can come to that's more related to the way we build portfolios\nAnd then you know its quarterly meetings it's one of the reasons that\nI preach these quarterly means on the show all the time and we implement them\nWe've gotta get face to face with our our clients to help them understand why we're doing the things we're doing so they can be educated and they obviously are it's their money nobody loves your money more than you so you have to understand where your money's being placed and is that the right profile for you\nThose things are extremely important and we bring it on the airwaves on a radio show we also now are on TV that\nYou know we're trying to bring it as many places in to as many people as humanly possible but you know you can only bring it to the airwaves or to these restaurant locations people have to engage they have to be there\nLet me point you to our website and this was a great thing for you to do today it even if you don't call us we want you to go to our website so you can see some of what Chris was talking about a on our website there's a radio and media page right there you can click on that and when we talk about Chris being on TV on Sunday Morning here you're hearing it now and you say\nOn Sunday Morning here you're hearing it now and you say oh I missed it okay well you can go to the website and you can click on some of that stuff\nIt's called them the money minute and you can you can check that out and those are all there for you you can also click the event tab and when Chris talks about the dinner seminars\nI've been to the dinner seminars and I've watched Chris do this and really what this is is I Know as you listen to a show like this you may have a financial advisor in your life and you're wondering if you're missing something well this is a perfect event for you\nA ... steak house coming up this week tomorrow night as a matter of fact on October the AIDS you can give us a call on that\nTo see if there's any places their papa do seafood kitchen in Marietta on the Eighteenth and the twenty fifth and then he talked about those client events we get food friends in finance as coming up at flemings steak house had perimeter on Monday October the Fifteen these events where you can come in not only ask questions\nBut you can sit there with a with a legal pad and they'd provide you with a paper and pen and you can write down some of the questions that you want to bring back to your financial advisor hey what about this hey what about that hey I heard this would this fit for me we want to arm you with as much information as possible because there's a a study\nThat was done here by the people at the American College of financial services they had twelve hundred people of retirement age take this test Seventy five percent of them failed it\nAnd I've taken some of these tests and usually they're very very basic questions about Social Security and you know how much do you need to live on and how it it just basic questions about four oh one K. and it's very very plain that a lot of people don't know how to approach this topic they know they need help\nBut then there's that hump that they have to get over of who do I get to help me that's a ... well\nWhen we start in our twenties and we put our head down and we're working hard to perfect our own profession and our profession is not financial services so we put money into a four O. one K. is were encouraged to do we get matching and we\nPick a couple of mutual funds and we watch it compound and over time it does well sometimes it corrects like two thousand and eight\nBut then you know mass this wealth and you have to start to engage the process of understanding how the the investment world work how Wall Street operate what's good for me moving forward is not necessarily what's been good for me in the past and you have to change your way of thinking you have to educate yourself\nAnd you have to start to build out a plan versus just investments and and those are two different sides of education\nThere is what are these individual investments how do they work\nWhich ones are right for me and my family and my portfolio built and then there's the planning side there's the income planning how do I protect my assets and make sure I don't get caught in a down market and having a poll assets out of stocks\nWere variable assets and Medicare Social security pension management it goes on and on and on but you got to take that first step and engaging advisor who specializes in it\nLook at your money as a pile of money on your kitchen table if it's a half a million dollars in it for one K. you keep on looking at that on a computer screen at vanguard or fidelity or wherever it is\nAnd it's just not real I Want you to picture it as a big pile of money on your kitchen table now somebody just came in and took ten thousand dollars away from you how you're going to feel about that they ran out your door\nThat's how passionate you should feel about your money you'd go running after that person so when you lose ten thousand dollars in the market or you lose ten thousand dollars to fees you shouldn't take that lightly you should have an active\nPart in your money give us a call and let's start that process right now we offer a retirement road map that gets you actively\nInvolved with your money let's find out where you are where you're saving are you going to achieve your goals let's figure out what the fees are let's figure out the risk let's figure out Social Security and talk about Medicare and those things might be a long way off but let's at least start the conversation\nHere is our number for all for nine zero eight eight eight\nFor all for nine zero eight we have an advisor on the line right now ready to take your questions we also can do this way you can text us the word road map\nThey don't want it walking out the door and that cash flow it's one of the reasons that these companies are that we talked about earlier down thirty to forty percent is because that models under pressure\n'em to things like index funds so index funds with something new people are starting to embrace that but that's basically giving up and handing over the market as you said and just letting roll with it baby let it go up and let it go back down to me that's maddening\nThere are opportunities to build a portfolio that has\nSlow and consistent and grow to it with layers of guaranteed protection from an insurance company or other financial institution that will say no if the market goes down you are protected but you can index into the market and you can get returns\nAnd if you get ... reasonable returns not thirty or forty percent a year\nBut if you're getting five six seven percent look at seven percent you double your money every ten years that's not a bad way to go if you don't have to deal with like twenty or thirty or forty percent law and look the market's up over three hundred percent I don't think for a minute this market can't wipe out fifty percent mhm\nSo that I don't think for a minute this market can't wipe out fifty percent\nOf what it's done over the past ten years it's it's there's nothing different about Wall Street and there's nothing different about their model today in my opinion versus where we were in two thousand and eight and there is something in this economy\nRight now that is a tipping point and the reason we don't know about it is if we knew about it we would be able to fix it but whether it's mortgage backed securities or it's technology being overblown like the dot com bubble\nIt's out there you just have to build a portfolio that has layers of protection in it and a lot of income planning to I I Wish they had stopped\nAnd reset the way we encourage people to build retirement portfolios while they're working I Wish they had implemented more pensions more guaranteed income streams for later in life if we do that\nIt takes the waves out of this market because people don't have to panic that they're losing their principal and all this trading doesn't have to take place you've got you're guaranteed income stream in 'cause a lot of your money is going to something that can't lose value\nGuarantees in income stream for the rest of your life but we didn't change that model either no we really didn't\nBut that conversation is just getting underway you're now seeing the Ross come into your four o one K plan your now seeing the conversation of annuities put into your four one K. plant these conversations are just beginning\nBut here we are ten years later with a huge market run up you could be just as vulnerable now as you were in two thousand eight have you changed anything\nSince two thousand eight if you are relying on the fact that the market went up that you've recovered\nThe market can take it away just as much so Chris when we talk about the retirement roadmap this is a big part of the conversation when someone comes to you and says job number one for you Chris is I've made this I don't want to lose this talk to me how we can have some protection that is that is a huge part of the conversation isn't it\nYeah so the changes in the four o one K plan you can put money into her off but your investments are the same to get it to get any kind of insurance products you've got to roll that out to an IRA and I ask what the roadmap will map out for a it'll be\nOK don't keep all your eggs in that four O. one K. basket you know as mad money Kramer said he should contribute to your four O. one K. what they're willing to match and then you should stop and look for other investment opportunity individual in stocks\nAnd we believe in insurance products but you've got to take action and get out of that cycle of its stocks and bonds and stable value funds\nWhere Wall Street's making all the money and we're getting\nLower gains and we should into good years but we are set up for a market correction and I see people way too exposed to it\nI think he got to take action now not not a bad thing to do going into two thousand and Nineteen get a second opinion get an assessment on your assets will\nDo a stress test will do the analysis and we will find most likely\nI Would say it's well over Ninety percent we will find a nugget in there a hidden gem that you can tweak or adjust even if it's not investing through our firm but keeping it where it is tweaking your four one K. obligations to ah hopefully offset\nUm you know having duplicate investments in there or having things exposed the bombs\nBut if we can roll out to an IRA you get the whole universe of investment including the insurance products and annuities\nGive us a call and ask for that retirement roadmap our advisors on the phone right now you can give him a call and uh you you met Eric last week or the week before and uh he's the guy who who is on the phone\nFor all for nine zero eight eight eight for all for nine zero eight eight eight as Chris says Ninety percent of the time they find some nugget in there that might be able to help you\nLet's find that nugget for you for all for nine zero eight eight eight give us a call there is no charge for this or ask for the retirement roadmap we're going to look at risk or to look at fees were to look at protection we're going to look at how do you create income will also take a look at Social Security and Medicare and legacy planning all of those things as well\nBut uh if you're concerned right now ten years after the financial crisis I don't want to go back there\nThat's a great start for your conversation for all for nine zero eight eight eight fight is online at on a leash or money dot com you can also text the word road map to the same number and our advisor will text you back and you can find a time when we can talk for all for nine zero eight eight eight alright so with that in mind\nThere's going to be a lot of people right now that are talking about ten years past the financial crisis there was somebody in USA Today that asked they asked ... column and he said should I bail on the market should I just pull out now pulled a ban on this thing and just say just take it all to safety risk what do you say to that you\nKnow we should have multiple lanes and your highway of your portfolio and you should be able to if he if he has that concern that he should be bailing on the market\nAnd you should be able to if he if he has that concern that he should be bailing on the market I Would not be taking money out of the market I Would be re allocating it within the market and picking investments that are still linked to the market but half protection so there's two sides to this there's the person that has some\nInvestor bill assets that they're not going to need to access for the rest of their life and they're leaving it as a legacy those you should fire your advisor for that money pay nobody\nBy an index fund or individual stocks\nAnd leave it there and if the market goes down twenty thirty percent leave it there reinvest uh dividends back in it and let it grow that's a very small subset of the investment community out there the rest of us\nMost likely will have to touch the majority of our money in one way shape or form and I'm not talking about using it all up I'm Talking about\nRequired minimum distributions so you had to go in and you got to take a certain percentage out and even if you don't need it then you've got to put it someplace else pay taxes on it and you need advisory services on putting together the plans for that\nBut that's typical Wall Street that we're talking about has anything changed in the market no\nThe investor has to make a decision and my all in all out and I see people all in or backing into cash which is going to be pretty detrimental if interest rates go or or as inflation goes up\nYour cash gets eroded so this guy's face with a dilemma right now and he feels like you have to make big bets on being in or out of the market when you could have multiple liens multiple layers of protection and you can stay engaged in the equities markets I'm not a big fan of bombs right now\nSo the markets at all time high I'm not a fan of bonds or cash\nWhat are we doing we are keeping you in the equities markets those are typically and historically the best performing asset class bar none you want to stay actively\nInvested in the stock market but get a financial institution\nTo protect you against any loss and put\nA stop at zero you can't go below your original investment\nBut you can participate in market gains and that can be your slowly but you don't need to dump out of the market or bail out of the market like this guy's asking the question on I Want my ... I Want my clients to be able to take advantage of the run up even if I think it's going to correct\nIt may still run for the next one or two years but I Want to layer of protection in their\nChris uses that a metaphor of being out on to eighty five you don't want to be in that fast lane that far left lane you don't want to be able to slowly and it ought to be in park\nYou ought to be somewhere there in the middle so you've got some some room to maneuver around and that's where we want to be financially as well give us a call and ask us for that retirement roadmap here it is for all for nine nine zero eight eight eight\nFor all for nine zero eight eight\nYou can text the word road map to the same number and also look up online at on a leash your money dot com coming up next there's a big local company in Atlanta and a big stock as well that one at hedge fund manager is saying you shouldn't short that mess on money unleashed\n\nBy forty nine in the cooler carrier W.

I'm going to build a wall to wall and I have agreed rooms you to wall which is our\nBack page um well let's you know listeners and you can guys come in and\nJoined us and follow us and maybe you'll get some content that's a little deeper in dive into the markets that we can do here absolutely in chapel and the things that we have to talk about is\nIn a market like this I mean the market always goes up and always goes down that's the only two directions can go and a lot of people don't understand there's ways of capitalizing the downward move with the market you know people don't understand what short selling is let's take a moment let's really get into this how can someone make money as the market's going down they can capitalize well\nThe Dow hit a record high this past week in today and then kind of\nFall below that after a while but even though the market's been going up and we've had a bullish trend bullish meaning up for nine years since the collapse into oh nine modest gun higher higher higher and complacency set in a lot of people think that you know it's never going to go down again we're back in that buying whole mentality just load up on stocks load up on mutual funds\nNo tree grows to this guy a lot of indications are telling us that we're going to have a correction we've been talking about this bowls and bears for a while we think the markets dramatically overvalued and most of your for one case track the market I mean probably Ninety five percent of the holdings in your mutual funds in the four one K. track the S. and P. and we see that all the time over and over again\nAnd what that means that you're the whims of the production of the market so when things are going up everything is great right yeah a things that go and hire making money you're paying fees while it goes higher but what about when the correction comes when it gets over ... and that's the retest it's fair value and we start to see the moved out what we're starting to see that now because even though the Dow at a record high this past week\nMore stocks were at their fifty two week low in other words for the last one was to hide what that means is that the markets turning over we say tops take time and so if you're sitting in a four one K. and the market starts to fall here's the problem\nYou lose you give your turn a winter ... or so you made money as it went higher then when it falls you give it back and people have that happen in two thousand I get an a wait and it's a real risk that's a real threat\nAnd there's a finite amount of money that's the real problem is that you can get really crushed in a significant move down and we expect to want to happen it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when\nAnd so you can profit from that moved down to a lot of people were able to do that in two thousand two thousand they profit from that many people lost and understand something folks the lie of Wall Street is that down as bad in other words if you watch the news at night and the market goes down they say it was a tough day on Wall street not necessarily it just fell in price it's a natural progression its\nPrice action we call it ... moves price changes nothing wrong with falling the problem is it's a bad day for the masses because they don't know how to make money when it falls they only know how to make money in one direction what if you could profit regardless of direction in other words would have up was good and that was good well that's the fact\nSee the light Wall Street is down his bed the reality is down as good if you understand how to profit and one of the most important ways to do that is by shorting short selling it's a great way to make money regardless of direction because we all know how to make money when price goes up when price falls that's when the separation comes that's when the best traders and investors take the money off the field\nAnd if you learn that skill as a listener bulls and bears if you go out and learn how to do that\nYou'll take the money to it's not difficult process is different and many people don't understand it and they get confused because Wall Street's\nLie to them that down his bed exactly they've they've been lied to they don't think that they can do that and the money that's out there in the market I mean they can absolutely capitalize on that downward move and you know a champion separate themselves from the masses because you talk about you know Wall Street you talk about everything you hear on the news that down as bad down his opportunity just got to take the time to learn how to do well\nIn the stock market for the last Ninety Days you could have short sold for and you could have shorted that stock now here's what that means a lot of people don't understand shorter because shortly means I'm selling something to enter a position in other words I'm going to sell something without owning it and people go how do you do that\nHow can I sell if I don't own it and that's where they get confused with what shorting is are short selling is or your broker owns this year so if we look at Ford Motor corporation back in June of this year it was right around Thirteen dollars a share\nIf you believed because the automotive industry has been going down consistently if you believe price was going to fall you could have shorter that stock when it was at Thirteen bucks right around June tenth June fifteenth early June mid June\nSo you sold that thing at Thirteen but this year the beautiful thing is you sold it without owning it your broker allows you to sell their shares in other words they housing inventory they have available shares for you to sell\nIn the anticipation that is going to fall in price because here's a way it works the minute you short sell for in other words you go into a brokerage platform you hit the button says some short so a hundred years old and she has afford\nEven to he leaves your brokers warehouse so to speak and goes into the market and you sold it at Thirteen\nNow you didn't technically sell it because you don't own a shortage which means that you're selling your broker shares because your goal in this trade in this position that you're taking is you want to buy it back at a lower price see the goal of Wall Street and the goal of making money in the financial markets to buy low and sell high we don't have to do it in that order though\nWhat we're doing is we're selling it at Thirteen I broke his allowing us to use their inventory to sell into the market somebody\nYeah that Thirteen I broke his longest use their inventory to sell into the market somebody pays it we don't care who they are they pay Thirteen bucks to share Ninety Days later it falls to nine bucks you buy it back\nNow when you buy it back technically that's called covering your short\nYou're buying the shares back the moment you buy those years back\nThey go right back in you broke his immune to it so they've been made a whole with their share of stock use their shares you sold them then you bought a bag of lower price you gave them back to them so they're good they charge a commission to execute that trade that the cost of doing business it's a low number it's cost of doing business again but what did you just do you sold is Thirteen\nAnd bought a back at night when you bought it back at night I went right back in the brokers enjoy but the foot all there was what you saw before you bought it for that stays in your account that's your profit that you\nMaking money on a dumb move in a stock sees me four dollars on a hundred four hundred bucks on a ... for grid in Ninety Days on a stock that you never owned that shooting and it's not a complex thing and people over thinking 'cause Wall Street doesn't want you to compete because they're shortening\nAnd they're taking advantage of price ... regardless of direction and that's what bulls and bears about we want you to understand that you can do the same thing\nI got lots of people that I Know that are no smarter than any listeners out there that are making a fortune when things falling price and you can do the say nothing about the market as a whole falling so when the S. and P. correct you realize you can shoot the S. and P. you could have done it in two thousand eight\nYou'll be able to do it again the next collapse it's not hard process is just learning the skill and what you do short selling becomes so important to your long term success\nExactly that key and is paramount so you don't have to worry about market direction and that's what a lot of people want out there\nOnline training academy the sponsor bulls and bears they teach a class specifically on short selling up your brand new the market you been in the market for years

the noted that he has put that\nOn their J. N. dot dot dot appropriate for radio but really what those will be wide open wide open very very few ah hold back there\nShe I'm Talking about a variety of things ... and ... I was having a good time but you know what when it comes to money it's a serious topic\nA lot of people out there when it comes to money it's a closed door conversation it's a kitchen table discussion they don't share what's going on with their finances with everybody but the reality is is the average person\nWould love to generate some additional income and talk about some long term wealth and that's why we have Chris Charles education coach from online training academy checking in with the school right now Chris what's going on buddy\nHey buddy it's good to be back with you guys um you know I got to tell you just listen to what you guys are talking about the fact of the matter is you're right people have these closed or conversations\nOn and they never really express any any concerns about their money until it's gone and that's a problem for many people so we need to start doing better is opening the eyes of the masses as to how it is it they're going to use the same process\nTo actually start generating some income that they can use to actually manage their own money in the markets\nFake recess Jeb down here and the good to talk with you let me ask you a question because\nOur electorate academies famous for its course strategy it's a padded system Twenty one years the academy has been around forty a global campuses and so a lot of times when people come in here they know the stability of the academy they love the support aspect\nBut what do you find most for most people is is some of the harder hurdle for them to get over because I Know the academy's whole goal is to teach people how to utilize the market for short term income grow their nest egg take over there for one case potentially take over there are a money and self direct those buckets\nBut what does some of the bigger hurdles that somebody who's just really thinking about taking over that money are you taking more responsibility over their investments in the trading and potentially learning both skills short term income on him well\nWhat if some of the biggest hurdles that people will come through or or that they face when they first get started\nDoing that you know ... that's a great question and you know as a coach it online trading academy one of the things that I have found working with hundreds and hundreds of students on is that they're in their own way you know they believe that the markets are complicated and the reason they believe that is because they've been told that\nYou know so if the markets are overly complicated and there has to be some type of overly complicated process to navigate them\nAnd it's just not the case it's not true you know I've heard you say this time and time again the great Wall Street lie is it you're not sophisticated enough to do this on your own and that couldn't be further from the truth I've got people coming into this campus and the fact of the matter is they never treated before but they can learn a set of rules and we've got people coming into the camp\nIt never traded before but they can learn a set of rules and we've got people coming into the camp says that have never managed their own money before and they feel like it's so complicated they can't do it but it's just following a set of rules so the biggest hurdle that a lot of people face is just getting out of the mindset of that they can't do it on their own it's just not true we see it time and time again\nWhere people can take a set of rules a process a plan of course strategy and they can follow these rules to a tea and do better long term I see all the time\nWell we talk always about its repetition and its skill building and see that's the real key is that a lot of people think that it's just like some sort of magic process that you're either going to be successful you're not they don't realize that just like any good career you have to build skill overtime but\nIf you do build that skill it opens the door to be able to make money regardless of director of the market and most importantly allows you to not have to pay those exorbitant fees that many people pay to somebody else to manage it\nSo if those are the hurdles those hurdles or just people not understanding that the simplicity of it what would you what would you say to somebody who who will maybe wouldn't believe that I Would say well it can't be as simple as you guys make it what would you say that person\nOr I Would tell them just to look at the process that the school teachers I mean you know for twenty two years of school doing around teach people a process of doing better financially and for those that feel like it's overly complicated why would they just explore something that's you know something that's obviously much simpler\nSo when we start to follow rules and we have a plan in place and again as a coach one of the great things that I get a chance to do is take people do and understanding of their time capital goals what it looks like have a specific plan in place\nAnd when we start to follow a process really eliminates the emotional attachment some money eliminates the fear of not being able to make a good decision so I Would tell people to explore the process explore the rules and find a way to do better\nThat's awesome man well you know what it's amazing Chris and thanks for your time it's amazing at him because the pedigree of our country academy a lot of people\nWe say the sponsor bulls and bears the pedal view that academy is absolutely amazing I mean the whole process that they teach is how to approach the financial markets is the way Wall Street approaches the markets in other words while she makes money virtually any condition up down sideways\nMost people you know folks listen to us right now you don't know anybody doing that are very few people you can do the same thing and once you start to understand is Chris referenced it's just a system is falling a set of rules it's like driving a stick shift after time you get ... get used to it because you just go through the repetition\nAnd we've seen people from all walks of life that have gone through that repetition in the academy and transition their life transform their finances and so for a lot of you\nWe get tired of people banging the drum on radio and talk radio about how you should bring your money to them and let them manage it you'll hear those certified financial planner regimented visors tell you that\nWe believe that you can do better yourself so we're telling you learn the skills of doing it yourself now those people are gonna be upset with us for saying that but you know what you don't need them we don't need them and the good thing is once you learn the skills of short term income or long term wealth or both\nIt can really allow you to get to those goals you said yourself and most importantly enemies you know it can really really set you and your family up\nFor the future well and that's exactly an online training academy the
