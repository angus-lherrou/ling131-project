I Want to walk you through the early voting numbers that we know of dust far or from the AJC this morning before we do that but let's go check with Doug Turnbull on traffic [noise]\nHey Daniel Eric vibe or did you do that you as being earlier down I asked you out of work to have any by Dominic like getting your era boulevard acted and according to the right but if you look at it as\nOut of the\nGeorgia hundred five hundred and forty\nThank you very much I'm\nSo here's the early voting data from the AJC uh the secretary of state's office for four Seventy five thousand people voted on Tuesday a there was Seventy thousand that voted Monday\nA hundred and forty five thousand early in person votes have been tallied sixty nine thousand six mail in ballots been returned\nThat two hundred and fourteen thousand one hundred Seventy one total votes cast is three times higher than the twenty fourteen period we're headed more towards the presidential turnout\nNow Democrats say roughly one third of early voters who didn't cast ballots in the twenty fourteen errors in the twenty four team mid term are now engaged and that's kind of Stacey Abrams strategy to win is to turn out those people\nBut there's a problem here in in ... who is democratic or Republican strategist rather Todd ... Republican strategist as pointed this out and the AJC documents this a toddler and found that\nOf the early votes forty nine thousand were cast by people who voted in the Republican primary compared to thirty nine thousand who voted in the Democratic primary\nSo you've got more people who voted in the Republican primary Cassie early votes than the Democrats\nSeventy thousand of the people who voted early cast votes in the twenties sixteen ... Republican presidential primary while only forty four thousand did so in the Democratic contest in twenty sixteen [noise]\nSo it looks like the people who are turning out are actually turning out in Republican areas and then there's this ... this well\nFifteen thousand two hundred twenty of the voters to skip the last two primaries came from counties President Trump won by more than Seventy percent which you know voters tend to devote in areas where the same\nSo you've got these people turning out from very Republican areas of the data looks if you're the Kemp campaign you got to be thinking\nThis data looks okay for me when you take all of the public pull it in here say I think public pulling the starting to go away [noise] other than polling will be done by universities in ... major uh institutions but a lot of the public pulling out there is so bad I mean just consider\nThe institutions but a lot of the public pull it out there is so bad I mean just consider go back to twenty fourteen when polling was not considered to be that bad and the gubernatorial polling in Georgia was terrible pollsters don't do a good job in Georgia polling and they have it for a very long time the ones who do\nAre the private polling firms that we don't see we don't see the private polling firms because the private polling firms are\nSupporting the candidates and they don't release their private pulley the only private internal poll we have seen is from the ... campaign and they wanted us to believe she was ahead of Brian Kemp and no one took that pool seriously including the other Democrats\nAnd then when you look at Abrams the Abrams campaign has started screaming about voter suppression of voter registration denials um\nActivities by Brian Kemp supposedly to deny black people the right to vote those aren't the signs of a campaign that's winning right now\nThe ... campaign is out there with a message of he's going to be good for jobs usually get people working and Abrams is going to wreck the economy the Abrams campaign has out screaming about um voters are being denied the right to vote\nThat doesn't sound like a winning message at the end either now the the the media spin is that oh she should try to fire per base I'm Sorry it doesn't fire up your base when you tell them that if you show up to vote you're not going to be able to vote\nBut that's the message right now none of that looks like a campaign that's winning to me I mean I could be wrong that can be a massive turnout but none of the data seems to bear that out right now\n[noise] Atlanta's evening news very Gary breaking\nNews or militias accurate and the federal five day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes don't you ask me [noise]\nWell us these car cowardice is here to help you save more spend less Santa going getting ripped off ... real estate I'm getting so many questions already\nAbout what kind of money making opportunities we're going to have during the super bowl and Atlanta next year and this is the third time the superbowls ballet and I think\nAnd the opportunities to make money\nOr not going to be as huge as you might think\nI mean certain businesses are going to be perfectly situated to make money from people who come\nTo Atlanta but a lot of the high rollers for the super bowl actually fly in the day of the game on private jets and leave after the game on their private jets that night\nSo you're really looking for sports fans who want to be part of the whole of vet cycle the super bowl is\nAnd ways to make money from them\nAre going to be like any other special event Atlanta that brings in a lot of people but we actually have conventions that come into Atlanta that bring a larger number of people than the super bowl will so you might be able to rent out your home on air BNB is I've been asked before\nBut that's not going to be a huge opportunity may be working as temporarily as a ... driver\nBut as far as big money to be made by us as individuals with the super bowl not really just enjoy the game\nMore clock tower in every ... every thirty minutes during this morning stumble you having me [noise]\nThe seven Daniel full flooring yard sales going on now that you're a little lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors up to fifty percent off in stock in already to go see big waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents get one look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off pretty finished\nHardwood from Ninety nine cents plus special financing get to the\nFull flooring yard sale today visit lumber liquidators dot com defined that had led to store near you\nThat when you ask me about ... er Cox media group station [noise] one of those twenty four hour news weather and primary five and a um seven fifty\nAsked me to you\nKnow it is six o'clock I ...
