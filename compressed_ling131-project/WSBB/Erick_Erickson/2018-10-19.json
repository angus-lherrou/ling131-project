Hillary Clinton may run again\nNow the people around here they're they're saying ... there's a high probability that she will not but it's not a hundred percent that she won't so she may do it\nOh my goodness ah that would be the best thing for Donald Trump issue one she you know to this day polling has her as more unlikely than Donald Trump I don't know that she could get out of the Democratic primary at this point if she ran\nI still think Joe Biden ... that that Joe Biden is more likely to win and what's so funny with all of this is the Democrats tend to have a propensity for nominating younger candidates and yet this time I think they may go with biting and he's older than Donald Trump\nWhich is fascinating to geriatrics running for president against each other nonetheless uh in other news so the political was running analysis and it is possible as I've been telling you guys it is possible but not probable\nThat the GOP could maintain the house\nThe reason is because some strategist are thinking the Democrats a push so hard on the blue wave that some Democrats think they have in the bag and they're showing an increased propensity to not vote and likewise as progressive Democrats become more violent\nModerate Democrats are thinking of staying home so the media is now starting to caution Democrats that is don't be surprised at the ... keeps the house by five or six votes ... people I I personally I don't care who wins the house\nI just think that whoever wins it needs to only when it by like five or six point so there's total chaos and nothing can get done so our freedoms are more secure\nUm and it would be really interesting that the Democrats won it\nBy only a handful of votes and all they could do is fight with each other over whether or not to move left or stay in the center or impeach the president\nAnd they don't have the votes among moderate Democrats to even move on impeachment they could tear themselves apart if they narrowly when the house what's even more interesting is that more and more people are writing off the even the possibility that they win the Senate\nUm ... even the Democrats waited as soon as possible but that's not possible so it's possible but not probable that the Republicans keep the house it is possible but not probable than the Democrats take the Senate\nOr we're now looking at a Jon Tester's in trouble we're now looking at Claire McCaskill probably losing we're now looking at\nHow do you hike camp definitely losing we're now looking at possibly Joe Donnelly in Indiana losing and Bill Nelson and for to losing and Republicans in Arizona and Nevada keeping their seats very fascinating dynamic and now Rick Scott is surging and Florida down there because of his handling of the hurricane\nUm ... looks like the Senate's going to be safe we can take nothing for granted you guys need to go vote I have seen the early voting numbers Republicans really need to go vote in Georgia you really need to go vote a when we did our poll Ninety six percent of our listeners going over five thousand respond it's Ninety six percent said they're voting for Brian give\nI suggest you actually show up at the polls and voted not just say you're going to vote for him you actually need to do it when we come back\nUm you you know the routine here's an e for example so my mother in law\nWas on a flight out west and\nOrdered it she's played on delta and when she got home on Facebook she was seeing ads for that brand of cheese that delta served her\nAnd this has happened to me and others as well I also have a friend who was it in a bar talking with someone and talking about a trip to Tanzania\nAnd got home and on Facebook begin seen ads for travel agency that could do custom trips to Tanzania and he was convinced that it was picking up his microphone and\nI've had other people we've had people called the show before convinced that Facebook Twitter Instagram that they are pulling their listening to your conversations through the Michael and your phone\nAnd it's not true and I've tried to disabuse people at this notion um it's not your particular if you have an iPhone it is not technically possible and if you're still don't believe that you can go into the settings on your full ... and turn off access to the microphone in camera\nFor the social media sites what is going on though\nIs a lot of Web sites now have a tracking code for Facebook\nSo if you go to a website with a for example you you just happened to to flip through something or Google Tanzania well Facebook can pick up that Googling\nOr if you use your credit card on an airline\nTo purchase a meal will they can track that and what one of the things that they track as you know in a lot of a grocery stores and what did you go to CBS or ... you go to ... you got your discount card\nThey work with outside agencies that collect all the data so when you use your discount card or your shopping cart at various um a store\nYou know Carter your shop recorded various um\nUh stores they can pull in what you've been buying so for example you go to the pharmacy because you're sick you buy a bit of drill or you buy night will or you buy cold an allergy medicine well Facebook's going to get that and guess what you're gonna start seeing on Facebook ads for other brands Johnson and Johnson for example um\nAs a ads for Sudafed if you go to a pharmacy and you buy cold products are you by allergy products and then you get on Facebook you use your discount card well then they're going to start showing new ads for Sudafed and whatnot\nAre the easiest way to get rid of this is particularly if you have an iPhone I felt a little better than the Android because of the privacy policies that apple has a place versus\nA the privacy policy is Google has in place or you can turn off make it harder for people to tractors is a setting in your systems do not track setting but one of the the hard things to do is is to escape\nFrom your discount carts and what you can do in ... again you can go to the rest of your dot com and see this article you can actually get some of these companies that track discount codes and discount cards and have them to stop tracking you but you have to give them all your personal information\nAnother way to do this don't use those cards or get new cards and when you get the new cards use a phone number email address that don't actually exist\nMake it up and they can't than tie you to the email account that you use for your social media Web sites of humor thoughts on this but we got\nDo that they already are guided by what they really didn't get the right lane born after hours very road\nSeventy one either God gave it to anybody over twenty minutes to write down what do you weigh the budget given the right lane hundred and forty four hundred and thirty five now trouble in the lead laying around normally think of the word\n... you know I got to tell you I'm not as freaked out about the privacy concerns is a lot of people are when it comes to these sites but I I I Do think I I recognize a lot of people have guns or do we get calls on this program so I was really glad to see joined us Stearns um\nPeace now I I Will tell you I Am I'm an apple fan if you're a longtime listener of the show you know I like apple or I really liked their commitment to privacy more than some of these other platforms your shows that I feel like I should disclose a Google and Facebook are sponsors of the research gathering and as I Do want you know that\nAnd that doesn't mean that I think these are glowing companies I I certainly have issues\nAre and privacy is one of those issues I I I feel ... sometimes on the Internet\nI Know you guys do personally I I have found value in Instagram for example the here they're advertising platform showing me things I'm actually interested in one of the cool things about the digital economy these days is that you don't have to have what everyone else has everyone has the same\nUm the Under Armour Nike athletic apparel or what not and and there's this great company called ... and I really have gotten to like their exercise of ... going to cross that now I I've really enjoyed their stuff and I saw the ad got their hands on on Instagram and saw it and it was great\nAnd it's just it's nice to have such a variety of products and I liked the advertising platform on Instagram I don't find that stock Russia I find it useful although as at the point now like yeah I Can't afford to buy this\nSo I'm hoping I win the mega millions ... do nonetheless uh if you text the word show to for for for nine nine nine I Will get you subscribe to my email in in the morning I Will get you this link\nTo Joanna strange because you really ought to read it it it it doesn't really deep dive into how these social media sites such as Facebook primarily Facebook how they track you on the Internet so that you're seeing ads and creeping you out thinking they must be listening to you it has nothing to do with that and everything to do with they've gotten really really good at tracking you around the Internet and in grocery stores and
