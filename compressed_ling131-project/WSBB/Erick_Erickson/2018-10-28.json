might be thinking about candy and goals and\nAll of that business we're thinking about your money and thinking about your retirement right now in kind of spooky market that's going on right now\nBut uh in any event Chris are four oh one case or something that uh we're watching\nAnd I've seen mind go down and a lot of people have done the same they they don't really manage it and you have in big bold letters on your website stop passively managing your biggest retirement as fed up there are a lot of money in those four o one K plan there are things you can do with it and a lot of people don't understand that well there was a conversation about it just this week\nOn the on the financial networks are mourning stars Maria Bruno was talking about taking some of that money early because we know at some point Uncle Sam looks at us and says okay it's time to take the money we need our taxes but\nIf you were to take the money early you might be able to avoid some of that here she is\nThere still options really that you can think about ... distributions to draw from this tax deferred accounts during those earlier years can fending for instance and the other could be getting serious have partial frost conversion taking his distributions and converting to her off\nAt create that tax every occasion that you may not have now that is a tough pill for a number of individuals because here accelerating Atari liability but you're doing now potentially the benefit of as paying taxes at a lower marshal ray\nTranslation take the money early in your sixties live off that push off Social Security or do a transfer of this money over to tax free money that way later in life you can draw on that money and not have to pay all these are MDs yep\nI completely agree with that first point and I don't think enough advisors and clients are having that conversation about how to balance withdrawals in those early days of retirement\nYou don't necessarily want to be pulling from your IRAs or your four O. one K. is a retirement plans when you're working because\nOf the tax bracket that you're in ... but that first year that you retire you should have a plan built while we talk about the retirement road map and a red zone is that ten years leading up to retirement and those first ten years in retirement\nLeading up to retirement you've got to build that plan and one of the parts of the plan is you have to know\nDay one of retirement where's my income coming from right and certainly a piece of it can come from and most likely should come from\nMoney that's never been taxed met with the high net worth actually is not a ... thinking about using our firm for advisory services and one of the discussions that we had was that he was about eighty percent IRA money four oh one K. money\nVersus taxable are already tax money not unusual right which is very nor life not normal it's actually higher for most folks\nIf not normal it's actually higher for most folks most of it's like Ninety percent and one of the strategies that we discussed was if he doesn't start to when he retires withdraw from his IRA\nAnd that grows to four or five million dollars well at a four percent withdrawal rate\nOn five million bucks I said you're going to be pulling out two hundred thousand dollars in income\nAnd he said well that's basically what I'm making today somebody tax bracket is not going to change bingo I mean yeah like have the conversation with your advisors I don't understand why either advisors aren't bringing it to their clients\nOr clients are choosing not to work with an adviser and they're building their own plan and and those are two strategies that she mentioned that have to be discussed\nYou may decide to take it all from your taxable money but I gotta tell ya I'd rather take it from your IRA and if you're gonna do legacy planning what should you leave to your kids\nLeave them stock in a taxable account because they get stepped up costs base ... so you know we want to keep as much money in your pocket and out of the government's pocket as legally possible\nYou gotta have that discussion now the ... conversation gets more complex\nBut certainly peeling some money out\nAnd converting into raw in small pieces shouldn't jump your tax bracket we can measure that will know what you're going to be making we work with your CPA or will work with our tax guys and will figure out a plan to have a roadmap to transfer some of that money over and pay small pieces of tax\nAnd now he's got a tax free bucket yeah and the tax free bucket retirements the best bucket of All right we'll either use it tax free or we leave it to our spouse or our kids grandkids whatever tax free as well so those are two strategies that under normal circumstances if you manage it yourself without a plan\nYou're probably not taking it into what effect and you should be\nSo how many people get into their seventies and they're stuck in this hamster wheel that you're talking about and they're writing a check to the government for thirty five forty thousand dollars a year and didn't realize this was going to happen\nYeah and I get I get it with my existing clients after we build a plan they send us a note or a phone call that says I Need twenty thousand dollars and\nWe'll just pull it out well what does the advisors not pulling it out with a plan yeah what if there is no strategy around at what if there is no conversation about is this a one time twenty thousand dollar event that you need or how much more for the remainder of the year are we going to need to pull\nYou got to have those conversations and you have to map it out now I Know they're unexpected expenses the ten thousand dollar event that I talk about every year right but I said it it's a ten thousand dollar event every single year we're going to plan my ... yeah I said let's get ahead of it and put it into the plant\nYou're listening to money unleashed with Chris often at the Hoffman financial group we offered to you on the radio what we call a retirement road map this is a full financial plan this is going to drill down\nWhere you are right now we're going to find out what the fees are we're going to find out what the legacy plans are we're going to talk about Social Security and we're going to really break this down in our next segment but if you don't have a financial plan something that's written down on that you can follow and you can adjust along the way as your life changes\nThis is something that you really need and uh if it's not created free let's help you create one and if you're worried about cost because you're one of our radio blisters were going to do it for your free right now\nGive us a call for all for nine zero eight eight eight for all for nine zero eight eight ask for the roadmap our advisors or on the phone right now\nUh we also make available to your texting features so if you simply want a text right now the word road map to that same number of it's not convenient to talk right now that's fine one of our advisors will text you back\nYeah and that is absolutely more common than you would thing and it's not just fifty five percent of the time or sixty percent of the time it's about eighty percent of the time\nWere able to find some low hanging fruit some minor changes you can make even if you don't hire are firmer our advisors to do it we can give you some solid nuggets of information to go back to your current advisor or if you manage it yourself\nTo implement yourself in your four O. one K. or any of your brokerage or a portfolio accounts\nIn addition to that we're going to do a deep dive into the structures because it's amazing to me how many people\nWe run into that don't understand how mutual funds the structures work so if you're working with an advisor to have an advisory fate and is that advisor putting you into investments that also have a say\nSo you get feed the death yeah you're you get one percent one and a half percent two percent two and a half percent that eats away at your portfolio you're not growing it as much as you could in a good you\nThe way your portfolio you're not growing it as much as you could and the good years and it gets very ugly when the market correct because now you're seeing not just market losses but you're seeing fees taken out as well so we want to skinny those fees down to one percent or less\nAnd there should be a bunch of ethics classes they have in there that have no fear at all\nOr going through the retirement road map and job number one is to find out where you are right now with risk with performance with ethic classes with fees job number two\nJob number two is then we'd be in an income plan I mean the key to retirement is there is no retirement without income right eye you hang up your cleats at work the W. to goes away the paycheck stops urine festival assets your Social Security all of those things need to replace it so we do a comprehensive Social Security analysis\nDo you know how many different combinations and ways to trigger Social Security there are for a married couple there's hundreds isn't there eight thousand [laughter]\nA thousand different combination while do put away your pencils yeah start to use a computer and we've got us off or a tool that will actually an act that out for you\nSo yes in its basic sense it's triggered early triggered for retirement or trigger it for eight or ...\nAnd then spousal benefit but there are eight thousand different ways in different combinations for a married couple so we're going to want to map that out set that aside after we run the analysis 'cause we've got to build the income plan not just around Social Security but things like pension management\nSo how many of you out there have heard the show before and heard about pensions and being under funded we want to do a deep dive into any pensions you have we want to research the strength of the pension we want to see how much a payout is we're looking for payouts of six percent plus\nOn the money if we can't get that end or we're worried about not having that cash in our hands we may take the lump sum option we've got to turn that lump sum back into an income producing asset for you so a pension management on top of Social Security are too big keys in the income plan\nThan the rest of it is we start to focus and shift from gross only assets to we naturally want to grow your money but income producing assets and so should your stock portfolio generate the evidence for you know and are their interest fixed income producing assets\nThat are reliable and sustainable annuity with income guarantees if you don't have a pension\nYou've got to look at that as a potential option for you to replace the W. to the paycheck that goes away you want things that are guaranteed in retirement you want to be like our clients that are texting me from Italy this week and saying hey we're having a great time but boy\nThe market's going up and down but there's no panic in their comments he wasn't taxing me saying\nOh our stock portfolios probably down else outlet all you got on it at Armageddon right you have plenty of protected assets and he's getting an income stream from\nSocial Security income annuity\nDavid ends from his portfolio and you know we're not going to ride through the storm if it becomes a storm but we can tweak and adjust things we can move things generally around in the income plan as long as he's collecting the paycheck we can use the market to our advantage we have time on our side\nThose at risk investments in a down market I'm going to argue they become you know liquid you know people say well if I buy a bond and I've got to hold it for ten years that's an ill liquid investment\nIf I buy an annuity and it has a ten year maturity date it's an ill liquid investment you want to know what's the liquid stocks that go down thirty percent in two thousand and eight that's an ill liquid investment anybody who sold\nMhm when it went down thirty percent wasn't building their portfolio to generate enough income to step number one is we'll analyze your current portfolio were Ninety percent sure we're going to find some nuggets in there for you\nSome low hanging fruit you can address immediately step number two is we've got to design and income plan that is sustainable and a lot of it is guaranteed for your retirement lifetime\nGoing through the retirement roadmap with Chris Hoffman it's often financial group and if you're interested in what you're hearing the numbers for all for nine zero eight eight eight give us a call and ask for the roadmap we're going through what you get and there's an awful lot fear step number three asset class allocation what's that\nSo you know I say it on a lead into the show the stock bond mutual fund model in my opinion doesn't work right so we want to take a look at broadening your asset classes out yes equities or find should there be international equities in there at the international markets have been hammered this year so far\nSo could there be international exposure that we\nWant to pick up moving forward if we're in the later stages of our bull market in that market has already corrected should we be looking at fixed income\nAnd that market is already corrected should we be looking at fixed income we talked about that earlier in the interest rates are starting to rise to a point where if we can get four percent or more\nMaybe we will add some fixed income into the portfolio and then you've got to add alternative investments in there you've got to take a look at these insurance products that have changed dramatically over the past five years and become very attractive to retirees that's their market you want to ensure your wealth\n'em as much as you want to ensure your health your your possessions so we take a look at insurance products as a state planning tools as income planning tools and they've got protection to them they're completely walled off from any market losses so that's a good thing in the later stages of the market\nSo the retirement roadmap is a really good look at where you are right now is so senior risk assessing how you're doing the performance is assessing how much you're paying fees then is figuring out how much income you're going to have developing that income for you when retirement and then the follow up it's the management of all of this\nYeah this is the most important part of all I ... and it sounds strange I Know we're supposed to assess your portfolio and find out what's potentially broken inside of it and fix that I Know income planning important and obviously we wanna reallocate your assets an ad to those and and create a\nRock solid foundation of investments and ethics classes in your portfolio but it's amazing to me how many people do that with an advisor\nHire the advisor they implement it and they never change it ... and it has to be a conversation your life is changing the markets are changing investment products are changing\nAnd the market is becoming more and more volatile it's not a market that just plod along and maybe that's because of the CNBC is of the world and all the exposure that we have to information\nBut when the markets are moving this rapidly up and down\nWe want to know what's going on with our clients lots we want to get ahead of the curve and know what the expenses are going to be and know where their comfort levels are and we want to communicate to them so they they know what the risk exposure is they know what their growth targets are and we map to that\nYou need to be CEO of your money as Chris many times says here on the program and the way to do that is to start with a retirement roadmap you just outlined all of the different bullet points what that will get you\nWe would love to put one together for you at no charge here's our number for all for nine zero eight eight eight ask for their retirement road map you can text us a text word road map to the same number for for nine zero eight eight and one of our advisors will text you\nBack and get in touch with you and sit down and talk about what time would be good for you [noise]\nYou're listening to money at least with Chris often and we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\n\n\nLike forty eight and Corey

have tuned in and said man this stuff's really helping us you guys are making the impact with us You're showing us the true\nWay the markets work the lives of Wall Street which we always talk about here and ... and bears understand some folks you're smart enough to imagine self direct your own money we believe that when the market goes down that's not a bad day diversification doesn't mean that you're safe\nAnd the trend is it always your friend and those are the things that Wall Street teaches the masses and we're here to break that down show you the real Wall Street show you how institutions approached the box and more importantly how you can profit regardless of what's happening\nExactly and you know what you have one of the big things right now is a lot of people are concerned you know this is reminding me of the market in two thousand seven I met a bunch of people in those seven and people are like the market's up starting to get shaky I don't know one is going to collapse I don't know one I don't know what to do should I go to cash and I buy more\nAnd really ultimately comes down to we got to preserve what we have and a lot of people have had a good run since March of two thousand and the market's gone up and now all of a sudden everything's ... around and people are freaking out a little bit let's talk about how they can protect how they can preserve the capital that they have eerily similar to two thousand seven record high\nStarting to get these big moves daily big intra day movement in the S. and P. and the down in the Russell I'm it's just a repeat of the film and here's the thing\nIn two thousand eight many people lost a lot of money about forty or fifty percent of money in the four one K. and manage diaries was transferred out of those accounts that wasn't lost\nJust went to somebody else some understood how to make money regardless of direction so there's a lot of listeners right now and if you're driving down the road right now and you're hearing us in two thousand and if you're four one K. got hurt badly because of the collapse\nHere we are ten years later\nWe're expecting other collapsed and many of you probably most of you haven't done anything different you're still not four one K. you still got all that money at risk think about that and I'm going to be blunt shame on you this is your wealth\nAnd you are not changing anything in this things you can do to protect and preserve capital this things you can do even in a four one K. or an IRA to not lose in a collapse of the market at least protect against loss and\nThere's other things you can do to profit from it so the focus is is that if we're not managing risk if we don't have a position of place that says if this thing collapses I'm going to walk away unscathed there was virtually unscathed with a small pre defined loss\nWhat's your plan because we're expecting it were calling for the markets overvalued and when it falls capital preservation got to be so important is the problem if you wait until it happens it's too late\nWell exactly that's it a lot of people in two thousand seven they didn't know what to do they got paralyzed two thousand eight they got crushed they sat there and watch this thing go down and all of a sudden two thousand nine rolls around that go now what what exactly what you said they missed it\nThey don't understand that they need to be they need to be proactive rather than reactive and capital preservation doesn't mean you get out of mutual funds and go to cast not necessarily cash is probably safer but let me tell you something I met a man of two thousand\nWhen the market fell forty percent and he said well I was okay I went to cash right before the collapse well\nThe currency that he was holding the u._s. dollar because when people tell me they go to cash only means the U.S dollar they're not going to hold the ... dollar or the euro and should they should in some cases they should this guy said I cashed out right before the collapse of two thousand and I was fine I said you weren't fun\nI said you realize that the value of your dollar fell thirty seven percent between the collapse of two thousand and the bottom of two thousand two in the financial markets so you had the same amount of money but had thirty seven percent less buying power that's a real number of folks in other words cash isn't always the safest haven\nIf he had gone to the Australian doll he would have grown as account exponentially because that currency at that time was increasing and value\nLet me tell you something folks capital preservation means there's things that you can use in the market to ensure that you don't lose or to ensure that when you do lose its small and pre defined\nThere's things that we can use like exchange traded funds that are inverse funds so in the market goes down our account grows it it's inverse to the actual performance of the market there's options\nOptions are insurance people couldn't protecting hedge their positions in their portfolios with options if they understand it and the beautiful thing is that a lot of times you're basically ensuring for pennies on the dollar and if the market collapse as you walk away with a very small pre defined last think about that\nThere's so many things that people can do here's the problem and you're four one K. you believe these two things one that up as good an down is bad and to that if it goes down it's going to have to ride it out because you'll never get out at four one K. God Forbid you move that money to something else which is a travesty because\nWall Street as you convinced that you shouldn't move that money and you'll just write it down your turn or winter into a loser we see it all the time you can't afford that folks here's the reality of the mass\nOf not protecting your ... your money\nIf you take these big losses like in two thousand two thousand they expect a big loss coming forward\nYou'll run out of ... years before you hit your financial goals in other words you're a lot of time to grow your account because those big losses are draining your account and now you're trying to get back to break even do you realize that a lot of people took them almost eight nine years to get back to break even\n... is that a lot of people took them almost eight nine years to get back to break even know what the collapse of two thousand eight and here they are now break even or there were they were the problem is or nine years older and here's the other problem\nThe markets geared up for a collapse again think about that is the definition of insanity that's the masses we need to learn the skills of capital preservation you need to understand the things we can do to keep ourselves safe no matter what the market does we can profit no matter what the direction but at least we have to protect because\nIf we wait to their house burned down\nBefore we ensure its\nIt's too late now the insurance is going to cost the replacement value of your house think about that\nSo we have to be proactive and have a plan in place where if the market collapse as we're not going to take the brunt of the loss and we could still take the upside of it goes in the direction we think\nThat's truly understanding market movement in price and the problem is with the masses Adam they're convinced that up is good in doubt as bad and they don't want to touch their money because if they touch it they say I don't know what to do that there's a lot of simple things that you can learn process he's that can help protect and preserve and most importantly keep you a check for those financial goals long\nTerm well Jim you said all the time it's it's it's a skill learning how to handle your money regardless of market direction as a skill understanding how to protect the money is a skill and if someone just as if someone looks in the mariners honest with themselves do I know how to handle my money and the average person there was no they put their money outside arm's reach\nBecause if it's in that four one K. was in that are and they can't spend it well and you know I Love about the academy on like trade academy our sponsor\nThey each each average people how to protect the wealth in other words if you're in a four one K. if you got money and IRA there's things in the market instruments you can use ethic classes to protect and preserve and still give you the opportunity to your goals and the problem is is that many people don't realize how to do it\nThe academy is put together a plan in place and it's helped a lot of people like you and I asked him\nTo be more successful in preserve capital because it becomes that important especially when we're expecting a big move down exactly in capital preservation is paramount and market like this and\nPeople out there they're concerned about the correction they're concerned about the sell off and you got to understand the protector out four one K. and I are re online training academy the sponsor bulls and bears they have a class specifically on Capitol preservation of your money in the market

people the lives of Wall Street and give you a solution because you know what it is not as difficult as Wall Street wants you to think and many of the most successful traders and the rest of that I Know have never had any background that they just learn the skill from the ground up\nExactly in right now we're taking the time to check in with our sponsor online training academy contacted headed down to the school right there talking to education coach Chris Charles Chris what's going on buddy\nHey buddy man listen it's great to be back with you guys as has been one of the highlights of my week for a while now\nWell we appreciate taking the time I Know you've got a lot going on at the campus what's going on down it online training academy I mean what's one of the key things that are happening these this week\nWell fact of the matter is we've got a bunch of classes that are going on and and people are exploring you know multiple markets and if I could add um I'd like to take a second just kind of clear up a misconception that I've seen you know a lot of folks artist painting that the only people that can participate in the market are the folks that have an abundance of time and in fact of the matter is\nThat we're getting a lot of folks coming into the school and they're living their lives you know they've got jobs lives obligations responsibility that got PTA and soccer practice in gymnastics lessons and horseback riding lessons and they're trying to find a way that they can make ends meet and do all these things at the same time and what we're finding is people are coming to the school with the main focus on trying to generate some additional strings of income\nHey Chris it's champ good to hear from you\nWhat what's exciting is is that when a lot of people finally realized that the market to provide them that you may income then they start to think well stocked with the way to go I you know focus on stocks because in the United states as you well know that's the main asset class of people use with trading and investing\nWhat do you see when people start to realize that there's other things they could trade and what's really the eye opening thing for a lot of students when they do realize that\nWell you know a lot of people do come into the school and they maybe they have a basic understanding of stock\nMaybe they'd never treated before but they realize that there's you know there's an opportunity in the market and they assume that the stocks you know stock market's going to be the answer for them and\nUsually it's not and the reason is because so many people are coming in here exploring how do I take a little bit of money and and get a decent return and unfortunately stocks not going to get people that opportunity it literally is a market that requires the most amount of money it's opened up\nBe as a market that requires the most amount of money it's open the fewest hours with the least opportunity and with folks come in here they start to explore these other markets like the currency market you know we've got a currency classes coming up in the ... market or they start to explore things like the futures market\nAnd their goal is to take a little bit of money and get a decent return but you know as as you talk about all the time change as a matter of following the rules and being systematic so we can take people through a process of\nGetting started using alternative markets that a lot of times they're not familiar with\nAnd we can start to explore these options that give them an opportunity to generate these additional streams again most of the students here the school or not folks that are trying to figure out a way they can quit their job and live off the market and while that does happen\nThat's not typically the goal for every person that I mean they're trying to figure out how can I in court with this into my life and we can do so with a plan in place that allows them to take some money and use it in these alternative markets to generate the income that they're looking for the additional stream of income\nIt's a it's a game changer for a lot of folks champ\nAnd and you talk about it a lot of those parents ... and those futures accounts that people open up\nThey literally can start with a thousand bucks a few hundred bucks so they really don't have to have a high bar of capital to get started and the problem with stocks as we all know is\nThere very capital intensive I'm going to buy shares of stock and got to utilize a lot of capital by that year when I use futures encourage these it allows me to be able to have less in the position still get a good ... a good return what do you see when people start to understand the futures market in the ... what does that do for them personally because\nThey didn't come into the academy no those are alternative asked that causes that could use what's the biggest thing people get surprised when they see the futures are currencies are options as an alternative\nWell you know champ I actually think that the misconception about the market and the stock stock market being their answers scares a lot of people away from it because they assume they do have to have so much money\nAnd the average person is coming in here and sitting in this giant on this giant pile of money and they're they're wanting to play with it they're trying to figure out how can they take a little bit of money out of their budget each month and put it to work\nAnd one of the big eye opening things for students in this environment is when they realize that they can use for action futures and the power of leverage to put a small amount of money at work in a marketing still get a great return\nBack to the matter is for many people they come in here such hitting one thing and when they start to explore the process they realize there's more opportunity than he could ever possibly imagine\nThat's awesome Chris and we thank you for checking in with us and Ali ... thank you to the sponsor of on trade academy we really appreciate your guys what's amazing what Chris reference was\nIn this country the U.S it's all about stocks I mean when you listen to the news they talk about the ... and the NASDAQ and the S. and P. and those are all stock indices yet when we look at the global market the size of the sheer scope\nThe currency market is immense the futures market is a mess and a lot of people don't even realize is up as soon as those markets and what we love to do is we love to share with him at when I've traveled the world for online trade academy I've been in Dubai in Mumbai in Jakarta we don't talk about stocks because for the most part\nThey're not used in those areas only in the United states we focus on stocks there's so many different ways you can play to create an income and the markets and what's great is that the academy allows us to start to explore some of those different opportunities exactly", "show_name":
