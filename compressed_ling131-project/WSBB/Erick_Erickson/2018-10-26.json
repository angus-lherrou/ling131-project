S. B. talk these Stacey Abrams campaign message and why it sounds like a losing message when we come back there is a problem in a pattern that you need to pay attention to first though let's go to Joe and locals grow welcome Joe\nHow you doing good how are you on the order up on a screen or I wouldn't take but a second and when I asked this question real quick no ifs ands or buts about it we're gonna have to invade South America that as well on doors all that and now I Know on a cruise council\nAnd our last spring so it's a ... grader ...\nAll right okay so so let me tell you a Joe I'm Glad you raise this issue because a lot of the president's supporters don't\nBelieve the United states needs to uh be aggressive militarily abroad I think we need a new Monroe Doctrine he does not get enough press coverage but\nChina is buying up mineral rights and oil rights and minds in central and South America is taking over control of the Panama Canal and is essentially a ...\n... putting incursions into the western hemisphere is only a matter of time before they have military bases in central and South American countries\nWe eat any Monroe Doctrine and part of that means we need to aggressively aggressively involve ourselves in the affairs of our southern neighbors Mexico is a failed state\nIt is a civil war and it doesn't get coverage some of these other Central American countries are as well Venezuela the economy has collapsed it is in debt to the Chinese and the Russians\nThey are establishing military presence is down there the drug lords had been in bold and uh yes I I totally think we need to figure out an intelligence and military strategy to deal with central and South America we and we may need to invade\nSo just be advised down eighty five south of the city is really where all of it is everything else by and large clearer till you get up north of ... very light drizzle I can see in the radar but\nOtherwise we're mostly clear um I have\nNoticed this there was a big story developing in Texas the it's interesting in that there is a Twitter feed the bills itself as\nAs some sort of millennial news service\nAJ plots\nUm news for the connected generation\nSherry and human struggles in challenging the status quo it has nine hundred eighty four thousand followers on social media\nAnd they put out this this tweet Texas election officials\nConfirmed that voting machines used in thirty percent of its counties including its biggest are switching people's votes including the Senate race between Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz the GOP appointed officials say they have no legal authority to update them\nYou got this Texas officials\nCouldn't for voting machines used in thirty percent of the counties\n\nAre switching people's votes including the Senate race between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke GOP avoided officials say they have no legal authority to change them\nHe'll just isn't true\nThere's no link to the story by the way there there is no link\nIn the story\nNo link\nIn the story this is what Trump\nSupporter set in Texas in twenty sixteen that Hillary Clinton\nSupporters were\nOr that Donald Trump supporters were casting their vote in Texas and the votes were cast for Hillary Clinton and Texas officials looked into it in Republican areas they said this was happening\nAnd it was ... he was idiots using the voting machines and probably idiots this time\nUsing the voting machine to one of I mean you've got to be an idiot if you were cast your vote for Beto O'Rourke middle knew how to use the machines that's what's happening in Texas there's this is so irresponsible though there there's no link in the story\nNo link at all absolutely just just crazy now I Want to talk about the same thing happening here I've been told by several people including a reporter that they believe that\nEither Democrat or Abrams campaign staff directly are giving out reporters' phone numbers to certain voters and telling them to direct dial these reporters to say that their votes are being changed on voting machines than when they try to vote for Stacey Abrams they're being their vote as being gassed for\nBrian Kemp there's no proof there's new evidence no one can get it to be duplicated and yet they're making this claim this is a claim that comes up all the time and I want you to walk through this pattern with me of this story were seen as they try to claim Brian campus stealing the election\nOf follow along with me or after we check with ... traffic for\nMe to do it while you're on the out of the travel advisories still only if I was down in a way of Ashford wrote an out of the family and what do you want to\nMount Vernon as an alternative that they're not so bad when you find out that way and pillows God drive twenty volume only\nWorking around the memorial Dr area and it was able to do what do you want to let you know the south I\nThink you very much so both for early voting started the Abrams campaign was arguing that three hundred thousand voters had been improperly removed from the rolls\nThe reporters\nWho bothered to report the facts turns out that these people\nWere improperly removed these are people who hadn't voted in seven years\nThe secretary of state's office tried to find them and Clinton and so they were removed from the rules\nAs having no longer exist in fact the number they said were three hundred thousand it turns out that when you subtract the people who were dead or in jail it was a hundred thousand and the secretary of state's office tried to find those people couldn't find those people and we did four\nYears four years to remove them\nAnd they haven't removed any this year it happened last year\nSo then after that they started complaining about the absentee ballot ... Brian Kemp is filed a motion to stop\nThe absentee ballot injunction in ... county you should know but\nThey start complaining about absentee ballots first it was the registered voters actually take that back after the registered voters it became the pinning voters on the ... there are fifty three thousand people who've been moved from the act to file to the pending found no no no there is a painting voters can show up on election day and vote so it's not true that they can't vote in\nTwo Seventy five percent of those who are on the ... voter file not fifty three thousand but forty six thousand\nUh they put in the wrong Social Security address your driver's license number and twenty three percent of those came from a groups associate with Stacey Abrams\nSo then they said oh the absentee ballots the absentee ballot Pete they people are are having their absentee ballots are addicted because their signatures don't match well if you're saying it's yours don't match and then you're absentee ballots not allowed to count\n\nSo now they've moved from registered voters to pinning voters do absentee ballot or you know and there was a complain about early voting as well that there were problems with early voting machines network and whatnot and now they've moved directly to the machines that the machines are casting votes for brand kept when\nYou touch Stacey Abrams is not true but the meat is yet again running this report\nNo this is the closing argument of the Democrats in Georgia the ... election is being stolen from them that is not a winning argument\nIf you're screaming that the rules are unfair or that someone is cheating that's not a winning closing argument and in fact I Would suggest that probably tells a lot of voters you know what my vote it's not going to count anyway so why go vote\nThis has\nEverything to do with trying to get the Democratic donors who have funded Stacey Abrams for four years to be OK with her coming loss\nYears to be OK with her coming loss that's what's happening\nIs a pattern is a sustained pattern of complaining about the rules and screaming racism that is not a winning closing argument\nBrain kept meanwhile is out there saying he's going to make a Georgia an economic growth center in the United states KIPP is out there saying he's going to give teachers pay raises\n... out there saying he's going to get the government out of the ways that the private sector can gr jobs in the states that's his closing argument\nAnd the Arabs arguments to complain about the process and complained about the voting and complained about the machines and complain about the balloting and sue sue sue sue sue\nNot a winning campaign that's not the message of one but you know what she can still win 'cause it's still close unless you go vote\n[noise] Atlanta's evening news theory Gary breaking\nNews militias accurate than the federal five day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes don't you ask me [noise]\nHelping us these Clark Howard is on every weekday ten to midnight here I'm definitely as his Clark Howard obtained sponsored by selling them rather headline has only dining\nCar cowards because you're responsible for your own healthcare\nPurchasing a plan for yourself next week is when open enrollment begins for buying health care on one of the state federal exchanges and the good news this year\nFirst time this has ever happened since Obamacare started beginning of this decade premiums on average around the country have dropped some states quite a bit small number of premiums went up but\nIt's a stunner that the cost of buying health coverage may in fact be cheaper now these are the plans that cover pre existing conditions and you can't be excluded from various coverage has\nThis is also a time that can be confusing because more and more plans that don't cover pre existing conditions are going to be available for next year but this is for traditional full coverage plans [noise]\nYou know do you do write later to block on the north side out by the west was an ad for nobody there digression daily nobody noticed outside out of the\nMarket it looked like somebody shouted highway one third of all the sounds under five\nMinutes to ... by the way through largely wrote it down and got a couple of hours ago\nFour hundred and Seventy five five Seventy five and all cleaned up back to the speed limit rides you had been to the northern suburbs this report brought you buy the trick play college football hall of fame on October twenty seven twenty eight the experience spooky sights and sounds that detect play college football hall of fame", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Erick Erickson", "city": "Doraville", "day": "26"}
