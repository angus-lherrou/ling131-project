E. N. Z. on business dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell come back to land on this presented by the university says that have business school I'm your host Richard\nLens this week we're chatting with Greg McGarry director of athletics at the University of Georgia so everyone's sky high you know my wife tells me or\nYou know um happiness is when expectations are are met or exceeded et cetera and so um I I Would I Would think\nUGA kind of in a tough position because expectations can be any higher uh and so how do you how to handle those expectations you try to calm everyone down or do you just go with it\nI think he focused on the things you can't control and were you for some get into trouble as they listen to all the noise and Malta prognosticators and everyone about telling me how great you are\nAnd uh so the belief that every sport and I know Kirby subscribe to this is that you you hit the reset button you start over you have to develop a whole new set of leaders that might not have been merged with the tremendous leadership that we were provided last year by our seniors but you know heck you can be a leader when you\nProvided last year by our seniors but you know heck you can be a leader when you're a freshman or sophomore junior you don't have to you're not entitled to be that at a certain time of your life\nSo everybody has to view themselves as leader but some of ... I mean these are young young men that are playing a highly competitive game they're trying to balance so many things on his campus\nBut I Do think that if you listen to the noise and you pay attention to that stuff and you listen to blogs and all this stuff that's where you get into trouble and that's where you start maybe feeling good about yourself and so\nYou control would you control you focus on getting better every day and then that's not only in football is with every sport we happier and really ever staff member what can they do today to make the University of Georgia better so that when we're in a position to maybe capitalize on something we are ready so that you're planning that's\nThat's brainstorming that's trying to uh for see a little bit in the future about what if what if we happen to to be successful in this game plus our plan so\nThere's a lot of thought that goes into that but really you can't listen to to the noise all this held that\nChatter gotta get your as early and can really I felt like it was a great testament to the entire program and Kirby that those seniors came back if you think about what's on the line for them and to make those those choices that I think that showed such a love of the school and the entire program\n[noise] well I view that is really validation of Kirby's playing uh because I promise you if they didn't feel like they were getting better if they didn't feel like that they were being appreciate it if they didn't feel like this was an environment that would help them get to the next level\nThey would have access to the program after their junior year right but sort of a from an athletic director ... it was it was phenomenal feeling to know that these young men want it to come back and they weren't happy with the way the season ended last year and so they wanted to\nTo make things better and they enjoyed the experience and and to me when a student athletes able to sit back and said that was a phenomenal experience and we were able to accomplish maybe not all of our goals but Ninety nine percent of them\nAnd they're on track to graduate and and they're checking all the boxes as far citizenship and things of that nature\nThose the great things about college athletics and and it was so pleasing to see those gentleman say you know I won't more\nIt must be strange that you know to be part of an organization that so much of their opinion about you\nIs on the shoulders of Eighteen year old and we all were Eighteen once right right\nAnd I I don't know that I was making all the best decisions and trying as hard as I could have as an Eighteen year old it you know I was trying hard at all kinds of things but uh so uh what it must be somewhat strange that you know you will be judged the whole program based on you know if someone drops a football somewhere\nAbsolutely and that's just that's part of what we do and they were in the process of of helping young people\nNavigate all of the complexities of their life and uh if it were simple a lot of people would do it and a lot of people would be very easy to do beef absolutely but it's difficult but if you long as you get the right student athletes here that want to do the right things is a great thing\nA concrete structure in the west end zone but they will notice the new school board the video board scoreboard and the new sound system that will be a atop the the the video board but\nI think those will will give people an idea of what will be taking place in two thousand Eighteen during the season but we're so excited to let everybody see what it looks like because nobody's seen it yet what's her yeah low it is kind of a new and and so I think people will be excited anytime you're you're able to be a little bit\nLarger and more technology advanced like we are going to be not only in the\nIn the uh I call it can't afford the television\nAs compared to what we had which was not old technology but we've got the newest and finest and the sound system should be as good as anyone in college football and and we hope\nBetter it must be an interesting construction challenge ducked get walking here a little bit but\nYou know the stadium all of our great memories from back in the day right in some heartbreaks right of all kinds probably a and the stadium is coming up on a hundred years old I think Ninety something and to come back to that old structure\nThat we love and tried to upgrade it there must have been some interesting challenges plus the get it done because you know the season ends and now you got to hustle\nUp and make it all happen willison accelerated scheduled needless to say and you know you've got tenure creek that runs underneath portion\nOf this new addition that runs really underneath Sanford Stadium so can you can do that I've always wondered you can walk you can walk now a new you'd have to have a level of war I'm sure I Would want to do that it does connect on down to the uk Tony hill cemetery that goes through out that that area but\nUh you're right anytime you're connecting a new construction and old construction the unknown is what's a could be stifling in a situation like that luckily\nUh could be stifling in a situation like that luckily when you get out of the ground usually the unknowns had been identified so we were all very happy if there weren't too many surprises below grade\nAnd once we were able to come out of the ground with new construction\nYou know then you're feeling really good about things because part of the worry part of the concern is maybe to as bill drawings aren't as they technically are usually what happens power lines or maybe six feet off and all of a sudden you've got to change and only time you can change is when you're in the field and when you've got all these pipes and theme lands exposed so\nAs we say once I got out of the ground we really feel good about it and um\nThe PR who was the a contractor for the indoor building as a contractor for the west end zone project and\nUh that team has been with us for a while now and they have just done a phenomenal job in communicating keeping a job site clean doing the little things that make the difference and they're going to be able to live or own time and within budget\nYeah I've renovated house on that compares but I was told as that started Richard expect is going to take twice as long as you expect and cost a lot more and they were almost exactly correct and so uh you don't have that luxury well\nWe don't have the luxury and that wouldn't be in part of the the playing either and if that happened in this uh this team wouldn't be working for us or so\nYou know change orders is like you know we all built a home and you know how to get into your base price and you can add the crown and holding for X or y okay I'll Try to keep this positive so right so we did a I think our staff and every one that was ... did a great job on the front end\nAnd eliminated change orders that can really drive the price of because we all know change orders are probably twice as much as they would be if you did not have them in the very beginning so very very few change orders and so that's been a luxury of the project and that's what allowed us to keep us keep us on time because if we didn't have our act together\nAnd we're saying you know what that wall needs to be over here instead of over there and the ceiling needs to be fourteen feet instead of twelve feet\nThat stops everything and all of a sudden as we all know is when you when you do process change orders that delays the time it takes to complete the project so we're moving through this thing with his little change as possible to be sure that were completed substantiated completion the middle of July which gives us\nA good four to six weeks to break it in work the bugs out because you only have seven Saturdays to perform\nEach fall and you have to be on you you cannot afford to be off\nAnd ah so this is part where it has to work from that first game own and we just can't have any bugs and so it\nGives us the situation a time to to work out the bugs in the system you're listening to lens on business route to buy 'em or universities ... business school I'm Richard lens we're talking with Greg McGarry director of athletics at the University of Georgia\nThat were just talking about how as athletic director running this huge construction project of course there's the fundraising part I write\nSo ah ... sometimes runs festivals guy and we try to put on a successful festival we do is we forgot who are all the stakeholders and how do we make them all happy so I was thinking about that before this interview and who are your stakeholders it has to be a long list and\nSo you know some you know you probably didn't know way back when you'd be running construction big construction projects with such pressure add so who who do you consider to be all your stakeholders I bet it's a long list\nWe uh back in September of two thousand Fifteen McGill society was initiated in ... ill and all the funds that were going to that process were originally for the indoor athletic facility and so our goal was to raise Fifteen million\nIn the end or building well that was exceeded very quickly to where the entire thirty million dollars was paid for that building and the donors from the McGill society which number probably close to eight hundred now\nHave have donated close to Seventy million dollars since that time that that the points the dollars that they're that they're providing to us transfer into Hartman fun points\nSo as I give X. amount of dollars my points are increasing which allow me to maybe have first dibs\nOn national championship takeout SEC championship tickets road trip tickets to maybe LSU or Notre Dame\nAre so it really incentivize people that ... they not only want to improve their score within the Hartman fun\nBut they also saw what it did to the lives of our student athletes and I think anybody that has given through the McGill society they come in and they can see their benefit the benefits that they provided to us at work to see the football team train inside when they're able to really visit and be a part of these areas\nWhether they're there for the uh opening ceremonies of the ribbon cutting they walk in and they say holy cow this is you know I helped build this and they can go to the recognition\nThere's you know I helped build this and they can go to the recognition all they can bring people in and right they say exactly hey Alice part of this and that so we said some some facilities that we've done our transformation indoor athletic facility is transformational\nThe west end zone will be transformational because he experienced these current student athletes and our perspective student athletes will have now insane per se or be second to none so there's a lot of pride in there it is it allows people to feel a part of the action and\nOur appreciation is kind of the\nThings we can to help the customer experience when they're\nWhen they're here the fan experience ah Kirby's doing a great job of holding up his end of the day that competitive\nFootball teams that are exciting to watch so very good so it's a it's a feel good experience but you've got to really uh pay all the the tribute to the members of of the video society has made it all happen fantastic\nYou're listening to lens on does that brought you buy him a university is because out of business school I'm Richard ... we're talking with a very special
