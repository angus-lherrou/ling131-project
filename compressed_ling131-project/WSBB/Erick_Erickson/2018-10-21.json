T. S. P. this retirement assets\nAnd then the second half of the presentation we actually tell you how we build portfolios so what particular asset classes investment products um we used to build what we believed to be the best combination of portfolios\nFor a financial plan nearing retirement or in retirement and we talk about the red zone the red zone is that ten years prior to retirement\nSo if you're in that ten year period where you are thinking yeah I've got a date out there that I'm shooting for and it's within ten years it's time to act in ten one of these events or call us and set an appointment with an adviser\nAnd the other ten years so it's a twenty year period of time it's the first ten years in retirement\nThat's when we can't lose any money can't make any mistakes and your portfolio we've got to go slow and steady wins the race it's a lot of income planning includes estate planning and you know we take all of those invest double assets all those different ethic classes and show you how to work them and massage back and forth like lanes on a highway as we talk about\nA nice dinner to go along with it coming up in Marietta on October the twenty fifth puppet of seafood kitchen or Ruth Krist steakhouse in Kennesaw on October the thirtieth and flemings prime steakhouse at perimeter and that's on November first those are all on the Web site on the event tab unleashed your money dot com you can also give us a call\nThe site on the event tapped unleashed your money dot com you can also give us a call on it for all for nine zero eight eight eight alright Washington DC you were there\nAre at the Fox business Fox News headquarters there and hanging out with Tucker Carlson what were your impressions he seems it seems like a real pit bull on TV but I understand behind the scenes he's not really that way well that's\nTrue he is a sweetheart and he's very personable we got a chance to meet before doing the interview with them and then a had a chance to sit in the studio with him when he was recording his show which is live by the way so it's a little unnerving to be a ... mile maybe five ten yards away from 'em off camera while he's doing his show\nBut very personable when I first met him\nHe comes in and didn't need to ask him any questions off the bat he just started rambling about DC and the dysfunction there and the loss of the middle class and uh you know he he knows his Duffy's entrenched in it he seems very sharp and he's very engaging for sure\nAnd I just got interesting Guy Tucker Carlson here's Kris All right well we're here with Tucker Carlson\nThanks for joining us in welcome to money unleashed thanks for having me good to have you our listeners are mostly are predominantly pre retirees nearing retirement or in retirement there's two things that impact their ability to plan for their retirement when I'm speaking with them\nNumber one is Social Security second thing is pensions yes both with trillions of dollars of deficit these are issues that even the stock market can't fix so is DC just concerned with battling it out over the social dividing the country or they seriously focused on fixing these two programs\nWell I think Social Security is seen as sacrosanct\nAnd obviously it's been mismanaged and surpluses evaporated et cetera and it's it's been consistently misused over decades however there is a broad understanding between the parties that it will be bailed out if necessary inevitably will be because one it's a secret promise and to\nThe people who benefit from it are the most reliable voters in the country so I think Social Security fund the pension question is a much more complex one\nUm and you certainly see people get trapped on our pensions before for sure\nI have a lot of big corporations in the Atlanta area and they're under pressure a lot of them are making decisions to trigger a Social Security early in the er last may run out and also take the lump sum pension versus the rely on income stream and have to invest it in the market\nApps that so that's an America that's gone and\nIncreasingly the trend is almost universal this point is to offload your labor costs onto taxpayers and you see huge companies do it all the time I mean if you know a huge percentage your employees are on food stamps what are you really set and you can afford to pay the more but you are you're having\nTaxpayers are taking up the slack on behalf of shareholders politicians don't seem anxious to address this question at all it seems immoral to me speaking as a citizen but again only the crazies wing Bernie Sanders and a few people on the far right ever say anything about it\nWell he wrote a new book chip a fool's yeah in that book you say happy countries don't elect Donald Trump desperate ones do and your opinion of the country even more desperate now than we elected Donald Trump\nWell it's funny the people who are the angry Esther the people who are the least desperate\nIn other words the divide is really economic a lot of the time if you're younger you're living in a big city you know making well above the the median wage you're likely to be happy you know globalization has worked for you\nAnd so you you hate Trump but for everyone else I mean really it's a geographical question too I mean Dr Ian word from the coast and you'll see why people voted for Trump but no the problems\nTo yeah we'll do a really deep dive in and set out all the fees and I mean one of the easiest things for any investor to do is pull it up on any of the financial Web sites and look for something called an expense ratio now that's only part of the fees and mutual funds 'cause they're unstated fees out there which will give you an estimate on\nBut you can see whether you're paying a lot or a little right out of the gate and then you'll have four one K. management fees et cetera so we've got to take all of those things into effect they eat away at your portfolio I mean that type of three hundred and sixty nine thousand dollars in fees\nWhat is that equate to in last opportunity as well and a million dollars over your lifetime yeah so that's not being re invested in compounded it's being put into somebody else's pocket and they get to use it to compound now you want your\nFinancial professionals to be paid they can't they don't work for free but you want to get something in return you want to be hitting your benchmarks are exceeding your benchmarks you want higher levels of performance when the market's going up and higher levels of performance when the market's going down those are critical\nOne of the things that I've said in the past and I think it's really important to do and that's visualize your money as a pile of money on your kitchen table these are your assets that you've been saving your entire\nI Love money on your kitchen table these are your assets that you've been saving your entire life if somebody comes in and grabs twenty thousand dollars you chase him out the door\nLook at it this way if all of your money all of your retirement money we're in a check book right now in your checkbook register and at the end of the year in December you had to write a check\nFor the fees that you're paying all year long and you saw what that huge amount was\nWould you probably do something about that you'd you'd say to yourself I don't want to pay this big bill is kind of like you know right in the checkout to Uncle Sam in April I don't want to pay this big bill and you would do something about it Chris you can do something about that can chew\nYeah absolutely and it's increasingly important as this market starts to show volatility and the downward direction you don't want to be losing money in the market and paying fees on top of it it starts to spiral downward and it's hard to recover I mean look if you lose fifty percent one year and the market\nAnd you make fifty percent the next year even if you didn't have any fees you're not at break even add fees into it it becomes harder and harder to recover from market losses\nIf you have investments at risk and you have fees on top of it and and people ignore them when the markets are going well and they have been for the past ten years and those fees maybe creeping in and being added in we've got a vet them out get it down to something that's manageable and wall you off from some of this volatility in the market\nYou may not know how much your losing and how much you could be putting in your pocket and putting to work for you that's a big number two and if you look at it over a lifetime\nThat could be a huge number once you give us a call and ask for the retirement roadmap right now that is one part of it giving you an analysis of how much you're paying fees what could we help you do if we could just cut it down by one percent\nAnd put that in your pocket what would that be give us a call and let's go through that process for all for nine zero eight eight eight ask for the retirement road map\nAnd we have our advisors standing on the line right now they can take your call answer your questions and get you ready for retirement roadmap also if you want to text\nThe word road map to the same number for all for nine zero eight eight eight road map to that number will get you are one of our advisors will ... will find a good time where you can meet with our our team at the Hoffman financial grew up in another way that you can get in touch with us is through the website it's unleashed your money dot com click on the contact\nButton up there at the top of the page that'll open up a field you can fill in some things there and we'll get in touch with you that way as well but again for oh four Ninety nine zero eight eight eight\nOr the beginning of the show I say we take a look at the financial headlines and one of them this week kind of sad on Monday we hear about the bankruptcy\nOf seniors [noise]\nWhere else could you change your race\n\n\nGod that's cheesy [laughter]\nMatter of fact it back then ... seventies and eighties yeah absolutely hundred and twenty five years Chris a hundred and twenty five years of Sears I mean how many craftsmen\nTools that I buy and and ah lands in clothing and black and decker and Ken Moran world pool all that stuff all at Sears and now they're going away why are they going away well\nYou probably know that at some point they own Kmart and that didn't work out well it's sold off a lot of their brands and if you go into a Sears it's not like going into a apple store\nLimited [laughter] not at all\nBut one of the things that the c._e._o. said this week was that the company's\nRetiree benefits are not completely to blame but their obligations to pensioners have been a big part of of why Sears has gone down\nThey kept up with their obligations they had to and that is not something that a lot of other companies have right now Chris pensions or a company that has a pension that goes bankrupt I hate to even hear that that makes everybody nervous doesn't it\nYeah well not just the ones that are going bankrupt there's a lot of underfunded pensions out there we just played the clip of the ah interview with Tucker Carlson I asked him about Social Security and pensions and you if you didn't hear it and he says well\nIt's sector saying that the government that they'll fund Social Security but Mm pensions are more complicated issue both on the government pension level which has\nOver a trillion dollar shortfall in it and then corporate pensions I'm In a recent article and Bloomberg was titled ... five hundred biggest pension plans face three hundred and eighty two billion dollar funding gap\nMan that's a big number yeah he can he goes on and says people who rely on their company pension plans to fund their retirement may be in for a shock of the two hundred biggest defined benefit plans and the S. and P. five hundred based on assets a hundred and eighty\nI'm benefit plans and he hasn't paid five hundred based on assets a hundred and eighty six aren't fully funded simply put they don't have enough money to fund current and future retirees\nThat's a trap yeah you pay in all your working life you stay with that company and these are employees that don't just come in for one year or two years and then switch and look for the next job some of them have\nTaken probably less pay than they would have been worth at another company because of having things like pension plans that are very attractive because when you retire you get that lifetime income stream\nYou may hang on for a little bit longer with those companies to build up to a retirement age and take less income during your lifetime and then to face possibly not seen that pension at all and then it's a scary thing it needs to be addressed um we've got some large corporations\nThat are here in Atlanta that are facing it I mean of the top twenty\nUnderfunded pensions\nNumber two on the list is Delta Airlines wow according to this article number Nineteen is Lockheed Martin\nSo it goes on and on General Electric obviously experiencing it they might be the next one not to go bankrupt but to have to deal with their underfunded pensions\nWhen times are good these companies get a little bit too big for their bridges they're probably paying too much and executive compensation they're constantly paying it forward assuming that their companies are going to either\nA maintain the strength and market share that they have or get even stronger and when interest rates went to zero it put another death nail in the coffin because they have to use protected assets to guarantee the pension plans if you're promising people's six\nPercent pay out on their pension money\nAnd you're only making one or two or three in a fixed income product for the whole pension you've got a shortfall and it's coming to bear so the recommendation there that I have with clients as if you have a pension\nPolice come in for a pension analysis will take a look at it will do some research into your particular pension we'll find out whether you can take a lump sum pension distribution and we'll compare that versus the income and will present you with some options that potentially get you out from underneath something that could be uncomfortable\nOur number is for all for nine zero eight at age if you have a pension and you hear a story like this and you just get jumping and I don't blame you at all what about the people who worked for years and maybe they're ten years into the retirement now watch\nSo maybe they're looking back saying maybe I should have taken the lump sum well maybe you should do at least look at it for all for nine zero eighty they'd call us and asked for the retirement roadmap\nIs a free look at where you are right now if you have a pension this is for you for all for nine zero eight eight or on line it's on a leash or money dot com you can reach us

of movement right now in the market market's going up markets going down people are getting scared we got to take a moment we gotta talk about how can someone make money as this market is getting ready for a major correction\nHow can someone make money in a downward move with the market let's talk about well the great thing about the markets is that up and down is the exact same thing and the problem is that Wall Street has the masses convinced\nThat when the market goes down that's a bad day and that's not true because there's opportunity when the market falls our looking for his movement and when we find movement in the market we can take advantage of that movement\nHelp you need to feed on line\n[noise]\nIf you love chip and Joanna you haven't seen anything yet\nCheck out the table

da and of course that over the Facebook Like is at bowls and bears radio a lot of social media going on out there you have a lot of stuff that were followed by\nThe drum other social media lost a lot of Facebook Live going to do a weekly live broadcast maybe a couple of times a week there's a lot of great people that have tuned in and said man that stuff's really helping us\nYou guys are making the impact with us You're showing us the true way the markets were alive\nIt's just showing us the true way the markets work the lives of Wall Street which we always talk about here and most and bears understand some folks you're smart enough to imagine self direct your own money we believe that when the market goes down that's not a bad day diversification doesn't mean that you're safe\nAnd the trend is it always your friend and those are the things that Wall Street teaches the masses and we're here to break that down show you the real Wall Street show you how institutions approached the box and more importantly how you can profit regardless of what's happening\nExactly and you know a champ one of the big things right now is a lot of people are concerned you know this is reminding me of the market in two thousand seven I met a bunch of people in those seven and people are like the market's up starting to get shaky I don't know one is going to collapse I don't know one I don't know what to do should I go to cash and I buy more\nAnd really ultimately comes down to we got to preserve what we have and a lot of people have had a good run since March of two thousand and the market's gone up and now all of a sudden everything's wall falling around and people are freaking out a little bit let's talk about how they can protect how they can preserve the capital that they have\nEerily similar to two thousand seven record high starting to get these big moves daily big\nEntered a movement in the S. and P. and the dial in the Russell I'm it's just a repeat of the film and here's the thing\nIn two thousand eight many people lost a lot of money about forty or fifty percent of money in the four one k.'s and managed diaries was transferred out of those accounts that wasn't lost\nJust went to somebody else some understood how to make money regardless of directions so there's a lot of listeners right now and if you're driving down the road right now and you're hearing us in two thousand and if your phone kid got hurt badly because of the collapse\nHere we are ten years later we're expecting other collapsed and many of you probably most of you haven't done anything different you're still not four one K. you still got all that money at risk think about that and I'm going to be blunt\nShame on you this is your wealth and you are not changing anything in this things you can do to protect and preserve capital this things you can do even in a four one K. or an IRA to not lose in a collapse of the market at least protect against loss and\nThere's other things you do to profit from it so the focus is is that if we're not managing risk if we don't have a position of place that says if this thing collapses I'm going to walk away or the ... there was virtually unscathed with a small pre defined loss\nWhat's your plan because we're expecting it were calling for the markets overvalued and when it falls capital preservation got to be so important is the problem if you wait until it happens it's too late\nWell exactly that's it a lot of people in two thousand seven they didn't know what to do they got paralyzed two thousand eight they got crushed they sat there and watch this thing go down and all of a sudden two thousand nine rolls around they go now what what exactly what you said they missed it they don't understand that they need to be they need to be proactive rather than reactive\nAnd capital preservation doesn't mean you get out of mutual fund that go to cast not necessarily cash is probably safer but let me tell you something I met a man of two thousand\nWhen the market fell forty percent and he said well I was okay I went to cash right before the collapse well\nThe currency that he was holding the u._s. dollar because when people tell me they go to cash only means the U.S dollar they're not going to hold the off the dollar or the euro and should they should in some cases they should this guy said I cashed out right before the collapse of two thousand and I was fine I said you weren't fun\nI said you realize that the value of your dollar fell thirty seven percent between the collapse of two thousand and the bottom of two thousand two in the financial markets so you had the same amount of money but it had thirty seven percent less buying power that's a real number of folks in other words cash isn't always the safest haven\nIf he'd have gone to the Australian doll he would have grown as account exponentially because that currency at that time was increasing in value let me tell you something folks\nCapital preservation means there's things that you can use in the market to ensure that you don't lose or to ensure that when you do lose its small and pre defined there's things that we can use like exchange traded funds that are inverse funds so in the market goes down our account grows it it's inverse to the actual performance of the market there's options\nOptions are insurance people couldn't protecting hedge their positions in their portfolios with options if they understand it and the beautiful thing is that a lot of times you're basically ensuring for pennies on the dollar and if the market collapse as you walk away with a very small pre defined loss think about that\nThere's so many things that people can do here's the problem and you're four one K. you believe these two things one that up as good an down as bad in to that if it goes down and just going to have to ride it out because you'll never get out of that four one K. God Forbid you move that money into something else which is a travesty because\nWall Street as you convinced that you shouldn't move that money and you'll just write it down your Turner winner into a loser we see it all the time you can't afford that folks here's the reality of the mass\nOf not protecting your ... your money\nIf you take these big losses like in two thousand two thousand they expect a big loss coming forward\nYou'll run out of ... years before you get your financial goals in other words you're a lot of time to grow your account because those big losses are draining your account and now you're trying to get back to break even do you realize that a lot of people took them almost eight nine years to get back to break even know what the collapse of two thousand eight and here they are now at break even or there were they were\nThe problem is there nine years older and here's the other problem\nThe markets gearing up for class again and think about that it's the definition of insanity\nAnd mark is gearing up for classes again think about that it's the definition of insanity that's the masses we need to learn the skills of capital preservation we need to understand the things we can do to keep ourselves safe no matter what the market does we can profit no matter what the direction but\nAt least we have to protect because if we wait to their house burned down before we ensure its\nIt's too late now the insurance is going to cost the replacement value of your house think about that\nSo we have to be proactive and have a plan in place where if the market collapse as\nWe're not going to take the brunt of the loss and we could still take the upside of it goes in the direction we think\nThat truly understanding market movement in price and the problem is with the masses Adam they're convinced that up is good and down is bad and they don't want to touch their money because if they touch it they say I don't know what to do that there's a lot of simple things that you can learn process these that can help protect and preserve and most importantly keep you on track for those financial goals long term\nWell Jim you said all the time it's it's it's a skill learning how to handle your money regardless of market direction is a skill understanding how to protect the money is a skill and if someone just is if someone looks in the mirror and as honest with themselves do I know how to handle my money and the average person the answer's no they put their money outside arm's reach\nBecause if it's in that four one K. visiting that Iran they can't spend it well and you know I Love about the academy on like trade academy our sponsor\nThey teach average people how to protect their wealth in other words if you're in a four one K. if you've got money and I are re there's things in the market instruments you can use asset classes to protect and preserve and still give you the opportunity hit your goals and the problem is is that many people don't realize how to do it\nThe academy has put together a plan in place and helped a lot of people like you and I asked them\nTo be more successful and preserve cattle because it becomes that important especially when we're expecting a big move down exactly in capital preservation is paramount and market like this and\nPeople out there they're concerned about the correction they're concerned about the sell off and you've got to understand to protect out four one K. and I are re online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears they have a class specifically on Capitol preservation now you have money in the market if you along the market mutual funds\nFor one case I raise this is a huge opportunity for you this is a five hundred dollar class taught right at their

to Seventy percent off\nCan you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem is and the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s manage diaries has you worried about run out of money before you die now I have students that are like ... that's been six to ten hours a month managing their own nest egg they manage their own IRA\nAnd they make decisions in that and those decisions are built around trying to make one percent a month thinking about that if you can make one percent among one of them are goes up down her side we can do that consistently over time\nYou put that a compound and calculator it gets powerful and the problem is is that many people can't make one percent a month because the market goes down they don't profit they lose they needed to go up for them to profit and ultimately because of all of this turns in price of the market and these fees they never hit the goals\nSelf directing a learning the skills to take control that bucket is essential to long term success and more and more people we're seeing this Adam\nAre coming out of the woodwork saying I Need to learn how to control my own money because the mass of my account says I'm going to run out of money before I die the Math Doesn't work and I need to change the formula and you know that former means no change in that formula means\nSelf directing taking control that bucket and making the decision to self 'cause who cares more about

show people the lives of Wall Street and give you a solution because you know what it is not as difficult as Wall Street wants you to think\nAnd many of the most successful traders and the rest of that I Know have never had any background that they just learn the skill from the ground up exactly and right now we're taking the time to check in with\nOur sponsor online training academy contacted headed down to the school right there talking to education coach Chris Charles Chris what's going on buddy\nHey buddy man listen it's great to be back with you guys is has been one of the highlights of my week for a while now\nWell we appreciate taking the time I Know you've got a lot going on at the campus what's going on down it online training academy I mean what's one of the key things that are happening these this week\nOr a fact of the matter is we've got a bunch of classes that are going on and and people are boring you know multiple markets and if I could add um I'd like to take a second just kind of clear up a misconception that I've seen you know a lot of folks artist betting that the only people that can participate in the market are the folks that have an abundance of time\nAnd in fact of the matter is that we're getting a lot of folks coming into the school and they're living their lives you know they've got jobs lives obligations responsibility they got PTA and soccer practice in gymnastics lessons and horseback riding lessons and they're trying to find a way that they can\nEnds meet and do all these things at the same time and what we're finding is people are coming to the school with the main focus on trying to generate some additional strings of income\nHey Chris it's champ good to hear from you\nWhat what's exciting is is that when a lot of people finally realized that the market to provide them that you may income then they start to think well stocked with the way to go I you know focus on stocks cause in the United states as you well know that's the main asset class of people use the trading and investing\nWhat do you see when people start to realize that there's other things they could trade and what's really the eye opening thing for a lot of students when they do realize that\nWell you know a lot of people do come into the school and they maybe they have a base\nWell you know a lot of people do come into the school and they maybe they have a basic understanding of stock\nMaybe they'd never traded before but they realize that there's you know there's an opportunity in the market and they assume that the stocks stock market's going to be the answer for them and usually it's not and the reason is because so many people are coming in here exploring how do I take a little bit of money and and get a decent return and unfortunately stocks not going to get people that opportunity it literally as a marketer requires\nThe most amount of money it's open the fewest hours with the least opportunity\nAnd with folks come in here they start to explore these other markets like the currency market you know we've got a currency collapse that's coming up in the ... market or they start to explore things like the futures market\nAnd their goal is to take a little bit of money and get a decent return but you know as as you talk about all the time champ as a matter of following the rules and being systematic so we can take people through a process of\nGetting started using alternative markets that a lot of times they're not familiar with\nAnd we can start to explore these options that give them an opportunity to generate these additional streams again most of the students here the school or not folks that are trying to figure out a way they can quit their job and live off the market and while that does happen\nThat's not typically the goal for every person that I mean they're trying to figure out how can I in court with this into my life and we can do so with a plan in place that allows them to take some money and use it in these alternative markets to generate the income that they're looking for the additional stream of income\nIt's a it's a game changer for a lot of folks champ\nAnd and you talk about it a lot of those currency accounts and those futures accounts that people open up\nThey literally can start with a thousand bucks a few hundred bucks so they really don't have to have a high bar of capital to get started and the problem with stocks as we all know is there very capital intensive I'm going to buy shares of stock and how to utilize a lot of capital by that year when I use futures encourage these it allows me to be able to have\nLess in the position still get a good ... a good return what do you see when people start to understand the futures market in the forest Marta what does that do for them personally because\nThey didn't come into the academy knowing that those were alternative asked that caused that they could use what's the biggest thing people get surprised when they see the futures are currencies are options as an alternative\nOr you know champ I actually think that the misconception about the market and the stock stock market being their answers scares a lot of people away from it because they assume they do have to have so much money\nAnd the average person that's coming in here and sitting in this giant on this giant pile of money and they're they're wanting to play with it they're trying to figure out how can they take a little bit of money out of their budget each month and put it to work\nAnd one of the big eye opening things for students in this environment is when they realized that they can use for action futures and the power of leverage to put a small amount of money at work in a marketing still get a great return\nBack of the matter is for many people they come in here such hitting one thing and when they start to explore the process they realize there's more opportunity than it could ever possibly imagine\nThat's awesome Chris and we thank you for checking in with us and obviously ... thank you to the sponsor of on trade academy we really appreciate you guys what's amazing what Chris reference
