just wondering if that if those accusations are true or not\nYes uh she is partisan and in fact I Do believe I read she she needed something on her college campus in honor of the ... the resistance protesters were wearing\nA she also I discovered this afternoon wrote a much ridiculed a study in two thousand eight two thousand nine period\nAbout the benefits of hypnosis in psychotherapy\nAnd now a number of people are starting to speculate on what is she used a hypnotists to draw out Brett Kavanaugh's name a that was completely undermined her story\nIm a that was completely undermined her

going after the the victim and I but I think they should um go after her credibility because as Rachel Mitchell the Arizona sex rush prosecutor noted in her memo that\nI had gotten to yet but might as well get into it here with you Steve is it there there is there is no there there she contradicted herself she gave her therapy notes\nTo the Washington Post at least to wash of his claim she did now she says she doesn't remember she gave the notes the Washington Post but she find out is refusing to make them available to investigators right I think she's hiding something\nWell you know I I think she definitely I'm liberal left leaning and being used as a pawn by\nThe Democrat I definitely think she's being used as pawns Dee thanks very much for this and listen I I don't doubt something traumatic happened to her but I have a hard time believing this Brett Kavanaugh particularly when she waited and to tell her therapist and twenty twelve it was him she didn't tell anyone until then\nAll of our witnesses have said it didn't happen she won't release her therapist is what she hiding and therapists notes\nWhich she hiding that she wanted a Trump them out to be quoted by the Washington Post but she doesn't want anyone else to see them she doesn't want the Senate investigator see him she doesn't want the FBI seem why is that\nAnd it does I mean given her background in hypnosis therapy is that how she came up with his name\nI don't know I I Will tweet out a link to the story my buddies Shawn Davis has put it together at the federalist but you can see a he has a link to her study or\nAt the journal of clinical psychology you should also note that it's cited a Nineteen sixty four paper on the use of hypnosis to treat alcoholics that has been thoroughly to bumped as
