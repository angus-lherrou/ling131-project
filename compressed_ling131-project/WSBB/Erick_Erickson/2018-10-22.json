S. B. talked I Want to review just just real quick if you if you're just shooting in um the secretary of state's office has been accused of suppressing or people's ability to vote and throwing people the voter rolls you know I was in elections lawyer for a number of years\nLet me review for you exactly the process of canceling the voter's registration\nThat the federal government actually requires that voter rolls be cleaned up\nAnd what George ... does is they clean up voter files in odd numbered years so contrary to what you may have heard in the press or the secretary of state's office has not thrown people off the voter rolls this year now local elections officials have\nSaid there are some issues I I think I read in in ... county where that has happened but they do it for very specific reasons the reasons they do with our for uh people have died people have been real mentally incompetent in a court of law people have committed a felony\nOr they've got to duplicate voter registration\nOr they've got to duplicate voter registration\nFederal law prohibits a mass clearing out of voters Ninety Days before an election\nSo any voter who's been removed from the voter rolls within Ninety Days of an election is either remove because they've died been declared incompetent or they've been found guilty of her pled to committing a felony that's it\nNow in odd numbered years secretaries of state do clean up their voter files and the process in Georgia is a seven year long process is automated the secretary of state plays no role in it\nSo what is the process the process is if someone does not a ... does not vote for three year period\nOr have any contact with the board of election\nThey get\nA postcard from the secretary of state's office with a prepaid return ... and they have a form to fill out and all it does is yes I still live here\nAnd you sit back in fact it's a postcard you don't even have to look a novel up you just put it back in the mail you you you tear it off it's perverted cheat you sign it using it in the mail\nAnd if they get that you're an active voter if they don't get that will you become an inactive voter now an active voter is a voter who can vote in any election it just means their flag does not having voted in the last three years and the board of elections and the secretary of state have had no contact with them\nSo what happens well the sectors date once someone is listed as an active voter has to wait for years to elect to full federal election cycles\nIf the voter votes in any of the next four years there immediately listed as an active voter again without the secular she doing anything you show up and vote you are immediately considered an active voter again\nIf you do not\nShow up and vote within four years you are presumed to have died or move or gone to jail or what and you're taking off the voter rolls is that straightforward folks its history forward it\nTakes it takes seven years so you're hearing about three hundred and some odd thousand people the secretary of state has taken off voter rolls that happened last year not this year and it was people who have not voted in seven\nYears in seven years\nAnd every year the Democrats go hysterical about it and by the way this is compliance with the federal law compliance with a federal law now let's go comply and check with traffic and see what Doug has to say\nI've been doing that money I Know the job market navigating by forty three no us running on him and he might have been really worried about chemical delays nobody right for the way that he kept getting hit by this out\nDown about Fifteen minutes or Georgia hundred walking around in memorial drive forty\nOne or chicken travel down to the north and again and again I got out of five minutes left over from an earlier age old forty thirty five forty five minutes\nOr Georgia or get around I don't want to\nThank you very much so it just just following up here now we're we're having all of this hype from the Democrats that Brian Kemp is trying to steal the election I I honestly think I agree with several democratic consultants out there who have said this is the Democrats telling their own base not to bother to show up\nAnd I actually think that there's some legitimacy to that that you've got a bunch of people who are being told your vote doesn't count Brian ... not going to count it so why bother to show up now why would they be telling people that\nI think it's because they think they're going to lose and Abrams has invested a bunch of energy over the last four years trying to make the case of her inevitability in Georgia\nAnd when she loses she's got to come up with excuse it can't be her it can't be that she ran too far left yeah be any of these things it's got to be that Brian Kemp stole the election\nJust like Trump that's what the Democrats are doing here now they're playing a voter fraud the airplane that voter intrigue on all of these issues because\nDeeply problematic I think um but that's the best they've got and that's the argument of winning campaign if you go to industry and by the way a e W ... I put up a PC was a male peace we got over the weekend\nThere is a woman and I don't know a friend of mine says maybe they're going for the call mom demographic or looked like the hot mess demographic to me um it is a woman a gym in in uh in Atlanta allegedly a wearing it\nAnd uh in Atlanta allegedly a wearing it you'll glasses and a nose ring and it has a quote this guy Brian KIPP is a hot mess pointing a gun or to get not true helping a sexual predator get a massage license not true now\nA felony investigation not true there's no way he should be governor what what was the only investigation they're claiming anyway nonetheless uh this this is the male piece um someone with a nose ring or calling Brian ... mess\nAnd eat that's again not a winning message of a winning campaigns this is a campaign that sounds like it knows it's going to lose and now it's grappling for excuses to come up with now of course Abrams is going to win if you guys don't go vote\nOr that's kind of a big deal there and you're going to have to turn out you're going to have turned out you're going to vote or you're not going to be able to let the Democrats claim that the election was stolen if you overwhelm the election\nNews weather in telling us the ...

border some of them will try to sneak across into chaos\nOr but they're not going to force it over so you know terms matter uh but yeah I totally get why people see this is an in an invading force you

to try to get you but there is another story you all need to know about a it is amazing how this is going down the memory whole\nFor a lot of liberals in the media we're hearing about the blue wave I'd been Tony the blue waves come in and the NBC Wall Street Journal poll is telling you that the blue waves coming exactly as I told you the blue waves coming it's coming\nTo already blue areas there is a huge blue wave coming\nBut it's coming to districts that are like San Francisco\nChicago New York City uh Raleigh Durham area Athens Clark County a Fulton County\nIt's it's fired up angry liberals who live in liberal enclaves are turning out and there's a problem for the Democrats when it comes to the U.S house\nYou need the blue waves to be happening in swing districts now there is a downside for Republicans here you do need to understand this the downside for Republicans is where the swing districts all of the swing districts are Republican districts\nThere aren't really there actually I should say there aren't any there are five democratic swing districts but all the other swing districts in there are thirty plus swing district remember they only need twenty three a there are third over thirty swing districts they're all Republicans safer five of them\n\nIn a year when the Democrats the\nWhite House the swing districts are in democratic territory\nThere Republican territory Republicans are on defense um if Republicans can hold the mall then they keep control of the house if they can't uh they only need to lose a handful of them and the Democrats can can take back then you lose twenty three to be precise\nGratz can can take back then you lose twenty three to be precise the Democrats can take back Congress and some Democrats are still openly saying they're expecting a fifty plus wave and that may be true but what the Wall Street journal NBC News polish showing is that while the Democrats lead by seven on the generic ballot nationwide\nIn the swing districts the swing districts those districts that are held by Republicans playing defense there even\nThere is no uh advantage to the Democrats is a fifty fifty tie\nSo what does that tell us\nIt tells us at this point Republicans are fired up as Democrats\nAnd the swing districts are going to be where the battleground is and if Democrats they don't have to sweep if the Democrats don't even sweet ah they win as long as they win a battle a close to two thirds of those districts\nSo it's going to come down to ground game now what does that mean for you and me\nWell quite frankly it means that you've got to go vote\nMay you can't phoned this in because there are enough swing districts around that it it really affects other races as well it will affect Senate races so for example in Indiana there are a couple of the swing districts are in Indiana\nIn the swing districts that are in Indiana\nI'm even Republicans turnout en masse and save those Republicans\nThey potentially can also cause Joe Donnelly to be thrown out in the Senate\nThe same as here Rob ... district and Karen handles district are considered swing districts now I think Karen Handel is going to win her district is the um the cook political index has now largely taken it off the table for the Democrats but Rob Woodall they're still thinking it leans Republican but it is not likely Republican\nIf the Democrats turnout um big then suddenly the you've got a district that could hand the gubernatorial race in Georgia\nTo Stacey Abrams\nA so you've got to turn out in Robert ... district and Karen handles district in all the other districts you got to turn out but this big blue wave is coming in as I predicted it would come and it looks like it's coming in already Democrat areas and not really hitting Republican areas the swing districts that's the big issue now another big issue is traffic we need to sit out there\nTrying to keep the big Asian amenable air do games that are out of that here they've already agree now that you asked me nobody ratcheted away annuity by but I noticed that the blinders forgetting judge of the Latin wave Florida the right lane\nTo anybody's did I revived they're not really the opposite way but it's definitely quite slow outward toward the area of adult to crash off to the right to anybody I Know where they live with their forty again\nAnd it'll be I don't know about it today about what it's all go both ways for all the way around I Want to\nThank you very much All right back to the phones we go ah Tom and Tucker your next welcome\nHigher I enjoy your show a Eric I have a always heard that the Mexican government was very strict with regards to immigration and so I'm curious\nHow this many people can just pass into Mexico do they all have passports and they all have their documents squared away that the Mexican government would admit them into\nThe ... do you see this is part of the problem this is one of the topics that I probably should spend more time on the Mexico is largely a failed state at this point and I don't mean that disparaging lay I mean the Mexicans are caught up in a civil war with the drug cartels in the country is is breaking apart\nA geo politically I mean that literally not not physically as a country but as a geopolitical entity\nMexico's breaking apart you have a regions in Mexico that have formed their own government you have municipalities in Mexico now that have basically taken over police and military functions for their area\nAs the Mexican president increasingly controls the smaller and smaller territory and there is limited border enforcement now in Mexico the way the Mexican immigration positions work now is if you try to buy a land in Mexico they clamp down on you\nBut otherwise a passage through Mexico is more and more easily accomplish because the Mexican military has distracted\nAnd by fighting the drug cartels and frankly each other now it is it is a failed state uh and frankly here's the issue that we as Americans are going to have to deal with\nWe're going to continue to see these problems moving forward unless we come up with a new foreign policy for the western\nHemisphere I don't know what that looks like but it is very clear to me that we need a policy we cannot just build a high wall because what we do when we build the high wall is we allow China\nAnd Russia to begin to move into the western hemisphere and establish relationships with some of these regimes in ways that would long term work against us we need to come up with a way to you\nLong term work against us we need to come up with a way to deal with these regimes in central and South America that are crumbling and allowing this to happen and thus far we haven't been able
