I just want to say the dumpster behaving this way because of Merrick Garland\nBecause of Merrick Garland yeah well the problem with the Merrick Garland thing is you can go all the way back to the Biden Rule these this unwritten rule Joe Biden brought up\nWhen it was tried before when they wanted to put another Supreme Court nominee on and Biden came to the floor and say well we're in the middle of a presidential election cycle and why would we put a a permanent position on the court from a guy who may not be an office in two more months let's let's cooler jets and we followed that precedent\nNow they're the shoes on the other foot suddenly it it wasn't cool to the Democrats the Republicans did the same thing I don't think it was right when the Democrats did it I don't think it was right out of the Republicans did it but I Know why it happened\n... well I you know you what's your plan to get at is an eye for an eye on the right to know the so\nThe yeah the problem is the longest time the left has been wanting all the I's and the right has been giving them all the eyes and I think at some point you just you snap and you say fine we're gonna play by the same rules you want to play with I don't say it's right but I also understand at some point you got to fight back\nWell I mean I'm a liberal and I you know uh I just yeah so we ... is the way you want to go but so you were cool here we are getting so you were cool with\nIt when Joe Biden said we cannot allow a nominee from the president to be put forward in a presidential election year that was okay when Joe Biden did it\nI I don't remember what I thought about it but obviously like you said it's it's not right\nOkay well at least we can agree on that because I I I don't think we should be playing but\nActually we muddled up this so much do you realize up until really about Thirty years ago when you had a Supreme Court nominee this was never televised we never saw it all kind of happened behind the scenes and mutually either had a good court record or you didn't and you got you got on the bench or you didn't we didn't have this or that\nYou're right it it all started with our book and that that that was it that was the poison and then a ... and I think he took it to the next level it look I I think a in a president should get that choice\nA but if I can say one thing uh I think a ... it you know like I said I I don't expect Kevin I'm not to become strong but I think he should have just said that you know what I had I had a I had good parties and that was that or maybe I blacked out I don't know but ah he didn't say\nThat uh maybe I blacked out I don't know but he didn't say it\nAnd then here we go yeah we have another investigation you know I I hear ya well Robyn buddy\nI
