I kinda\nI Wonder if people understand\nThat some of the people who I see let me put it this way some of the people who I see out there cheering the president\nDoing what he's doing with birthright citizenship through executive order we're limited with Brock Obama doing what he did with ... and ... um through executive order\nAnd I really think this is this is not about President Trump at all this is about the president's eat itself\nAnd I don't think the president of the United states should or does under our constitution have the power to change immigration laws dealing with citizenship\nThrough executive our I don't think he knew it Congress can do it\nI think you get 'em in the constitution to do it but I don't think through executive power the president can do it through executive order the president can do it here's the thing if President Trump can do this was an executive order the next president can undo it\nMore Republican voters had voted in Georgia early than democratic voters which is unusual\nAnd that is a good um that's a good sign for Republicans in Georgia the problem is that on Thursday Friday Sunday and Monday there was a real surge for Democrats\nSo when you take the early voting numbers for really friday\nAnd then Sunday Sunday small but it was almost all Democrat and then yesterday was a huge Democrat surge and today I'm being told we won't know the numbers and blow tomorrow but today appears to have been a very big democratic surge you have the Democrats now gaining momentum and they're gaining momentum at a significant pace\nAnd that has Republicans in this state worried\nThere is another issue that has Republicans worried and it is the president's statements day about the executive order\nThe group of people Democrats had been hoping would come rescue them\nOr Hispanic voters and Hispanic voters\nHave not been highly mobilized in fact here in Georgia you know Republicans are convinced that ... county is is going to be gone soon if not this year\nWithin two to four years because of the major Rosen this spending population same in Cobb County and that they would vote Democrat but they're not actually turning out at a significant rate this year\nAnd you have a lot of Republicans were worried that what the president has done we seen this he's going to do this executive order and get rid of a birthright citizenship is going to mobilize Hispanic voters to go out and vote against Republicans\nThey have not been mobilized the Democrats have not found a message to mobilize these voters and suddenly the president has handed them one a lot of Republican strategist this evening very very upset about this one Republican congressmen\nVery very upset about this one Republican congressmen a set on TV just long ago it was political malpractice for the president to do this because of what it was going to do that to the Hispanic vote that was otherwise not showing up uh the so you've got a real problem there and Republicans are nervous\nI Am also aware of in several states\nWhen the president has gone into suburban areas to campaign for Republicans the Democrats have benefited more than the Republicans the Democrats have seen a big increase in female voters whenever the president shows up in suburban areas that's why by the way it is very very very smart of the ... campaign\nTo get the president in middle Georgia\nBecause middle Georgia doesn't have that that female suburban base that has turned on him and the way or the Atlanta suburbs doing given the way media around the state plays you're not going to have the attention in the Atlanta suburbs of the president's visit as you will in middle Georgia and most of middle Georgia is very highly Republican which benefits rank up\nAnd then you've got the vice president who doesn't drive up democratic antagonism and he's going to go into the Atlanta area as well as a guest in Savannah that help Springfield\nI'm not really worried that you could lose the race there are others who are really worried about it I'm not I'm what I'm seeing it looks good\nI Am concerned however\nAbout the state legislature were definitely Republicans are definitely going to lose seats in the state legislature and there is the suburban mobilization that's happening I'm among women and black voters that looks very very bad I've had friends of mine told me that the ... gonna be a blowout he's going to win he's going to crush her and that's not happening\nI think he's going to be closer race than people expect a there are a lot of people who think is going to go into a runoff I I'm not there yet on thinking it's going to go into a runoff but it may uh\nI think he would win in a run off I think he's going to win but it's going to be far closer than people expected it's going to make people very very nervous and you know the truth is it has more to do with the president than it is Brian Kemp\nA Democrats are just so amped up to protest the president now all of that gets us back to the citizenship issue but before we get their review chicken would up trouble address\nAt about am I getting charge rep out of diners going to go to any by that that have you on in their forties or you know when you ask me on the Internet to anybody that the Afghani that ... by helping to keep that Bush\nBag or Georgia or under the duty by

lady by George under the right down on the get out of Seventy five at a northwest\nThank you very much so now we we go back to this issue of birthright citizenship and I get there are a lot of people who oppose it and I I'm kind of in different on the issue of affect me I'm a citizen one way or the other\nThere are two ways to get citizenship one is is blood right citizenship and one is land rights citizens ship our birthright citizenship symbol refer to it um blood right citizenship\nIs your parents one or both of your parents are citizens therefore you are a citizen\nOr the other is birthright citizenship overland right citizenship is you're born on the soil\nOf the country and therefore you become a citizen of that country\nThe in this civil governments the civil ... societies like France and Germany and whatnot that developed in central Europe and cutting into Europe from Roman law they went with blood right citizenship\nAnd it was the European was the British system actually the English system that as their empire expanded they came up with birthright citizenship\nAnd the America's I'm adopted it yeah I mean for example just say this list of countries in the in the western hemisphere that we're all a English territory's you've got um\nLet's see Canada in there you've got\nA grenade isn't there Jamaica is in there and the Bahamas or in there and the\nUnited States is in there obviously are by and large these countries Australia is a um birthright citizenship [noise] um a lot of these countries that came from English common law our birthright\nAnd that is if you were born\nIn the country you became a citizen of that country\nThere is a legal debate in this country over this but you should understand that it's a very recent phenomenon only in the last Twenty years has this really been an issue and the predominant number of lawyers are in the belief that the fourteenth amendment gave birthright citizenship\nAnd their argument for that is that uh it was part\nArguments for that is that uh it was part of the American heritage it was part of what our founders argued our founders argued in the American revolution that they were British citizens because of birthright citizenship they were born in a part of the British Empire\nTherefore they were British citizens and when the Supreme Court in Dred Scott said birthright citizenship doesn't apply the fourteenth amendment was he designed to overrule Dred Scott\nTherefore birthright citizenship must apply that's the argument in a nutshell it's a little more ... than a complex but that's the argument that show the fourteenth amendment was specifically written to address Dred Scott Dred Scott it's in birthright citizenship whether the thing the fourteenth amendment says it is therefore it is now you can change this through by changing the constitution\nIt is arguable Congress could sit some parameters on a piece of the language of it but\nThat's what you're dealing with um the alternative is obliterate citizenship that we see in continental Europe and the danger there is you have a lot of people who've never actually get deported and they have no hope of ever becoming citizens\nEnsued they essentially you've got a bunch of people living in your country who aren't invested in your country\nAnd we're not even this president hasn't been able to round up all the illegal aliens so seems like it'd be a very bad precedent for us to go that route um we should probably want to have people who come here be invested but you know what all this goes away if we just seal the border which is what we should have done a lot\nOf evening news ...\nNews or militias accurate mental five day forecast for the same traffic every six minutes don't you ask me to\nHelp us
