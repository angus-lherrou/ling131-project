Democrat running for lieutenant governor George is saying that there\nMay be as they are there with rank if she's got no evidence and no proof but in the ... era he may need a Democrat to the governor it's it's all implied in a character attack you'll get if you go back two weeks ago\nGo two weeks ago on this program I told you I talked to a Republican senator who believed Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd was ready to throw in the towel\nAnd then I told you I talked to him after their Ramirez allegations came out and he had a complete change of heart that those allegations prove to him this was all a Democrat attack and that they were going to make anything and everything up to take out Brett Kavanaugh if\nAnything is a Republican should send a thank you note to Ronan Farrow in and Jane Mayer for running that story which then propelled Michael I have an editor come out\nBecause there were mirrors allegations were no more credible ... sweating the allegations\nThey were even less credible than forwards out dishes which were already in and of themselves not credible she had to this is I I see people see it all the time the the FBI refused interviewed witnesses none of the FBI interviewed everyone who was named as a witness they just didn't interview the people who said years later they heard about it that's not a witness\nThose people aren't witnesses their testimony cannot be used in the courtroom in a quarter of all I Do you understand what here say is\nDo do you mean lawyer somebody here say all the time but do you understand it will how we should spend just a second on this to understand what was at stake your what was at play here with the Democrats and why they're calling these people witnesses when they're not but first let's go check traffic Doug Turnbull\nAverage Eric I'm going to be a lot worse honestly by forty three now that you and me five dollars an hour from now what are you working round out earlier trouble at highway at marvel highway the apple\nPie [laughter] it was like you're going to be thirty five hundred around wondering what the fire fire somebody will try to\nTake you very much so ... you know if you ever watch\nJudge Judy if you've ever watch judge Judy and and\nSomeone says well so and so told me she muses I I I don't I don't want to do what they said do you what happened to you\nWhich she's doing without saying it because this isn't a real legal setting with lawyers is she saying that you say I don't want to hear here say what is here say here's the is you heard someone else say something\nThat means you're not actually a witness\nThere is an exception to here say and that is if if someone tells you something and it's to their detriment well then one of the exceptions to here say is um the ... that the truth of the thing to certain works against them\nSo if you're if you tell someone you stole money then that person potentially ... if you're dead or that person say yes he told me he stole the money\nBut generally you're not allowed to make a statement of the truth of the matter asserted that you're not allowed to to make a statement say Christine Blasey Ford told me he was sexually harassed or ... told me Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her that's here say that you're taking her statement is the truth of the matter asserted\nAnd you're not allowed to do that see a witness is someone who actually saw the of it\nAnd you can't have it here say witness\nWhen you have a trial you want the people who experienced the incident the people who witnessed the incident you don't want the people who save will five years later she told me this thing that's here say it doesn't matter what she told you what did you\nIt doesn't matter what she told you what did you actually see\nAnd that's what these Democrats or do now it's very Orwellian they're trying to re define what a witness is because they don't have any witnesses so a corroborating witness is now someone who you told ten years later did this to happen or Twenty years later this thing happened\nI mean with ... with a Christian but as you forward it was something that happened and they do and it was two thousand twelve when she says she was the first time she spoke about it\n\nWell those people in two thousand ... witnesses and same with ... no one who was actually at the event\nOr any of those dormitory parties recalls this incident the people who were actually there are the witnesses ... recalls that there are other people say well I remember her telling me something about something that some boy that I think it was about him but that's not a witness\nAnd so the Democrats have to read to find these things and again this helped Kevin all\nIt wasn't just Michael Evan Eddie helping break capital he was Ronan Farrow in Jane Mayer helping him as well because when they came out with Deborah Ramirez a story that was so preposterous that even the New York times that hate spread capital wouldn't run the story\nWas a big red flag to several senators one in particular I talked to who is ready to tell the president was Robert capital he's like he goes I get this is clearly Democrat dirty tricks here\nThey really

the White House\nYes well apparently over the weekend some anti gay home with all that weight had been discovered in her past\nAnd she says that you should be a judge heritage day on what she did while she was in college\nYeah isn't that what CNN has\nJust been doing it Kavanaugh while he was in high school and college\nWell you know so I'm torn on this what I think I get your point but she's not up for the Supreme Court she's a reporter and CNN was passing along the news I think there were a lot of people and seeing the new bay badly particularly Chris Cuomo giving Michael ... a\nA big platform that actually work to our advantage but what is Caitlin tolerance do\nAre we just going after her because she works for CNN\nI mean is is there something that she in particular did that was wrong or bad or super partisan biased\nOr I don't think that our ways are there ways and I don't think we should be behaving like the left is um you know there are a lot of people who are coming towards the right now there are a lot of people who were persuaded tobacco break capital because of the behavior of the left and we're going to turn all those people off if we start behaving like the left we're not like the left\nSo I don't think we should go after Caitlin going I don't know her well but I think very highly of her work\nI thought by and large she's been very very fair I pulled her out several times for things that I thought she did wrong and I'm happy to call her out for those things are but I don't think just as I don't think we should be destroyed Brett Kavanaugh over trumped up allegations from three years ago I don't think we should be destroyed reporters just because they work at CNN\nOr because we're mad at CNN um everybody should be treated as an individual and respected us such were all individuals made in the the image and likeness of God not collectively but individually and we should show each other a little more grace including these reporters that that's my view\nUm your view may vary but I Hope not because\nWe've been persuading people to flee the left by not behaving like the left and we'll lose all those people if we start behaving like left

right um\nWas I I got thrown off by by phone calls in and Caitlin also you know I just I really don't like the the tit for tat and I don't like to engage in it\nOr don't think it's very Christian frankly um that we should I mean this goes to turn on the other cheek I I I don't think that conservatives should engage in the behavior of the left and there are a lot of people in the right to disagree with me now the ...\nOr the left and there are a lot of people in the right to disagree with me now the ... bytes we should fight we should be just as nasty but but the polling shows more and more Americans are being turned off by that and because they're being turned off by it you leave and the prisoner using it to our advantage of persuading people to come to us and I think if we act\nOr like the left to try to destroy people because of the things they did three years ago that it's going to end up badly for all of us are everybody has things in their life\nThat Thirty years ago they did that they probably shouldn't have done or they change their mind and and we are\nDenying people the ability overtime to change their minds to grow up to mature to to do anything by tried to ruin people that is what the lifted the bread capital we were also opposed to the left doing it to break capital I don't think we should they'll say oh they did it us we're going to do it to them\nWell then we're acting like children and conservatives Republicans should not operate like children and that's what the left does and that's why grown up voters are rejecting them\n[noise] Atlanta's
