you were on hold just stick with me please I've got less than a minute here and I give you the nut show on early voting numbers and I'll get into the details and we get back\nOr the Democrats in Georgia are turning out the early vote but\nNormally in Georgia and elsewhere Republicans run the absentee ballot game Republican voters like to vote absentee ballot\nAnd Democrats show up in early voting locations\nSo Republicans went absentee ballots and Democrats win win in person early voting and they tend to outnumber the absentee ballots are this is the first time I can recall or anyone else I've talked to can recall Republicans in Georgia we look like they're winning the early voting numbers by absentee ballot in in person but it is very very\nClose which is also somewhat unusual more details when we come back\nWe know that everyone has their own taste and jewelry especially when it comes to engagement rings\nThat is why shank company carries hundreds of fresh and current

five five and seven fifty WSBIU depend on it\nKids thirty nine after the hour\nThere is some news the president has ordered now five thousand\nTwo hundred soldiers to the border or to secure the border\nAs we can have a wall he's going to ... border personnel there let's go to the phones Mike from Atlanta Europe first tonight welcome\nTo hum thanks for taking my call so we're thinking a lot like question it was a I have to actually um but the first question is how do you think the announcement of the fifty two\nHundred a church will affect the voter turnout um since the last time I checked a Seventy five percent of people hold proved to enforcing the border um and the second thing um\nI ... kids and in our home school group and then our church\nOh scar kids and in our home school group and then our church uh we have offered watch anybody children who didn't want to deal with them at a polling place or\nA leader is with us go vote come back and pick them up\nOh that is [laughter] that is awesome well done well done uh on on the border issue hey if if we get into crass politics people tuned in mid term elections to vote against something\nThen for something and I ... the cynic in me honestly ... the president ... ... fifty two hundred soldiers to the border is the right\nThing to do but it also takes an issue off the table that he could otherwise use to motivate voters to go I'm no one's going to go vote will I won't say no one but very few people will go to the polls and vote\nFor the president's party and team because he did this as opposed to go into voting for the president and his team because he's promising that if the Republicans keep the Congress or this is what he's going to do that that's the problem\nBut as president is the right thing for him to do don't don't misunderstand me I'm I'm not saying he shouldn't do it\nI'm I'm just saying that it it kinda does take the ... the issue off the table for the G O P or perhaps but I suspect we're going to get back to the media coverage of what's happening at the border and that's going to\nHelp the Juppe this issue really does wind up helping Republicans and I saw a lot of Democrats initially thinking the president would start separating parents from kids again\nAnd that this would wind up hurting the ... that's not what's happening right now\nA email it let's get back to early voting in Georgia the data I have seen suggest that you'll be a slightly ahead with early voting but it is very very close to the good news for the ... is that they are a head but here's the problem with all the early voting numbers in why you've got to be very very cautious in talking about early voting\nNo one can tell you who someone is voting for\nWhat we can do is we can look at counties and we can look at people so for example the counties that Hillary Clinton won in Georgia have generated forty seven percent of the early vote\nThe counties that Donald Trump won have generated the rest of that\nThat's good for Brian Kemp numerically we can look at people and we can say we have these people voted\nAnd it looks like based on what we're seeing numbers wise it is more Republicans voting the Democrats and that's good but again the voting can't tell you who anyone voted for and there's a problem for the GOP in this I'll tell you about after we address was over\nThere are less weight around nobody by once again as we've run right nearby morning read on us being the out of twenty five western allies don't you know it's almost an hour at least fifty\nMinutes ago nobody around the area that we're getting word of activity on the north\nAs you weren't very fired up that area and then I'll be thirty five you know probably an hour George Will drive we've got extra to leave work but if I work with at least one of your weight and you have an aunt or under six minutes Eric\nThank you very much so he hears the issue is I I Can't tell you how any person has voted a it was some data I can tell you who has voted and if that person is a regular Republican voter than the odds are they voted Republican this time\nIf that person as a regular democratic voter I can the odds are they voted Democrat this time\nThe problem is in voter intensity measurements veteran since the measurements is how Democrat or the Democrats and how Republican or the Republicans and normally if you vote in every Republican primary and every Republican presidential primary the odds are you're going to vote Republicans and Rolex and see what the Democrats\nBut there are there is polling data out there that shows particularly in the suburbs\nPeople who have been Republicans by and large for the last decade are going soft on the GOP largely because they don't like the president\nUpper income highly educated white Republicans in the suburbs are leaving the G O P uh\nThey're classified themselves now is independent and we don't have the we don't have the data shift to say that because when they went to the polls last they voted in the Republican primary in twenty sixteen uh they've in in this area they largely voted for Marco Rubio\nHe one of the metro Atlanta counties mark Rubio did\nWhich was smarter brand kept to bring Rubio into Cobb County\nSo they're listed as Republicans but they've had a change of heart or over the last two years and now would consider themselves independent and they're voting and we don't know are they taking their frustration out on the president by voting for Stacey Abrams\nAre they taking their frustration out on the president by voting for Stacey Abrams some of them appear to be the question is how many of them are doing so\nThe data I've seen suggests not enough for Stacey Abrams the data I've seen suggests that Stacey Abrams is not generating the ground game that she has said she would vote for that is that she would generate we still have another week of early voting\nAnd so things are very close right now are they are close the kill folks seemed to be very nervous but they also seem to be very optimistic and upbeat um because the trend lines for the ... show some strength\nOr that they haven't necessarily had in the past they also have the vice president coming in for three stops the vice president all of a campaign data I'm seeing out there shows the vice president does not turn people off in the way the president sometimes does that when the vice president comes in for you he mobilized just Republican voters but he doesn't necessarily mobilize democratic voters\nThe data for the president suggests that when the president comes in\nAnd democratic voters get mobilized as well so you bring the vice president for three stops you mobilize Republicans without mode of mobilizing Democrats that amps up Republican turnout so when the president does come in next week\nThe Democrat mobilization will already be offset by increased Republican ... mobilization also the president will be going to middle Georgia where all the data suggests he's in highly Republican areas without those surrounding suburbs that have gone wildly on him nationwide so he won't risk firing of Democrats the way he might have\nIn some other states or this looks to be good for the ... campaign\nThey're executing their strategy\nAnd they're deploying their strategy\nAnd they're giving people reasons to vote for him not just against Abrams but what about the voter suppression story from Abrams some green room gossip from Washington DC when we come back [noise]\nErick Erickson you may not always agree with him you know he's going to spend every day I've told them and he was not even five and then if you ask me [noise]\nAnd when you ask me is Clark Howard is here to help you save more spend less than a void getting ripped off onto ...

I got to say\nI I Am a little bit frustrated with\nThe attacks in general the media and\nIf your regular list or you know I got a lot of problems with a lot of reporters and I call them out on your regularly there are some deeply biased reporters out there who pedal a lot of left wing nonsense about the president and his supporters\nAnd I tried to push back on it I Try to push back on the prevailing narratives that get in into the New York times and elsewhere but I don't think it's helpful to call the press the enemy of the people\nAre I really don't think that is helpful\nUm there is a stick symbiotic co dependent relationship between the president of the press where he attacked them they report about he responds to the reporting they report it he responds he had to actually get in on a number and goes\nAnd I am deeply troubled by more and more malevolent soles\nIn politics turning violent ah we've had James Hodgkinson you all we had the the Sutherland Springs church shooting we've had this um a synagogue in Pittsburgh a beautiful city and to see this happening there\nWe've had this guy sending bombs to the media and it's worth pointing out again that they didn't explode they were poorly made but they weren't fake bombs they were intended to be real he just was an idiot\nAnd how we got a I\nIt just was an idiot and how we got a I think all of us play a role in this one I'm also very frustrated by or the number of people who think that this is all the president's fault\nWe elected him but more than that\nIt advocates responsibility for people and the other side as well to fixate on the president is to say that the president can persuade us to do things we otherwise would not do but for his persuasion and it's also to advocate responsibility for people on the other side who fired up James Hodgkinson to go out and commit mass murder\nOr ... to go out and try to shoot up the family Research Council nobody wants to talk about that it's it's very frustrating because I feel like more and more I'm Out there saying you know what Mr ... that you shouldn't say this you can go after the media but I wouldn't call them an enemy of the people\nDo it in a different way um or in in you get attacked from your own\nSide yeah they are the enemy he right age right they they they only did\nI I've I've got and stuff like that and then you get a deck for all the Republicans conservatism is racism and so unless you're going to condemn conservatism your race is just like throw up so screw you I I I get it from both sides\nAnd it is exhausting but I still see these things need to be said\nWe could all be better the president as well the president excels at said in public what people say in private often and he's gotten people to feel comfortable about themselves saying things in public that they normally in the past and we said in private among their friends\nAnd he's not the cause he's a symptom\nThe president did not create this atmosphere he did not\nAnd progressive who say he's created this atmosphere are wrong and they also don't want to point fingers at people on their own side to say these people to contribute to it it's a very one sided conversation and so I get the frustration with the media\nBut I don't think that the enemy there are bad actors in the media but the media of the press itself I don't think is the enemy of the people now let's go check traffic doesn't\nThink forty here you've got to do on the on the our duty body was found there's still a viable backup are petri industrial eggs in thirty one couple of miles over

Stone Mountain Norris Stacey Abrams gets elected stone rubble welcome\nThank you sure go ahead\nYes uh I had a question about the voting and a north\nFlorida you know where they had the hurricane he has a series of them\nTotally destroyed or those people are going to vote or they later rises\nFor that so they have put in the polling locations are operational to the extent that they've had to bring in portable building for voting they have\nUh the problem is getting the people back home a lot of people have their head they don't have houses to stay in so they moved out of state stay with relatives\nOr to a different location and they're going to have to drive back to that location or they're going to have to request absentee ballots now my understanding is the Florida secretary of state has been proactive in reaching out to people in the area and saying if you need an absentee ballot\nWill get you one just let us know mom but people have to do that\nRight okay okay\nYeah that ... thanks very much for the phone call yeah that that that folks it's going to be that that puts a disadvantage on the Republicans in Florida because that area is so heavily Republican\nI'm not withstanding that they brought in portable buildings they made it a top priority to get loading locations up to snuff to be able to do this it's just a matter of getting people back home\n[noise]
