S. B. talk now you should know there's other data out there today are\nAbout early turnout and democratic turnout it's not just in Georgia, Georgia is beginning to see a democratic turnout in this final week of early voting the Democratic vote now is out pacing Republicans some of the key Republican areas like for example ah\nWalton in Cherokee county are very heavily Republican areas in the state for sites Kelly is well the Republicans are not turning out now at the rate Democrats are turning out\nThat is throwing things off a then of course you do have Sunday there really I think somebody totally fourteen of the hundred and fifty nine county is due Sunday early voting\nAnd Democrats are now in those areas out pacing the Republicans\nSo that helped Democrats get close um I ... the ... campaign and\nThe people I talked to everybody it seems to the ... they don't want to say they\nUsually they don't want to jinx it but the trend lines are good the problem is that we don't want to run off I really don't want to run off but the other problem is that there are a lot of independent voters voting and we don't know how those people are voting and that can make things closer\nWe also can't tell for sure who someone is voting for you assume\nRepublican candidates are voting for the Republican Democrat cancer run for the Democrats but there has also Paulina showing a shift in the last couple of years where some people who are currently identified as Republicans because their voting patterns are shifting towards the Democrats because they don't care for the president and it's the Atlanta suburban women that the\nRepublicans are nervous about they're nervous about it for Karen Handel they're nervous about it for a poodle and they're nervous about it for brand kept but there's another aspect of it as well that is the Hispanic vote\nOr Hispanic voters have not really been engaged in this election\nAnd there is deep fear because of the president's wanting to ban birthright citizenship and announcing it before the election he may inspire Hispanic voters now to go vote and in places like when it county for Rob Woodall and for brand Kim\nThat could impact the election and is there are other parts of the country where we're starting to see democratic or Hispanic voters seem to suddenly be voting in the last week they seem to we don't know though if they're voting Republican or Democrat I've\nUh seen a number of interviews with Hispanic voters were the reporters very clearly expect him to say that\nThey are um that they are voting Democrat and they're not they're voting Republican kinda throws everything off on all the\nPresumptions but still it is a dangerous game people are playing in looking at the early voting and making too many presumptions from what I can tell you is everyone is convinced there is a sudden surge of the Democratic early voting Georgia and there's rain coming on election day as well as tomorrow\nUm and you know it can I just say that and I mentioned this earlier this this year but I'm just I Am just determine I feel compelled to lecture kids dressed up as horse tonight\nUh eat irks me to no end of the ... taught um the effect on Halloween costumes\nAnd I know I said this every year and I've already said that this year but come on parents be involved in your kids' lives I and I actually I went to pivot from when it when it ... I've gotten more to say or early voting turnout but I've been meaning to talk about this uh since last week and I only reference it very briefly last week\nAnd I've got some time here I Want to do this it is worth ... speaking of parents being involved with their kids that you should know um the New York times of all places and did a fascinating story ON Technology in classrooms now I I I gotta tell ya my kids\nWere at our church's school\nLast year and\nWere miserable in the school just discipline issues which are unfortunate\nThere's rubble and the school just discipline issues which are unfortunate um\nAnd we decided to move to a smaller a Christian school where the doors weren't thrown open to everyone um one parent at least have to be a regular churchgoer the school and it really has made all the different with our kids their leaves so much happier\nThe discipline problems that we had I mean the schools not perfect no school is but the bullying and the discipline problems we were dealing with a last year that in the ... several years the from rural school they're all gone away or the school is not as wealthy as the last school\nThe last school starting in sixth grade all of the kids get tablets and their homework is all done on tablets and they had these H. P. monstrosity they didn't even have chrome books they had these a H. P. tablets\nAnd I'm I'm an apple I use windows for years I can navigate the windows I just I prefer the Mac so much more of that and not withstanding that\nI wasn't a fan of these sorts of tablets but nonetheless they ... it was it was ... a very big thing all the big schools are doing it ... and they're not alone a lot of schools a lot of public schools have to take into having kids do their work on tablets this new school it's textbooks in every class every every subject has a textbook\nAh and the kids I'm already finding the kids are doing better with textbooks because the technology can get in the way of just focusing on your homework it becomes a distraction sure enough\nThe New York times has done a massive massive report ON Technology in classrooms\nAnd you will probably not be surprised to learn that parents of kids in Silicon valley are insistent that the kids have textbooks and not tablets\nAnd that in their homes kids cannot have I pads and devices to stare at no screen time in the homes of the inventors of these devices and I want you to think about that for a minute the people who know these devices the best\nDo not want their kids using them at all\nAnd what the New York times points out now is that there is a technology gap\nBetween the rich and the poor\nThe richer you are the less likely you are to allow your kids' access to this technology\nAnd the most prestigious private schools in the country are realizing that this technology actually harms development instead of helping development but so few parents realize this they they get tattered as oh look all the kids get tablets to do their homework on the computers that or did it\nAnd more and more studies are showing this is actually a terrible idea for kids\nUm think about that for a minute\nMajor private schools in this city\nAre putting kids on tablets and getting rid of textbooks\nAnd the people in Silicon valley who invented this they're now banning their schools they appear it led initiative among the private schools and the public schools in Silicon valley to ban the use of tablets in schools because the parents know that it actually harms their kids' academic achievement\nTurns out good old fashioned paper textbooks\nAre better for kids and helping them retain and process information than staring at a brightly lit screen\nJust a while I could have told you that though I could have I'm now I could also day when you get a check\nYet when we go again the ball how do you buy my forte bring us at ... an hour and a half there to get out and got what about do anybody that now that you wrote in what way around where I Am now\nAnd I'm twenty four by four twenty five star for George way over to our very own gotta\n\nThank you very much now it looks I I'm not I I'm not getting on this uh I I like text or I have had books\nAnd I've had professors that have given material and PowerPoints a seminary working on my PHD or people have a move toward electronic stuff and I'm noticing a trend of moving back\nI think that is a good thing I find that my memory retention is better when I have the tactile touch of a book in front of me than a screen and there are tons of studies\nShowing this is the same with kids that kids do better having a physical page in front of them\nAnd I would just tell you if you're a parent\nAnd your kids are using tablets at school\nYou should make sure the administrators at your school see this study from the New York times this past week or Google is your friend on this this is a widely traffic study is very easy to find just Google New York times um electronic devices in school or tablets in school and they are finding it is a big mistake and it is the parents of Silicon Valley\nAnd they are finding it as a big mistake and it is the parents of Silicon Valley we're raising the red flag I mean that they're interviewed people who helped develop the I've had people who who work at Google or in the like and they're all saying no no no this is not good for our kids are kids who do not need to be scared of these devices in you know we had to go cold turkey in our house\nWe did a I'll I'll tell you more
