think that me as a listener and use the host is a little bit of a microcosm of people in the the broad spectrum of Republicans conservatives in that we don't always agree sometimes irritate me and I'm sure to irritate you\nUm it's like a mirror yeah support\nTrump initially and I respected that and understood why I did but if you look at it today\nThere's this cold lessons going on the centering of people in a broad spectrum of Republicans conservatives who are starting to think the same way and that doesn't mean you became a Trump or or doesn't mean I changed that much but I think people are centering on what's important and I think the fuel for this was the craziness that's gone on\nThe list guy David I think you're absolutely right it's a great observation I Can't tell you the number of friends in fact I got a friend of mine who\nWas a die hard yeah I mean I I didn't support the president twenty sixteen and this guy was like burn it all down if he gets elected um he's a blight on America and he's like a man I'm voting for this guy twenty twenty I Am writing them a check these people are out to get me and my family and ruin us\nAnd I hear that from people all the time the anger on the left is really driving people to the president much more so than the president's action sometimes tend to to drive people I mean like today's at the ... the president of the United states no president should ever referred to anyone as a horse base a particularly the woman he cheated on his wife with\nRain in into the area now in the south side noon and you're going to be getting rain over eighty five or just\nSouth of Newton and the into the Noonan area here and just will but Griffin is well you've got some rain encroaching on your area and the north side you got to get up north of coming for there to be rain it's heavy rain now that it was between coming in blood I go\nIn the north of ... you start seeing rain it'll be over five Seventy five here in the next forty five minutes there are some light showers on the Greek curve in downtown Atlanta um ... we had a listener call in\nAnd ... ... you made a good point actually I I guess it was somebody on Twitter and then I just echoed the point\nA David cold in the last segment remember how a lot of Republicans and conservatives people right of center who weren't fans of the president a\nAre moving in the president's direction myself included and then there were people who kind of held their nose to vote for and there weren't fans of him and now more and more they're thinking you know what I'm I'm guess I'm with this guy\nAnd a lot of it has to do with the antifa\nBlack lives matters is the the democratic protesters the harassment of people who dear to disagree the treatment of Christians in the country and\nWe didn't mention but I Do think it's worth mentioning the media as well I Do not think any president of the United states should ever refer to anyone as horse based\nJust don't I think the president should have better manners and that but it is really rich to see the media that was okay say in all those things about Kanye West last week being upset with the president saying this today on CNN\nCommentator referred to Kanye West as the token uh I don't even know if I can say that went on the air it's it's not that in word it's the other one uh and yet there are there are ... they were perfectly OK with that on CNN but they're horrified by the president using that word\nYou know but they're horrified by the president using that word or using that phrase horse race is talking about Stormy Daniels today\nIn the media has constantly or or take lessons while I was going while I was out in Dallas preaching last week the president did a rally in Ohio where he praised Robert de ... military skills\nAnd the media blew that up I mean made a huge huge issue out of the\nNBC News when wall to wall lose coverage of the president praising robbery leave what they left out is that the reason he was praising robbery Leon by the way it is completely not in dispute that Robert ... was a really general\nI mean even people who hate Robert really agree Robert ... was a brilliant general and that's where the president said Robert ... was a brilliant military strategist\nIn general and yet Ulysses Grant who was a drunk still beat him\nThat was that was his whole point he built up Robert ...\nAnd the media NBC News in particular when wall to wall in their coverage of sabotaging the president for praising Robert really never pointing out that the reason he did it was too then praised Brandt as even better in that Lincoln should have stuck with him about what was so interesting is when they finally realize is like oh\nI guess she's making a Kavanaugh statement that he stuck by Brett Kavanaugh that dropped to um no I'm not getting their Huffington Post reporters among others who are making that climate and\nYou cannot get fair treatment from the American press corps these days there are plenty of time\nWhere I vehemently disagree with things the president does and I say so on this radio program and it makes some of the really mad make some of you really made yeah is there are some of you listening right and I know you're listening or in a and you can't buy any criticism of the prison any criticism of the president in your mind is is treachery\nBut I ... to be pushes well what's so amazing to me is that you can't trust the media and so many people to actually\nCriticized both sides and praised both sides it's all one or the other the media is just as bad as those who are always from I think the real problem here as much as the now never Trump people who have manifested themselves now Republicans who were cheering on the Democrats because they hate the president so much\nOr the the always struck who he can do whatever he wants and it's creating a glorious\nI I kinda like where I Am it's not the easy position to be in but to say I think this is good and I think this is bad and I think I'm voting for the president twenty twenty but I really wish you wouldn't have done tariffs or cold Stormy Daniels horse face or what have you\nMore honest position than everything he does is good or everything he does is bad and some people who have lost the ability as a people to nuance uh what is not nuanced in Atlanta is traffic which is the best of herbal\nThank you buddy and we had a temporary drafted round hard exporting more WNBA vehicle buyer and there's no doubt the hot market at one point over land six Seventy five now the anvil blocked exits that I've worked a lot they now reopen the luckily\nThere that don't have anybody on the I don't doubt it but we're break like Atlanta wrote down twenty to free way to anybody out there yeah we've got a couple of them are probably thirty to forty minutes from where you break free their eggs forty\nThank you very much ah this the whole thing is is unhinged and the American media is so in the\nTank with the Democrats\nAnd the resistance you can't get a fair hearing you can't get honesty from the press these days\n[noise] and it's unfortunate because we really should have a free and on his press that gives us real I'm real truth\nAnd they don't want to I mean look at the Capitol situation the number of reporters who were in the tank for the Democrats pushing the smears against Brett Kavanaugh will get a ... is\nIt so Jane Mayer from the New Yorker has now come out and said that she pushed the Ramirez Deborah Ramirez story because\nYes yes yes\nThe Christine Blasey Ford ... story was true she wanted to prove a pattern\nShe ran the story not because she believed it was true but because she wanted to show a pattern of conduct if foreign story was true\nUp for a mirror as history was true she wasn't concerned about the truth of Ramirez the story\nThey were I mean all of them in the tank to destroy Brett Kavanaugh because they wanted to stop him from getting on the Supreme Court and now you've got to many members of the media and by the way NBC really has got to be ...\nIt's just it's amazing to watch NBC reporters now so you know I think that it's a legitimate\nI mean this has to affect their reporting where you had the guy at a the Washington Post over the weekend the congressional reporter who blame Republicans for the attempted assassination of Gabrielle
