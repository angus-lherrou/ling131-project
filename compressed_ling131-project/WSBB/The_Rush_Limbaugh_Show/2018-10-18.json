people are getting bonuses they are not happy\nThat more people are working and they're not happy the economy is growing to the point of absorbing all the new people that want jobs so\nWhy in fat who in the world could be unhappy by this who can be made unhappy by this the answer is very clear I don't want to give it away\nBut I told him that I think whatever arguments we're having here they are still all circling and focused on the age old argument between conservative and liberalism and that is the role of government and people's lives\nAnd the answer to why people on the left are unhappy at great economic news is because they can't claim credit for it and it threatens their whole existence where in people are not capable of this and need to vote Democrat to basically live\nThey need to vote Democrat need to continue to vote Democrat because only the government can provide for people only the government can can protect people against injustice discrimination\nAnd so as as looney tunes as a as the Democratic party is getting and as they have incorporated more and more psychological disorders that people have and now it's turning those disorders into political causes\nThat then demand the government fix we have an impossible situation and government cannot fix psychological disorders the government's not responsible for fixing all\nOf these problems that these people have that have made them victims by becoming victims they are absolved them any responsibility\nAs they are demanding that government chair that government fix it while the more independents success people have\nThe more people rely on themselves get jobs improve their lives just the fact that Democratic Party gets mad if that is all anybody on the need to\nKnow but at the same token new instances of polio and the Democratic party is not upset about new instances of diseases breaking out we've already cured and they're not concerned about it because\nIt is harmful if anybody makes the connection
