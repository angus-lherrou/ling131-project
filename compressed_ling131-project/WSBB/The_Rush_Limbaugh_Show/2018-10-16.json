Obama ruins the Democratic party ...\nIs the reason that they lost twelve hundred seats nationwide there hasn't been anything to change that\nThey lost the Supreme Court they lost Kavanaugh they did everything they could do a mounted October surprise they tried to destroy the life of a career in the past the future of Brett Kavanaugh to save the court nothing\nIs going their way they're not winning meanwhile what's happening on the Republican side many of you may hate hearing it's something you'd never Trump per se but the fact the matter is the Republican Party is unified and what made that happen the Democrats attempt on Capitol\nThe Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump's brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing all probably the first standing in his career\nIn front of a of a stadium or arena sized crowd\nI guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation daddy and it really is not used to hasn't I needed\nIt did in fact most people in the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons\nCompany not waiting with bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this\nThis notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites are Nate Silver this is the guru data analyst on the left who used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he\nWent to five thirty eight and then he went to a box of back to five for five thirty eight is his company and he took it to various places\nAnd the Democrats the rank and file Democrats live and die by what Nate Silver tells them for example made silver on election night two thousand sixty five PM Cape Hillary Clinton's like an eighty nine percent chance of being elected president so they were all thinking it was over in the same thing is happening now Democrats Seventy three percent chance of retaking\nThe house of representatives\nDemocratic voters breathing a sigh of relief Nate Silver is continuing report that he was on um the FiveThirtyEight dot com politics podcast and the host was Jody African who is a guy and the question has the gender gap increased since\nKevin the a lot of takes on Kavanaugh on the effect that he had are drawn by like male pundits who are in almost social\nNetworks right especially for Republicans where the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit of improved\nAfter the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats\nAnd all of these house races the Democrats are assuring their voters are locks they're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of 'em that are too close to call this isn't in the bag for them but they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blow away business for so long that if they come off of them even admit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base and they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten for rock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten in two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama one well didn't even get when he was on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year\nWe're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic\nLoss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency and the Democrats have the least amount of electrical power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... victory awake and the Democrats to comeback\nShow up and retake everything they lost all the problem with that is\nThe Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else Democratic Party\nDidn't much were bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the standing to\nEnergize but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along Benghazi there was nothing that Obama was doing the economy was a flat line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns to Mexican drug cartels in a back\nDoor way to do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did except they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component development twelve so now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand in the Nineteen twenties has suddenly over\nYes it's two thousand in the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd a hatred for who Trump is its hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaves hatred for his hairstyle it's hatred because it'll be mean spirited and what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us all girls this massive Democrat blue wave\nThere is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave\nPlus Trump is uniting the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver life here from the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this has been pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual were also I always says what are in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone\nIn both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there is a forty percent chance\nThat one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts and I'm like this for you\nLet me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as he can be he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitting he's never seen a split like this he's talking about Democrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate he is never seen anything like that you know I don't know how to factor\nAnd we consider it a toss up if it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's telling us he hasn't the slightest idea what's going to happen this election and he's very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way\nYou need to have the time of the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start throwing their numbers around and their percentages and stuff but let me just go through this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever have a split in the forecast like there's pretty unusual yeah a\nLot of things are unusual this time aren't they need to be unusual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it\nTo predict the likelihood of a split as unusual we um you know I always say when we're in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighties twenties on in both places that makes me nervous\nMeaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house\nAnd makes me nervous eighty twenty that's as close to ... it makes me nervous\nThat we're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance at one of those two British is going to be wrong [laughter]\nWell there is a pretty good education the Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't win the Senate ah when the how\nHe doesn't know he's nervous as analysts are telling you if it's eighty twenty both sides but they don't know it's fifty

character that soon the password\nAnd if you try to make AT T\nAnd it comes out as a plus sign you have to know to back it up as you did it wrong it's not an easy thing to do and I just I don't [noise] I I'm a long way of saying I Would be really really\nShocked if Jamal ... watch recorded\nWith the with an audio ... just press record or the voice memos that comes with with the watch I'd be shocked if it was a record and then I'm further ... I'd be shocked if the Saudis didn't stop on that watching destroy it\nIf they saw that he was wearing it so I don't think there's gonna be video or audio ... or whatever happened to democracy will be a Casey in sand point Idaho welcome great to have you here Hi\nThanks for your walk up I was wanting\nTo touch on why I think that might be a red wave instead of a good way and that's because for years and years we've been told that we buy the media and the ... however is that we needed to go with mark and a moderate candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney\nYeah yeah exactly right look where that got us in two thousand for national idol\nYeah in two thousand six ... Donald Trump come down escalator and we were fed the same talking points of life could win\nAnd with our back against the wall election night we all showed up to the polls for the the greater good of thanks and recruit the media and everybody else wrong and I believe that that gave the conservative a\nConfidence and I think that they're going to show up and a greater force because we've been told not to be able to wave and we're going from wrong to thousands of acres\n[noise] well that's what a lot of people are hoping that there is a sophistication sophistication level among two thousand sixteen voters that tells them how necessary it is\nTo go out and vote in whatever way but we'll continue to support Trump because that's really what this is about\n...\nMaybe I'm going to do this starts tomorrow Thursday I don't know which yet but I it it's it's it's about time to go through the list and the Republicans have this list but when they made their own of what to expect if the Democrats win the house and it is brutal and I don't have any doubt\nThat everything on the Republican list is true they're going to every committee in the house is going to be used to investigate something Trump has done or some body in his administration it is going to be unlike anything we've ever seen every day of the Trump Administration is going to be investigated and subpoenaed\nThat's all the Congress is going to be doing is investigating and indicting that's all they're going to be doing that's all that's going to happen the Senate\nRepublicans hold it so legislation is going to get ... there's going to be total gridlock nothing's going to get done none of Trump's judges will get past his lips\nAfter he nominates them so yeah it's\nGoing to require a lot of voters to understand this but you said conservatives the Trump coalition is not\nJust conservatives there are a lot of Democrats who voted for Trump there are a lot of independents that voted for Trump there are a lot of moderates that voted for Trump there he got he got people from every demographic spread\nAnd some of the Trump people were not ardent Trump supporters they were frustrated didn't like anybody at all and fought they wouldn't go for the biggest change they could\nBut not every Trump voter was a make America great again to advocate\nSo how many of those are still happy with their votes how many of those real lives that for what they voted for her to continue Trump has to remain free of investigation I mean look what the deep stage when able to do when they don't even run the show\nThe deep state the executive branch which Trump runs look what they've been doing just imagine the Democrats' controlling every house committee agriculture intelligence foreign affairs foreign this morning whatever I'm a judiciary\nThey're not going to stop and jump they're going to try to get cabin off thrown off the Supreme Court they're going to bring back balls he poured that whole thing\nAnd I I haven't even remembered ten percent of what they're going to do that is where I'm going to make the list but it's just it's easily predictable it's a no brainer but I'm On I'm here to tell you that the objective is going to be\nThe force Trump out of Washington DC as soon as they can they don't want to wait for reelection campaign and twenty funny they don't want that they're going to do every thing they can\nTo make sure that the Trump Administration essentially ceases to exist in January of two thousand Nineteen if they win\n[noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise]\nAre we going
