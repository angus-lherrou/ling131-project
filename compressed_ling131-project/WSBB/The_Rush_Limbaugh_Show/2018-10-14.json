traffic came as another way to warn you about red alert problems during your commute to know when you ask me triple pain traffic alerts on your phone\nThat's for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty that's for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty okay so we've we've tackled the brown rice and well first let's talk about is there a downtime\nThere really isn't this is a very simple procedure we use ah the client comes in we do a console a with how they'd like to have their browse to appear on a daily basis or as a makeup artist we draw them out for them so they can preview it and actually face first\nAnd then you can make any changes any changes they won so we can work with people that have just a little bit of hair or no hair at all or just misshapen browse just from years of over ... and we'll stylized them with them once they've approved a template blend we've than numb the brow area\nAnd then we will use a cosmetic attached to machine that basically the needles or the with the human hairs there so finding delicate that's how we can replicate this feature on the face so\nThat artist steps into the pigment and then strokes the hair stroke through the brow we did this over and over until we built an eyebrow when we're done it just looks like they're ...\nWhen we're done it just looks like they're browse had been instantly restored they get to walk out the door looking like that so start to finish in Ninety minutes that got Ralph and it last Eighteen months just three years without wiping off\nOr if they need a little tweak we invite them to come back within three months and we couldn't finalize any little details that need to be done but other than that they are cosmetic free instantly with no downtime I've looked at\nHow so many of your before and after pictures and it truly looks so natural thank you that I Would not be able to tell that that was not their natural brat that's our whole goal that's our whole goal so\nI'm again and this is really important when we work with a male audience again no make up there so we want to make sure that there's no no down time for them\nUh and we definitely build men's browse into session so they come in we did the first session very lightly\nAnd then we come back in about six to eight weeks and add a little bit more to give dimension and then again just like with women they'll have about Eighteen months to three years where they just look better men look better with some some dimension and color around um their eyes\nAnd you know we talked about before that men and women I'm In the workplace it's uh we're working longer right\nAh working up into the advanced ages that's right so you want to look more useful longer right it gives you an edge in the workforce\nI agree and it makes you feel it makes you feel better I always tell my client you're outside the insides need to match and whatever you need to do to do that\nAnd that's where we need to be because we are living longer and it's a world that's used driven where unfortunately you focus culture so you know forties the new ah skewed me fifties the new forty and so on right and that's true and that's because we eat better you know we take better care of ourselves and we have access to all these amazing\nUh know downtime procedures really we call our lifestyle friendly procedures\nThat you come and spend an hour and a half and you can look up to ten years younger when you walk out the door how great is that like when I was like the magic pill\nIt is okay if you'd like to join us on the phone lines that's four zero for eight seven to zero seven fifty that's for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty and maybe you actually started working in a ... a a burn clinic\nI did I did I started out uh I actually was a professional makeup artists I'd been annexed edition\nAnd I kind of wanted to move more into service work\nSo I my mother had been a two time burn survivor and as a child I was very aware of one that made her feel like and all the things she had to go through to get ready and so um I found an article about her medical artist and how they restored features using cosmetic tattooing\nAnd it was it in a burn clinic out in California so my mother said well take care of the animals you go and see what you think and I came home three weeks later and I said this is what I Want to do with the rest of my life it was amazing that that is tremendous and also\nWe need to say that um they you know we can talk about the term micro blading yet or eyebrows and that's ... that's probably the term that most people correct so see eight with eyebrows you call it micro micro strokes macro stroke\nMhm why is that Mike or blading is just a manual method of application of these individual airstrikes micro strobe just means that it's the same thing except that we're using a digital a computerized apparatus said that it it's safer for the skin because we've eliminated the human component\nOf am am I too deep but my two shallow so the machine reads the skin as we work across it and it just like to do in hair transplants or Harry now they have robots that do the same thing so it allows us to kind of remove that element of error\nAnd that way we never go to date for too shallow it's just always the perfect amount it adjusts itself automatically for every person I'm working on so we can do all skin types from the ... election to the darkest\nWhere the traditional micro blading manual method there's great limitations on on the type of people that can be done on and it it's not only meant to last for about a year\nSo ours is more of the long term but it's still the same effect that individual here stroke that everybody's so excited about right now\nOkay let's talk about something that I'm dying to [laughter] and this is not talking about making your lips a larger sized this is giving them the look of that you have lipstick on correct and not a garish colored this is just\nI'm a little tone a little color to your lips so you can wake up looking like you've or fresh and you've just had your you know little fresh hint of color\nWe call it an enhanced natural or lip blushing and this particular procedure last about three years so when we do that\nTo kill or procedure last about three years so when we do this and a client comes and we're going to match the tone of what young children slips looked like and that's our best visual example everybody knows that\nThat color is amazing and it goes with everything right so this is why we call it enhanced natural now different tones of skin um have different amounts of Blue Note in the ... depending on the amount of veins present in the surface so we will adjust that enhanced natural to each individual person\nBut in the end it's going to look like they did when they were a small child that vibrancy and and just natural color that goes with everything\nAnd once we age Melinda ... what happens to size no little or knowledge and they lose a looked like a cadaver [laughter] she does not look like a cadaver but\nWe didn't lose color so what kind of look washed out and tired all the time ah so that's why you see women putting lipstick on I mean think about all that so I I eat my lip all throughout the day I'm a ... it right on like anytime it All right\nSo we shouldn't do this procedure for you and when you walk out the door Belinda you'll just looked like you have lipstick on that day\nAh within three days it settles down in lines and within six weeks to bodies bloomed in this amazing color that nobody can tell or believe is actually tattooed in and it's gonna last year about three years now I'd say the biggest question we get is if it's a tattoo why doesn't it lasts forever\nThis is cosmetic or medical tattooing the pigments that we use are designed to be ex Foley aided by the body okay fine so you don't get in trouble and you can change your mind as you grow older you may want things to look different\nSo as the ... that allows your artist to change the color in age gracefully with you [noise] okay what if I decided I'm going to wear this bright red dress to Christmas Party okay and you've got an enhanced natural if she'd simply put a red lipstick over the top of it and it would function just like it would lipstick on your normal lips\nBecause the tattoos under the skin Belinda\nIt does not interfere with top cosmetics always tell women we want you to look natural\nAnd than anything else you want to add to it to enhance that are embellish it in the evening\nGo ahead I mean it works very well hand in hand but the good thing as you get to wake up with color every day and what is the downtime of having ... there's really no downtime with either procedure ah we just tell people the color is going to be vivid for about three days because my ... my ... brushes or needles\nA but you're ... when the procedures done your number when you leave it's very comfortable a lot of people think needles and paying with traditional tattoo or fillers but we use great topical and these are very shallow superficial type tattoos that don't cost discomfort because of how we manage it\nA little Tylenol afterwards and you're good to go oh that sounds fabulous\nOK we're speaking with ... with new vote clinic permanent makeup and there's so much that she actually does um at
