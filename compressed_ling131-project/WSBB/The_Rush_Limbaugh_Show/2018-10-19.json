poverty and violence in the Central American country with the hope to make it they were born in ... nothing about this as organic you look Trump's right to ask who is paid for this who is buying

they got to drink\nMany of the ...\nI think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was none of the ongoing or a before now\nI they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected and it's been a slow reversal in a slow realization on the part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side what we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a Pompeo left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohamed been so I'm On the crown prince he flew to Mexico\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message compelled to him so he got one report for maintenance\nI think that was the message punt pale talk so I got one report from a repeat of the Caribbean has turned around now if that's true whoever is paying for this is going to have to keep paying for those people who go wherever they go next are they going to go back to Honduras are going to go back to Guatemala are they going to go to holding places in weight\nTo try to do the caravan all over are they going to try to sneak them in in smaller groups rather than as part of this gigantic mob only time will tell thanks again Todd this is Jeremy in Mayfield, Kentucky you our next on open line friday Hi\nThanks for taking my call Russian my coming loud and clear\nYou are sir here you just fine\nThanks it's a sixty dollar Samsung strung out whatever but uh yeah you know we\nAll have our obstacles to bear in life and your your overcoming those are pretty well I hear you pretty well\nThank you uh you know I'm a ... I voted for Trump um added Trump voter and America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question here\nHow can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned is in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we the odds with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty but at the ... can you cleared out of farming\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back on harmed and we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and I said yes we do and we're going to continue the spike is we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd a particular when Democrats are in the White House and that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that he was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William F luckily junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up\nAnd I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it have to do with it what what is understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying\nThe Saudi royal family is\nBehind this I said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam\nAnd that's what I started asking experts\nAre at at one of the people I talked to was anti McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the line shake case and it was Andy who said that he followed the blind check was just acting\nOut to being a radical inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the Koran if you read it right\nThis is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he he told me was so\nWhen you realized that the Saudi royal family\nIs in charge of\nWorld wide Islam because the holy sites are in their mecca and Medina Medina\nI found that it is absolutely\nTrue that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam while in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islam comes from ... for those you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence\nWhile hobby Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming anybody they can into their in their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family stood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating you don't know but Saudi funded cherished\nThe kid and you don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby is and that's what I went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve Mont\nMohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth\nHe wants to branch out he wants other people investing other industries individuals investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars in federal dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley and the typical places in other countries as well and part and parcel of his reform is the\nI don't know what word abandonment or and me a distance thing from ...\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goes if ... is still\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to show gay again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca I'm a diehard they do not want ... watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... among represents a bit of that it's fascinating that he has been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith the death of shaggy this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wondered well who determines these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives\nSo a Saudi king could have twenty sons how does he determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines the lineage of the crown prince the heirs and in what order\nThen saw him on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current\nKing Solomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says it the widow if it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as crown prince\nNot many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what your his sons is gonna be the next king but it's not the case so all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cabin up all these plans for reform\nHave been brought to a

an Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain it's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting and I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from him and that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that's going to happen these done too much into little time\nOh I don't either get the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions that we have independent budget deals that we had and then there's not and we have\nControl of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for\nYet\nNot serious money and certainly not serious construction there for his theory was that the Democrats are trying to demonstrate that is never going to happen and Trump doesn't even cared and it isn't\nGoing to happen\nAnd what better way to illustrate lives

Nikki Haley showed up at the Al Smith dinner last night I mean she didn't storm in there she was invited obviously but this is causing\nPeople to believe that Nikki Haley has got\nSome residential perspiration going on and in fact she might Nikki Haley said something less that we don't have this on tape or an audio but she chastised Trump last night she standing\nIn America in domestic politics we do not call our political opponents evil\nAnd of course the room say hey\nWe do not call well who else does but Trump he calls the press evil\nAnd the Democrats evil and so it's that comment that that made people think a ha she's she's actually going forcing him to go for the Republican nomination at some point maybe not twenty twenty twenty twenty four and she is beginning the process of distancing herself as a Republican from Trump\nBut her funny lines had to do with Pocahontas theory\nWanting to buy things that again right\nI get it you wanted an Indian woman [noise] I don't want
