like sharp and Reverend Wright's Louis Farrakhan that's absolutely true and there's photographic evidence\nOf it and when those photos ended up being published in many cases and drive by cropped Farrakhan out of the photos\nOne of the examples at the funeral for Aretha Franklin and any rate uh your Democrats are demanding at Trump told it now did you love it when Trump said I have sounded down if you only told it back up I Will\nDonald Trump was elected to be different Donald Trump was elected because people were fed up with\nPolitics as usual I must tell you this people set up a politics see the Democrats in the media politicizing everything it's not going to send people running the Democratic party\nQuite the opposite of what the media thanks\nTo the media and the Democrats obviously think that the majority of the American people want to see the country the way the Democrats do it through a lens of everything being political\nAnd people don't want to see it that way the Democrats in the media telling Trump to tone it down\nBut they\nTone nothing down themselves what\nWas the mayor of Baltimore said the protesters we need to give\nThem space to destroy\nWe need to stand back and let them get it under their system they say nothing when the Republicans were gunned down they abuse power to hide the Hillary's crimes to fix elections Iran's silent coups against a duly elected president\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is part that for Trump takes a helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter\nSaid Mr President do you think you need to revisit does\nSee some guy goes nuts in a synagogue and squirrel hill and the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns\nIt's time to drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target and that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump as an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nThe reporters as Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws has\nTo do with it if you take a look if they had protection inside as a result would have been\nThe speed that will always exist I suspect\nSome kind of a protection inside the Capitol\nMaybe you could have been very much different situation\nHe was able to do things that were generally should have been able to do\nAnd next up F Chuck Todd of meet the press who thought that the Russians were behind the pipe bomber a Cesar ... yeah Chuck thought to the Russians might be behind that this guy that that that also gets more curious as time unfolds [noise]\nThis guy was was uh [noise]\nYou ever have you ever heard of a routine failure you\nEver known anybody that was always on the verge of a big score hit it big and never amounted to edit that apparently was this guy [noise]\nCesar ... dog anyway we'll get back there but the minute here is the mayor of Pittsburgh with F. Chuck Todd I meet the press that his name is William ... into an F Chuck said is there anything that President personally can do if there is something you'd like to see him do personally about\nThe see how this works [noise] see him somebody clearly mentally unstable who has been a nut case for a number of years who hates Trump by the way because he thinks Trump is a sellout to the Jewish people and here's Chuck\nTodd of asking the mayor of Pittsburgh is Trump responsible if Trump culpable if there's something you'd like to see the Trump do personally about gun violence\nI broke along to an organizational bipartisan organization called ... again still legal guns I don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues mosques and churches\nFilled with armed guards for schools filled with armed guards I think we're we're dealing with an irrational person who acted irrationally in trying to create laws around that is not the way that we should govern\nWe should stop have your from happening in the forefront and not try to create laws around a rational behavior to confess\nThat's all must do is create laws to justify irrational behavior and force on the rest of us in the mainstream of culture and acceptance of irrational behavior and they tried to tell us that it's normal and we're the big ... or whatever if we reject that as normal\nI think it'd be very very irrational actor rational person acting irrationally me trying to create walls around the [noise]\nYou mean you\nYou're telling me we can't have laws or procedures or policies are smart thinking to deal with their rational people the mistake is dealing with a rational people rationally but not protecting yourself from them that's that's not a danger\n[noise]\nAnd so you see a defensive weapons according to the mayor of Pittsburgh not call for here not the thing to do\n[noise]\nIt also in these quite look I Know the drive by say Trump and I know they're trying to get rid of Trump but even take Trump out of this the fact that\nThey're looking for washing tend to have the solutions Washington must do something somebody in Washington was\nThis happened in Pittsburgh in a state Pennsylvania and yet ... with a nut case and hated the president somehow it's up to the president they have only or no it's actually the president's fault\n\nComes just make a comment so stay with one more soundbite this wouldn't be audio somebody number ... this morning\nCNN's new day the co host Adelson camera erotic interviewed the tree of life synagogue rabbi name is Jeffrey Myers camera Robin said President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh in the coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to come\nThe president of the United states is always welcome I'm a citizen he's my president he's certainly welcome\nWell not if they thought he was responsible but didn't drive by as they're trying to say trust\nAnd if they thought he was responsible and drive by as they're trying to say Trump's responsible for this the rabbi here obviously buying it if you think Trump's responsible for that you don't want him anywhere near whatever your organization\nIs so I made sure that didn't sit well with the with the left or the drive by let's take another brief break rush right after the light of that may\nBe that\nNews Ninety five five AM seven fifty W s be\nMy
