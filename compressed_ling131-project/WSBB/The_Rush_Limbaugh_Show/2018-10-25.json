less excited less enthusiastic that this bomb story has totally destroyed all of the energy you know that's what they're reporting out there\n\nIs that what the media is trying to do with all this over the top coverage of this Trump targets bombs received by Trump targets\n\nIf this is indeed the election meddling depending on how it ends up here this could be a pretty successful case of

many ways economically foreign policy intelligence you name it and they have the audacity\nTo chime in on this so called stupidity and ignorance of Donald Trump\nI just some days it just gets to me it just ticks me off another Trump tweet\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely false in an accurate reporting in the mainstream media but I refer to as fake news it's gotten so bad and hateful it's beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast\nEverywhere to that is true they're out they're calling Trump hitting worry about calling I'm not you know the New York times published a story yesterday the day that this bomb business started the New York times in a store yesterday fantasizing about Trump's assassination\nYou want to talk about lack of civility you want to talk about public discourse the New York times yesterday October twenty fourth published a fictional piece imagining Trump's assassination at the hands of a Russian\nAnd the secret service agent novelist is always sharp wrote the following narrative of the president's assassination I'm going to quote verbatim the president doesn't seem to notice heat wave in his ... the secret service agents clustered around him assured him forward the armored liberal idling outside at the curb\nThe Russian waited until they were a few steps past before he drew the gun\nHe cited on the center of the president's backing squeezed the trigger the ... the secret service agent at the president showed her neglect spawned the indoor crouch he registered the scene instantly drawing his own weapon with razor reflexes\nThe Russian tasted failure he closed his eyes he waited to pay the cost but it did not come he opened his eyes the secret service agents stood before him presenting as block but first here the agents send it to the Russian assassin use mine in\nNew York times published this yesterday a secret service agent helping a Russian agent assassinate Donald Trump after the Russians gun sales to fire\nNo wonder the New York times couldn't resist publishing ... even on a day when they are pretending to be horrified by the photo violence because of some bombs being sent\nTo Democrats you know like a couple of mouse clicks could have told the writer of this piece that the secret service no they don't use ... they're not they should blocks for years the six RPG two nine [noise] a minor minor [noise]\nSo it's actually ran in the New York times they explain the reason for publishing with these New York times well\nOur focus here at the book review is our books and stories but also on how the books being written and ran reflect the world outside of books and one of the biggest stories out there of course is the mother investigation that relationship between Trump and putting them\nIt's hard not speculative it's made up\nTheir justifying a story on the assassination of Trump by a secret service agent based on the mother investigation\nI'm telling you these people are not right folks they are ... their troubled that they are suffering psychological disorders that has been brought on by the on the relenting hatred they feel over the outcome of the two thousand sixty an election they are out of control\nAnd these are the same people that published and reviewed a movie on how to assassinate George W. Bush during his presidency and all day long yesterday and all day to night we're getting\nPreached to bite of people in the media it would be very very dangerous discharge speculated who was behind the bombs before we have the fact that is very very distant preaching to us\nAbout civility when they are running stories and publishing excerpts from books fantasizing over the thrill and the joy of Donald Trump being assassinated anybody find something seriously wrong with these people other than me\nThere's something seriously mentally psychologically wrong here I mean it's one thing to run this another thing to not realize how plain and simple wrong it is and then to justify it based on the Mueller investigation\nWell there's a lot of exercise there Mr Limbaugh Muller is looking into the ties between potent and there aren't any\nOr is looking into the ties between potent than Trump there aren't any ties between Hillary important\nThere aren't any ties you haven't found any there never worry any that were known to be found there wasn't any collusion anybody with an open mind and like your pencil eraser knows it by now but not these people\n\nHappiness glee over fiction\nResulting in the assassination of Donald Trump promoting it\nOn the same day they're wringing their hands to ... did in ... so many bombs had been sent to Trump target [noise]\nAnyway Trump is right on the money with his tweets about the media being culpable and I'll tell you don't misunderstand you know I'm a big self responsibility person I Am so into it\nThat I don't ask for help enough folks I really don't I I've I've been told by number for you know you could really ease some stress if you ask for help I if I look at everything as isn't especially things I Want things I Need I look at them as totally\nMy responsibility and maybe too much I don't know but I firmly believe in it and so therefore whoever did this is the ultimate responsible person no question about it but I'm not going to sit here and time my hands\nBehind my back and the other half of my brain behind my back being preached to buy a bunch of people lying to us and being phony about it because they're not they are trying to pass responsibility if there's lots of Donald Trump in and trying to get us to shut up\nIn response and in opposition to we're supposed to sit here is that oh no no no until we know the facts recap combat while they comment left and right and start ragged on Trump\nOr his supporters or what have your while we're supposed to sit here and be polite and have good manners and not say anything about it we're\nDoing what we always do were minding our own business we get up one day and we find the left just trying to suck the hell out of the country and we find ourselves in

top of all that he criticized the media coverage he doesn't like and of course he took no responsibility for his own rhetoric\nWell Donald Trump junior responded to cry baby Jimmy costume with this ... hey Jimmy did you\nOr your colleagues take any responsibility for your rhetoric in constantly calling my family racist and Nazis for two years when my wife actually opened an exploding on below the white powder intended for me what about when it happened to my brother Jimmy\nYou know you guys claim everybody else has to accept responsibility for their rhetoric but you don't want to have any responsibility for your rhetoric or your actions and that is so damn right on they demanded the media\nTotal exemption from what they say from what they report because they're journalists because they get mentioned the first amendment there\nCan be no criticism of what they do and you damn well better not investigate them you better not find out how they get a legitimate kids they have how many DUI

about male multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd have in Charlotte miraculously at the same time and across the valley yeah and if they if we can actually find that that's not that's not common sense I mean I see how that\nCan just sort of the the new world package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the day before truth CNN got their little Clinton who support\nI there was a ... throw the whole group of them that they have like four or five of them shows up all that I thought well how do you know it was a priority mail\nIt couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages easy way obviously your first caller is what I was one of the Congress adults can make the fact that there wasn't enough postage on at the post office he even accept it\nUm the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages so you're not taking ... and paying for them you know having to wait and paid in profits properly\nUm your you have to stick the post office box right well I was just ... don't even have enough ... wind whipping oversized practice\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know

individual also get more than any other nation and the point is that\nI have the choice when I get to charity I give it to I don't have the right now my neighbor who they give it to and that is actually what the government's doing they're telling us well they're gonna get basically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give us a choice and that's my point\nA good point too it's a classic illustration is reacting to the soundbites we play the John Case it was a ringing of hands and guilt over the fact of caravans coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it\nOver the fact that caravans coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it\nAnd it because we're not in it but could be in it except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls 'cause God doesn't want that and we've got to realize that that were just playing lucky it's kind of like written Richard Gephardt out winners of lights lottery\nYou know we were just minding our own business one day and we got conceived in a woman in America and we've got born into America and and man that's that's so much luck that that we shouldn't feel weren't anything special so the fact that we weren't conceived and warms down the Nicaraguan ... means that\nWe all we really do and we gotta we gotta learn to walk in the shoes of others and that's the wrong way to look at it we nobody has any trouble imagining what it's like to be poor that's why so many people strive not to be governor it isn't hard to imagine\nWe don't have a lot of people in fact most people in this country go up and down in terms of annual income\nOr people that are in a lot of money and lose it all there are people that are in an average amount of money all their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never if they've never been in and they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world United States poverty is not really poverty I got in trouble Everytime I point that out but it happens to be true\nUh statistically financially however you want to look at it but but the way to look at these disparities is not simply say oh oh that could be me and in the run around feeling guilty about it\nUh\nThe way to deal with this is not the runaround constantly imagining well you know if there's one accident and I could have been in that care a man and then having\nThat impact the way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion and lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism it never sounds anything\n[noise] liberalism as a\nGutless choice because you'd never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care\nAt all you have to do is tell people how much pain you're seeing\nAnd how it makes you so one comfortable to someone fear look at the suffering and the starvation its citizens and you are automatically credited as a person with great compassion you haven't solved anything all you've done to say\nThat you recognize and you're telling everybody else they've got to do something\nAbout it and that's liberalism solutions\nWhere the answer is and solutions to these problems are exactly why they have been happening in the United states for the past two years\nSolutions\nBy the way before
