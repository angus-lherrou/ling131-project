I mean we are our race here in the state of Georgia is a highly contentious it is that the gays from outside of the borders of the United states is upon\nThe state of Georgia and why do I think we're such easy pickings for that I think it's because you know we like to tout ourselves in the city of Atlanta\nAs a city too busy to hate I called bowl on that we're in the city and state too busy to forgive\nMe we just refuse to forgive and move forward actually not all of this\nAnd and I was saying it in the first segment that if your constitution is not your bedrock if liberties not the bedrock if you're more interested in reinventing the wheel and so is your party in your party's interested in and oppression that that you have to ask yourself and you're taking money from people who are completely anti constitution anti American everything\nAre really in American so for some of you who are in that hyperbole\nI Know my industry sells hyperbole a lot to you but that's not hyperbole that is that is the foundation from once you can legitimately decide who you're going to vote for and who you're not I don't care what side of the aisle you land on people in my own party I wouldn't support because there are oppressed his people\nSo I mean this isn't a partisan statement but we are married to our skin color and the state of Georgia are I\nMarried to our skin color in the state of Georgia our identity politics are sexuality or sex or gender or academia I mean you name it you know ... those are the things that rule and rain and the state of Georgia\nAnd it doesn't have to be that way and for some of you you know you're you're trying to decide whether or not to walk away and listen as a minister I get the generational ah wow encroachment upon your liberty I get it because generational things are real\nBitch excuse my language they just refuse to let you move forward and especially when it comes to\nFeeling like you're going to be a sellout you're going to be ostracized you're gonna be alienated or to be alone in your choice you don't even know if you can trust the white man I mean 'cause that's what we made it\nThat's what we've made it if your house is\nBurning in a white dude shows up to pull you out or are you going to say no I got man I'm good\nI mean come on in the country is is burning socially socially it's burning so do we really need another person to help us you know it's like it's like going to help fry like fat back [laughter]\nAnd a friend of mine you said in the about Senator Flake me to\nOvercome so you know with a category five hurricane evacuation finger pointing at throwing around and that you know with the in our state it's especially around the issue of voter suppression really who's depressed do not know how does your name did you graduate from Atlanta public school I don't know I mean who is it that filled out your guard\nWho did you did you not do spell check before you hit send it I mean what I'm I'm so I don't get it's crap and\nMost of you guys are discerning enough and you are smart enough and you are American enough to know when something is crap when someone is selling you a bill of goods\nAnd I want to encourage you to this is the time to go back and read that preamble for yourself and own it for your life and then start making your decisions on who in fact is going to uphold\nThat base with regard to your liberty in this state and in this nation because there are forces that we're going to discuss later on in the show one in particular\nThat comes in the name of prosperity and move forward in ...\nAh and you know Citizens United and all that forward thinking and feeling and all that stuff that pumped millions of millions of dollars into our races they don't live here\nThey envy the United states they hate our liberty they hate our constitution always have they come from generations of it they always will and there is a candidate running for governor right here in the state of Georgia who takes money\nFrom such people does that count American\nNo it doesn't when we come back we're going to have ws the senior political analyst bill crane with us we're going to talk about some of things going on in this\nSuppose that voters depressive state of ours [noise] get down in some detail Iran to take your calls they tell you are listening to ... do you live in politics on WSBIU [noise]\nThe scotch late with a story that still gives me the creeps I grew up with an old fashioned oil fired furnace on the farm and when I got cranky which was often I was the one who had to go out of the solar coax it into work and\nI get a chill just thinking about this was a very old farmhouse on top of a deep dirt shelter met furnished reminded me of a giant Jacqueline would fenced it looked like huge arms coming out of the top of the fire regret covering the ...

trip to the basement\nWell bill got this week I just don't ask your question is no okay Bill Bill crane can you hear me\n... and cannot hear me we're having technical difficulties maybe he's yeah maybe my fairy dust has somehow [laughter] portrays it do grapes phone [laughter]\nIt's all good so we're talking about we're going to try to get Bill you know rounded up but all jokes aside before the break 'em well you're talking about voter suppression over the gubernatorial\nAmericans are Americans\nThen okay I think I'm getting I'm getting like I'm hearing from other planets right now so I think I've built came back with me too I ...\nI Do not have the train so when I hear bill cranes voice and then I Will break to bill crane until then\nI'm going to go back to the conversation [laughter] this is just live radio stuff happens he's got a roll with it but um anyway the guys are rolling out some funding going on in Atlanta today I think the ah taste of Atlanta going on is that right okay\nSo I was talking about you know dishonesty of ...\nI was talking about you know dishonesty of candidates 'em\nHow to determine whether or not\nYou were about to make a sound decision with regard to whomever it is you're electing um whichever raised but for me primarily I'm focused on questions that people are you know sending me daily around the Georgia gubernatorial race and because this raises made national headlines consistently for weeks now\nUm you know a lot of people are like I'm confused I don't know I'm really on the fence and you know Brian ... pointed a gun at somebody and any relief suppressing black people and minorities from voting you know what I mean these are these are narratives that people are believing um because they have other things do besides a you know that\nInformation all day are okay so I just got another thumbs up\nWell great to you know what we're going to break to bill in like one second I finished my thought [laughter] okay mhm my mama mowed down and like you know have said over there for a second [noise]\nSo that they there's a large body is evil and inordinate group of undecided voters who are legitimately just I don't even know what it's like they just feel paralyzed and a lot of it is because I Believe people are engaged in voter fatigue\nWhich is is an actual thing and particularly in the midterms I Do believe that the red is is completely a motivated and and we have you know we the left is given a great reason to say no thanks for showing up your cards that that's not really the road we want to go down\nAs a nation so more people are I'm inspired to show up and to re engage in these midterms which historically we have not\nBut I've been speaking to the voters who you know I get it being kind of like well historically this is who I've always voted for and she really is the first black female and black potential governor of the state of Georgia and wouldn't it really signal to us just how far forward we moved\nAnd I'm like we sure would if the candidate was actually someone who was actually adhering to constitutional\nPrinciples and that's my measuring stick for any candidate on any ballot argue for liberty according to that preamble or are you not\nSo now I'm willing to go to bill crane are you there bill we're going to try this again if he's not I've never talking to bill current again [laughter] for\nWhatever reason I got the thumbs up and bill is still not on my show so we're we're we're hey maybe you could text me your answers how about that but you know we're talking about voter suppression and voter id law being settled\nAnd and and you know OK okay and I just ah you know what about the president for Brian Kemp stepping down as secretary of state of it is that going to happen no it's not\nBrian is answered for things that occurred in the past with regard to his office and unfortunately you know past mistakes missteps even though you recalibrate and you correct them\nAnd they always come back to haunt you in politics they just do and they're capitalized on and they're embellished and they become hyperbolic you know talking points you know I've I've followed the\nDishonest ads of Democrat to give it to her own nominees de da Missouri few weeks now\nLittle footing other than an attack on her opponent's record 'em and his former campaign ad featuring a rifle that was not pointed at J. for the love of God can we move on from that\nShe has been an inordinate amount of time and money to attempt to convince you that higher taxes are necessary expanding dependence and poverty along with socialized medicine is the way to go\nAnd allowing illegals to vote is top priority for her campaign in other words she's made it plainly clear to anyone with a TV set that she is not building HER Foundation on the constitutional principles ordained by free men to maintain freedom\nOn the contrary she appeals to a base of individuals mesmerized\nBy ever fleeting social cons drugs not built for any real justice to ensue but to provide an outlet for continued disparity and division among Georgians both mentally and socio economically\nI mean what voters depression I'm I'm not seeing that again like I said before that we can you do did you misspell your name well\nAs we've reported on this station a number of times take your ID with you show up and vote matter of fact take two forms of IDs with you I just sat on my show this morning I Can't even check into a hotel I Can't ah what I was I Can't run a car I mean there's other fundamental thing I can apply\nFor a home alone a bank account I Can't open a bank account there are many things that I Can't even apply again and go for my driver's license without some form of id proving who I Am\nSo why in the actual hell would voting be any different why is that racists intimate can someone explain that to me if you can explain that to me please call in it\nFor zero for eight seven to zero seven
