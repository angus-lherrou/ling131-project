have to be some kind of ethical issue if you could just accuse somebody without any kind of cooperated evidence and then go public with that\nAnd raise you know that that amount of money is a is a

already have a lot of money anything than you could try to make that point that the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you Jeff in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left as always behave like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you know ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics work\nThere's no reason to stop and say no bully is ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that maybe maybe it's\nIntellectually now\nAccording to our caller that should have been the starting point people should have been picked up one grams opener and run with it and it shouldn't be calm\nThe daily identifier of the Republican Party they should have been throwing back firing back right at the Democrats in their faces every hour of every day exactly what Graham did make that the ongoing about putting them on the defensive make the media repeat these charges the ram laid out but instead it\nWas a standalone ramps and it it was great it was impassioned and that was the end of it it was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican\nAnd sell grams impassioned allegation from the Democrats was followed by agreement\nJeff flakes\nDemand that the FBI be allowed to do one more weight but it doesn't get their fight mellow fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs\nYou're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country and what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're gonna have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis but it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans\nDoes we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated we shared it with the way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on the Fox news but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and vitamin D did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said mom even got mad at it not a single one of them even want to refute if they didn't kill me I Want to get a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys Lincoln but no they said they didn't Lincoln Mr German we didn't Lincoln I just asked\nMy staff they said they didn't oh what about an investigation huh well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're gonna invest some of these other things that\nNeeds to be followed up on their needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent I'm getting tired of all they are further delay\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and there's been a while how why if that's so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility an attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering\nOver something now want to go back to my production [noise]\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out capital that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held up by because voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again then the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this keeps up Republican voters are going to get some kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons they hate seeing what's happening the capital and they don't want to management happening there on Kim they're going to show up in droves well I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\n\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting if Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh is not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to\nBe so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad that you feel betrayed\nBecause if that happens like that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin all were in the majority and we couldn't get to confine you need to come out in ... how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans that come out and vote to keep the majority when Kavanaugh was not sworn in everybody thinks\nThat what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there\nWere guaranteed to get their votes were going to there's going to be a Republican away because of what happened to Kevin all and then a Republican start campaigning and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe majority\nWe know it's very small majority but you know the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\n\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republicans are going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're gonna show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut it's that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump Trump ...\nPositive Trump Trump alone will be able to make the case Trump\nAlone will be able to turn a cabinet to defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do it\nVote for us Kavanaugh was defeated vote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout we have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here in certain rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see house don't say really are you kidding we lose and in hell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin Kevin on doesn't make it this is going to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up\nThe base that doesn't make any sense to me you know what I mean the other way around\n\nThis is another trick I think it gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up if Kavanaugh doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush voters are going to be so mad\nYeah yeah what the guy got\nRailroad railroaded and our guys couldn't stop it and when we're supposed to say well okay man we're really loaded now that's gonna really caused the turn up the ... I've done sorry clumps that I don't think it works that way\n\nWhen people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is that voters are going to be out there saying\nEven when we voted Republican Democrat still run down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up ... got to be the other way I\nGot to win this we have got to be the Democrats not one of them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analysts and they all well\nNot all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired up we want to let them destroy\nA great life a grave patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win them in terms how does that work\nYour football team loses make you want to become a season ticket holder\nOr is it one day when that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team why do we have to keep losing the fire up our base you talk about a trap\nShe asked me the media's behind that the Democrats a Washington establishment I got to take a break be back after\nThis seems like these we need more than ever rush leaky I\nYou should not have to nap in the afternoon the other thing we hear especially from guys is snoring and I don't care if you've done it all of your life does not mean that's normal it's going to blow your mind how many couples are not sleeping in the same room they come in\nAnd you get people call back in tears because I slept in the same room with my spouse last night it was beautiful thing\nDon't risk your health and lifestyle any longer set up an appointment today called six seven eight to six nine six zero for nine breathe easier at sleep better Georgia dot com\nBubble you asked me about ... er Cox media group station\nThat one is twenty four hour news weather and traffic ... five and am seven fifty\nAsked me\nWell good afternoon it's two o'clock I'm Chris channel alive and they told us be twenty four hour new center cows Canada and Cabot on such as the news so far on this first Monday of October first the thing that's clear now but still a couple of fugitives on the loose W sb ... columns at the scene of the great powers gaping Cobb County ...\nAnd ... or ... and ... than dogs they're eighty nine on board of cattle trucks that hurt other ran for ...
