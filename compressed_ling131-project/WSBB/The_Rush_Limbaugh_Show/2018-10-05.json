Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand sixty and if they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that is the\nKavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms\nIn other words in her study of things\nThe words in her study of things just\nContinuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there\nDon't know why I Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst because of\nHow Trump voters that first and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he is being treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populists coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of range had somewhat diminished until Kavanaugh came along and re awaken these people and fire them back up\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful\nThat it's all about being strong in help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from cabinet by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy as high now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixty two thousand eighty admitted terms now where I look she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people voted for Trump by deeply involved with things\nNow maybe there are some exceptions and you have some people to vote for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nHounded every day\nMultiple times a day

innocent and I can tell you this right now my military brothers and sisters have not hot and dry for that sort of write for this country\nDamn right that is exactly right I don't think Kavanaugh would be able to sue them I don't think that once you start getting into government government officials and so forth the\nPentagon or you've got the first amendment which protects political speech and you can produce an ad that's pretty much anything you can lie about whoever and whatever you want and there's not much you can do about it the\nThe uh the remedy for that is more speech\nWhich in this

term landslide defeat any party has ever experienced\nThis party deserves to be punished at the ballot box like no party ever has\nAnd in a decent unjust world that's exactly what happened what happened and yes\nRight now the Democrats are expecting this gigantic blue way if we're not going to win the house in ... already talking about being speaker\nThere even dabbling about the possibility of winning the Senate and then they're telling everybody what they're going to do and I'm telling you better if they do when both those you better get as much active\nEnjoyment out of our current economy and your current liberty and freedom as you can because they are going to start immediately erasing it by raising taxes raising corporate taxes committing this country to all kinds of worldwide climate change garbage\nThat is going to redirect American resources\nThere are going to reenact the Obama agenda and they're going to put it on steroids and that'll mean wiping out all of these trade deals all of these new jobs the Democrats want government to be front and center in everybody's life may want every voter to think whatever they have came from government came from Democrats\nIt didn't come from you it doesn't come from your hard work it doesn't cover yourself ... comes from them and you're going to learn it and love it and living by golly by gosh or else you're going to be punished\nThis party deserves to be so soundly defeated in November that we haven't seen anything like it if they lose if they do not win the house if they do not win the Senate if they lose seats in both\nThen that might\nMake some of the leaders of the party\nReef think their current strategy but if they win based on this it's going to get even worse than it's been this politics of personal destruction is\nGoing to be amplified and every Republican it's going to be targeted and every political media opponent is going to be targeted\nIf they win with this kind of behavior and

Bush in the first time of the rap on him is that he is is is a not a deep state or but that he is a swamp dweller a and there are some people who think that there could have been a more conservative choice Amy Coney Barrett by the heat\nConservative choice Amy Coney Barrett but he he he is good don't don't believe any of that this guy threatens the Democrats as much as if Antonin Scalia or back alive and were up for re confirmation\nGood you know as much as they try and thrown at this guy I mean I really think that there are only purpose behind the continued FBI investigation was to try to make like ... you know dig for everything until you find something\nOh there's no question delayed delayed delay and get lucky and find something that you can meet people believe or something that really existed but no you're absolutely right about everything there so far\n[noise] [laughter] well ... they take advantage of the fact like people like me even though I've been listening since Ninety three you know I work every day every dog got seven kids with what we do every time we don't have time to to ... a little more so so what happens unfortunately for the rest of the country that doesn't listen to Rush Limbaugh there's not that many [laughter] but the ones that don't\nThey get these hidden bits on the evening news or the drive by media they have no clue what what ... what the real news of the day or the news of\nThe week oh tell me what tell me about it I look if it's like they're too big developments that the people that only watch drive by media do not know they do not know that ball Z Ford's lawyer has been out there is some boarding perjury that they've been trying to get her before well tried to get\nWhere you live in the Kaiser to change her testimony to say oh yeah I you know what I Do remember being at the house when Kavanaugh attacked Christine they actively try to get her to change her testimony\nA and there's one other it's what they might slipped my mind but neither of these two stories have been reported nobody in America outside conservative media knows anything about\nThat that's exactly right ah\nI Wish I could remember having a mental block of what the second story it's related it's all related to Baltic port are two things here that the drive by\nA oh the yeah the boyfriend a letter to boyfriend letter claiming the bulls even why that she does teach people how to beat polygraphs that she's an expert at the boyfriends letter has not been reported on by the drive\nBy media a six year ex boyfriend a ball the Ford was basically said that most everything she said here is not true and then he added the woman is a credit card fraud stardom boats she continued to use my credit card even after I took her name off a bit of after we broke up\nAnd continue the charge things all and that she never had any fear of flying at all and that she never had any\nClaustrophobia that she lived for a while in a in a very small room five hundred square feet a didn't need a second door or any other remedy\nTo get past the trauma of having been attacked by cab I said none of what she's saying if she ever said to me she never mentioned this guy Kevin O's that letter that the boyfriend route has yet to be reported on by ABC CBS NBC CNN\nMSNBC in Los Angeles times Washington Post New York times Associated Press USA Today\nProfit to\nRussia Today they Al Gore news network none of them have run\nA syllable of that story or of the attempt to get Leland Kaiser to change her story [noise]\nThe most powerful men talk radio I met for\nNinety five five and a um seven fifty\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one random safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skill sweat and talent\nTo produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network on line at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.
