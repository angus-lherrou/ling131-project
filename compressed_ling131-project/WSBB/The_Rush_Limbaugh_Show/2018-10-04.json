new witness everything in this we knew which was eminently predictable\nThey still haven't the FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses upset folks\nAny of the allegations that witnesses have may they haven't been able to corroborate lousy forge testimony they weren't able to corroborate Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate a sweat like they weren't able to corroborate that this is now the seven FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nThe left is out there is there but they didn't talk to don't you're forty and they didn't talk to Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of the deal they testify under oath\nWhat more can the FBI where do you think the FBI I really think these people don't change their stories from what they testify under oath\nBesides that Dr forged testimony changed any way in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or Kevin always because they've talked to Kavanaugh for how many times over the years\nAnd now here is the payoff NPR without they pulled it themselves and they found that exactly what I have been saying has come to pass the capital hearings are back firing big time on the Democrats and NPR\nHearings are backfiring big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they plan to support a Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm election right now\nI'm so this this is happening and they only primary changer difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reaction to it I've even seen\nStories today among the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative\nMovement well we will ah will say about that but clearly there is a reaction isn't it and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people today that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran an operation to destroy women who surfaced\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and he got booed because the millennials in the crowd have no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token most people will not live to Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita\nHill so this is their first and that means it is the worst smear campaign ever that they've seen get anyone be smeared more\nCan anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse Kavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact she's been vindicated by evidence he'd been vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life well lived when you boil\nAll this now and I think it's going to be really hard for any Republican to vote against the guy\nAnd in fact I don't know this\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if some

Chuck Schumer his office stone faced\nThe meaning is they're coming out that many they're depressed or there are no expressions on their faces they're not happy in a stone faced their shell shocked there's something or other\nNow why would that be why well did the Democrats on that committee\n\nActually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying so I don't know how anybody could\nHonestly Fox without an I I'm not even being part is when I say this\nShe can't remember where when why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although for did the Democrats in that too many really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days was going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nomination\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they've known that this ... nothing other than the ... this is all this has managed to all they've got ... they really thought\nThat this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations in countless other interviews and written questions having produced\nWell that is shocking to honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but\nI fought this has been a scam from the get go and that they're all in on the scam and at the scammer was delay hence the late release of of of Dr Ford's letter\nDetailing all of this so they work out a Schumer's office and they're all stone faced\nAnd here's what Ben Sasse said last night on the Senate floor\nWe all know that the president cannot lead us through the time\nWe know that he just showing unable to restrain has impulse to divide that his mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and the not going to presume that you're listening but maybe somebody who knows you is I Need you to consider something senator south\nI Need you to consider something senator Sasse\nYou and numerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this it's who he is he can't help it\nMr Sassaman gets the other way round I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump has a behavioral patterns strategically ... it's called pacing and lily briefly explaining it began in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford what did he say compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it\nIf she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's lied and his death even gone Trump said all of this and everybody's in a while this is really unusual for\n[laughter] no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic maybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord so yeah yeah there may be something here we are going to look at it they don't always going to have oh no it doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue as seemed to dubbed tail with what the swamp things\nBut then\nA few days or are we go by him and the president's becomes a way he is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not mock her\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was for still look and listen to that little riff on Dr forge shaky uncorroborated provable test them on to the drive by us we're never gonna\nTell the truth about Dr Ford the dry buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally\nBut because he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said in the process that Dr buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving me the vapors gave me the papers on my got Trump is always uses horrible 'cause his businesses who may and he's not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did re counting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media on all day yesterday\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr Ford's testimony the drive by media did not report on on ... none of the cooperation being possible they did not tell their audiences\nThat the foreign people foreign place them a room with her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knows that\nFolks other than you\nBut people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying that people watch the mainstream media had no idea that the foreign witnesses foreign claims where they're all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends\nDr buys were not reporting any of that the drive by it's worth reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned the woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital\nWas guilty so Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she gets it on the record to drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way think of the millions of people who had never heard\nThe truth\nAbout Dr Christine's Ford and hurt\nAbout Dr Christine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of ... million just never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterize that for everybody think of it this way I think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and remain in West Virginia and North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\nDetailed it for people in his rally Collins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no corroboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest mediate millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protest today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous the people at these protests think she's telling the God's truth they think\nIt's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told them the Democrats senators haven't told them only Trump did another reason why they hate it\nBut we don't have an honest meaty and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine balls the foreign story\nNow they do and here's a little cherry on top\nSince Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying\nNo corroboration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump or his go literally insane\nBut if Trump hadn't set it and nobody would know what the Trump did say it millions now do know and and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report\nWe couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democratic senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff this is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more in a\nRush\nNinety five five at a um seven fifty [noise] don't you ask

Democratic Party in democratic members big time members\nAlso there's two people who are on the scene and that's her and having\nOne of them is lying why isn't this committing perjury we know nothing

they're trying to railroad a guy oh they don't lose control of the Supreme Court in their mind\nI Know but nobody is responding to them appropriately with me you got to put it back on you know well why didn't that they investigate port we don't know anything\nTo serve has been brought up brought up\nI tried to come met and I think I've carried out what I promised immediately that we were I have a fair and thorough process we had a\nFair and thorough process and I think that's best demonstrated by the fact that we the men in Iran about who the person was in the Feinstein ladder Dr Ford\nI read about her name and the paper we got on it right away to provide the forum she wanted an intern we provide the same forum for Kavanaugh\nBut what I've been dealing with since July the town the downhill slope that show has put us on Israeli dealing with a demolition derby\nAnd ... they just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo hopefully we're forty eight\nHours away from having a new person on the Supreme Court\n[noise]\nCertain endorse everything that's a fair amount of the comedy is a sad [noise] like I'm disappointed in my democratic colleagues for what they're doing [noise] there's no excuse for a but they're doing it\nI'm grateful to the FBI for their efforts and doing a thorough very important investigation says Republican Orrin Hatch speaking to the judge Kavanaugh dead what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people\nSome outside people should be disqualified but after investigations for both the committee\nAnd the FBI\nWe have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him\nAnd we need to confirm him right away his confirmation\nRight away his confirmation will be a victory for the Senate as an institution a reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate [noise]\nThat's how I judge to him for the way he's been treated yes this is an important position yes and Democrats have a right to feel very worried and upset of about ... a Republican getting this seat 'cause they thought they had won the election\nBut that isn't the case\nIn our side is handled this I think was discretion [noise]\nHaving every problem that has come up\nAnd frankly I Hope we can just move forward and you get this done it's the right thing to do judge Kevin I was a great judge and make a great justice on the United States Supreme court and I intend to do everything I possibly can to make sure he gets there as quickly as we can [noise]\n\nOur friend the senior senator from Minnesota said about this confirmation process she said this is not normal flag agree with her because if this is the new normal will be to the Senate\nAnd any nominee that would be subjected to the unacceptable\nCharacter assassination that we've seen directed at this nominee in this case if that's the new normal I don't know who would want to serve and frankly I think people would be justified and losing any respect\nFor the Senate than the way it conducts sell during the confirmation process so Moore is at stake than just this nomination and the Supreme Court the Senate itself is on trial if you're\nA vote against judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be an endorsement\nOf the mishandling of this confirmation process because of hiding\nRelevant information that could have been examined you on a bipartisan basis in a way that respected doctor forge request for privacy this is Republican John Cornyn senator from Texas the bottom of this as we've attempted to do now with twenty million people watching on television\nA vote against judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be a confirmation vote for abusing the confirmation process and a good person and it will be a vote for this shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign\nI agree that the FBI investigation to now they've talked to a total of a hundred and fifty different people or through the seven background investigations that judge Kavanaugh has been through since Nineteen Ninety three or ... operation\nNo confirmation of any of these outrageous accusations that have been made against him\nUnfortunately this could have all been avoided um\nMost of the embarrassment to Dr Ford and and the public circus like atmosphere if we adjust the ranking member had just made the allegations known in the regular process and could have been investigated as ... as I said in a way that would have protected her and her confidentiality\nI've said before and I say it again I Believe that we should and we did treat Dr Ford the same way I Would want my daughters are my wife or my mother treated under similar circumstances but we have to remember\nThat judge Kavanaugh's entitled to a fair process to and he has not been subjected to a fair process anything butts so now's the time to quit all of these antics these high jinx the circus like atmosphere and will do that tomorrow morning when we both\nAnd Saturday when we vote to finally confirmed this good man did this important position [noise]\n\n\nProcess of reviewing the FBI reports that we received this morning a has been exhausted and it has been a collaborative process with my colleagues a it occurred in a classified environment because these are documents that were not allowed to return to disclose to the public\nUh but because we can review them and only one place we review them together and we stopped and we talked about each point made to make sure that we understood\nOr is the message from each interview and each report Senator Mike Lee of Utah do that part of it by operation of law is not allowed to be public I Want to keep you there sure is that we treated these documents just as we treated each and every allegation with\nThese documents just as we treated each and every allegation with up no seriousness with a desire to do nothing more than search for the truth\nAnd just as we've spent hours upon hours hearing testimony in an open a hearings before the public we've also spent hours upon hours reviewing these documents in a classified environment\nAllegations of sexual misconduct are serious of sexual assault or of the most serious nature and always have to be treated with most seriousness may have been in this case\nAgain this is someone who's been through seven background investigations in the course of the last three decades\nWith over a hundred and fifty people interview with regard to have this is a man of outstanding character who has lived an exemplary life he and his family has been subjected to a lot of questioning a lot of ... a lot of humiliation in recent weeks\nThat\nHas been a difficult part of this process for him but in the process of doing that he's proven his character and his willingness to be candid with the public and ... even sharing facts that are at times uncomfortable\nI'm convinced of this man's character of his true for most of his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court or the United states I wholeheartedly support his confirmation and look forward to voting for him in the coming hours [noise]\nFault\nOf agree with everything my colleagues have said I senator\nTom ... of North Carolina here he'll be the final speaker experienced\nA traumatic event in our life I just also believe that there is no evidence that we've seen\nThrough the FBI background checks or the time that we've spent and they're hearing I'm just substantiate that these claims are properly alleged and directed towards judge Kavanaugh\nThousands of pages in that briefing room Mike or senator lay in our in that room together for an hour we break for an hour than we were all back for two hours I'm\nAt the desk is also some Fifteen hundred pages that document the prior at the uh\nInvestigations and none of those was there any reference and and keep in mind this goes back twenty three twenty four years this would have only been six or seven years after he was out of college certainly if it was in recent memory you would have seen some Web or some suggestion and yet there was not\nThat it's the last thing I'll leave you with those\nIt appears as though says one of the taxes some of my colleagues on the other side they all have taken here is not working they're not really substantiate able to substantiate the allegations", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show",
