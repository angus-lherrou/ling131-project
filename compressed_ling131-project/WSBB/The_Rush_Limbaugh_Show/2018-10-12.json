Russia and Trump was simply doing what Trump does he was laughing at them\nAt the futility that none of the greatest investigative agencies in America could find Hillary's emails the media could not find Hillary's emails the best investigators but nosy as people and nobody can Trump\nDidn't believe nobody could find them Trump believed everybody was shielding them and protecting Hillary so he said hey Russia maybe you can find them none of our people seem to know where they are maybe you could Hillary is still blocked by this\nYou asked Russia had\nMe on national TV she went to Twitter to make that point and Trump did no such thing if anybody would even the slightest sense of humor would realize\nHe was making a blindingly obvious when\nHe said the news media what reward Rochelle for finding Hillary's emails before Trump quote is Russia if you're listening I Hope you're able to find the thirty thousand emails that are missing\nI think you'll probably be rewarded mightily by our
