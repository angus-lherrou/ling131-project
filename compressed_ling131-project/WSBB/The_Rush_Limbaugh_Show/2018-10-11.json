from number one yes\nAnd my entire adult working life has been in an economy in decline and not only have you which has been a real pleasure you've I've listened to you for many years but\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton has been in the public eye and in particular in in my generation my whole life\nShe you know I remember Hillary\nAs first lady and working on healthcare\nAnd and to see this attack from the last um concerning Donald Trump and his finances and as someone who is the in my country get poorer we don't have any money\nBut people who do have any I'm ready to play the where did you get your money from game especially concerning our Senate and Congress\nI I find it hypocritical an unbelievable that these people who are completely there just have no self awareness\nWould be you know hounding Trump going after some for my part of it I Do not plan on abandoning my president it is the first time in my adult life\nThat I Am in an economy that is growing I was just old enough

about uh all of these things that they want to pay for you know Medicare for all it's a it's a lovely idea but we don't have any money\nRight there isn't any\nChristmas and you're making a really important point that I don't want to gloss over I Want to return back to\nBe a primary point you've made that you are in your mid forties I'm for the first time in your life your living through a growing\nPositive economy that prior to now your entire life has been lived in a either a flat line or a shrinking economy\nYeah part and you know let's not forget something for most of that time in the last eight years prior to Trump\nPeople like you were also told that this was as good as it going to get that you had to work and acknowledge that there was a new normal now\nAnd that America's great days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and ended this this was more like the way it's going to be now so you were also told not only were you on a flat lining economy you're told don't have any lofty expectations\nHere right ... exactly how how\nLet's jump forward to this growing autonomy my next question are you actually there's no wrong answer here it's not a trick are you actually aware of the growing economy because you're living and experiencing it are only are you aware of it because you see economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI I'm In a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate\nEconomy so I'm aware of it the ah information but I can I can feel it I can sense that\nI can I I Know that it's true that is that if I mean it's hard to build your life if you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life\nAnd and I literally feel like the finances in America there's been the ... hold on to this depletion of it I mean I'm old enough to remember\nSitting around the table and my parents and you have to finish your dinner there's children starving in China when I was growing up everyone knew that China was a core poor poor poor place and just a in a span and just the you know Twenty years it's boomed and happy for the for the people have tightened up who is\n... am I happy for the for the people of China absolutely we don't want to see anyone in the world struggling and and and not have what they need to survive but on the other side of it\nIt's because of poor management and our government that has all of this money out of our country and and people here are suffering and you talked about the opioid epidemic I can and and all of these you know these the fruit the fruit of having no work\nWhich used to be just standard knowledge you knew that if there was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have other problems\nExactly right but the point is you're you're you're living economy you're you're not just saying and thinking it's good because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it\nWell I Am experiencing it and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because people want to act like a well he was just given money well lots of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later oh hey real yeah\nOh that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that is a whole other subject watery lottery winners at all what becomes of um [noise]\nYou're absolutely right I just I'm Glad to hear you say you're living you're experiencing it but it's real did you that it's not just the result of me or people like me telling you that things are good that matters\nJust one thing my mom also told me Christine to eat everything on my plate because there were people starving in China\nBut I wasn't smart enough I was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic on every example of parental discipline I could\nSo when my mom said that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing his mom you're telling me that if I eat everything on my plate a bunch of people in China are going to be rubbing their stomachs who say boy it feels good to be full\nAnd she called me a smart alec and told me to stop sassy her but she never told me the China starving story again he\nIs
