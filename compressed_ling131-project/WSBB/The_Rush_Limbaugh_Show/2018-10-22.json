end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that\nPicture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people

gathering here they were she was ruined lead treated and she was protesting and so forth I and I'm not sure I Believe this is legit but let's play the sound bite this is from Wednesday in coral Gables which is where the University of Miami is\nA policy was entering an event to campaign for Donna Shalala ... ... you're done me on my knees Cleveland river her she was the um [noise]\nWhat was she she's in the Clinton Administration and she was best bugs out there with Janet El Nino\nAnd she is running to fill the seat currently held by Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros Layton and philosophy was confronted in heckle by protesters in here is a portion of what it\nSorry man the policy right here we're going to be right here [noise] neither\n\n\nOkay were you able to hear what the protestors [noise] okay [noise] I'm not sure I buy this just like\nNo no no final meal just light bill and Hillary are going to go do or what they're going to do a theater slash stadium tour and are going to charge people and get in to hear them reminisce Hillary and therefore\nSan America today bought by and they're going to charge people to get Trump those encouraging but again and he's going to charge for that could probably make money off this they're clearly picking back piggy backing off what Trump's doing and they want to get in on the action and they want to prove to themselves and the Democrats that they can draw crowds too\nAnd they aren't going to pay all there are not going to be Seventy five thousand people waiting to get into here the Clintons\nUnless they're paid and that couldn't entirely happened I'm telling you there aren't going to be anywhere near that kind of crowds to hear or see the Clintons as there are Trump but they want to get in on it\nBut there's something about this it doesn't jibe with me [noise] Washington Post has a story far right hecklers confront below sea call her a communist that Florida campaign of in\nTheir recall their communist the communist socialism sucked socialism sucks this sounds like what leftist what conjure up a protest if they thought Republicans one show up in protest what Republicans would say\nHow many Republicans have you seen show up at a Democrat and Ben started shouting time you're nice the communist uh social how many times have you seen this\nTell me tell me\nHow many times have you\n[noise] it doesn't happen often I Know\nIt is Miami and you're thinking Little Havana and all that but I'm just telling you like the Democrats want to get in on the they're taking heat\nFor all of this garbage that they're doing they're taking heat on the way they did capital they're taking heat for forcing Cruz and his wife and others out of restaurants nobody's in favor of that that's not getting any support what's not building a movement it may be set of satisfy the already existing lunatics\nThat make up a Democrat base but it's not growing it\nAnd so I think I wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats staged this whole thing\nTo try to get sympathy for polo see much like all these attacks on the turtle and his wife and Ted Cruz and all these other Republicans would have been forced out like just to Nielsen it just reeks of copycat to me\nIt just reek like Bill and Hillary want to get in on the action of Trump's stadium tourists [laughter]\n[noise] the Clintons I was [noise] I I just
