M. S. N. B. C. and this morning\nBill Burton who is the former deputy Obama White house press secretary was talking about me and Kevin all they were monitoring this program that doesn't surprise me a bit\nThat the Obama people are still monitoring this program and I'm just going to tell you I I ... I'm not surprised I'm I I did not predict this but I wondered if somebody was going to notice what I did yesterday here's Craig Melvin host setting up Britain with the question\nLet me ask you really quickly here Mr Bergen about this Washington Post article today the writers come alive within passion defenses\nOf capital in recent days talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has at least a torrent of criticism on the air such as this last week on militant feminism these women are angry Limbaugh says something has happened to them in their lives and their wage an anger they take it out now in the country or on all men or men into powerful majority which is white\nChristian man and so forth again that's a quote from Rush Limbaugh thoughts\nBook I sort of some Rush Limbaugh yesterday and what I noticed about his show is that he actually started with a half an hour about trade before getting into the capital of south and it made me feel like maybe the some of the energy was gone I\nAm so happy somebody noticed that\nNow if you were listening yesterday you know why I did it because I told your why I get I told you why I opened with NAFTA and I'll repeat myself again\nWe started out by pointing out Trump it down to thirty to forty five minute ceremony announcing NAFTA in the rose garden and he had all the people that have helped make it happen there\nAnd I pointed out that this is something that the press is going to their beer and attendance but all they want to ask Trump about his cabinet they're not asking about NAFTA they're going to look past it because to them it isn't any big deal with trade big what they're missing it again this is a seminal Trump campaign issue\n[noise] well Dr Carroll Christine fair set that white Republican senators deserve to die miserable death while feminist laugh as they take their last gasp ...\n[noise]\nShe went on a profanity laced tirade against capital calling him a rapist then to perjure or this is a professor at Georgetown she described the Republican Party as an F ing death cold and filthy swine\nShe tweeted look after this this chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapists irrigated entitlements\nAll of them deserve miserable death swallow feminist lap as they take their last gasp bonus we test rape their corpses and feed them to swine yes\nThat is a professor\nYes\nThat's a professor that is eight ten urine and highly respected professor at Georgetown University all of these in title white men\nJustifying a serial rapist didn't ties with all of them deserve miserable death while feminists laugh as they take their last gasp bonus we cast straight their corpses and feed them just why and\n[noise] they're any embarrassment over Dr Christine's for now but I'm telling you this this is why I have a scribe did the theory that what liberalism and the American left has become is essentially a party of psychological disorders\nInfiltrating our political system and demanding that their psychological disorders be treated as serious policy disagreements and that they\n\nBe given policies they demand we're dealing with people that have psychological disorders have become the base of the Democratic party\nAll of them are victims if somebody else's fault\n\nDr fair settled this in response to Lindsey Graham blasting Democrats for the biggest political sham he has ever seen after this tweet she is still employed at Georgetown\nWhere probably as she was applauded by several others there who share other psychological disorders\nOut Twitter has removed her account after she tweeted that white men should be cast rated in federal buildings\nBut she is still at Georgetown and she probably will be back on Twitter after a limited amount of time at the folks if you are a woman and if you are the mother of\nSons and if in this climate you vote for Democrats\nYou need to really think about that because you are more than likely voting to put your sons and lifelong political parable\nIf you're married to a man in any job or income bracket and you vote for any Democrat you are living on borrowed time your whole life could blow up at any second the Democrat Party the American left can come along at any time and take out your man\nIf they need to if you have brothers\nAnd vote for any Democrat you are sentencing your brothers to blind citing potential ruin nation even your father in the seventies or eighties is not immune to having his life wiped out of existence with one drive by news story\n\nIf you have any treasured men in your life a high school or college friend and mentor a

exactly\nUh what what I noticed her speech pattern those of us whose profession involved with a voice know very well uh\nThe various vocal techniques that professional vocalizing views\nAnd she used to a great effect what is called up talking or up speaking and that means the end every sentence on an up note it promotes the idea that your young and innocent and vulnerable and it's what you say
