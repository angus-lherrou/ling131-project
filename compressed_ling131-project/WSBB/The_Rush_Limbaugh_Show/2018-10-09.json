uh I'm\nElena Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean who way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not sure that this is going to do the court any good\nA Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states started hearing audio soundbites seven he has apologized and be Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett\nAnd the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this covers right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in\nYou follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over everybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping the fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin all their openly promising to continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this is one of the word over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I told you folks this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president what would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles\nI Can't think of one who would do it and it's just as important the Trump do this and it was important when Trump at a rally\nExplained\nTo the American people what the American media has not told them\nWhen he recites the essence of her testimony\nWhen the drive by said that he was mocking laughter malls before he wasn't mocking he was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them\nThat she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where about house was\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his image intimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them so anything that can get rid of him in the rain\nSo anything that can get rid of him and the reigning in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says about his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for months coming up with this\nAnd that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kevin ... is in them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of the history onyx the child like wailing immaturity is the result of the liberal socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one\nKind or another video a video of these kids on Saturday afternoon literally falling at the doors of the Supreme Court they get in\nTo try to stop a real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors there wasn't any humanity and miss this was just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders all of it promoted not denounced all of it promoted\nAnd encouraged by the powers that be and the media and the Democrat\nParty and the ... of the left as I say what a decent people do in response to the different people or we're we're not going to become them\nThey have as an objective a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but we're not going to become who they are we don't have an image to become who they are so given that\nHow are they stopped it's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political\nMurder to stop\nThings they don't want to stop people if they don't want how do you how do you oppose them how to you beat that back\nTo do it with the city to do it with politeness do you do it with ... I'm\nSorry I'm going to cut it sorry never Trump has bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might\nSay Russia the ... the church is rock solid but churches where enduring about\n[noise] uh not anymore the churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money\nChurches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is happening take a look at\nYour papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious\nProblem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency so we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump fearless leap pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nI mean their buddies accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but at the highest levels of government never had before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd\nWith that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were\nUnder historic scrutiny were\nProven innocent thank\nYou [laughter] [noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never Trump or his but that's just pure class to take\nThe time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and actually Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear that every father loves having his children told that he was a great man few ever are\nAfforded that opportunity but Trump did it last night then proclaiming\nKavanaugh's innocence I mean that is akin to taking all the poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it cabin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media tried to\nRuin Kavanaugh to openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that wasn't a corner law he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to die and find so I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... forge privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or is she was also a sewage\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination of Kavanaugh would pull out and they would never get as far as soon as it got very it was\nClearly\nIllustrated she had no evidence no collaboration no nothing in their strategizing of this event they never thought I Would go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination presidents don't want the grief starts to reflect\nPoorly on them they go to the nomination look [noise]\nMore work nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees inside damn it's my one sorry nominee up pulling my support nominee president get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah nominee pulls out didn't happen here Trump refused pullout withdraw ghetto capital that's where they gum up the works\nAnyway I got to take on another brief time out and just getting warmed\nUp here so we hang one when there's the novelty of all time Rush Limbaugh hardly\nNinety
