is and it really served to understand is\nThe American left today despises America is founded and this may be a bit of a simplification but I Do this in order to communicate and be understood\nAnd it's very s and the modern day American Left as taught and educated over the past two generations through middle school high school and college has been taught to hate America because America is unjust from our founding days because it was founded by white men\nAnd white men founded they place for themselves and exploded everybody else and everybody else has been getting the short end of the stick for over two hundred plus years\nAnd only now\nIs the awareness insensitivity to this day and realized only now are the victims of this white privilege of this white power only now are they standing up and demanding to be hurt only now are there are rising up in a righteous indignation and demanding fairness and redress\nAnd the only way that can happen is for the white power structure white privilege\nTo be destroyed and replaced by a coalition of all of those who have been victimized\nSegregated punish\nMistreated abused what have you Byron them reclaiming or not reclaiming but claiming what his just leave there\nAnd that is America and its political systems and that's what young people have been taught and now\nOf of capital a Kevin are being on the court simply because of the shift in the course of this represents\n\nBut is undeniable folks it's factual it's right in front of us they have not been able\nTo succeed\nImplementing the leftist socialist communist agenda via the United States Congress\nThey can do it in their state legislatures I give you some places like California and so forth they haven't been able to do it nationwide\nIt has to be forced\nAnd of course for back to work for the use of force to be working half the cave to it\nYou after it came to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened on every oddball left this cultural demand out there they count on everybody caving they count on everybody suing for peace until Donald Trump came along\nSuing for peace until Donald Trump came along Donald Trump doesn't ... doesn't sue for peace and he doesn't power to them he calls them out\nIt makes perfect sense they would despise Donald Trump it would make perfect sense if they feared Donald Trump it makes perfect sense that they have they have refuses to play ball\n\n[noise] look at what they've attempted to force for I'm I'm a country this whole Russian collusion thing Trump Russia collusion that's a classic illustration of the left attempting to force\nWhat they want people to thing happen on the American people using everything in there are certainly have the media they had the deep state\n\nThey had never Trump or is on the Republican side they had all kinds of allies and a special counsel with an unlimited budget sixteen or Seventeen Trump have lawyers slash\nInvestigators and still nothing because there has been pushed back when there is push back on the left they will fail they can fail\nThey have gotten accustomed to there being no pushback they've gotten accustomed to Republicans being afraid of them end afraid of the media\nAnd it's this push back Trump having the audacity to run the audacity to win then the audacity to actually do what he said he was going to do in order defiance of all these people\nIt's rendering them on balanced and been saying by the way Paul ... who writes columns at the New York post and other places tweeted yesterday afternoon at two oh six PM Washington Post national security correspondent Greg Miller\nSpent the last two years writing a book on Trump and Russia and yet he found no evidence that Trump or any member of his campaign conspired with Russia hacked the elections zip zero zilch nada\nYou won't hear about this and I don't know if this guy bragging are talking about it but a Washington Post correspondent spent the last two years writing the book on Trump Russia collusion and there's a problem he can find a shred of evidence that anybody\nWithin any Trump circle Trump himself\nHad anything to do with Russia at any time for any reason during the campaign non\n\nStop and think of all of the Avon jak lives the left forces on this country the supposedly legitimate news stories each and every day it's nothing about the use of force\nThey use of force flooding zone because they do not have facts on their side they do not have majorities on their side and they know it which is why their reliance on the court says so strong\nMay take a brief comment I just telling you folks that if if if everything were just in a decent hear these people would receive the biggest

they are capable in fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point made here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is is a woman making the point that Kevin wrong\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball the foreign that Kevin ... could have not well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss what is
