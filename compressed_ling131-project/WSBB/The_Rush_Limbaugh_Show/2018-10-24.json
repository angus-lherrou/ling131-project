I'm so just trucking it's equal I wouldn't put it past and they pay somebody off I really do that struck thing and the Democrats um so anyway we have a lot of like ten days let's see what else they put out there next\nWell exactly exactly this is why I was telling people back in June and July to polls here really don't matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now do\nNot so much in accurately without any doubt predicting a winner but the polls today can be highly influential\nAnd decisions and action taken by political people now I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for ah for calling 'em and again for measuring Bob foreign it really is one of the finest guys anybody could ever meet [noise]\nAh I look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am a fairly experienced here at analyzing predicting understanding\nThe left and I know their mind set on many things one of their mindsets on power is but it's there's that that they are entitled to it\nAnd whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happen which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be that people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and the compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them the left is making every every effort if\nKen to distance Trump voters from Trump they've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office divorce Kevin all out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of its work\nFor the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling\nIs something you and I cannot relate to\nWe can try but the degree of frustration they're feeling at having lost that election in two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory\nAnd subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump and I cannot tell you\nHow frustrated they are it is easy for them to take out Republicans when ever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously but they haven't been able to even score on Trump\nSalt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they ... they created out of whole cloth something that does not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and they began reporting the news that way everybody hates Trump but now that they've seen trauma naturally hate him to despising\nThey regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became a noted that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumpet action I've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left taste now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody hated Trump and everybody hated themselves republic for it\nWell it isn't coming to pass\nThe blue way if they said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now we're two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave of Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's and the blue wave in the house it's looking if he if he and now with Republican turnout\nDwarfing\nDemocrat turn out in early voting early voting is where the Democrats get to run their fraud schemes for early voting is rubbing illegals vote in the dead and vote and all these other things it's purposely set up and the

Hussein Obama was not a bomb George Soros was set up a bomb yesterday\nEric Holder has been kind of a bomb and Debbie ... the former German Democratic National committee was also sent debate recipient of a bomb up to the bombs that were sent had her address as the return address made to look like she\nHad sent the the bombs are we here at the E R B network are very concerned and as I stayed at the beginning of our program we condemn\nThe use of bombs in politics\nWe do not condemn the use of bombs in war such as declared hostilities but\nWe declare and clearly condemn the use of bombs\nIn American politics or any other domestic circumstance but clearly America has become a very dangerous place for Democrats what can we do to protect our Democrats\nThat I received a lawsuit but I've been able to have it but just this morning and I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them but I just want to share with some of the things I get some of that is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me\nA into promoting whatever it is that I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you this passionately\n\nThis guy who is it a story and who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone\nJust not as well known as he looks at things he's\nAn absolute red wave and he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing trends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to convert into these transiting with actual prediction\nVerdant of these trends are the actual prediction until now\nHe says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is craze wearing the whole Democratic Party now Amy ... is in a seven point race she was not too long ago in a in a\nIn a landslide victory situation that\nWas so secure and that she wasn't even going to have to spend any money now her lead is down to seven how sleep is only down three the governor's race to point an elder sudden Keith Ellison who is crater ring looks like he's going to lose by more than seven\nPoints\nAnd this guy says he's getting reports him on the ground in Minneapolis and throughout the state that Randy areas are turning out in droves once again Republican early voting is through the roof and nobody predicted this\nThe Democrats owned the early voting and the Republicans so far\nOn it and\nAll over the country it looks like and this was a stunner this is something people have not seen and nobody predicted\nThis\nIn Nevada Dean Heller now on track to win by thirty five thousand votes California thirty nine California forty eight California forty nine absentees\nAll three seats would be safe Antonio ... is up or two points in his district of California's even got places pockets\nWhere Republicans are looking good Arizona Republicans up over Democrats twelve point four percent\nUh that's\nUp three point nine percent over two thousand sixteen the or Arizona won a Democrat seat is now close all of these thought to be Democrats locks just a month ago are now toss ups\nAnd this guy says to me I think we're in a position here to actually gain a couple of house seats maybe seven to nine seven seats at this rate if these kinds of trends and it's all based on polling data continues\nNow you might be as Russia is this guy round here in this anywhere I Know you're not hearing it anywhere that's the point\nIt doesn't matter what is the fact that I'm are laying it to you is all you need to know that that that I'm taking it somewhat seriously ... at least to the point that it's interesting I'm not endorsing any of this bugs\nI don't I'm not familiar enough what to say to myself I just have instincts and I like process information like everybody else and I'm just telling you I I don't know how things are going to end up but I Do know that none of this is\nThe way the Democrats in the media thought this was going to play out there isn't any blow wave and even they are beginning to pull back from that now even they are beginning to admit that there isn't one and it could be big trouble\nUm NBC Wall Street Journal poll Politico these kinds of places are pulling back from it I don't think there ever was going to be a blue wave this is my point I think we've been lied to we've had a\nMedia soap opera narrative that has been part of the effort to defeat Trump at Republicans for the last year starting with a generic ballots last December so uh it it but regardless however the Democrats are telling the story themselves however they're lying or whatever if\nIsn't it isn't unfolding as they expected they expected\nTo be able to make a blue wave happen just by predicting that just by

another story this from Bloomberg News holes and could be missing a Republican surge\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the mid germs but this cycle present some unusual risk\nFor pollsters not the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys a shoring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to beat curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans\nNow polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys could miss late change the story written before the bombs could it happen again it\nProbably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's a but it did it could go either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go in the ... what is this an decision all\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us but the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember\nThey believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which just so obviously a set up\nIf they use this caravan which is so obviously set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then ...\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here\nYou Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump's just to opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and pay for this if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... smokes\nA lot of people in our size have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates let those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong border security that's doesn't help us a modest seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us what happened now do you say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickled kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is\nPanning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but I I don't think they're going to [noise]\nI I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary group think narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there was nothing happening in America right now that argue is electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in math there is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people resist the vote for the all they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump is Trump's what he's aboard he tweets is a bad guy his whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one\nI Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society\nStandard and good old normalcy is under assault everyday led by pop culture leftists in Hollywood in Silicon valley and the drive by media were under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not\nGotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal\nThere's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans I'm I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the church or not\nIn less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip the scenario what\nSense does it make for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going to go off and they're going to be discovered\nDoesn't make any sense\nAny way shape or form a yup break time back with more after this\nDisease\nThis stuff and then just three

Bush do you think he knows that some of the great nationalist of all time included ... I don't know what happened in a cold bottles but whenever Sarah Palin came on to see in the cold while I was kinda [noise] couldn't handle the Republicans anymore it's a shame too she's so she was so good she was so bright\nI've just [noise] something is happening to people in that town when Trump shows up and it's just it's causing them to make fools of themselves here's what Trump said yesterday in the oval office Trump speaking with reporters during the Q and a a\nA ... a ... with no no [noise] uh [noise]\nThey've got mad at myself or does it as as as the days I think I've gotten myself out of\nA [noise] here it is it's number ten here's Trump in washing the oval office a White House correspondent Jim Costa CNN so this is before the bomb said to follow up on your comments about being a national is there's a concern that you're sending coded language or dog whistles\nWell did language or dog whistles\nJust some Americans out there who are not sees and your signaling that you're one of them like a white nationalist what do you say to that\nTrauma has a theory about was I heard them all without somebody that lives on route for our country and I am a nationalist is worth it hasn't been used too much\nBut I Would rather be brought back by somebody that wants to help other countries of the world [noise]\nAnd I also have to say that they have are all out on our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of us so they have not read it for our country [noise] so in that sense I absolutely and that was set up\nYou know this is this is so easy this is so not\nA controversy this is such a microcosm is is is is such a teachable moment this is exactly why the American the left and the media have no idea who Donald Trump is\nAnd they can't even relate to it here's a guy who does nothing but love America and that is something they can't relate to\nLoving America to them is old fashioned it's a bygone era in this era of globalism loving your company is fine but but it seems so old fashioned and it's it's it's just pass say\nIt so it's so foreign to these people they just there really isn't even a common ground with them on that\nDonald Trump\nLet me start with the way my brother David tweeted on this yesterday and it's probably a good way to say it he said Trump believes in a strong exceptional America he's not a political scientist\nHe doesn't speak in code he doesn't offer dog whistles you don't even know what the ... years when he says I'm a nationalist he's not winking\nAt neo Nazis he's not winking at white supremacist and say we're patriots and UPC people like he's just a guy who loves America he's a nationalist versus a global list\nHe's going to make America great again he believes American deserves to be great he believes America weeds in the world when it's great\nBut these people are but they're supposedly the intellectuals\nThere the broad minded people there are so small minded and tiny minded that they can't get past\nTheir hatred rooted in partisanship and all they had his knee jerk reaction so Trump says it's a nationalist they immediately hear a dog whistle yeah Trump's talking to the people in Charlottesville that's what they're thinking that Trump is winking at the people in Charlottesville and not to say you go guys you go that's what they honestly think and if they don't honestly think that\nThey're doing a double disservice because they're trying to make people that followed them believe they do think that if they do think that they're the ones I have an electoral problems if they do think if they cannot understand the simplicity\nOf I Love America I Want America to be the best it can be America the best it can be makes the world the best it can but they don't understand that if that doesn't compute with them then they have\nNo business being positions of power in this country because they're not going to accurately\nRepresent us or this nation's interest 'cause this is not complicated it is such a cheap lazy reaction to say\nSee the Trump Hitler nationalist dog whistle\nThere's no basis in fact for it there's still\nEngaged in trying to convince Trump or are they convince people to hate Trump the way they do\nI'm just going to tell people\nYou you're ... if you don't learn to understand this you're going to ever be ... at the guys and ankles\nLoves America\nThinks America is great and can be greater and a great America is great for everybody in it and a great America is made great by great citizens\nAnd if there's nothing wrong with loving America there's nothing wrong with thinking America is exceptional and exceptional America solve the problems of the world and exceptional America it creates an economy that is capable\nOf providing prosperity for hundreds of millions of people there isn't another form of government that can even come close socialism can't communism can't by definition at camp\nSocialism communism produced wealth for the leaders by stealing it from the people who created\nAnd that's your Obama's and your Hillary's and pick any Democrat running for president in twenty twenty and a bunch of I'm running for reelection this time around what do you people not understand how absolutely ... seat lazy if he is\nTo say that the guy is simply trying to describe how he loves the country is a freaking
