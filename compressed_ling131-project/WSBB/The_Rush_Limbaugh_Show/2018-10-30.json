you're right but let me let me give you some facts on the ground\nForty oh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship isn't just a second here but I Want to set it up with this 'cause man this is great what Trump is doing on birth for all this is exactly why Trump was elected as my good friend McCarthy said you got to have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the left is beside itself the day the NBC is headlined Trump\nIf they emerge victorious\nAll of these

than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented Republicans seldom show up this while in ...\nSenate Republicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away\n\nBut the conclusion is it there has been no blue way if there is not even been a blue ripple\nThat you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip some blow bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal cities\n[noise] [noise] so this guy is off the firm\nBelief that a conservative red wave or Republican red wave is coming and is on the way [noise]\n[noise] many other people are ... I've I've\nHeard some people that were rush look at it got to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirements that's that's [noise] such a toss up I don't\nKnow how to factor all of that

the\nEvidence of panic\nThat is prevalent throughout the drive by maybe because their efforts to derail Trump have failed every one of them including the big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly ... loaded with the Russians Robert Mueller was supposed to have delivered to go to\nThe special counsel buying now was supposed to have core Trump Trump was supposed to be on the way

total losses there were a lot of never Trump or is it in there and that's one of the reasons they retired I Would be remiss if I didn't mention is there were a lot of them I don't know about the total number forty five but a lot of them quip\nBecause they were just fed up that\nTrump won and that Trump was leading the Republican Party and they don't want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided they wouldn't go back just being a regular house bozos because it's such a calm down you know to have been a committee germ and then go back to being just a regular venture or back venture\nIn their ways and this this orders well in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary nomination was replaced knees never Trump hers were retiring are Trump supporters\nThere Trump\nAnd so the the total number forty five resigning is not in another itself a completely negative\nCharacteristic the power of incumbency still can't be denied it's an amazing thing I think it's still true house races in Ninety eight percent of them the incumbent wins\nEvery year year in year out regardless there might be a year or two where there's a larger wider variants than that but that's the overall staff\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's\nEven worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country overthrown from the days of its founding\nOf to the left America is it legitimate to a gym morals it's in decent because we were a slave nation\nAnd we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers there were no founding mothers only founding fathers and a a bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up a company for themselves and their descendents so goes the argument leaving everybody else out\nAnd it's time to overthrow them and change it and it's a serious movement and it's it's I Hope you can trace the educational roots for this back to the Nineteen\nEducational roots for this back to the Nineteen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise] an offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where the changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story\nDonald Trump and let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution an end to birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump offered a dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed a ... a unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a weeks ago before the political mid term elections\nTrump's vow\nTo enter the rights of citizenship for children of non citizens authorized immigrants born in America came in an interview with ... released yesterday Trump did not say when he would sign the order\nAnd some of his past promises use executive action of gone unfulfilled but whether he bottles growing his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions intended to thrust the matter\nOf immigration into the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks\nAs I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like it was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet pushing\nBack against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent\nAnd dangerous after all these are people who do not accept election results anymore\nAnd you know what that means you go into this country together all these years is the honoring intellectual results yeah have a heated campaign you're may have political parties and among us really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago\nHe he didn't go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock George W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by is on the left what convinced that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away with people were fed up with the Florida\nRecount remember all that Al Gore got jobs but Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened the Republicans won and added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify\nSome of what we believe or auto values basis because exit poll showed that values were a large factor in\nWhy people voted Republican well fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge with the Trump won they do not accept\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they\nDidn't want it\nWe've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election and its results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama the O. J. we're used to overthrow run a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those election results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight featured even more violent unrest that we haven't yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find a period where it was worse than it is at present you can always go back inside the civil war but it is a seminal moment when a political party\nAs its official position refuses to accept election results\nAnd that's where we are and that's why we're where we are\nThey refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump I don't feel good about it they just rip whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing\nBecause what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections you know I I predicted some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point\nAnd the natural conclusion to figuring this out as well let's just eliminate elections elections or what's holding us back let's find a way to eliminate him\nPeople laugh come on why it's never gonna have to do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever\nSo now Trump rather than being intimidated by\nTrump rather than\nBeing intimidated by their refusal to accept this election or rather these feelings hurt\nTrump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back with\nAdditional energy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order and birthright citizenship is huge\nAnd it's why he was elected when\nThings are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong and out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries in Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing the left is the way it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nIt requires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they had made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't he doubles down All right I'm just I'm a physician executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the or the fourteenth amendment ... begins\nAll persons not the fourteenth amendment goes back to Eighteen ... I think it was ratified by Congress in age and sixty six\nNot it was passed by Congress ratified by the state's two years later so agents sixty six it was passed by Congress in ratify the state's Eighteen in sixty eight and its original intent was to grant citizenship just slaves and their descendants and it\nWas part and parcel of post civil war era of America fixing itself\nIt was a good thing or our constitution was written so that mistakes at the founding could be corrected the vast majority of people do slavery of the founding was was understandable but they needed the union in order to fight\nThe revolutionary war they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they had to accept slavery but they built in safeguards to wipe it out of habit an agent sixty eight the fourteenth amendment begins this white all persons born or naturalized in the United states and\nSubject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the U.S end of the state where in\nThey reside it was clearly intended to be referring to slaves and their descendants the parts that birthright citizenship a freaks half to delete\nArt naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that rub\nYou are not naturalized and you are not subject to the U.S jurisdiction if you're here illegally\nYou cannot be you're under some other countries jurisdiction if you're here illegal you cannot possibly be naturalized\nWell the birthright citizenship crowd which ones don't watered down American culture and destroy western civilization conveniently leaves out naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that Rob\n\nSo your born here or child absolutely is not a citizen and this is what Trump is saying Trump is finally pushing back against an assumption\nThat has been made because it was the least half of resistance if you will but now it's it's make or break time\n\nAs my friend McCarthy says you need somebody to break the furniture [noise] sometimes you got to remodel\nHouse I got a quick time out a little long haired next segments going to be strong backing of Amish Limbaugh going the way I'm lucky I met for\nMe it was Ninety five five and a um seven fifty [noise] don't you ask me [noise]\nHow to make money flipping houses in your spare time using other people's money Atlanta in Athens are perfect markets for my system and this week I'm holding a free to our educational workshop where you'll learn how to make money flipping homes and how to build long term wealth with income property\nTo get to free tickets to fans workshop texture five digits a code to eighty two thousand seating is extremely limited so texture five digits a code to eighty two thousand right now because this free ticket offer expires this Friday just texture ZIP Code to eighty two thousand\nAnd when you ask me about 'em doraville er Cox media group station\n[noise] twenty four hour news weather man from\nFive AM seven fifty\n\nKnow it's one o'clock in the afternoon on to bring a cute that live in the delta USC twenty four hour a new set of falling into the Olympics story is one ... county ... on the scene\nOn or off the road southwest between windy hill road and county services road you can see the neighborhood right here this is the area that we're talking about talking about a police say a person is barracks\nAbout a police say a person is barricaded in there I suspect as barricaded in there and\nWe now understand that all still road is shut down a lot of them are real and the devil you must be twenty four hour traffic and ask direct debris not all still road is shut down between windy hill wrote in county services parkway the void that all together don't even try to go on to off still road\nAgain it's close between windy hill in county services parkway you can get powder springs are either sell ... bright and try to help you around us I'm Veronica ...

this is how we ended up having a chance to win\nBy shining the light on the left in who they are and what they do by forcing them out of the shadows and making them do it\n\nSanctuary cities is a good

to having been told what liberalism is and who liberals are there now see\nI get and once that happens it's it's harder for the left to win\nI mean if they could win by being honest if they could win

looking\nAnd then if that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make up the entire narrative and what they believe rush it that that person is an idiot they're not even\nNow I'm not saying all that every I'm liberal person is like this I think that they're these kinds of people exist on both
