I think why we're here this is we're here to\nUh walk path of righteousness I'm not even saying that from a religious point of view it's about your behavior and and more than that if what you care about is the end is\nA by any means what you're saying is I won't observed normal morality and that ultimately means innocent people can get hurt\nIt's worth it but then you have to say why is it worth it are you trying to achieve justice in the end for what a greater number of people or is it really a power structure that you're after or personal power once you say by any means necessary\nYour uh\nIn my mind you're taking away the possibility that ... that your behavior can be trusted that you can that you have principles I allergy that's consistent with morality which is about the path in my opinion that's the way I think about the idea of the ends justify the means\nThat's ... talks about it what is he said\nDo you justify the means and you only have morals and ethics when you are in control basically\nAnd here's the thing about the ... thing that I thought was very interesting that you brought up before never take yes for an answer basically yeah right yeah so how did that um that was also a factor in this story\nSo there was action to try and change the flag but solid ski talks about never fall into the trap of having your opposition give you what you want because then that stops the activism cold right and what\nThey were doing was what the what the legislation that was on a path to getting past was this restoring the Nineteen oh to flat correct yeah it's a very manageable thing and eliminate all the racist stuff everybody can get on board with that it doesn't uh capitulate or whatever was acceptable before there's no reason not to have it again eliminates the problem\nAnd brings everybody together right and that's not what they want because without the crisis which is what Saul whiskey says you must have in order to mobilize masses of people and build your social army you must have crisis and you must have conflict\nAnd one of those people one of her two partners in crime at that time said no right\nYeah he said they they oppose the legislation outright and they called the black a politician I Would run with it quotes don't ... they called and I don't I I I Will say it but but they called them um some very kind of\nRacist names yeah like on us away they the Kanye West is treated right [noise]\nUltimately the flag ... Miller he gave up on the fight to remove the flag to remove the battle battle emblem he said today um he's giving up his fight to remove the Confederate that battle and boom from Georgia flag because the effort was awakening extremist feelings are detracting from other legislative goals I strongly believe\nIsn't detracting from other legislative goals I strongly believe that changing the flag is the right thing to do however extremist on both sides have complicated issue beyond any solution\nSo and ten years later they did get a flag change and the new flag I thought it was\nAs a noxious the flag and actually it looks like\nIt's still had that on on the flight was a\nComplete failure right unlike the nice you know what you like and then and then that did ultimately give way to a neutral flag the flight we have now\nYeah so it brings was touting that as an accomplishment is a virtuous thing yet her group actually cause the governor to stop pursuing that while it gave Stacey Abrams many of the opportunities that has led led her to where she is today\nWell that I also found interesting is that her or she right after that and the Rodney King thing got a an internship or or if job in the mayor's office at the age of Nineteen that she has to this day as an important first step\nOn her kind of spreadsheet patch should we play that clip of of her talking about that job I think that's worth it click bait\nCreating conditions where people are either one of the reason my dream team led me to\nAge Nineteen to running major program for the city of Atlanta [noise]\nHaving the ability through college gate to have the power of the city behind when someone is it needs to come to this meeting and they hear my younger\n[laughter] they would they showed up because I was able to say oh I\nSee when but at that time when she was actually Nineteen was it didn't she have a quote that said something to the effect of they don't want to risk any more uh on rats yeah something like\n... there's a group that she founded along with a couple of other guys and they had two hundred students that basically would follow whatever the whatever they did and Abrams was quoted in an article in the AJC in Nineteen Ninety two\nAs saying that they're talking about a committed student committee that the mayor's trying to uh put into play and ... says she knows that they're going to get that can be done because they don't want to risk having another may first incident happened\nRight which I I mean that that is that what it's all bad huh\nBanning of violence happened it was may first uh\nBut that's what it's all about so it's not about getting a flag change they actually rejected the proposal of getting the flag change and set the effort back because it was it's better to have the divisiveness it's better not for the people\nNot for the people but for the people at the top the people at the top of these movements and then they get absorbed they just want to place I think\nThey want to play at the table a seat at the table that's part of their life plan yeah it's what fulfills them but but by any means necessary means that people get\nHurt along the way that it's not about a principal in ideology is not about equality and justice so I think there there is something true but I I Want to add something\nAnd it kind of a from our perspective I Hope you are grievances including if not you can add to your perspective as we wrap it up or right after the break this is Monica ...

than one NFL team and and different major leagues as well but um yeah we we treat people all over the country really\nDoes the needle have to go Zach leave where the pain is already just injected somewhere in the body and the stem cells nowhere to go\nI yes to both answers like um if someone hasn't an acute injury like say one of the athletes has an elbow or shoulder injury or any injury then will inject right in that area but if somebody has got pain all over their body if their knees are both knees are hurting and they're back in their elbow\nThan we might just do an IV injection or or an interim muscular injections so really depends on what kind of problems people have and when people come in for consultation wearable sit down and figure out what's best for them\nBecause you know you hear people who have arthritis and they're getting these very painful cortisone shots and and the actual joint on and the muscle and that sounds very painful\n... um those can be in the problem with especially with steroid shots of steroids actually break down to shoot court because there was there with you know I we used to give them all the time to everybody but then people still get them all the time but the problem is is there actually bad for our bodies that actually break down the tissue that we inject them into so\nUm you know and actually causes things like osteoporosis actually causes fractures makes your ligaments and your attendance all those all those tissues week so that's it's may relieve pain for a short period of time a matter of days or weeks or maybe a month or two\nBut actually during that time it breaks that tissue down and makes a week or\nSo how long will an injection of stem cells laugh well\nUm for say a joint to somebody comes in with a bad knee that's got arthritis in it or they have like the cartilage chair or injury something like that um when we do a treatment it's a one time injection and it can last for ten twenty Thirty years\nYou're kidding me now have suffered with hip pain for years\nMay not have suffered with hip pain for years that wakes me up every night and you're saying with [laughter] one injection that that could be over\nYeah yeah for sure definitely\nAnd I have been told is ... ... and so\nIt was a with the stem cells will help heal burst site is tend to notice any kind of information that's in it in an area of the body that the stem cells um er at they can definitely feel it\nAnd anyone who's listening knows that when you have a part of your body that chronically hurts it just is it's debilitating mentally and physically it just wears you down\nYeah definitely yeah it I see people that have been pinned suffering and pain for years like they'll be in pain management they'll see a pain doctor\nThey're getting pain pills prescribed every week or month they get at the journal shot steroid shots all these different things to try to help their pain but none of it's they're all band aids solutions and nothing last but the stem cells actually heal the tissue that actually were we were generates the tissue ... some believable\nBecause it's going to the root of the problem yeah yeah it'd be it's going right to the root of prominence actually fixing the problem whereas all these other treatments the pain pills they just masks the problem the steroid shots all this other stuff it it just masks the problem it doesn't treat what's wrong he doesn't treat the cause of the pain\nOkay well I'm I'm just lost throw some uh maladies at you and tell me a stem cells can help and are not fibromyalgia definitely yeah because that's inflammation\nAny yep exactly information is a big thing that some cells held okay fatigue\nIt can help the cheek as well yeah it um usually fatigues tied in with other health issues and problems but it can help that as well along with\nYou know the information is the key there okay sleep deprived and sleep problems um if they can is more that's more of his that sleep problems are coming from pain or issues like that they can help with that\nOkay um you hear a lot of people especially diabetics you have problems with their feet um can this help there\nThere yeah but it problem neuropathy is the term that we use for people that have you know numbness tingling any kind of burning sensations in their feet from diabetes um and we definitely stem cells have been shown all across the world there's meant a lot of several really good research studies showing that neuropathy is\nThe one of the few conditions it's themselves can treat that nothing else well why\nIs there not a clinic on every corner next to a Starbucks\n[laughter] good question um\nUnfortunately our medical system is geared towards pharmaceutical companies you know they're worth billions of dollars and if you go to your regular doctor and you sit in the lobby long enough you'll see these people coming in when dresses or nice suits and I'll bring coffee and doughnuts to the doctors and that's the pharmaceutical reps their job is to sell drugs to the doctors I've\nDealt with them for years and years and years and unfortunately a lot of these drugs have more side effects than they do have ... you know and it's it's we're the only country in the whole world that allows pharmaceutical companies to advertise on TV\nAnd I'm Still watch one of these commercials and the first five seconds that sounds great it's the best thing in the world yet or if so and so [laughter] her you\nAfter that you hear about thirty seconds worth of side effects and the problem right side effects a hospital death yes very ... excuse me a very scary but the great thing about themselves as is no serious side effects no serious complications\nNo one's ever had to go to the hospital because of the stem cell treatment um it's amazing\nOkay what about people who you are have large joint people who have looking at maybe a hip replacement or I Need a replacement where the body is just worn out yeah where you have bone on bone and and you know your face in surgery\nI see that every day in my office and the amazing thing is that the stem cells can actually regenerate that whole joy they can take it a bones they're rubbing one on top of each other where people are having severe pain and within three to nine months they can transform that trying to look like it's an e joy\nWhile the novel surgery without surgery with just one injection one injection yeah yeah it's incredible now we see that all the time\nI'm going to ask you the million dollar question is it covered by insurance\nNot at all not at all it is low insurance and the entire world that covers themselves right now unfortunately and again it's a lot of politics behind this is like I mentioned the ride industry is tight so heavily to our our conventional medical industry it's is terrible and found a lot of even really get physicians there\nThey make their income doing surgery so they the more surgeries they do the Mormon come they make if we cut that down by a third or half that's they're not going to make money so it's\nYou know if there's a lot of education and used to go on a lot of people need to learn about themselves what they can do what types of stem cells there are but right now the treatment is available it's amazing and it works\nCan't believe that such a remarkable amazing treatment is\nRemarkable amazing treatment is such a hidden gym that we're not being told about the cause of a lobbyist and and pharmaceutical companies and those who are profiting from pills\nYeah yeah it's it's sad but um I compare it to the car industry like back in the Nineteen nineties when Janet ... developed an electric car called the easy one\nMatch drove one K. you know all about I Know all about the\nSaturday they had thousands of these and California yeah but they leave them to everybody\nAnd what happened is GM made a deal with the big oil companies to get rid of the cars 'cause they didn't want electric cars\nThey took them all back and they actually destroyed them great cars but they were fantastic cars there was such a loyal industry in one a electric cars they want it to us to go to the pump every week and spend money at the gas pump so [noise] um money makes us world go round unfortunately and big money especially but\nUm this is a miraculous amazing treatment that actually works and helps people feel better get better so I'm just very fortunate and blessed to be able to help people and this is the best way I've ever been able to help people as a doctor\nWell I'd say I'd
