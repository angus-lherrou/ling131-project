pictures of the bombers a\nVan down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the\nThings that I had intended to share with you today as a Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday and we have an audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that Chuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind the scare Chuck Todd said that he fears\nThe Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare of that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party as well as CNN and Robert De Niro\nQuote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now and that is so all of this confusion Chuck\nTodd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the mail bomb scare is dividing the\nCountry and that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press daily now I ... the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is not\nWorry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press\nHave Chuck Todd who believes despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under the belief the Russians stole the two thousand sixty intellectually\nIs do you think that as we sit here today the deep state they lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than a day to day thing not going to win the

much was going on we can't we get our democracy camps\nToo much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy out prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left when in fact they orchestrated if you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that they corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\n[noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being on a lot of trouble\nTheoretically actual events eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why isn't that happening now the Republicans round the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan I says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing at once these elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him if they really\nScientists let's discuss it you'd think Trump is essentially on the ballot\nIn in this election there's no wrong answer who don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you think that Trump is essentially on the ballot that this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in Toto are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this is going to be their big moment when they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this was the beginning of the ...\nAnd I will do something with it I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blockers meant keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and\nIt's all written by a bunch of young millennial journalist and they have ever since election day two thousand sixteen they haven't been in various stages of\nPanic and I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll\nShowing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen it was not nearly as big\nAnd this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about writing about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty in was an odd confluence of events\nThat that gave us a one off result that it's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says but if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth\nAnd it was it was um it was ... I wouldn't say there was panic and reading the written word but it's slowly dawning on some of the last two years they have live with the belief\nThat what happened in two thousand six team was unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidate with\nHillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people have been waiting every day for these two years to fix is mistaken the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correct is missing now they're starting to begin to quite may be this is not an oddity maybe maybe we're not the majority\nAnd it kinda dumped tales of what you're saying here do you believe for example that\nA Trump voters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum devote because of his mom's now\nGo rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally or whatnot at Trump's rally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river\nAnd I think the uh mid America center seats for this event it was sitting like twelve thousand\nI'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line\nThere were more women than there were men are going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAnd my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters when I got down there like me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that and it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do and so many of these\nTo get in their faces an act like they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and phone how how could you hold it against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote that they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing their sleeves like these crazy radical leftist they're all doing\nWell it is it is a ... it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that\nPeople voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that this week a bomb scare stories can dampen it ... I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more maybe I think more than the average Trump voter I I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people let's continue you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a usual lessening of enthusiasm Oregon gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is it that was it's as important now is it wasn't two thousand sixteen\nAnd in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and the policies have been enacted the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I think the ... the rally in his ...\nHe was talking about how he he produced he's got he's got a track record now\nIs it two years ago on a campaign I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again we're going to stop there's going to make a trade deals better but back\nThen it was just words that would just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think Trump supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um uh attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to his spirit them a or to somehow we get ... and so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called thanks
