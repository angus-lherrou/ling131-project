are\nGoing to ... ... because I'm seeing a lot of Democrats now who are basically upset that he pushed it so far that the he may have actually ruin the case they were trying to make by going so far to the edge that it actually was even quoted by ...\nTo make by going so far to the edge and it actually was even quoted by Susan Collins as her reason for deciding to say yes on the confirmation\nI think that by the time the third accusation was re it started to look more like a potential political conspiracy I'm elapsed like\nBrett Kavanaugh perhaps had a problem too many people and I think that um this rabbit Nettie both trying to build his name identification and fundraising base though he could sell financial respectable\nPresidential campaign for a challenge to Donald Trump and twenty twenty and I think his motivations are showing through laws and the credibility of the woman that he was representing\nSo let's talk about Susan Collins referencing him and then her statement a pretty lengthy and well prepared something that you certainly didn't throw together that day what do you think about the way Susan Collins approached her comments and does that help some people that might be sort of fence writers ... go one way or the other\nCall on this is a moderate and the United states and which is to become a rarity among Republican she's pro choice she was very concerned about roe versus Wade president not being overturned and\nState it several times during her forty five minutes a statement from the well the Senate that she questioned judge Kavanaugh the three different meeting with they had on President and on particularly his views of roe versus Wade which of course\nA scout and all that more than one he believes in using subtle walk 'em I'll point out a prior precedent that I think it's a compelling to bring up in this situation Justice David Souter was confirmed Nineteen Ninety two he was appointed by George Herbert Walker Bush\nJohn Sununu is chief of staff recommended a\nBigger than he was a known conservative with the conservative on the bench activist across the nation gathered against him there were buttons that women wore in the gallery and all over Capitol Hill saying if she was appointed women will die\nJustice Souter was appointed in Nineteen Ninety two and later that same year authored the decision Casey versus Planned Parenthood\nThat basically upheld roe versus Wade with Justice Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor co offering in a five four decision little two thousandth hit with Justice David Souter who joined the minority\nVoting to keep the recount going on in Florida which potentially could have\nBarred George W. Bush from becoming president siding with the other side and of course the prevailing was five four to end the recount and and call George Bush to become president or you don't know\nWhat a Supreme Court judge is actually going to do trivial there on the back and trying to presume that in many cases not just that one people have guessed the wrong way\nThat is true bill I hate I I'm up against the next to a break here but I appreciate you taking time out on the Sunday once again to lend your analysis and your political wisdom to what's been a pretty rock is the last couple of weeks\nAnd will stay that way but I Hope that people will take a breath now and calm down and stop fighting amongst their families on this and let let's see what I have a lot of that\nTotally agree Bill thanks so much for calling into the Allen Sanders show we're up against the break but when we come back definitely got those phone lines open for zero for eight seven six zero sum of fifty one eight hundred WSBIU talk\nHey it's not lending since I started talking about my main thing experience have Mariette a plastic surgery some people have asked me while I'm willing to make the trip outside the perimeter of the um\nWell the answer is easy they're the best Dr ...

other\nYou know I've mentioned is many many many many times before I've got four daughters no sons but I'm the oldest of four boys I've got four girls four daughters I've got a wife got to have one of those [laughter] it helps\nWe've had this conversation amongst ourselves\nThe fact that there's not enough evidence or anything credible whatsoever to ... to lay blame and judge Kavanaugh does not necessarily mean that I'm all for women staying quiet and just deal with it\nI don't know where people conflate these two ideas that these have to be two mutually exclusive\nYou either support judge Kavanaugh in which case all women should shut up and deal with it or all women are telling the truth and therefore judge Kavanaugh needs to go away that's not a black and white world that we live in that that makes no sense whatsoever\nThe fact that Christine Blasey Ford may have had something traumatic happened to her doesn't mean that I don't believe that she had something happened to her\nMy doubts are the ability for her to confirm to me and to the rest of the world will listen to the rest of robot to the rest of the folks that are really looking at this logically from a legal standpoint she lacked the ability to bring forth enough evidence for Susan Collins a moderate herself\nThere was not enough to even get beyond what is typically taught in the first year of law school of what would be a standard\nTo have the ... of a case nothing so when you have somebody who's credible it doesn't mean I don't believe something happened to her\nI just don't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh and the only reason why I don't believe it is because I haven't heard anything\nThat leads me to believe that in fact the way this was all handled\nImmediately makes me believe it was a political stunt and not an actual occurrence and not an actual case that's to be believed and they said from the very beginning that it I felt bad for Dr Ford because she was being used\nTo stop a Supreme Court nominee from getting on the bench she wasn't being listened to she wasn't being addressed she wasn't being handled confidentially her privacy her tears her emotional state was not anywhere\nTo be taken into consideration by Senator Dianne Feinstein by the way she conducted herself and the fact that she is still looking in the cameras thing I had no idea how her letter got leaked to the press\nAre you suggesting that the her letter was sent to more than one person are you suggesting that the initial Congress person that she addressed in California who then helped her how Dr Ford get in touch with you are you suggesting that maybe there's multiple letters that she emailed to lots of other people\nShe said she only send it to you and did it under condition of anonymity and yet you can't figure out how it got up to it wasn't me\nOh it wasn't me no Dianne Feinstein you want it to change hundreds and hundreds of years of precedent you want it to change due process you want it to get rid of the presumption of innocence so therefore Dianne Feinstein I think you're guilty until you can prove otherwise you don't like that standard when it's pointed on you do you\nGo to the phones

super excited people on the right are super excited that this trial I mean really celebrating and I\nI I smell or of course because I don't think this guy is a particularly worth celebrating I feel like we were set up a we're all in society left and right to be emotionally involved in this battle that had no that wasn't really\nEmotionally involved in this battle that had no that wasn't really based on content but on just pure partisanship ... you know like a sports event and\nFor me I well the lately people talk about conservative justices and I think historically we thought of those people as\nConstitutional is conservatives to us are conservative means to look back to not change to be cautious\nSo for us that means a um to always have the touchstone of our founding documents and our founding principles in Europe it's different in England to be conservative is like the monarchy is to go back and use that foundation of touched on\nBut for us the conservative is is you don't want to change what we're actually getting is neoconservatives which if you read just if you can find it on my block might the probably the best thing I ever wrote\nWas an analysis of urban Crystal's book neo conservatives on the autobiography of an idea\nWhere he tells Republicans to give up on the idea of small government to stop ... to the um\nThe population and be more aggressive and foreign policy that the people want to be led especially in issues of economics and foreign policy so when I look at somebody who's considered a conservative\nAt like Brett Kavanaugh I Want to know is he a constitutional list or is he a neo cons so if you just and this is what I Wish the Senate and the mainstream media had brought up what is this guy made up\nAnd there are some cases that I think they're serious scrutiny one was a man I'll just the best summaries I've found of the of the really have to totally did again but the ... one liners on some of his\nDecisions one less Kavanaugh wrote that the men of data collection a you know the big warrantless wiretaps whenever I'm and everything that that implied I guess stimulated these cases he wrote a the ... the data collection at issue was not a search\nAnd even if it were no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks so that's the Fourth Amendment being completely negate it right and I just can't I Can't cope with that\nAnd that wasn't talked about at all because all everybody talked about was the sex stuff\nAnd the alcohol right and and uh\nSo people will say well who do you want and ah I Want to judge you know you know the liberty and he's the constitution was ... whether it makes them comfortable or uncomfortable\nIf they wanted to stop cabin all that was the route to take but the problem is that would not have mobilized these masses of people that would have strengthened these activist organizations are number one goal was to strengthen these activists organizations using sensitive issue\nRight and you know what it worked in the rights favor to the ... the people on the right got him\nForeign aid even though it to me he is the truth each state given his foster background or even ... given his position on a on the gate and constitution of the name of terrorism\nBut that's you know so that lets appeal the onion a little bit more after the break

last is that thin line I'm protecting us from that and and he was deprived of that\nAh you had a great Brinkley you had a great tweet that is a perfect leading for my um\nFor my ... my smoking gun on the first amendment issue underlying the bill Cosby case let's hear All right dean\nSays that yes the\nGovernment did him dirty talking about Bill Cosby they broke the law to get punishment for the sake of the movement not to mention the bogus rationalization used to unsealed a court documents for the a P\nOkay so what he's talking about what teams talking about is the Associated Press uh\nWho knows who prompted them to reopen this case after so many years a\nWanted the deposition so I said earlier that the prosecutor in two thousand five put out a press release we're stealing the records we made an agreement with ... that we would never prosecute this case\nAnd either in that press release or just privately or whatever it was known caster the d._a. at the time said I Am doing this so that\nThis woman can get um a deposition out of Bill Cosby in a civil case and and he can basically forfeit our way of his Fifth Amendment rights and not be I'm\nNot ... because he will not be criminally prosecuted so ah that deposition he describes what he did which was disgusting he gave that he offered women quite leads which they took and he did not so that he gets to decide which he did\nBut it's that the ...\nUh but\nThat the deposition was later unsealed and and weirdly in the jury trial against him the entire deposition was not permitted as evidence only the excerpts\nPut forth by the prosecution I mean it's clearly\nA a a fatal flaw in this guy's condition which will likely be overturned so the judge probably knowing that waved bell so that he had to go to jail pending appeal which to me as an eighth amendment violation is cruel and unusual spun eighty year old blind guy in jail\nUm for something he's clearly not going to be able to do anymore\nAnd people in jail are probably going to have the same perception that doesn't understand that that does unaware of all the other things reduce the amount of 'em even worse than he is yeah\nAnd he might be a isolated which is also and before that reason I Know he's in a single cell\nSo but here's the thing how did that deposition get unsealed it wasn't unsealed in that jury case there was unsealed before which is why ... why the case was re open 'cause the Associated Press got it unsealed so different judge Eduardo were Brando\nA made this crazy arguments [noise]\nUh he this is the bottom line is\nThere's a there's a ruling I think in a case called pansy saying\nPrivacy you have a right to privacy you can't the government can't put out a court you can protect court documents if they're really embarrassed that that you you don't have to you can testify openly in court even if something's embarrassing because it won't you will have a right of privacy\nIt's so that people will testify honestly obviously\nSo ah but there is a a several exceptions to that or mid against privacy this is from pansy privacy can be curtailed if the party benefiting from the order of confidentiality is a public entity or official\nPublic entity or official and that and by that they mean like an elected person so [noise]\nSo this ... says although the defendant is a public person\nHe does not surrender his privacy rights at the doorstep of the court house we're this so\nWell known non governmental public figures visible in the public eye but pursuing strictly private activities would be subject to puree is litigation brought per chance to gain access to the intimate details of their personal lives under these circumstances the potential for abuse is high\nYes so they want inflation details of this guy ... for a you know no no public purpose or there are a lot of cases against cause the at the time because of this stuff was bubbling up that\nThese this deposition could be used by those people if they weren't a ferry is actors as this judge suspect some might be to make the things sound\nLegitimate because it will echo what his words are it will highly prejudice any future proceedings this is a lawyer and becoming an sorry if I took a reverse halo effect\nSee now that I really didn't have an analyst\nI don't understand that I Believe is right um\nIt says this case however is not about defending status as a public person by virtue of the exercise of his trade as they televise or comedic personality [noise] we're\nDefendant has done is the mantle of public Mara list and now to the proverbial electronic or print soap box which is what an ... an elected official use is\nTo volunteer his views on among other things child rearing family life education and crime to extend that defendant has really answered the public square and throws himself into the vortex of these public issues he has voluntarily\nNarrowed the zone of privacy that he is entitled to claim wait a minute yeah\nSo because you engage in discourse you lose those rights you were talking about right now he's\nEngaging and political speech this guy says very importantly from a soap box but a soap box is wasn't an elected official or a ... a candidate uses to get elected yeah this guy was a citizen speaking out against some pervasive problems\nWith society culture he was exercising his First Amendment right strong ... as they ... as a private citizen with public with access to public forums because of his position but he was saying this stuff\nAt an award ceremony they actually refer to his pound cake speech which was that an award ceremony for him [noise] um\nSo and then later it says ah\nSo there were a bunch of edition\nAnd so there were a bunch of additional cases people were making accusations against Bill Cosby and he started speaking out I think I did not do any of that stuff\nForget about it this judge goes on to say by the debate about the merits of the allegations against him\nHe has diminished isn't title meant to a claim of privacy wow\nSo by defending himself in a court of public opinion where these people were making accusations he has negate it has a right to keep that deposition sealed which not only was embarrassing but it it was a violation of his Fifth Amendment right he would never have made the statement\nTraffic it is clear set entrapment it sounds like\nWell after the fact but also what the guy said what the judge said was that\nThey failed to show that it would be embarrassing to him or cost him anything which is crazy because he was on the verge of getting a new show the proof is in the pudding that can really it's really detrimental ten and and there because their case where it's like\nIt's clear that he would be embarrassed and guys like that you didn't articulate in what ways you know so you really should one one should read and I printed it out and crazy many many pages but\nUh so so it's crystal clear to me that or I should say\nThat I just believe I presented evidence that it is his exercise\nOf the first amendment that led to his being denied fifth sixth and eighth Amendment rights\nYeah so\nIs this the first time you've heard all of us think that is the first time I've heard all that and it's because he's such an an sympathetic character\nOh my goodness yes yes yes ah All right we're going to take a break and then after the break I actually I'm not sure I can tolerate\nThe sick clip that you want to I was shocked\nWhen I saw what Bill Cosby retweeted in his own defense clearly displaying his lack of awareness yes he has the truly and charismatic [laughter]\nAll right if I I mean they gave you a ... year mosques warning you got kids on the carpet your ear my son so after the break
