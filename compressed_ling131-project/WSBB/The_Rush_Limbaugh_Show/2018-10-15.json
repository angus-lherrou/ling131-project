falling into the ocean or raising sea levels I remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact there are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I read it and the Heritage Foundation are actually report that this was during the spotted owl earth first a natural forest station\nControversy that was all part of the global warming craze in the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... at our founding\n\nThe left went fatty they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and shot down trees and we haven't replaced them to make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I pointed\nOut you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is\nThe wood industry they need what right how do you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree to cut down for new ones are planted it's part of the policy a warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this\nThey wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that they couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two then there was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they do what you're cutting down the redwoods never come back you know I'm the same\nToken I remember saying well it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees forested acres in America today than there were even fifty years ago the second one was when when I um when I pointed out\nThat are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green is going to raise as sea level I said it's like ice in a glass melting I said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice

not a scientist you can see that\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten

and we're going to go to the phones after the break in the bottom of the hour this is the thing is is not this is classic Mrs Trump saying you never knew how this honest\nThe media was and then he decides to put Leslie stall in her play\nNever knew how dishonest media was I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound bite\nI now I knew how to change the subject a cat well no but even the way you ask me a question like about separation yeah when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk to them now and I I had in Las Vegas going around your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you that you feed into me much differently on the subject\nI disagree but I don't want to have that\nFight with you hey if I look at the time I'm president and you're not in the mean\nTime I'm president and you're not reminding her who he is ... she is talking to you\n\nKnow a lot of really rude what'd you say that you don't have to say that she knows\nHis point was that he was not being

they can't\nGet rid of him they've thrown everything that they know that Donald Trump they have tried every maneuver every strip the jury every tactic they have tried\n... just a minute sub Saharan is

some people really get confused you're coming from from India\nOr over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Sahara Desert\nA which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of this arid desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that and not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this\nBecause they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she's self mission and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now\nWhat is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the because the elections I I think a lot of it is rooted in they have Trump Titus many of them do and they live and breathe to expose Trump for whatever they think he is the point that people have Anthony I'm Glad you waited\nA Scott very much like so much John in Tacoma, Washington your next I'm Glad you waited too high\nBoth thank you and make it to those from under the shadow mount Rainier so\nI appreciate I thank you\nBoth welcome and just wanted to talk about the the movie ... now I heard you on your Thursday or friday show last week you were ah you were speaking about that movie so I decided to go check it out\nThat would be friday I was ... yes\nSo I got 'em after work I raced over to the theater I I I watched it over there but um [noise] I wanted to I I I just want to portray how ... and he was he was a very very powerful movie and to illustrate that I just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie\nI'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then the the credit start rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff\nBut this did not happen at the end of the guys now\nAfter the after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all the credits finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nThey're smoking I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I I'm I made a calculation when I was talking about this on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it\nSo we got what but but what I'm not asking you know identify that but what if anything surprise you that\nYou didn't know or just just surprised your period even if you think you didn't know what about the movie what did you learn you know\n[noise] [noise] well I I didn't know about who Mr guys now was um I ... I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\nWhat what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving half of the movie was over [noise] was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but let's say this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two they were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the ... of what happens in those clinics but\nEven more than that what was that the white level what\nWas the barbarian eight of what happened in the clinics\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no in God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born Danny would kill\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by sniffing they're spinal cords with scissors now I didn't say this on friday I didn't say this on friday about gods now about what he did because I didn't want to frighten people away\nIt's not\nAs you I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right it is about primarily a trial I made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director\nLets the story tell itself there aren't any exaggerating computer generated graphics there there's not a lotta a special effect\nA real or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers of children born alive killed by this man is stunning\nShocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less money had done they've always done their best to suppress it it was nearly impossible to get this movie main precisely because what yet revealed\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking roles people like Nick Searcy who\nUm a is a A N across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take or [noise]\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling ... and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run that go from the pages would\nNot allow any kind of\nFunding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which\nA ... a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one that they wouldn't allow any\nFacebook would not allow any kind of a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a little essay amazing miraculous buddy if it was it was a ... a lot of hard work at a lot of\nTime to get this movie made but and it was a real challenge for them but how how difficult is it to focus on\nThe fact that this ... did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of ah of abortions in the world but\nThe numbers of born alive that this man murdered it's just stunning everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion\nAnd it's called an abortion if you if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is ... in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up with a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was ... rock Obama who refused to support it\nThe left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever it's called an abortion and the the the the the thing that left just tried to do in countering this movie is to say well\nWell if you want more God's know then you go and overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say guys now was doing what he was doing because women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere they get that's a flat out why by the white guys know clinic\nIf you will none of the none of the year was sterilized people that were getting sick and infected with it just it was a pig style was in Philadelphia\nBut I didn't focus on that on purpose because I didn't want to you because you don't\nSee it that's my point they don't graphically tried to make their points they focus on the murder trial button good going\nOut there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating of nervous out there what does Russia want to hear what it would have been he got as not that I wanted to hear anything but that is what I think most people will learn that they didn't know if they go\nThrough in Newark mainstream America just gold rush on my ER I'd be men were\nMy mom\nBuying a home allows you to benefit from
