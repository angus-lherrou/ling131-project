financial world ice chief investment officer over a trend macro political he can absolutely help us better understand one of the biggest stories right now and that's what's happening with interest rates\nAnd while you're trying to figure out your own personal story when it comes to reaching your goals of like retirement we are here to help and call with your questions eight eight eight eight three three eight six three seven or you can always drop us an email to\nShoot me that email ask Andy at investing sense dot com we're going to keep an eye on the inbox there throughout the show but Afghani at investing sense dot\nCom so we're going to get started Andy there was a big story recently from your industry independent financial advisors and every year the publication barons ranks the country's top independence and natural advisors and they came out with their most recent ranking just a couple of weeks ago\nThere was a familiar name to if you're on the list for the first time and it was a very good rank for a debut on the list yeah\nFinancial engines were incredibly proud to be named to barons list of top independent investment advisors start first time on the list we debuted at number twelve\nAnd this was out of like the top forty firms that burns ranked this year interestingly enough uh parents actually had to expand the list from thirty to forty spots this year and that was due to this incredible growth that we're seeing right now in our industry\nSo let's bring that to the actual clients with this barons have to say about that\nAre so barons concluded that this was quote largely good news for for clients\nAnd that's really because you know firms like ours as we get bigger keys in general are coming down and that's whether you want to look at fund expense ratios are even commissions are these days some brokers are going commission free right or all that together really is a good thing for clients so\nHere's the cool part while fees are coming down\nLuckily for for those turning sixty five right now you've benefited from this nine you're bull market in stocks plus housing prices are up so that means is more of you are ready and in a position to retire\nAlready and in the position to retire so if you could use some help taking that step please get a second pair of eyes on on your financial future it's great if you're working with a broker it's great if you're working with with an advisor or plan or but this is too important for you to just kind of you know hope for the best\nSo get over to investing cents dot com set time to talk with our local team\nNow and in Texas has taken a cell phone or offer to call with a question at eight eight eight eight three three eight six three seven she'd like to know about an annuity to help her with income in retirement and thanks for calling how can we help\nThanks for taking the call today first of all and I will be sixty five years old next Wednesday and I'm working to try and set up as much income for later in life retirement as I can figure out what's going to be happening then to ...\nAnd a few weeks ago I had her heart of your show only part of a show unfortunately and you said that you didn't really like a new case\nBut I have an owner financed mortgage note and it runs out and about eight years right and I was considering an annuity to replace that after five years\nAnd if you don't really like that idea that you made any suggestions on where it would be safe and ideally I could at least earn some interest if not more\nAbsolutely so Ah yes we were talking about a annuities I'm not a fan of of these insurance products um I think they're complicated too complicated for like Ninety nine percent of of people out there uh I think they're expensive\nFor what you get um I think they're better for the people selling it to you than you the person buying it and I think people deserve to be better than\nYou know just being some food source for their broker a there are only there they are in liquid so you put your money in in anywhere between six and twelve years down the road you can finally pull out the you know the last of your money without any penalties\nSo only in a couple of situations do I ever think that it's okay for for somebody to purchase um these insurance contracts if you're the parent of a special needs child and you're trying to create a a trust\n'em that can fund some sort of income stream for the child after you're gone um if you are very very old and have literally nobody else to help you\nWith your your financial picture you maybe by an immediate annuity and create a an immediate income stream of that\nFor the rest of humanity I think that there are better ways to go about setting up an income stream I'm so that you're not you know kind of food you know held at ransom\nBy these insurance companies with these lackluster products are are you going out and looking for information are people starting to contact you or are you being pitched\nOne of these insurance contracts now where are you right now\nI'm looking for an investment to give this the money I have at least for now it's going to come from\nA four O. one K. right and\nI watched it go way down in two thousand and eight\nWhen we had you know the crisis and the oil thoughts and everything like that right it was\nSet up by my own company I work for and it's all sitting in stock I I wasn't scared I knew oil wasn't finished yet and I said I'm just going to leave it you know roll the dice and let it come back on that has\nNow I'm going to be sixty five and I'd like to put at least part of it\nSomeplace where it won't go down and the next dot market cycle\nOkay so I did have good luck a long\nTime ago the only time I've ever really work with a financial manager\nAnd I'm I have a couple of small and that sense that I still have from her from years ago and they pay me give it the end and I was just thinking about doing that or you know like utility stocks you can buy those but\nI prefer to roll it over rather than take the money out and and it like on the utility that\nBy law it said how much money you're going to get but I'm considering a financial manager and you know I thought well I'll start with just on the radio on a call insurance\nNon allergic did I'm Glad you did so you know you're thinking about things the right way so what you wanted to I mean if you're going to be sixty five um what the what the Centers for Disease Control are telling us is that um if you're if you're turning sixty five on average\nAt um if you're if you're turning sixty five on average you're gonna live another Nineteen years\nNow that means that half of Americans are going to live longer than that half of Americans are going to live you know less than that but the point is you're gonna have\nWhat could be a couple of decades of life left of time left in the market so at at no point do I ever want you to take on more risk than you need but if you do something like you're thinking about what this annuity you're opening yourself up to different types of risk\nThat you don't need right now at as as we move through the the next couple of years in the market as we move through um you know just your life in general\nYou want kind of two things always working for you you want some sort of growth component\nThat's going to be in stocks that can help inflation proof your money\nAnd then you want some sort of income component that's going to be able to pay you a an income stream as you kind of live out the rest of your days\nThe ah the the annuity that you're thinking about doesn't really do either of those all that well it's it's great for the company that puts it together because they're you know charging you an arm and a leg to make this happen\nBut what I Would have to think about is you know sitting down with with somebody I can uh you know hold on here after the call I I Want to get a couple more pieces of information I'll reach out to my partner's down there in Houston so that you can talk with somebody\nBut what you basically want to do is create some sort of paycheck for you as you move through the next couple of decades\nAnd so as long as you have the rights I'm a investments for you and your particular situation it may be some similar socks that to what you're doing there may be some different types of investments that we bring in to create an income stream for you\nBut I think that you know that is what I'd rather you do don't spend your money on these insurance products they're too expensive for what you get there going to tie up your money\nI'm as the market changes around you you're not going to be able to to adapt\nAnd that's just not a good place that you want to be you know with your with your money\nI found it online and it and they were they\nAwesome awesome you hold on we're going to get you some help and luggage squared away I won't do it\nWhen it comes to planning for income in retirement and you've been saying this all year\nThat step requires a different skill set it's just not as easy as plowing money into the stock market and watching it grow but this is all about preserving and protecting and generating income and and accomplishing that requires a different skill sets\nIt does and and we're getting an some help but if you could use some help planning for for your retirement income get over to investing sense dot com set time to meet with our local team ask\nAbout a service that we offer called retirement paycheck a it's an annuity alternative because we designed it to deliver a regular income but with a lot more flexibility and that a lot of lower cost than what you would find with these uh you know kind of very complicated insurance\nContracts now Jason has set of questions you are asked candy at investing sense dot com and box and he writes Andy I'm new to investing and I don't have much to invest and I was wondering if a robo adviser account was worthwhile it looks good on paper what's your advice a great\nQuestion Jason and you know look if you've got five thousand dollars or less than yes a robo adviser could be a good jumping off point that you said that you're a ... that you're new to investing if you're young you have a long time horizon I'd go one step further and make this even easier for you\nJust open an IRA or a brokerage account by an index fund that tracks the U.S and the five hundred regularly in vast\nAnd then once you get to maybe ten ten thousand dollars or so diversify a bit more by some small kept some international stock but don't make this more complicated than what it needs to be\nSo you know think about your personal situation you've got those IRAs you've got to brokerage accounts your situation is getting more complex you're looking at a hundred thousand or more saved are invested it's probably going to make some sense for you to get a second pair of eyes on your plan\nBecause now these questions aren't necessarily you know what fun too I use what ATF do I use it's more like how much do I need to retire\nJackie set us for portfolio last week and she writes I have a question regarding bond funds and CDs\nWhich is better at this point bond funds seemed destined to lose value in a rising interest rate environment individual bonds pay the state of interest rate is held to a majority but Kerry default risk CDs pay this stated rate it held the maturity and our FDIC insured\nSo this is where the conversation started with Jackie but I wanted to dig a little\nThis is where the conversation started with Jackie but I wanted to dig a little bit deeper so I ask more about the overall situation because look planning an income stream and retirement is difficult enough to begin with but now\nYou got rates where they are where they could be later on the market in the environment or going to get even more difficult and Bob you have you have Jackie's replied\nDo she wrote back I'm retired sixty seven have a pension and drawing Social Security my spouse is also retired and draws Social Security combined we have about a hundred thousand dollars in annual income from those sources and saving a portion so we don't need into our savings\nYeah right there okay it's a key point that I Want to you know for those kind of you know the focus on here they are still saving a portion of their retirement income stream\nNow I'm going to circle back to that and the second Jackie may not have realized it but she revealed to me of a little bit of risk aversion by mentioning these CDs\nSo in our email conversation I suggested some alternatives and realize you know we use any or all of the following types of bonds in clients' portfolios or you've got\nHigh yield bond floating rate bonds municipal bonds corporate bonds multi sector bond fund or you know collective investments so importantly right now we're trying to keep the duration pretty short or even ultra short\nAnd because we think this is one way to manage interest rate risk and still get the potential benefit of a steady income\nSo let's go back to the key points about Social Security and pension income\nJackie said that they are in about a hundred grand a year between Social Security and a couple of pensions right plus they're able to save a portion of that cash flow each month in other words you know they can let their savings ride\nThat this is this is very important in this era of longevity that we're seeing right now uh you know when you understand that you're likely to have a much longer life in retirement you start to realize pretty quick you know how vital it is to have your savings and investments work for you for longer\nSo with Jackie I was able to carve out an application to some different bond funds inside their overall portfolio and their their income sources\nAnd it was an allegation that made sense for their uh situation for their longer time and retirements while still trying to manage risk against that rising interest rate environment if\nYou could use some help planning your retirement income stream like this get over to investing sense dot com set time to talk there with our local team\nWe've got a call now from Andrew in New York He's calling with a question about the yield curve Andrew thanks for calling how can we help\nMy question is if you guys explain what you look like an hour to determine when it when it's happening\nEntered this can be a great indicator but let's let's unpack this just a little bit but the yield curve does is it compares yields across different maturity\nSo imagine you you have this graph paper in front of you along the bottom left to right is the maturity of a bond like the two year after the ten year along the side\nFrom the bottom of the top is the interest rate of of the bond now imagine that you're drawing a curve the line on that graph in front of you\nTypically what you see the shorter than maturity the lower the interest rate so that means that the lines can occur from the lower left up to the upper right\nSo what happens when the yield curve in birds is that the curve does not go from the bottom left to the upper right it's because the shorter maturity bonds have you'll that's higher than the yield for those longer maturity bond so the inverted yield curve goes from the upper left down to the lower right\nIs there something else to the yield curve that we should be following for example what happens if it in ...\nHistorically they're not always but historically in inverted yield curve can proceed a recession but you want to be\nA ... you want to be really careful with this if then or this this causality\nBecause it usually takes a long time between the inversion and recession we're going to continue to monitor things pretty closely and we'll let you know if and when the curve in birds just please do not be too quick to act on this information\nNext on the show we'll be

killed\nOkay it's so dark dean is that just kinda fried down to the roots I just pulled on him then they just came right out dog would uh the ... country that has ages all\nIs just friday stunted it when are they coming out this year and and now it's totally dry it up\nUm two moms to hum I have a lot of Botanic calls um you know just just everything in a certain spot and then all along the front where there were all types of perennials from it'll speed wealth lemon balm or how you know just\n... be bomb and nothing's bloomed at all in the back where there should be gardening is where the Sharon some ... it's a beauty buried just in my figs crow than a raspberry I mean\nHonestly I'm not going to eat there's thousands of dollars for a while\nI'm not going to eat there's thousands of miles and things like roads is just totally fried up\nOkay was he trying to spray weeds in the areas that when he was trying to do what was the motive or do you know\nI don't know that they're\nOkay I Would highly recommend pursuing a soul test of the area just to find out you can do it through the George extension service and then I had to see what's going on the next thing I Would do after you\nHave the result is I Would go ahead definitely remove the plants and when you replant I Would dig the whole ruble out with the soil and then when you replant and make sure you put a new so around the plant very well but I Would definitely check out that sold his first and I would think by doing that you're going to be okay\nOkay okay and as far as the garden area where the main bill or what ever happened was um does that soil all need to come out um it was kind of a balanced arrangement you know right right um\nDoes all that so I only the coming out are well I find that out from the extension vote I\nDon't what is it like a perennial bed where the the product was dumped in there like he just dumped the whole bucket in there\nThat are ... sprayed it I I I don't know but the whole ten by an area\nIs pretty much fried crispy and where especially the guy in it than a dog which just died and um and then and I think that's where the pecan got its roots over there in fact that the um and I mean that the country is probably forty feet high\nWow so do I want him yeah I Would say this old says is going to say to go ahead\nAnd remove the soil down to a certain point like I'm guessing they're going to say now to say twelve inches or something I don't know it could be a little bit more and then put new so back in and then after you do that you should be OK planning a time when ... now the tree I don't the truth is the ... just dead completely\nThe dog what is and um and the ... ton appears to be okay I mean I only spring well towel and that um I think this got rain chain size myself trying to get out that that brought it out and try\nNot very feminine bed okay but anyway it's I I guess that I'm I'll find out what that now called the extension center then and um do you have to tell them specifically what to look for\nOr can they do a math test there\nThey're going to pretty much running on everything they're going to check every single hang out in the salt is but I Would definitely when you call them or email 'em let 'em know what happened and then they'll find out for sure All right thanks for your call waiting herring\nYeah good luck eighty six degrees

saying that he's not responsible for his behavior\nAnd throughout history there have been society's just said well men just simply cannot be trusted so we cannot show an ankle because men can't control themselves\nWell why the heck not why can't they control themselves right is the sexual drive powerful of course yeah hey let's celebrate it it's amazing it's wonderful\nIt takes a man to manage it and it's what's your job is Amanda management regardless of how anyone who's dressed around you or whether or not she's acting like a lady so what what what we have to do is stop saying that one person taking responsibility for their behavior means that they can take responsibility for other people's behavior and that's\nNot true now there's another wrinkle to the issue do you want to be treated like a lady didn't act like a lady right it greatly increases your chance as it does not guarantee that you'll be treated like a lady okay very good point because\nThere's not a girl or a woman I Know that has not been mistreated because of her sexuality in some way shape or form\nMy daughter yes my wife yes my co workers yes the people that are employees that have worked with me yes there's not one and that does not mean in any way shape or form they didn't want to be treated like a lady\nThey could set up with and do all the right things but one of the things we have to face and this is something my wife has helped me understand is you are at an inherent power disadvantage\nIs you are at an inherent power disadvantage as a woman simply because of two things one basic physical ... size and strength\nTo the women always bear the burden of sex meaning they're the ones that get pregnant and they're left with the burden of that so that has always put women at an inherent disadvantage what we've also done\nIs taking advantage of them in so many other ways and we've come up with diagnoses that say they can't think they're driven by feelings right it's always revelation to people that you know where the term hysterectomy came from yes hysteria yes yes it was ... so you were diagnosed with hysteria\nWhich only women can be diagnosed so in order to remove you of that emotion alley we're going to remove your uterus call it a hysterectomy right 'cause men don't get hysterical\nI ever not at all no they never get overly emotional at all\nRight just go to a college football game later and it was funny [laughter] right [laughter] so I I Want to have a ... a ... it says to my daughter and I have looked you know it\nDoes dressing like a woman and that you want to be ... does does pursue how you want to be treated that does not guarantee you'll be treated that way but it does greatly increase the chances\nThat here's another wrinkle to it\nSome women don't want to be treated like a lady they want to be treated as an object of lust right because that gives them a certain sense of validation and if you think about it\nThere's a part of me I can understand it because we were talking about this off air when people get stressed out we doubled down on what we think we have when people feel insecure we doubled down on what we think we have and so I'm going to show off\nMy delta medallion bag tagged at the airport to write because that's finally a place that recognizes how important I Am right or I'm going to show off my kids because I really don't think I have anything\nRight to show off and so I so often will will do anything we use anything when we're operating from a place of insecurity well think about it a girl growing up\nHas been taught through all of our messaging and imaging that to to get power you have to be an amazingly attractive sexual being and she starts to develop that\nIt's tempting to want to show it off especially if you've got an inherent power disadvantage\nI'm Fonda turtleneck threatening to say about me you were completely secure in your\nYour femininity and your your sexuality it's amazingly secure [laughter]\n[laughter] and so here's the thing that we do we reward attracted more attractive women yes yes we do\nAll the time and so do girls make mistakes by leaning too heavily on that yes just like men make mistakes by leading too heavily on what car they drive or how much money they make\nOr what their position is and they don't realize you're actually showing your insecurities\nLike when somebody says that person has a really big ego\nFor my license former licensed therapist perspective what they really mean is that person has a really small you go okay and they are puffing it up to make it so you are and make it look bigger we all do this in\nOne way or another and dressing a certain way is one way that people do it right and girls do it because it does give them attention it gives them and\nAgain psychologist hat on for a second [laughter] maybe they're not getting attention I tell you this\n[noise] a\nStronger relationship of girl has with her father the less she has that baseline need to attract boys\nThat strong in exchange for secure mature love from a dead they will take last ...\n\nThey had to do that are on so one of the best things are just said your daughter's is I Love and respect you and I'm not scared of you becoming a young woman I'm not scared of you're developing breasts I'm not scared of you can't say that\nYou can demonstrate it by being just as affectionate\nAs you were before by being just as close wanting to spend time right letting even I ... I came home one time and my daughter she had several friends over and there was ice cream and cookies and chips out and some chick flick on and I knew\nImmediately he broke up other oh that's what I just figured right and she had she was crying whatever and as soon as I got there she been with her mom had been great you with their friends ripe as soon as I got there she cleared a space for me on the couch and said I Want my daddy and just climbed on my lap and this is Seventeen year old\nAnd just climbed on my lap\nAnd it's a Seventeen year old in front of all on your front umbrella friends\nRight and what to do mold man and just watch watch this movie with me day oh wow I cherished moments like that because that's a it's a validation okay I did something\nSomething right so\nSo many times what we think well what they need to know is this guy snake will then might be somewhat helpful but not all guys think all the time\nBut\nNo matter what you do you're not responsible for some with somebody else does okay let's go to the phone lines real quick and speak with Earl Earl you're on WSBIU how are you today\nI Am well good afternoon mayor I come from a slightly different point of view okay I'm a I'm a grandfather now ... a father or children\nThree boys and a girl and they all basically got the same tall ... which\nWas R.
