neighboring city is\nAnd what the wind gusts are the ... the highest wind gust right now around sixty four sixty five miles an hour in the Panama City Panama City beach area these one hundred and fifty mile an hour winds are in the Iowa poll they are not the entire storm\nA I I'm not trying to to to minimize the impact here it's just that the reporting on these storms and the education on these storms in general is I think one thing it's lacking\nSuch as the way they colorized the graphics of these storms to make it look like hell on earth when any any hurricane the strongest wins are in the eye wall and a little\nYou know extended from it\nBut there's not too many places are going to get a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds the day where am I wall hits and maybe twenty miles depending on the size of the I Will not from there it'll fall off\nNothing nothing uh\n[laughter] I mean a hundred and twenty five is no slouch if you think that you've experienced Seventy five out on our wins well that's not bad like and it's the effect of a hundred and fifty versus ought to Seventy five months is not a\nLot better than nothing\n[laughter] I mean a hundred and twenty five is no slouch if you think that you've experienced Seventy five mile an hour winds well that's not bad I couldn't either it's the effect of a hundred and fifty versus other Seventy five months is not twice\nWhen you're in it if there is a multiplier effect\nOf massive wind speed so that if if the fastest the highest winds you've been in as Seventy five miles an hour and you're like OK a cat for its gonna doubled is it won't ... on the ground miles per hour it is but the impact of\nA hundred and fifty mile an hour winds versus Seventy five the just the destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four\nOr ... hundred and fifty miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it\nThe further you get from the high of depending on the structure the the more the wind speed decreases the rainfall pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm but the devastating the worst when the storm\n\nAre only in the eye wall area and people can look at these storms in the graphics while a hundred and fifty miles an hour winds all that's all I met the whole banning it now it isn't not trying to downplay the or the damage I've just I've

the speed remember the force of the when it does not double as wind speeds do the forests increases and a much\nGreater rate and there was a formula that the scientists have developed the force of when it goes up as\nA square speeds so two times if you if you've got thirty mile an hour wins that all of a sudden make I'm sixty the force of that is is um\n... would be much harder to to to Times Square to thirty you'd you'd get a are scared you know you you've got to you got close to a hundred mile an hour force um when you get above the Seventy five miles per hour limit is what it really is so the\nUh two times when just four times the force of the wind up three times as nine times you do you square the speed to find out what the force of the wind is\nSo a hundred and fifty miles an hour [laughter] it's devastating\nNow where did those wins happen are those surface Windsor those flight level weddings and this is what you have to have a hurricane hunter data to what to know but they are reported as wins on the surface hundred and fifty mile an hour winds at the surface I mean there's there's\nVery little it's going to survive that\nSo we will ah will see exactly what\nAt landfall

oh\nYes is out in the old in the old Soviet Union\nPeople would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that the state that the regime was listening to them\nAnd so you're basically this driving described in the same thing the difference is that in in twenty sixteen there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump is it on the\nBallot leaders so you you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in yards but but your point is the outward support for

issues\nThere are people that are prone to violence there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that an assassination is going to take place but Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask for the calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants\nAmerica to think that this ... on his behavior is\nPretty natural pretty normal that it is representative\nOf of a majority of American people like Democrats want that perception out
