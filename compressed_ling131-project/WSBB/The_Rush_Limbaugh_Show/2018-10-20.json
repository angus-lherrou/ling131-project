recognized certified financial planner professionally Andy Smith [noise] Hi, Bob Richards\nThe guy standing next to me as Andy Smith hey Andy it has been quite an October already yeah really quite a year and to to help us sort through all of what's been happening we're going to start the show today with news about a limited time offer for a free portfolio review and Social Security optimization report at investing cents dot com\nRight so we're running this limited time offer for a couple of reasons or one\nYou know this recent market volatility might have you reconsidering the risk that you're taking right now and this is important right now so many of you are reaching retirement age the last thing that you want is to delay retirement because of you know any sort of market drop\nTo you know the second reason for us having this limited time offer at investing sense dot com like Bob was talking about I mean it goes back to so many of you reaching retirement age right now many of you could be making a huge mistake by claiming Social Security or planning on taking Social Security too soon\nI threw the show you know we're going to explain how you could be leaving lots of Social Security dollars on the table if you're applying are planning on applying the wrong claiming strategy you know in the meantime just cut the chase learned more claim that free portfolio review that Social Security optimization report to it's a it's they're investing sense dot com bubble\nWhen it comes to reaching a goal like retirement for most Americans that means having two sources of income source number one is your savings and investments in source number to Social Security and for some American couples the total lifetime benefits from Social Security can be over a million dollars so when you add that\nTo a nest egg in a four one K. or an IRA and maybe a little income on the side and all of a sudden there is no retirement crisis I mean at least for most people listening who I don't think are facing retirement crisis but Andy when it comes to the investment piece of this formula\nHow do you work with clients and take them to that next step and move into retirement whatever that retirement ends up looking like\nAll right so it all starts with a conversation I I have to get to know your needs and your once because ultimately\nI'm going to build a very personalized plant around your specific needs and once and that plan can help you take certain steps and make critical changes to what you may be doing right now and you know look changes a huge theme that we've talked about all year on investing sense and all this change stems from the volatile\nA you could be missing out on what is yeah it's like basically a guaranteed increase over a couple of years which is what happens when you wait and you know\nSo we're a couple of years which is what happens when you wait\nAnd you know if you're still working while you claim benefits before full retirement age Social Security has actually been to reduce your benefits even more\nSo I mean think about it you can't get an increase like this than any other investment period and this is from a guy who you know makes a living helping you invest in the markets and\nWhy would you want the Social Security administration to take more money away from you with these reductions in benefits simply because you're still working and I mean really all of us have financial engines are worried\nThat Americans are taking risks that they don't fully understand and that's why for this limited time as part of our offer for free portfolio review will also run a Social Security analysis to personalize you're claiming strategy please get to investing sense dot com learn more and get started here\nNow to give you an example of how important it is to apply the correct cleaning strategy\nAnd to explain how sometimes it's difficult to know what that strategy actually is\nWe are thrilled to have ... joined us on the show\nTitled is a wonderful thing it's an angel engines he's a senior instructor and he travels around the country teaching people and places like Boeing and Ford how to better prepare for their future and we've invited Kyle to join us to tell a story about his mom and how he helped her get more out of Social Security when it comes to spousal benefits\nKyle ... is great to have you on the show with us today we're all anxious to hear the story that you have to share about one of your own family members and how they almost left tens of thousands of dollars in Social Security benefits on the table\nPlease share that story with us\nAbsolutely Bob my dad started to receive Social Security benefits because of disability in his early sixties my mom's planet always been to delay taking her Social Security benefits until Seventy given her above average life expectancy\nOr you know really I mean just her knowing that kind of puts her a pretty far away from most of the people who know what the different Social Security claiming options are so it's awesome that your mom had this information where did you learn all of her different options here\nWell she had always been a good planner and she definitely done her homework she looked at several different claiming strategies wall factoring in some of her other sources of income\nAnd she basically determined which strategy wouldn't make the most sense for her overall retirement plan now when the bipartisan budget act of two thousand and Fifteen was passed\nFile and suspend with restricted application she assumed that she couldn't claim spousal benefits and that her only option was to wait to turn on her benefit at Seventy and to continue to receive my dad's Social Security benefit as a source of retirement income\nSo Kyle I'd I I'd like to have you back up just a second and explain for us you mentioned the bipartisan budget an act of twenty Fifteen explain for us what that is\nAbsolutely the bipartisan budget act of two thousand and Fifteen it changed the rules around the voluntary suspension of benefits so for married couples somewhat have one spouse file a restricted application\nAt there for a tyrant age so that they could claim spousal benefits while allowing their own benefit to grow until age Seventy so for anyone born January second Nineteen fifty four or later\nThat option was no longer available what also happens with these changes is that if you spend your benefits all benefits based upon your record will also be suspended soldier benefits or suspended\nYour spouse can no longer claim a spouse will benefit because that benefit would also be suspended here's the part of the bipartisan budget act that my mom overlooked this changed the right to file a restricted application for those born on or after\nJanuary second Nineteen fifty four\nShe was born in Nineteen fifty two and since my dad was already receiving his Social Security benefit\nShe was still able to use a restricted application so once she reached her for retirement age and says she has not started taking her own Social Security benefits she could Clinton's spouse will benefit wall letting her own benefit continue to grow\nSo I'll I'll go back again I'm too where you started talking about the the changes you know specifically with Social Security but if your mother knew about violence has been in restricted application and spousal benefits and everything else my gases that she\nKind of game plan what the different benefit numbers would have been to her\nSo how much more in benefits you know did she started getting one she filed for this restricted application\nThis was the best part of the entire story as soon as she turned sixty six which was her full retirement age she filed the restricted application and she started to collect nine hundred dollars a month\nAsian and she started to collect nine hundred dollars a month\nAs the spouse will benefit off of my dad's record so this was over forty three thousand dollars that she would have left on the table between the ages of sixty six Seventy that she and I had this conversation\nAbout restricted applications and most importantly about the changes that did not affect her because of this bipartisan budget\nChild this has been a huge benefits for our listeners having you on the show thank you so much for being with us\nAbsolutely you're very welcome thank you very much for having me on today\nThere was a lot more to Kyle story I Want you to go here that full conversation and investing sense dot com but this story you know really motivates me here and what we're doing right and and for this I Want to speak directly to women\nRight now I still like the guys to play to pay close attention to what I'm about to say I especially if you care about your wives or your partners\nBut Social Security is so important to women and it's because on average at least you know women earn less than men you can find lots of statistics on this but women generally are in about twenty percent less ah for women of color the pay gap is even more pronounced\nThis is why choosing the rights Social Security strategy is so important to women\nAnd the other reasons that Social Security is so important I mean women tend to take more time off to raise children for example ah women tend to accumulate lessons savings women tend to live longer which we talk about all the time on investing sense now about that about that longevity men verses women\nWomen it is vital that you account for life span when you're selecting a Social Security strategy women represent more than half of Social Security beneficiaries in their sixties uh women represent Seventy percent of Social Security beneficiaries in their nineties women make up Ninety seven percent Ninety seven percent\nOf all Social Security survivor beneficiaries you have to be making the right decisions all along now if you even step back a little bit further and think about things that a little bit more global level we've been adjusting client portfolios we want to reduce risk before we see additional volatility in the markets that volatility alone\nShould've

that would be a good option for you or whether your skin laxity you know requires something else most people in the age range of about Seventy like you mentioned neck tights probably not going to be my first choice\nBecause it it just isn't powerful enough to to tighten that skin usually people need some kind of a neck lift or lower face lifted neck with I just did one of those yesterday a on a lady who is in her sixties and I talked to she and her husband last night\nAnd you know they're doing fine and so we usually tell people that\nRecovery from a more invasive procedure like a lower face neck with something like that is in stages where you're kind of out of the public eye for maybe ten to fourteen days and then back to exercise and activity by a month and then feeling you know better

what's the phone now yeah thanks will couple of ways obviously for those who are driving around the can't write things down Marietta plastic surgery dot com you thing to look up later but says\nAmusing to look up later but seven seven zero four to five zero when when eight is our direct line and we have two offices one is in Marietta near can assume hospital right off the vice Seventy five and the other one is actually in Woodstock town lake area right off of five Seventy five\nAnd we have people who travel from all over the metro area and even surrounding states to come and see us um which is great\nA lot of people from in town like it because they're not likely to run into their best friend or when they're there and um and and other things so that's\nHow they get along and it's easy to get to a gorgeous office and everyone is so pleasant treat you like you're part of the family thank you know I really enjoy that just okay back to the phone lines we go if you want to join us that's for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty\nFor oh four eighty seven to zero seven fifty like Meg in Marietta has done how are you Meg\nI'm well thank you how are you how can we help you today\n[noise] um this may sound kind of crazy um I have no but it's a genetic trait I mean absolutely nothing\nI got yours [laughter] I have\nDegenerative disc disease s a joint all kinds of lower back issues and when I said I Am literally sit now than it\nDoes in plants has any of that or is it simply cosmetic is that something that could be done to try to alleviate pressure and possibly thing\nYeah that's an interesting question Meg thanks for calling in so it sounds like by your description I Would guess that you're relatively thin is that a fair assumption\nI'm a hundred and forty a hundred and forty five four okay so you know\nMy first choice with the description you gave wouldn't be to use a buck implant um just because the medical implants are usually place a little higher in the ... area so when you said they don't actually give you any patting you know in a normal sitting posture\nAnd that's a really good because sitting on a implant usually wouldn't be very comfortable um the buck and plants are actually a little firmer than the typical silicone gel breast implants they're a different type of material\nAnd these days what we prefer to do usually is is kinda fun exotic name but Brazilian but left is the name which is actually kind of a fancy term for taking fat from other areas may be the abdomen or the flanks love handle area yeah we take that fat\nAnd then we clean it and we inject it into the buck soft tissue to give more fullness and and and maybe some more padding\nSo if you had some fat that was extra that would probably be your best first choice\nYou could like make my stomach flat or in my eye on her\nThere you go to Ryan and it sounds good\nYou are winner for the day\nWell let me ask one other question that it should not physical problems is that something that uh insurance would ever cover because I Know typically they don't\nYeah I Would say that my experience that would be a no um\nYou know it's not really a reconstructive thing for your direct problem so I I think insurance would have a hard time with that\nWell\nYou are given me a direction to look and thank you very much\nOkay make hope you have a great day I thank you my\nGosh that just puts a big smile on my face and you can do [laughter]\nI liked her little jingle that she came up with [laughter]\nForty four minutes after one o'clock sixty three degrees here on peach tree street going to speak with Michael and when that hey Michael how are you today\nOn your sleeve lady Oh thank you what can we help you with\nWell I just wanted to call

Paul and the doctor Hannah ... such a nice guy when I met with him\nIn the office your staff and Marietta location is really sweet I met with a lady before I met with your head and all all everything that I'm sure she was really sweet and herring you've got a really excellent show\nWell thank you Michael we we certainly appreciate Yukon and given his feedback and I'll I'll be sure to pass on to a doctor Hannah that you appreciate it his demeanor and attention to detail during your consultation I I have to say\nThat I really think that Michael's experiences very classic and for office you know

I guess the L. A. R. E. T. all of these are going to be big bold red wines with a little bit of a smooth finish all of this would be a great choice Bonnie doing makes a great ... so\nHe was one\nYou got it All right miss Iran thank you for your call forty minutes after two o'clock sixty three degrees were going back to the phone lines and speak with Jennifer and calming Jennifer you're on WSBIU how can we help you today\nYeah Hi how are you good well I like\nCoffee different from the first caller I like it fairly light um heavy on Kramer and a bit meeting among ship so kind of interested in what want you to just really\nCool a so that that tells me you're right you're going to want almost the exact opposite of the last caller in terms of uh\nSo have you on uh what what you're describing is something somebody who's flexible both in whites and roads are as long as that red wine is as super light on the finish um yeah so a great sort of place to start would be peanut or as which you know we just got through talking about the war is a sort of in the last\nSegment um they tend to be cherry or raspberry or flavors along those lines um so are those fruits that you tend to enjoy\nYes definitely cherry not face\nAwesome yeah then I'm going to leave my answer really kind of free with that I mean do a great ... valley peanut or that's where I Want you to hang out um\nSo ah there's a really good value on I'm under twenty bucks um [noise]\nAnd what was that name again that was selling\nA will emit valley is a great that's a region on in Oregon that they grow super fun ones are but a ten mile is a great you know no more specifically out of that that's under under Fifteen dollars that's a great place to start\nOff and you know it's really weird like one thing that when it comes to beer I found that I really like a fake roadside fears orders in the south I Can't wait to try that pumpkin border you mentioned earlier that thanks for that suggestion\nOh it's my pleasure and actually that is not that surprising so uh porters are sort of softer gentler him even though their dark in the glass\nThey're really not hard on their palate necessarily it's not like an eye view it as aggressive so that actually makes complete sense\nSo think about again is again is is very snooze\nIt it is moderately smooth and it's got a nice talking um we'll call it structured finish um but it is not harsh at all\nNo even though it's dark and time for that You're welcome sweaty have a great day All right\nIf you want to join in on the phone lines we have of\nOh for Fifteen minutes left joined us up for oh four eighty seven to zero seven fifty that's for oh four eight seven to zero seven fifty we would love to type before that perfect bottle of wine or east so tired of going to the grocery store your wine store\nAnd going to the same island picking up that same bottle of wine because that's all you know will step out of your comfort zone let us find that perfect bottle of wine for you\nFor oh four eighty seven to zero seven fifty we're going to lead in in Covington your own ws the Howard Hughes sweetheart\nI'm fine how are you a little bit horse today so forgive me for that\nLittle Shetland pony huh yeah\nWell I was at home coming my my son and again last night we were doing a lot of screaming well\nGod I Hope they won um yes they did thank you okay what's your question\nAnd I wanted my ... um type of wine and I take I like my coffee like really strong French Roast and that I like cream and the\nCloser to actual creating the better so I like literally ... not any kind of ... or a fake crane and I like um sugar not artificial sweetener 'cause it makes it taste sweet and bitter so on that has a better like after taste so that's how I take my call\nYou know as well and that that's so you love texture and and sort of ... mouth feel that you get out of a big bold coffee\n... yes yes cool\nUh so you have a really easy answer a in my mind at least a ... sort of your natural fit I'm petite serrano art to me the deepest reaches of the ones so it's um it's a lot like drinking a an imperial stout or in your case a French Roast coffee with both cream and sugar um\nLet's think about this so I'm a I Know of\nTall that help at the health I like I'm I'm a big black and paying 'em for beer um and I like Guinness just by itself but I really love a good black and tanned\nNice again I think it it takes a little bit of that what you call shockey I'm off the finish of the skin is\nNice no you're you're you're I think you're really in his own if you will in terms of what you like which is awesome um so I Know I've talked about this before but uh the tea petite from Michael David is a great I'm sort of started down that road big bold roasting in the middle of but super smooth on the finish and it has\nAll that mouth feel that you crave 'em so I can only\nCan you suggest a white wine as well I like white ones that are really struggle with white because of if they're inexpensive they tend to have they very often tend to have their bitter to me very you know I don't like that um shark taste at the end of\nIts like aesthetic and I I don't I have a hard time finding it get sharp and they I guess I should\n[laughter] me too yeah outlets\nSure now I guess I should [laughter]\nMe too yeah I don't like him you're that's that's a little bit tough a shirt and they would be my my top recommendation just because of that now feel it is to me the most viscous of the of the white wines um\nAnd if it's done right you get a little bit of that we we call it mellow lactic acid in in the business but you get that sort of creamy buttery complex in on a on a good short in a ...\nI mean it just doesn't that to Anita and that's a good chart and I if I buy it such or say\nThat's what I'm suggesting I achieved ... probably not the the way to go um well I I Will say so so this is not an expense when but for Corrado makes a really nice sort of ... that I I like and it's also under twenty bucks\nI'm so ... if you do a white would be where I'd go and it happens to be a great Thanksgiving pairing so that's coming up down the road\nOkay wonderful thank you I was taking copious notes while you were talking I actually have a piece of paper in nice oh you're a good student Leanne thanks I'm\nAll right thank you for your call sweetheart forty seven minutes after two o'clock well let's see if we can squeeze one more and before the break I think this one's going to be a good one for you this is Matthew incoming Matthew you're on WSBIU how are you buddy\nHey I was going on like you want to do at a tea and coffee coffee black and she sued lemon\nNice so what what kind of ... and the least you know what to do with\nUm usually I mean I like anything in green tea to orange ... she had to for black though\nNice or so when you say like a an orange like maybe an Earl Grey perhaps or a\nYes or like that are so\nCool um so that that gives me a lot of room to work I I Love that thank you for\nHelping me make up my life easy um you could really probably do anything from a sub block on the white side all the way to like a cab or an hour only on a on the red side um I Would probably based on what you're telling me I might start with um are you looking for more of a white recommendation or read or do you have a preference\nFor the ... and a cat or in areas you know once I go with already um but I don't like okay I don't like okay you\nDon't get that All right so here's what I'm going to recommend for you or there is a cool red bland called the fable list at a pass or a rubble is uh twenty three Ninety nine so under twenty five bucks that sort of my my wheelhouse or it is super rich Jeremy I'm ... and again and got that middle let you you probably enjoy\nUnbelievably again is called the fable list the fabled and if you were renting a fable um and and what was at the line is is that it's a it's a red blended a cab blend a and it has a generous copious amounts really I'd even say Marlo a super nitrogen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "20"}
