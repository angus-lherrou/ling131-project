mentally challenged people on television was talking to Franco Cuomo who's on that list as well\nAnd they were talking about recent shootings and mailed pipe bombs and freight said the lemon and there was another hate filled criminal just last week Kentucky white guy in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store\nAnd do we barely had time to what Barry had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they had the Muslim ban there is no white guy band\nWell there you have a my friends there's there's Don Lemon um we need a white guy bad to go along with the travel ban andme a Muslim ban because the biggest terror threat in this country right now is white men\nThis of course ignores all of the people of color protest marches antifa who inflict damage and harm on people of course the black lives matter\nA group but you see 'em\nWhat's interesting about this are noteworthy about it is this is what is really thought of non lemons not alone here he just happened to be the guy that set it\nBut that happens to be the driving impetus\nBehind much of extreme liberalism they certainly that is what's driving militant feminism angry women they think white men at the problem\n\nDon Lemon sad or Monday Night also told him he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nExplained away by people like you in the sense well they're cops and they mistreatment racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me the Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think it was just telling a wound to people stay squeeze almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk in the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas to thousands sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc Muslim Americans in fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\nAccording to Forbes magazine of the three thousand three hundred and forty two people to buy terrorists in the U.S between Nineteen Ninety two in two thousand Seventeen Islamic terrorists are responsible for Ninety two percent of those murders and you have Don Lemon on CNN says the problem\nIs white men we need a white men than there is no white guy ban\nBasically no one must ever blamed left no one must ever blame the news media mingle one must ever blamed the rest of the Democratic party for any of the attacks done by their rabbits like Occupy Wall street like black lives matter like antifa\nThe truth is it isn't Republicans running around doing these things [noise]\nIt is a bunch of deranged people who are out of their minds and I'm telling you\nIt can happen\nTo among the most feeble if there's just a steady diet of the negative\nUpon negative drumbeat

on CNN\nAnderson Cooper three sixty of the program a question the Senate John Kennedy was motivated by anti Semitism but also this obsession on the caravan in the invaders echoing language the

Trump considered drop a sellout precisely because he has a daughter to convert to Judaism that's not mentioned not Trump is ratcheting down his visa had been pedaled through the metal and here's the opinion of David Robin gr\nWe ought to go back and think about you know how Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma studying I'm Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd he ... he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of make of beat the drums or to go out and stop the terrorists all around the country tried to heal and it was a turning point as president say he was embattled when he went to Oklahoma City that turned his presence around with a very positive direction\nThis is how history revision has works\nThere David Ronald Reagan's saying Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after\nThe terrorists he\nDidn't start in America you know beat the drums to go out and stop the terrorists\nWell\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five in Minneapolis\nHere so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other they spread hey\nThey leave the impression that by their very words that violence is acceptable you ought to see you I'm sure you are now seeing the reports of some things that are regularly send\nOver the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nRight now who couldn't even talking about this Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox News ... some of the airwaves\nOr this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nBut the White House felt some have they have the issue of corrections and all we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's the way it meant by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were in camera gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this\nYou get right up but there's Clinton's zeroing in on it when his attempt to blame me\nBombed out somebody you say Clinton you didn't do that no he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of beat the drums in stark tell us all of them he tried to heal it was a turning this is\nAgain history revision is an extraordinary one more by this was a wolf blitzed\nAnd judge Jeffrey turban\nAnd judge Jeffrey to one\nLast night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI with the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing or Clinton was president he went to Oklahoma City was he delivered a beautiful speech it was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on a jury you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests see\nSo now there were no protests for a bomb and there is no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nTrump's guilty But Trump's at fault that the protesters are right why weren't there any protests back in those days all take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\nPrecisely because the left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse for it\nBut it also was a different time we're talking about it over twenty five years ago twenty two twenty three years ago and it it it was a much quieter and different time it was\nJust getting

issues that save the geo paid\nNow I I haven't seen the specifics of Senator Grassley is quote unquote report so I don't know\nIf he used the phraseology same with a GOP or\nIf that is the media as they are interpreting and reporting on um on on what grass\nElise words are\nBenefits difference Grassley save the geo ... that would that would indicate that grass lately I really do want to go there I don't want to assume Grassley said until I ... actually said I'm not going to even speculate though the way the media is reporting on of his save the GOP\nMeans it was over we were in we were I mean we were headed for the gigantic way we're going to lose everything and then that cabinet thing happened in a caravan thing I might save the GOP there are other people saying well if it was going to save a GOP it didn't because all of that momentum was interrupted by the pipe bomber and the synagogue murders\nIn Pittsburgh and that would have just destroyed any momentum I yeah I Love people in Washington and they're conventional wisdom okay so they are sitting there their businesses the News I'm unexplained mystery of their business is the news\nThey eat it they rule event they breathe it they rank grudge had tainted the eliminate it they absorb it it's news\nThey think everybody does it to a certain extent and so they get all hot to try and about things and they see the caravan might be helping Trump and they like it or don't like it doesn't matter and then they said that Kavanaugh situation the Democrats blew that\nSky high and said oh man this is really gonna help but then the pipe bomb and the swimming I shouldn't come along and they feel like their motivation or energy level focus on those two things is interrupted by it and they think everybody else's\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy and Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means which there'll be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nGetting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice\nA point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being sought and they no longer\nAm answered the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future and his life\nAnd they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess it's we need a ban on white guys from Don Lemon\nThey real murderers in America the real problem is white men we've got a Muslim ban we've got this bad we don't have a ban on white guys that we need a ban on white white guys white men have now become the primary issue in America according to the left\nAs ... by John Lennon\nSo we're we're just struck by many right given everything we got an capital but now drop it and move on the other things now Trump responsible for pipe bombs now Trump responsible for senator guy should Trump responds more Trump responsible for the airplane crash next week when they got around to that\nNone of it is real\nNone of the news is real it's all manufactured so what does it mean what does it mean that we're not getting any updates from the drive by media about all of these women were so mistreated by Kavanaugh\nWhat does it mean that the Democrats are not being asked by the media whether they support Kevin O's impeachment wise it's all been dropped\n\nWhy have the media given up investigating the story they obsessed over for nearly a month\nFor weeks September and October that's all the media talked about [noise]\nWhere's the follow up if Kavanaugh was as they say that story should not have gone away the women still suffered the women did not get justice Kavanaugh got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation will it doesn't exist because it was all made up about capital\nClassic Democratic Party media operation\nSo is the aftermath of the pipe bomb story and so as the aftermath of the Jewish synagogues story it's all media manufactured not the stories themselves in this case but the coverage the way it's being covered the fact that Trump is to blame Trump responsible all of that manufactured all of its designed\nTo destroy your energy optimism emphasis whatever you want to call it to vote and participate in the mid

nineties\nHis life\nSpan and pre electricity to going to the moon in his life he saw all of that he grew up on a farm had to go plow fields before school every day\nCome home after school work the farm and so forth and like all the stories everything they didn't sell is what they got to eat um\nHe was one of the first in is why they're going to the first to ah to go to college became a lawyer\nBut he\nCame from the horse and buggy days and no electricity to manned space flight landing on the motive saw it all and I remember\nI was I was home in Missouri I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after the program again so they Nineteen Ninety\nAnd he's around Ninety these these are close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so what what are the big thing is [noise] it was hard of hearing but it's not just couldn't here to radio easily and one of the big things being discussed on your program say immigration we called and pop\nPop you would not believe it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run\nThis was this was folks this was\nAll in back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days Ellis Island you immigration has been\n\nA polarizing subject to this country for as long as we've been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUm efforts to ... new arrivals from western Eastern Europe and he was\nTelling me that there were so many people who didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe average people as his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance [noise]\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying but back in the early Nineteen hundreds late Eighteen hundreds of controversy then was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration there were people opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity that come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what extent the day\nThe differentiating thing today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed and we have both political parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for lawlessness advocating for illegal immigration\nAnd then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it the idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship or amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the ah the Democrats or the American left today are are advocating and they're doing so on the premise that America is responsible for the economic plight\nOf these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources\nWe've gone around the world and taking what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so in liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy than somebody has to be poor out there and so therefore the American people are guilty\nOf something\nThere was an unequal distribution of wealth elapsed as in all of these countries in Central America and South America so poor compared to us and it's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion and the real purpose behind that is to transform America and to the kinds of nation that was never intended are found to be and that's the difference of the legal and illegal\nTo the subject has been around it's been controversial for as long as it\nYou will immigration subject has been around it's been controversial for as long as it has been happening but the idea that illegal immigrants have a legal claim on whatever they
