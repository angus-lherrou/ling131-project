it [noise]\nNo no no no no no no no no I clearly stated yesterday that Elizabeth Warren was one of three and went and one of four women that mounted and what they what was going to be\nA killer October surprise\nWarren was going to ride this DNA tests showing that she's Indian blowing up and the Republicans in the mid term and just like it blew up for Hillary gets blown up for Elizabeth Warren she made a serious miscalculation exactly [noise] exactly what I told you yesterday\nThese people think they live in their own little tunnel vision world and they have no idea that they are on the table anymore to dominate and create a news narrative anyway I'm going to get to that of course because not what I was going to lead whip today but I got a newscaster story here\nDisaster for Elizabeth Warren is all three networks mocked Native American claimed this is the last thing that she expected it happened the news media cannot carry her water\nHer excuses to flimsy what's really interesting about this is the news media has known all along that this is a bogus claiming they were more than willing to carry it they were more than willing to promote it propagated do whatever they could they knew full well that this thing is bogus and it was nothing more than a tempting political trick and they gave it their best shot\nBut she's too stupid the way she handled all\nThis and they couldn't maintain their support for her so it it's all followed by the wayside and within probably any presidential perspiration is that she had just like presidential perspiration is an avid not

Brian ...\nDepending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no\nI think I'm helping people\nI'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful that people don't even talk about but many of those forty eight hours you know where people that have no chance in some cases we look at Florida\nOr people that have no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names\nLook at Georgia governor many many races and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say that in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nOr some of the people I've endorsed have gone up forty and fifty points just suddenly endorsing in nowhere in that state does Donald Trump say he got me but an dressed the house being lost he doesn't even accept that premise a pie\nOffers it as a premise so they say if Republicans lose control the house with a ... do you believe you better responses but no\nI think I'm helping people that becomes a headline Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses house now the eight people tell you what oh that's essentially what he was saying no it isn't essentially you are miss quoting\nDonald Trump is not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing the need for excuses a pie he thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory but it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and somebody's going to blame him\nThis is why Trump never\nMisses an opportunity to talk to the media it's why he tweets\nOver and over and over again so now we got a little Bryan's daughter at CNN soundbite number one this was actually it was Sunday Morning I got I guess I was a mistake and I thought it would have happened yesterday Sunday Morning on his program reliable

it I like getting the point across I've heard you say many times that the economy isn't covered properly and it's not that the economy's not covered properly by these so called mainstream media and it isn't a we went up almost six hundred points yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere and\nThe economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore we do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk about on myself\nAnd what about the your your tweets are so far these people are saying we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting\nOh and I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that that's a way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on

hear people in the media speculate oh it could be trouble be removed after the midterms when mullet releases a report in ... will be Trump's going to have to be removed to report my all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end of this\nWe'll be running Congress before he decides to really end of this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein who is technically his boss at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not that it is made public it's always the Democrats do when the house\nThey're going to insist that Muller not conclude the investing particularly if he hasn't found any collusion of Democrats when the house they're going to tell us when we got time man we can all the time in the world keep digging\nWe don't need to report right now we were already won the house and we didn't mean your report so you keep digging\nHint hint you keep digging until you find that proof campaigned meaning since we're on the show you're not going to need any proof all you need to do is highly speculate that have happened we'll take care of the rest that's gonna be the Democratic message if they win the house\nIf the Republicans when the house while there's a whole\nNew ballgame in terms of what mother will do and how he will do it and whether he will\nAnd that wrap it up issue as report or not but there is no reason other than political reasons there's no reason for smaller to say or for anybody to leak that he's ready to deliver key findings\nNo reason to do that other than to have it used as\nA change agent in the upcoming mid terms specifically\nMuller is close around during judgment on to the most explosive aspects of his inquiry\nWhether they ever clear incidence of collusion between Russia and ... [laughter] believe me that one of a week long ago there isn't any of that and the second thing is one of the president took in the actions that cost to the obstruction of justice\nAnd Bloomberg goes on to say some things that make it look like they're pretending that there's even more being investigated besides collusion an obstruction but there isn't then they say there's the question of timing is critical monitors work won't be concluded a head of the midterm elections when Democrats hope to take control the house\nAnd and Trump's one party hold on Washington but this time line raises questions about the future of the pro itself Trump has signaled he may replace Jeff Sessions after the election a move that could bring in a new boss for smaller Rosenstein might also resigned re fired by Trump after the election but you notice here\nMueller's work won't be included a head on November six mid term elections when Democrats hope to take control that not every news story is written from the perspective of its impact on the Democrats\n\nAre the words Mueller's work won't be concluded ahead of them November six mid term elections when Republicans corn maintain control about ... would never think\nOf writing that this is out there to create the illusion that Mueller has been gardens and it's only a matter of time before the world is officially told at Trump polluted that's what they hope to create with this\nAnd the media will be helping and it will all the impact votes and again if there was going to be this gigantic blue wave that was not in doubt why would any of us would be necessary let me take a break what's what's next in the ...

so that'll that'll happen tomorrow and I I guess from talking about this is why I'm getting the emails about it but that's just\nTook it for about a ladies and gentlemen there's much here to continue on with the themes established in the in the first hour grabs soundbite number twenty six I referenced this none of Brazil she was on Fox today with Bill hammer\nNormally Donald Brazil occupies a chair over at CNN\nBut when it was discovered that she was funneling town hall question to Hillary Clinton in advance of a town hall telecast on CNN\nI think they ended their relationship with her and then she got her nose outta joined about solving a she wrote a book acknowledging that the DNC was playing a lot of games with the money and Reagan the primaries for Hillary and she didn't want any part of it and so she's I wouldn't\nSay she's a strange from from the Democrats used to um important to them to invaluable but but she's she has some shifting a loyalties here I guess\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho so the DNC the Democratic party who in her normal countenance would be out there so oh yeah boy wave Democrat's gonna win big gets it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she sounds\nSee how many days in a long time in politics I'm breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens why\nWe still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout democratic victory depends on turnout among millennials one on a farm millennials voted in the last midterm we also that and make sure that we get a paint way before we can get a blue tie we need these women to when they are wearing says\nI'm confident not over confident you asked me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats I Would talk Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so why would she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that\nWell because she has the freedom to say it she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it turns out the Latino are far more supportive of Trump at Republicans than anybody know according to recent polling data the Democrats\nSo you know according to recent polling data the Democrats are done\nAt the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans in Trump the reason they're stunned just because they believe that all Latino is\nShould despise anybody who is anti\nIllegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennials thing I think what that's about as voter turnout she mentions that here everybody talks about the millennials and young people and young people that\nIt just it never ceases to be the case that on a lecture day they don't show up they don't\nShow up in the numbers everybody thinks they're going to show up in\nAnd every cycle this plays out every cycle we're told the youth vote is fired up this time Mr Limbaugh\nThe youth vote their energetic they're energized they are motivated this is a new day they can't waiting in the same old thing happens they don't show up in the numbers that everybody expects them to she suggested that that may be the case here but Democrats failed to light a fire\nOn to the Latino thing bother to look at what the Latino thing what that actually stands for is immigration\nShe is I I'm I guarantee you like many other Democrats are done that immigration remains such a big positive winning issue\nFor Trump and the Republicans and it is it is the issue every Republican running for office eater incumbents or running for the first time needs to be focusing on this issue there is no way it can hurt them\nI'd been in they have to be on the right side about it let me take a brief time I'll

finds Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity\nFor twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen ... current helps put these numbers in that context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete picture of registration from those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes

D. cameras the motion detectors that glass break sensors all of that they communicate with the primary bay station in the house my wife I certainly wires to run that is so\nSo important so crucial in making this\nLast complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to hack it I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting wife connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips in their sensors in an detectors in the age of the cameras that come with every system that sends signals doors and windows are open\nAnd if you wander simply safe system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do when you finish\nYou will have an intimate knowledge an awareness\nOf your system it comes pre tested in pre configured all you have to do is installing or get something to help me it's no big deal you can do it in less than an hour but don't let that make you believe it's not serious it's deadly serious it is serious serious\nIt is just as effective in justice comprehensive as any other security system you would get that uses wires\nYou have access to their twenty four seven monitoring system service that's the only fourteen

so much rush I'm just an old white man that here in Huntsville, Alabama and shut up\nThat you won't ... well yeah and so you're you're demonstrating you or your arrogant white privilege here\n[noise] [noise] yes I Am ...\n[noise] yes I Am a [laughter] really a a a oh listen to your to the uh the article from I Believe it was ... that are thoughts that they're going to release the mall or a report or sometimes after the election and ready to that yeah I understand\nThat we don't believe that we're not going to believe anything Mueller anyway\nNow that's an interesting point too\nI mean unless the unless he implicate or the or\nAn Obama administration and Hillary Clinton and the DNC in awe of this investigation including with Russia which they evidently did then you know we're not going to believe anything that report says the [noise]\nUh I I just don't understand if the drop by media just go get it they're not going to feel as people that voted for Donald Trump\nFrom Donald Trump they don't understand is like a you know the magnificent seven uh both guys really you know when I came up here they didn't they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians were Aurora [noise] ah you know if they are\nNot lived a good life I wanted somebody to defend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country over the last uh eight to a a sixty years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is um\nI think we're very frustrated they haven't been able to and if they could they would the icing on the cake I think their primary objective\nNow is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democratic Party you know there's like combination coalition of minority here minority just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters\nSo the the focus I think is on ... up a first time participation\nUm and that's why this this enthusiasm thing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger some that's why I think that they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans have hate Trump\nI I think they they do move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake I think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in perusing\nThe news as I Do more and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about\nThe blue wave\nAnd there are some big rush don't fall for doing this on purpose or sucking you went in there making you think you're given up they're making you think they're trying to despair or you know trying to make you think you got it in a bag no they're not gonna ever pull\nThat off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have a media wide throughout the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I never I never believed there was going to be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and I if if I ended up being wrong so be it\nI'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough time for me to be worried about it but it is I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHave been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in when outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on even they're stupid traveled uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda but some things he hasn't been able to do it like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think of all of the things were true of nine people hate Trump regrets their vote\nA wish it had never happened regret that Trump is President Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if the Democrats are right about all this but they're not write about it\nI I I\nBut they're not write about it but I I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Boston is fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nAnd you ... with their their mentality that says winning is their birthright power is their birthright they're entitled but\nElections haven't been going their way how in the world stopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary water one and the first Trump would have never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now it's true\n\nThey thought they had it in a bag of two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized too there was one of the talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway out a little long next segment is
