piece shut it down\nI mean this this is is insane to this is a gesture in that suggestion is really insane and I\nI don't honestly people stop here's one of the other questions that I had here and I was very genuinely asking us and I don't expect serious answer some certain people's political realms because they're just not\nSerious\nSo one of their is you have Twitter Facebook you of Instagram is a staff have a bunch of different social media platforms there was another platform called the gab that's operates similarly to Twitter as I understand it but they promise no censorship right\nOr corporate censorship rather I think is a more appropriate\nPhrase to use now let me share this with you because this nut job murderer this anti Semite who shot up the synagogue he had accounts apparently on everything he had to count on Facebook and Twitter he was verified on Twitter\nHe had an account on gab okay and so this let me open this up\nSo\nPay pal band\nSocial media platform gab this is a headline after it was revealed that the synagogue murderer was a heavy user who posted often about his hatred of Jews\nAnd he posted a lot really awful awful stuff\nThe same stuff that he also posted he posted ... similar and same stuff on Twitter really awful stuff on Twitter ah he just awful so a spokesman for pay pal confirmed that the company canceled cabs account\n\nThey said that there are allowing the the perpetuation of hate violence or discriminatory intolerance\n\nAnd so they canceled their account and it's and there are other tech companies now as well that have been\nDumping or trying to de platform them a go daddy dropped gab they gave them twenty four hours to find a new host or completely just be platform from the the ... so now gab is I don't know if it's permanently or today said temporarily\nThe company posted a statement saying that we were systematically de platform by app stores multiple hosting provider several payment processors et cetera\n[noise] now I don't have a gab account I don't really know anything I don't know a lot about a gab other than I've never actually I don't think I've ever been on it\nUh it is something that it's\nSimilar from what I understand very similar to Twitter except they they don't have the terms of service they're they're just it's like a free speech free for all so you had pay pal stripe medium everybody's dropped a gab\nAnd they are\nLooking at any other so yeah they were all here's the thing though\n\nThis this murderer also had Twitter account he was on Twitter who was verified and he said the same stuff on Twitter\n\nHe said the same things the same ignorant awful things\nMeanwhile the guy the bomber Cesar ... uh the I'm going to say his name that guy he apparently was also on Twitter and Facebook where he posted ridiculous stuff and you also threatened to threaten people with death\nSometimes I get so many deaths I've already gotten ... death threats because of this stuff sometimes you never know which ones are serious and which ones are not so you just have\nTo send them all out what I don't\nUnderstand and the and the threats that had been\nReported prior on Twitter by the bomber they were ignored and the murderer who went and shot up the synagogue said some pretty awful stuff on Twitter as well apparently\n\nWhy is it that it is just I mean it's inconsistent\nThe treatment of Twitter Facebook and then this lesser known service gab were you at anti Semitic an insane remarks that were shared all of these services but why is only one penalize\n\nDon't understand that why is only one penalize am I missing something\nOne penalize am I missing something am I missing something came to mind is seen anything why is one being penalize that's what I don't understand when you have\nSort of what was the big need a scapegoat and they certainly don't want to use Twitter I mean they need some sort of scapegoat to show some sort of responsibility right I guess I have no idea\nYeah I don't know ... it's a little inconsistent it's incredibly inconsistent it's super inconsistent\n\nEd Ed just doesn't that doesn't make any sense is it really about\nThe idea of limiting the ability of\nNot jobs murders like this to spread their hatred or are they punishing a service\nBecause they think that it's a ... I don't know anything about the service I see stuff floating around on social media where they say oh so and so's right wing et cetera\nUh that's but that is that is I don't know I just why is that\nWhy is there this inconsistency and so\nI look also on what is still up on social media do you guys know the Boston bombers\nAccount is still on Twitter I just checked it a little bit ago I'm not going to say what it is but that's it and I went cross referenced it with a ton of other articles that talked about his social media ... that's it put her never took it down\n\nI had a guy threaten to shoot me in the head on social media\nTwitter ... kept it up there for a couple of days I didn't publicize that one because the ones that I think are more serious I don't publicize that that guy was like you're going to be shot in the head you know maybe I'll do you know all this stuff and um it's still up there even after I reported a ... times Twitter keeps up there for days they never take that stuff down\nAnd you also Louis Farrakhan up here\nThis is the stuff he treats by the way the stuff that he tweets and the stuff that does not job tweeted actually are almost verbatim where he was talking about the ... Jews and all this stuff that's like those are the phrases that they used\nFor instance Farrah Khan tweeted\nThis say ten of Jews that control everything and mostly everybody there your enemy this is another tweet to say ten of Jews and their allies fear being exposed and that is the role of the messiah to reveal the man of\nSin a and then he had the video just what last week week before where he said I'm not an anti Semite on the anti termite which that's horrible\nAnd this all is still ah do you know how Twitter responded they just took away as blue check mark guys that's all they did\nThey seriously took away his check mark and that was at\n... [noise]\nAnd this is where we are\nI'm I just I I have no words there is a\nReally vicious stick effort I think to control speech and I also think that there is an effort whenever you have a horrible tragedy that individuals who really don't care about limiting hatred they just want to control speech with which\nPeople whose ... policies they disagree they exploited and they use it for these and that's what it's all about\nThis just ridiculous so coming up\nNBC which we're going to get into next hour set on evidence\nTech completely discredited Michael I have an idea and his accuser\nAnd they've just didn't they didn't that all shed they had it for months they didn't share anything\nOr weeks at rather also The Simpsons or permanently deporting a minority from Springfield because social justice ... will have that for you a and a bunch of other stuff as well as we move on here\nWe'll have the latest developments that these other stories that are coming out to\nA between work and the kids in school and everything else and that it's becoming one of the busiest times of the year which is why I rely on a daily dose of super beats you keep up my energy levels naturally feel like you're dragging more than normal maybe it's a combination of how busy this time of year at this time of year and the change of seasons but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "30"}
