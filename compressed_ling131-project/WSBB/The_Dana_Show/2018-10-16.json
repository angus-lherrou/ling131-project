is one of the guys at CNN here are Trump's comments tonight calling the leader of the Confederate Army quote a great general multiple times\nWow wow [noise]\nThis is so ridiculous I'm the first off he was praising grant he was talking about how ah the point of the whole story was how\nAbraham Lincoln chose a guy from Ohio to beat Robert ...\nThat was the whole point of his story this is purposeful deception and it wasn't just\nThe CNN dude and all that I got more and more examples is so many more examples frail it wasn't just this guy was there was a ton of um\nNBC News that had to watch President Trump says Robert he leaves a great general during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible what they leave out is that he was talking about how Ulysses S as grant was better and that's why he was recruited to beat him\nAnd again going back to history Robert Daly was a West Point grad you can recognize that he was a good general\nAnd not agree with the cause for which he fought just like you can write going back to patent Romo pad and could recognize that rumble was a worthy opponent without endorsing flipping not to use them how are some of these people\nDiscussion today sucks because people choose party and tribalism over intellectualism your tribalism is making you stupid\nEveryone says Trump is turning things into an eighty awkward said no no no no I think media is complete ignoring of nuance and they're dumping of everything down to just the simple as most tribal is reduction is what is making everyone stupid\nI mean it went on and on and on so many examples collections whole collections\nA Washington Post quote Trump calls calls on blacks to honor him with votes in praise of Confederate General Robert ... that is so blatantly false\nHe was explaining\nHow Lee was respected as a lead up to how grant defeated him oh my gosh\nSome telling him\nAnd there are tons of other journalists who did the same thing Eric soldiers from ah has has a collection of media people but at the exact same thing all the people who were selectively editing his comments to feed the rage mob\nPhilip Rucker a say\nOver Washington Post as the same thing CNN David Corn\nSeven thousand Ohioans soldiers fighting for the union were killed during the civil war Trump praises Robert de ... who led the troops that killed him and Trump's Ohio supporters cheer not that's deplorable\nAre you serious\nIt's deplorable are you serious\nI mean they went over I mean all of these Rick Newman rubber Brent growth is all of these all of these\nPeople and as I said the whole point\nAnd he he and his actual remarks and I'm just ... he said quote it gave you he's talking about Ohio when Ulysses S grant he said\nUh he goes and it also give you a general who was incredible he drank a little too much you know who I'm Talking about right so Robert ... was a great general and Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia and he couldn't be Robert he and he was talking about battle after battle he said that he had all of his generals they look right there were at the top of their class at West point\nAnd one day it was looking really bad and Lincoln said you hardly just knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem and Lincoln said I don't care what problem he has you guys aren't winning and his name was grant general grant and he went in and locked and he knock the hell out of everyone\nYeah listen to this wasn't this is what they didn't put it in this was his worst his worth\n[noise] they didn't know how and one day it was looking really big and what did you just said you\nHardly knew his name and they should do to a gym he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nAnd only gives that I don't care what probably as you guys aren't winning [noise] and his name was grants general [noise]\n\nAnd he went in and he knocks well out of everyone [noise]\nAnd you know the story they should salute you and your kids use your money more\nHe's an alcoholic\nAnd let me just said [noise]\nI don't care who's an alcoholic frankly give me six or seven more just like [noise] resorted to win grant really judge ... from it was a good general and he's finally being recognized as a grudge ...\nSaid this is what he said and everyone's like oh my gosh she's praising Robert de leite again history Robert he ... he was a West Point graduate\nHe was he knew battle any new strategy he very reluctantly served the confederacy because he didn't want to bear arms against Virginia he wasn't procession he wanted the union just said he wanted the ... the United states you need to stay together\nAnd he agonized agonized over this decision for days and it made his superiors about tear their hair out because they wanted an answer from him super fast and he wasn't going to give it super fast\nAnd so they got grant who was also\nAmazing general any proof better they have more resources and he out strategize lead but this idea\nYou were somehow endorsing someone by recognizing that they were good at what they did is ridiculous let me give you an example I think Brock Obama is a fantastic speaker now does that mean I endorsed his policies\nHow stupid or some of these people is that what that means I think Bill Clinton is probably the best Democrat at retail politics today and maybe of his generation does that mean I endorse his policies no this is how narrow minded and ridiculous people are\nNow to this point it gets even sillier now hold up because you know how somebody comes out and you know there's there's news about something so the media went and found his grants like or no grant sorry leads to great\nGreat great great burger they\nSo far removed they called them a collateral ancestor have you heard of those yeah collateral ancestry\nIs like if it was his brother or sister and it's like they're the brothers sisters Gregory Gregory Gregory grandchild\nThat can so they found this dude whose name is Rob ... and he's a Reverend I don't know and he I Love these people who are like I'm going to make a statement and to get some attention so Robert release\nGreat great great great great great great\nNephew whatever his collateral ancestor came out said quote my response to Donald Trump and his comments last night about my collateral ancestor Robert ... [noise] so and the\nUh\nSpoke out and said that he was you know the it basically said I don't support robbery lead cetera et cetera and you know whatever that's fine he could not I mean there are definitely people look it's not a proclamation either way the whole point is that is not what Trump was talking about is what the media was saying that he was talking about\nNot what Trump was talking about is what the media was saying that he was talking about\nGolly I like how they find the guy you know my word [noise]\nI just I Can't even as just it's so ridiculous this back and forth media ridiculous and uh so okay so coming up the Portland mayor triples down Ted Wheeler\nDefending the antifa protesters last weekend who created that who who costs thousands of dollars damage to ah Portland portly Indians cars\nAnd block the roads pay we got that for you uh also how the media is rushing to the defense of Elizabeth Warren after her I actually am a Native American think completely backfired we have that for you as well and we'll be bringing those two in the meantime\nYou need to I Want to sort of I read an article the other day that was talking about the nitrates and be and it was actually\nI don't remember where it was if it was a ... piece or if it was a Wall Street journal piece I'm going to find it now I\nHad last night 'cause I actually read it last night [noise] um but anyway it's it was discussing how dietary nitrates effect of the body and I'm like this is literally what super beaches science is based on and and they really just become more widely known in Nineteen Ninety eight when these two I'm a\nScientist actually got a no win a Nobel Prize over their studies of how nitric oxide impacts the body and I dietary nitrates\nHelps to kick start the bodies production of nitric oxide out of all the food fruits vegetables and such are out there be are loaded with nitrates but there is one problem you have to eat them raw because if you cook the beat the heat destroys the nitrate than the beat and the nitrate is what you want\nAnd so superb each develop this cool dry and process so that they condense the beats down into a powder\nAnd somehow and I can't explain it it takes the dirt tastes away because I didn't ... but I can drink super beach\nSo the regular flavor is just in the best way to describe it as a mild kind of earthy Barry flavor you can also get like cherry its own after all there is no they don't add sugar and all this stuff to it the black cherry it's again natural it tastes legit like cherry juice if you love cherry's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "16"}
