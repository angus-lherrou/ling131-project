Rachel Mitchell noted that she did not name cabin on 'til now\nUntil now um\nApparently Emma brown at the Washington Post because remember Dr Ford gave the Washington Post her therapist notes but she would not give the committee that's determining if she if she is looking to report information about Brett Kavanaugh the committee that's making a determination as to whether or not have and I was going to be on the Supreme Court she's refused to give that committee her therapists notes\nI Wonder why well lemme brown over at the Washington Post noted that Ford did not name Kavanaugh and any of the notes\nThat's why\nSo she provided the Washington Post with our therapists notes but the committee making a decision on the actual nomination of the Supreme Court justice she refused to give than her notes but wants them to consider the fact that her no she says corroborate her testimony\nBut she they can't see the notes but just trust that the notes corroborate everything that she's telling them but you can't see the notes literally that is what the lay of the land is with the Washington Post says she didn't mentioned Kavanaugh\nShe was not the only time cabinet ever came up was after the news broke that he was the nominee he was not ever mentioned in her notes\nThat Michel ... outlines there was NO NAME and the twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME given under twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\nAnd it took thirty six years for him to for his name to emerge and so that's I mean I I just I don't know I'm\nMitchell notes quote Dr Ford testify that she told her husband about a quote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she informed her husband that she was the victim of physical abuse at the beginning of our marriage she testified that by the time she was referring to the same incident\nSo forward um Mitchell says at Ford was changing her description of the incident to become less specific\nUm Mitchell says she noted that there was no memory of who invited her to the party how she heard about it really where it was how she got to it and um she did not know how she got home she did not know if she made a phone call she did not know she talked to anyone else at there after ...\nUm Mitchell also noted quota according to her letter to Dr Feinstein or to Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to other party goes downstairs well she was hiding in a bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nUm she also noted Mitchell also noted that the number of people at the party was inconsistent and kept changing uh originally there were four boys at the party and that was and then there were four boys and a couple of girls\nAnd their and that's that's what the that's the the trouble is and\nMitchell noted that her reasons for coming forward are inconsistent\nAh she said that a missile nose call it the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post was the first person other than her therapist or husbands who she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker she testified that she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and the president she did not contact the Senate however because\nShe claims she did not know how to do that yes she does not explain how she knew how to contact representative and issue but not her senator\nOr the she can't recall and this was what kept coming up with Michel she apparently took the her polygraph the day of her grandmother's funeral or right after her grandmother's funeral and\nAh the reason that Michel focus so much on that is because she says quote it would be inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who is grieving\nBecause polygraphs are already so unbelievably unreliable that's why they're in admissible in a court of law as any sort of evidence\nUm she also there was all a win win ... Michel noted that there was some discrepancies in terms of the effect that the trauma had\nAnd she doesn't know if it was because you know the lawyers are affecting us or what it was but does she noticed there were there were twelve rather large inconsistencies and all of that\nAnd that the post article says that\nAnd that the post article says that Kavanaugh isn't named and in the therapists notes\nBut yet for wants to the Senate Judiciary committee the committee to believe that Kavanaugh was named in the notes that she says are her biggest piece of evidence corroborating her story\nYet she won't give them the notes so that's huge she also doesn't know if during the polygraph there was a video or audio recorded and they have no idea what questions were asked\nSo this is why progressive or just attacking Rachel Mitchell um relentlessly right now so I you know I it just it's I'm I'm pretty ... it's just um inconsistent\nSo when I hear people like Lisa Bloom say well there is evidence and there's testimony the testimony is inconsistent and that's according to the the third party that was brought in\nThere isn't any evidence to corroborate any of this information there isn't even to the ... named witnesses don't even corroborate a the named witnesses are actually disputing the of events and the\nAlleged occurrence so all of that and they're doing so on record under penalty of felony which uh that's that's pretty significant\nThat's pretty significant\nSo now they're ... they're Democrats or further moving the goalposts because the whole cabinet as a rapist isn't sticking Kavanaugh's a serial rapist isn't sticking\nHim hosting gang rapes isn't sticking so now they're trying to say oh well he was not consistent or he was um not truthful when he was discussing about his alcohol consumption so now they're moving to alcohol consumption\nThe rape charges aren't sticking so that's the new thing that's what they're doing this week and they're going to spend all week trying to shore up that new talking point and the relocation of their goal posts we're going to talk about that coming up as well uh initially a cabinet third accusers holy not credible we'll discuss that\nAnd a Kanye West was I was a ... you know Chris Evans the guy who plays Superman I was so fascinated because of the title white man Chris Evans says that a black performer is an intelligent because he doesn't share the white man's viewpoint", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "02"}
