around the Sean Hannity show what Speaker Gingrich how are you\nI'm great how are you guys doing were reading what greetings from Colorado I'm Sean Amos just figure I actually want to take a minute and talk to the\nParents and grandparents out there of millennials and young generation X voters we as parents and grandparents\nCannot be complacent if these are adult children or grandchildren are not shown any interest in voting\nUm we need to do all we can do to educate them on the importance and the seriousness of this election and all that is at stake\nAnd Sean I've been using your talking points to convince my adult children that every single vote is important and what's at risk if they don't vote and here in our house we turn to boats into three to five and then possibly even more because our kids took the message to their friends their college classmates\nAnd some of them ended up voting as well so I'm a couple of weeks ago I spent three hours on the road driving a mail in ballots to my child has a student at University of Colorado just to make sure that that one single vote is cast and counted so\nHey everybody do whatever it takes to get their vote in um offered to drive them to vote ... percent pay for their overpay for FedEx to nail that athletes here a\nMail in ballot to be to to make sure that it gets counted and trust me the future them will take us\nWell thanks for the call the Sherman\nOaks every parent who's not serious or making sure that the children and making sure who can understand the issues are going to be voting on it but that's that's a great state confuses me\nAppreciate the call thank you we go to Arkansas Mary Beth on the Sean Hannity show which Speaker Gingrich how are you\nI'm great thank for taking my call what's going on or you\nHi I Am a grandmother and I'm you know this caravan coming over\nWhat bothers me is they just let people go in and they never make their their court date and my grandson was sent home because his inoculation a record was not brought up to date did they just let these people and without any inoculations I mean why the CDC or somebody getting upset about this\nWell listen I I I Want to be very clear 'cause I think a lot of people um I I think that's almost been used as like a scare tactic they people let me tell you what I think Mr Speaker see if you agree with us\nYou know I think the Ninety nine percent of people that were in a caravan they see America as the land of milk and honey and opportunity which we kind of take for granted sometimes as Americans and I'm sure that Ninety nine point eight percent of them are probably good people that just want a better life\nUm we can't vouch for any of those people in terms of other enemies of America that mix themselves into that group\nThe idea that we're going to have five seven fourteen thousand whatever the numbers are different estimates room everybody just get to our border in charge across a there is no respect for American law our constitution our sovereignty or we don't know we need to be able to vet people\nI Believe in a border wall with the door because uh we just want to make sure the people that come to this country can sustain themselves and secondly I Want to make sure that they're not enemies of this country we can that but that's all it's for the safety and security of everyone that is a citizen here\nHousing starts basically right and I think what people feel the ... the\nThe grief is short period of American immigration which really made a huge Jordan or a country that we are the period began um when I was on welfare state to people who came to America came to America expect him to work and they came to America expecting to learn English\nAnd uh I take it as the welfare state grew in his liberalism grow all of those basic patterns are really greedy people should they became American ... to ... to one side\nIn American ... to put to one side by people who had no interest in the United states was all about\nYeah back to our phones mark is in Hudson bill on the Sean Hannity show with Newt Gingrich how are you\nHey Sean is calling us just bigger pleasure to talk about what's going on\nYeah I just want to ... with a\nCouple of other callers said it is it's just so important to vote or you know my son who's twenty chicks we've been watching ever since President Trump came down the escalator announced that he was running for president and I watched your show Fox News been keeping him hosted in educating him on\nA true our differences between the two parties and whatnot and they get these younger folks out to vote is just so critical in crucial I'm there live their livelihood and their lives are going to be ultimately changed\nIn in a way that you know I'm fifty six years old he's twenty six I got a twenty eight year old so I'm their lives my grandchildren are ultimately going to be changed and kind of direction that is just going to be so incredibly different than what we're enjoying right now with with President Trump\nSo it's just in my eyes are so important to get that younger voter out to vote and vote for their future\nWell it's hard to get that through the young people to be very blunt about it in young people have a very different perspective in politics is usually not their first love uh I think I was a bit of an anomaly in love with politics at a young age and I know Newt Gingrich was as well more of a historian professor but [noise]\nUm [noise] I think that this you know to get young people to realize that there's a lot is at
