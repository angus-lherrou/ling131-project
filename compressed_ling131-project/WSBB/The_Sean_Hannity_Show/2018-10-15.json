she has no water right now because she was in hurricane my oh wow yeah they've been out of power to run the generator they've been out of power since about Wednesday and now they have a social service\nBut she thinks she thinks there's some trick ratio either turn it off and turn it on and turning it off and turn it on so they're limiting the amount of people\nThat are all I mean you've seen the ... there's been an aging status say I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though when you start looking at the eye of that storm and where it hit how close it had it could have had to like a major metropolitan area and it wasn't\nJust twenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this was a huge hurricane\nYeah my brother lives near Panama City\nAnd how is he he's doing great okay or his house survived good but we're all\nYou know thinking I kept telling him like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and you tell them to evacuate only two days beforehand and he did it did them morning of the hurricane yeah Marsha Blackburn aren't we yes um\nBut you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like twelve feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOkay so so so if it was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about this though so if your house is twelve feet off\nThe ground right every time that you pull into your driveway you're getting your stepson\nIs true of me is make sure way on your dollar [laughter] because you're going up and up and down a Beth is in Tallahassee as Andrew said hello there Beth\nHi Ken so do you have Internet access is everything goodbye you\nWe do not have Internet uh we have body cell service\nAll right so without the Internet\nWhat do you miss the most\nOh my gosh I'm probably social media\nFacebook that I heard Facebook in the back right after\nFake I my daughter and my husband are here with me there aren't that um yeah I I I went to make a dinner last night and I thought oh I've got the rent yeah get away [laughter] I Can't look it up [laughter]\nSorry Karen I have to have a Mac and cheese again 'cause I can read the ... okay let's just let it All right and then\nWe're cutting everything on the grill it that that's really interesting as well\nRight and and or cooking everything on the grill it that that's really interesting well you know that it's healthy right or you know kind of kind of we just got a great that died out the window [laughter] during the hurt and\nAll I did was eat it was like I had the nerve but lengthy\n[laughter] that's okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts and our prayers goes to everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nUp the coast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speakers once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody getting them have the thing that everyone should have and I'm like do I really need one and what would I use it for\nYou know it's a really good question because it's one of these gadgets that initially when you get it you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic is going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and then you start moving up the actual long so then you say turn on the lights\nAnd you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will lock the lights will go into night mode and then suddenly on the smart speaker next year end table some white noise is playing to sue the you to sleep\nWith all that happen automatically\nKnow of course not you know that [laughter]\nIf they like you to think that but you have to you have to buy all the gadgets along the way right\n... you got to buy the lights the smart lights and the smart locks and then you have to program those but it's not very difficult to program it\nUh they were thermostats that like the ego be in the nest that work with the Amazon Echo so that this way if you're sitting on the couch and you don't want to get you lazy but up and you can say you know turn the air down to Seventy six or turn the heat up to sixty six or whatever it may be\nAnd so it takes a while for you to get indoctrinated into it so to speak or no pun intended with these smart speakers but once you\nOnce you get it I think that you'll understand\nLike this is exactly how it's supposed to work I'm going to put together some links for you over at commando dot com\nAnd so that this way you can select the right Amazon Echo and also we have a couple of articles about some gadgets like I just mentioned that you might want to tie into the Alexa environment and\nThanks for the update on what's going on with you and your family are so pleased at you and everybody's came through with the just

[laughter] so it's\nKind of like that same thing with this mobile passport and so when you get off the plane and ah when you land back\nAnd so when you get off the plane and ah when you land back in the states just look for a sign that says mobile passports here in Phoenix\nUh they actually didn't have a sign and I had to ask one of the border patrol agents like you know where's the mole passport

the moon first and then the router\nBut you also want to make sure that you are getting the speed and so what happens is you're going to send out of paying\nA painting is how fast response that you get back from a testing server and as far as download and they'll close speeds they're given in bits per second higher numbers are better okay and download speeds there's typically going to be much much faster than up ...\nAnd you want to compare these numbers that you get again speeds at your Internet service provider promises you and you want to run multiple tests over several days do it in

you always want to make sure you use a wire connection for more accurate results 'cause why if I could be your wife I network and not necessarily the speed as I mentioned do multiple tests or check

that way there was one report that said Harvard says they didn't hire because I've been to other words they were building her as a better term\nAs Native American and if it's one in five hundred and

really care\nListen if you're in ... left if you're you know part of some far out right wing radical group you know what\nEverybody needs to just knock it off because somebody's going to get killed here\nAnd I'm Serious as it is if you find yourself your family in any of these situations things in my advice to get out of the way\n'cause there are a lot of dangerous people out there and the fact that we didn't have police come in faster in Portland I think it was a huge mistake we saw the assault on these drivers that was ... what a week ago and these congressmen and women they need to calm the waters\nOn every side and tell everybody you know knock it off I mean listen to this is just one will show you the video tonight but this is out of control [laughter]\n\n\nOr you know the idea [laughter]\nBy the way Bernie Sanders wouldn't condemned the violence as we can I have I condemn it all I don't care what side you're on\nIt just as ... out of control innocent people are gonna end up getting hurt here are twenty two days out of this election remember I said that one of the things that Democrats will never say Israel when we're now we're gonna impeach forty five but just don't do any voters don't Tony Tony\nMember and then Maxine Waters they keep telling me not to say it but I'm going to fade and Pete's forty five and ... forty five\nShe's she's honest about it she's telling everybody here we're going to do it but they're telling me not to say because it's not going to help us in the electorate and twenty two days now we have a piece of Democrats are being advised not to speak about their unpopular open border policies that is very difficult to win on immigration\nIs there was a memo obtained by the New York times and left wing consultants for the center for American Progress that's but that's the group and uh the think tank third way by I think Democrats running for reelection spend as little time as possible talking about immigration and the immigration issue\nWhere more than a one and a half million immigrants were admitted to the country every year\nAnd they reported sanctuary attacks packs a punch just a four page memorandum put together by the center for American Progress and uh yeah\nGo shared about a dozen briefings with Democrats in ... so they can't talk about anything they want to do mean tempered that for you let me lie anyway we can never tell you what we plan on doing what we know what they plan on doing endless investigation impeachment of Trump open borders which they won't talk about impeachment they won't talk about\nYou have shifty shifty announcing plans for nearly a dozen brand new anti Trump investigations in the house alone if they get control the house it's why I'm telling you if every house race if you don't get out in twenty two days I don't care what Democrats name is on the ballot\nIf you vote for the Democrat you're voting for below sea you vote for democratic Senator McCaskill Donnelly Heitkamp pastor Nelson a you know this woman out in Arizona whatever her name is that thinks Arizona's a crazy\nCinema I mean you're you're voting for Schumer it's the same thing you don't vote it's a half a vote for the Democratic senators and house members\nAnyway Washington Examiner points out Trump is likely to face at least five new house investigations are caucus led by Nancy Pelosi will lead to ruthlessly prioritize the most important matters first he said\nAdam Schiff member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence listed five different investigations he says that the Democrats will start once they take over and one that will prove his charge that Russians are laundering money for property is owned by the Trump family\nAnd the intelligence will assess the work of Robert Mueller et cetera et cetera I mean it just is never going to end\nEver they don't care about the the country of the future of the country or the way Hillary says in an interview Bill Clinton

sexual misconduct man no no but I Do I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with the White House intern some today has said he should have stepped down but\nReally just sat here you know she's defending him all she wants but that doesn't address Juanita Broderick Kathleen William Paula Jones and are saying the bill to not abused his power how can you say he's an intern in his classic workplace sexual harassment because he's\nWorkplace sexual harassment because he's got all the power he's the president or whatever I mean I don't know why Hillary so defined on the issue but she is\nUm so we got the ... let me tell you what's going to happen on twenty two days because I think this was important we have a CBS News battleground poll showing that the house races are in a statistical tie\nMy advice to you is to think three weeks from tomorrow you're going to turn on the TV and get bad news because maybe that will motivate you and the agenda simple impeach investigate open borders eliminate ice they want their crumbs back they won Obamacare what else do you really need to know\nAnyway they find that the battleground states the race for control the house is now within the margin of error which means a statistical tie\nThe same CBS survey finds that for Democrats to when they have to rely on voters who say that they're going to vote this year but did not turn out in the twenty ten or twenty fourteen midterms\nIf the elections were held today Democrats would stand to win two hundred and twenty six seats they claim more than two hundred and Eighteen needed for the majority of Republicans winning the remaining two hundred Ninety but the margin of error and each of those it's tight why

V. I. L. GB T. Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are the candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who are told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented\nSo I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia and that's going to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp\nTelling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia\nAnd said I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants and adding that it would be a lawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in the gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Kristin a cinema but she's going up against Martha ... one of the important racist that we're following and how she uh had referred to our own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and\nAll the Washington Examiner apparently found emails that show cinema herself inviting a prominent group\nI'm not making this up of I'm ready for the Washington Examiner of feminist which is\nIn Arizona called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day in a protest the war in a march in two thousand and three I guess that would be the same war that her opponent Martha McSally was risking her life it and fighting for\nAnyway the cinema campaign would not say why she invited the which which is er clarify why she thought members of the cold deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning war and peace the which is in question it should be noted claim to practice only non violent magic\nCinema encourage the which is to wear colorful clothing come ready to dance toil in stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth\nAh I don't even know what to say [laughter] [noise] anyway the people Arizona you're paying attention\nOr we have a breaking tape that we're gonna that Claire McCaskill's team is going to want to pay very close attention to\nThat last week we showed you the tape project very toss with uh the campaign surrounding ... news the former governor of the state of Tennessee and now is running for the open Senate seat of Bob Corker Corker but thank goodness Marsha Blackburn is now pulled out a fourteen point lead in the latest polls she was down for a little while\nA lot of people were concerned about it but I think now that they see that reticent staff has basically saying he's saying one thing to the people in Tennessee and planning to do something very differently\nBut where do you see the tape that we have tonight as it relates to Claire McCaskill another important red state Democrats Senate race that's going on member you vote for Claire McCaskill you might as well vote for Schumer you vote for any democratic congressman you might as well vote for ... if you stay home because you don't feel like voting and you being lazy well that's a half of Oprah ... Schumer\nI let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he has dispatched his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here and it gets almost more bizarre by the sec and now\nThe allegation has banned that the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day the Turkish government had suggested that ... was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi hip team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to it on known destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today has been hero some reports claiming that cause show these murder was recorded but to Dayton audiotape know videotape\nNot even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues saying an absolute saying it's absolutely short 'cause she'll be was killed by anyone that can't say it let alone the Saudis now this just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal cause show gave this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analyst former U.S treasury attached to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years or she along with dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent\nAuthor as well as the ... best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nYes and I lived there for us to starting to counteract that I needed something like this ... and the reason I guess it's because when the president that this morning that he's sending secretary I'm tired of hearing that the secretary of state when it if you keep on world certainly in the government can't at all\nOf state when it does these people in the world certainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fly halfway around the world um I I Do is incredibly serious done and that the\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if the reports are deeply believe and we're still going to have to because if if the records out there is what what comes out or is that the Saudis are cleaning some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to clean the senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how was your does know until now because it shows how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat doesn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that\nI haven't this report we'll see what happens when secretary on pay for them and let the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this end satisfy President Trump the secretary Pompeo you know they also have an audience and the and the Congress the Senate but they're also accountable to mind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president\nThere's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually the very locally um I'm supportive of the relationship I don't agree with senator call for a number of reasons that I could go into why I think the relationship is is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says we\nNeed to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive a movement away from their big finance form is just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin supposed to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening stickier yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any uh there there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S then bonds you know I mean this is getting more bizarre buy them in and out of somebody in this particular case walking the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely show they're really two aggravating factors here why do you already brought up the fact that this happened in a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that bridge every single out of a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well I mean aggravating is is probably an order signed enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage ... the fact that this individual aka so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nHighly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's a sign that said way back would see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now what we do need the Saudis there's this is not as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where honor razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump gets that ... I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veiled threats that they were going to respond you\nKnow we were supposed to be responding to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah to yeah just to see the the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they lied to the president on this\nYou know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince had called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we do not know about it looks like they have like the president I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an ... was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the\nIn Saudi Arabia on the air and well okay you're going to happen I mean\n... there's been a women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting and driving in cetera and being told how to dress\nOr being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up of you left if you went out and public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under Sheree there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually saw him last year\nWasn't modernization and Saturday we saw it when that being able to drive we saw the the what the wrote that the\nGovernment that I had to where it's called the ...
