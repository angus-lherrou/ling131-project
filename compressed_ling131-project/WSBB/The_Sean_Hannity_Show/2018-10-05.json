America I mean how is it the Republicans always support Ruth Bader Ginsburg gun and Justice Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nThen Republican nominee to get just get bull legit\nThat does it matter if there's any corroborating evidence\nYou know one thing is I'm watching Susan Collins this speech was so well thought out\nBased on facts and the standards that she uses to evaluate important issues maybe that's why she kept to herself pretty much the whole time nobody knew what she was going to do\nOn the role of advice and consent on the madness and the circus that has broken out in this country\nAnd um I I have I I'm frankly we never run an entire commercial free our unless it's really important news and we did that where you are beloved audience because it was something that I wanted everybody to hear\nThis was a moment in history what has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in those ...\nWhat has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country you cannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence weighed judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhat really realize today is I don't know her well she doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody of interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect\nThe the systematic she walked every American through hard decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was\nObvious she missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this\nProcess did all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as an hinged they'd been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate holes at this point Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on a news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked us at ... well what are you know about Susan Collins and you'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years ... tomorrow I start my twenty third year in the Fox news channel\n[noise] well uh you know I'm I'm In a\nPolitical system this deteriorating\nI think what you saw today somebody step forward to maybe said at the biggest winner of the speeches the judiciary because there was a wholesale attack on the independence of the judiciary one at all costs what you saw the day was a person embracing the rule of law knock the role of the mob what you saw today was a woman\nNot being intimidated which you saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being save a strong woman which you saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country and I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward\nBut this is as close to McCarthyism as out forever witness in my life\nAnd if anybody turned it around and it was senator Collins\nAh you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came when they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh I don't think any of us will forget anytime soon the things that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that\nRemember the accusation by Julie sweating it was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that that judge Kavanaugh and others\nWere routinely drug in girls lining up in halls gang raping them and it happens frequently\nAnd I know that some people brought up the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night how was one supposed to act if you're innocent to the charge of drugging teenage girls and participating in gang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but\nI Would think if you're innocent it is one of deep anger and and the frustration Eighteen days ago nobody bought any of those the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise] well yeah I think I think most Americans so a man who was\nFighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this\nWent through a logical explanation of based on a calendar that very few people in the world case except him and his dad and just the wanted everybody know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life I'm not evil and I I think he reacted consistent would be an innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here\nWhen the sweat Nick allegation came out it\nWas breaking news allegation number three and a very new and\nEvil level right so I thought I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party or where people were drugged and raped and go to too much less than that made no sense ... call Susan she said this sounds bad and I said yeah Susan is going to be this way for a while to come\nRead it here's my take on it and being in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge this doesn't have the ring of truth she said you know that makes sense why would anybody keep going back and put themselves in that situation and and the friends not tell anybody and you've gotta remember is ... and she worked through the process you took each allegation on its own she went through\nAll the major decisions have judge Kavanaugh and spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a ... every I think they should be in every civics class in the country\nEvery high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins explanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am\nAnd what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election and thirty two days\nTo me senator or look at\nYour when Senator I Know how close you are to Senator McCain right and who recently passed away and I I've always admired him for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for president in oh wait over ... it was the right decision then and I stand by of the day\nI had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated\nAnd I remember he said that how would these people on radio and TV\nAnd you know I understood Senator McCain that's you know he kind of had that side of him and I knew it really well\nUm but he also talked in that speech to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last Eighteen days political the sounds of Alice box\nI mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habits are the best thing you can do to stop this and the futures deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats they won't power too bad if what it says and say listen I I you know I went to the record\nThe allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape the serial sexual predator he is a very reason logical judge I looked at everything they said about him\nI compared it to the facts and I'm voting yes here's what I Want the voters to do the voters to remember\nWhat the Democratic Party will do to get power and that they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remember this America do you really want these people in charge of your government [noise]\n[noise] well I think that's a great question you know there's something you mentioned earlier I saw I I never know Susan Collins that well I Know that the Republican Party\nIs not a model out for dinner if you want to and I'd love to I actually\nI I Know is embodied today that I had no idea the thorough in his under which she makes her decisions and I are all that time I respect I I really have a deep respect I Want everybody to have their own mind that I'm not even a Republican I'm a conservative for reasons that I hold passionate and dear\nWell you mentioned something earlier that this was a profile in courage for her right in as much as we you've been outside of than the holes in the Senate and you see what's going on there and all the protesting and Maine is not exactly an a an expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and influence\nOr and groups are pledging now to to vote her out of office and destroying her and I'm like did anybody listen to what\nSenator college just said that anybody want to listen I don't think anybody wanted to hear what she said because it was the single most thorough case for for how any senator or congressman should make a decision\nAgain a good example for a civics class to look at it in terms away senator should act but let's talk about the politics for a moment [noise] okay I talk a lot about what America get only because had tried to save the system\nTo be on those votes but I mean I Know but but you know you more than made up for it\n... I don't think anything to make up for I really ... for you to disagree with me I'm not going to run my life around being somebody\nI'm not going to end my life around what the hell Hannity things no way or another to be honest with you I'm going to be treated me aren't you truly you yes or Leno wouldn't expect anything about\nSusan Collins she's a moderate pro choice Republican from New England that represent say party a that used to exist in New England and greater numbers\nShe is a fiscal conservative she voted for the tax bill she's a social moderate and she will do things you won't like in the future but whatever she does will be thought out and reasons but here's why I appreciate you talking about Susan Collins today\nShe has come as close to anybody in my lifetime of saving the republic from the abyss because we're headed down where nobody even want to be a judge in the future if Susan had legitimize this got help the Senate confirmation\nPrior to ... she's she said it it's been in a rapid decline for Thirty years they've tried it but I've got a new senator um okay\nI don't think this would have happened I don't think I don't\nWant to reshape that but I I Will do something without big just just for a second okay I'm going to send me on every year and have the politicians do probably\nUh I'm fine uh you know I'm fine uh if you can ... and helps as they are going to try to destroy her now she comes from a purple state a President Trump last name but he points he wanted to second congressional district the main politics are different than they are in South Carolina and she was not about main herself she was about America", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "05"}
