us I mean\nLook you know I I Will get it and if so do you know what you know what you're going to get yet I don't know like yeah\nAll right well a couple of things might want to look at it I mean of course you know there's the iPhone and we've got the X as in the the seven plus is actually a good by right now but since you're the type a gal likes to hold on to things like you know you'd probably still have your shoes from the seventies\nIs that new you did I just knew it no you did\nThat black St Clair where the one year and you say I Know\nIt's I I was looking at some boots that I have and I thought you know what they are out of style but I still like um I Can't help but uh but you know of course you've got the Google Pixel three the Samsung Galaxy you know ... and a lot of this depends upon how you're going to use the phone and if you find yourself like you said being ... and start using all these apps\nIs that if you're an Android take you know of course you're going to stick with Android\nAnd then if you're apple you know take a look at a take a look at the iPhones we have some smartphone comparison charts up on the site and you might want to check those out um for those of you who have not\nYou know check your name to see if there's something that you could be finding on line as far as missing money we've got that tip over a commander dot com that's K. O. M. A. N. D. O. dot\nCom I had a quick question so both my parents have passed away if I if I were to search for their names\nOn them is the money and I'm next to Ken\nWould I be able to access that money or you're going no you're going to have to sort of farm okay and probably provide you know an official death certificate right uh but that's actually a really good point because you know if you go there to just don't type in your name type and other people's names you can search all fifty states\nUh you know and it's funny because that we bring this up because just this past week and that I was working with amber on our four one K.\nAnd a gentleman who worked for us who had passed away probably six or seven years ago is four O. one K.\nIs astronomical\nAnd I and I so I sent that back to ... you know somebody needs to tell his next of can you know that we that way but that's also how money can be quote unquote missing because it's just sitting there\nGenerating a return year after year but that's a really good question and there are other sites that you can check and again you want to go to a commander dot\nCom for that tip [noise] All right let's talk about their works relieves like many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps jihad muscle cramps in your legs and do you have them in your feet\nTo experience relief do what I Do you want to use their works relief fast acting films grade gets their works relieve today the pain relief aisle at your local pharmacy or at their works relief dot com once again that Web address is there are works relief dot com [noise]\nAll right now is a really bad time as I mentioned to buy and I've had a Mac book Mac many rare pods you have to wait until October thirty first folks because every October apple comes out with new hardware just in time for the holidays and we're expecting a new eye pad pro eleven inches use facial ID like the iPhone does\nA new Thirteen inch Mac book airs rumors less expensive and has a written in display I Hope it has multiple you as the seaports two\nAnd a new Mac many pro and what this means is that if you have an older I've had pro or Mac will care now's the time to sell abuse October thirtieth that's where the mountain happen they right where you are have more of the show coming up you don't want\n[noise]\nA ... and and I heard you talk about these things before in a different sites for can get a lot but I used to ... dot com yeah his book Google a and I'm coming up with nothing\nYou know there's also family tree now where okay you\nMight be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but really there's a lot of information there\nAre ... and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer glass why okay ... click and other places are and then of course there's the surge which is another place for you to attract but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman\nIs that you know I'm surprised that that you know he can't sprained\nHer on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media because that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out there\nYeah I don't think he wants anybody\nIn ... out there yeah I don't think he wants anybody slipping oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know why\nYou have a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that\nThat she is his daughter and I don't and she's got a really good background and I think she's just to get what she can get\n... well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find online\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nI and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she asked for money so that this way you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember it or it sounds like he's probably not even going to tell you now that I think about that\nWell we're not that close like I said I'm just a a a bystander and all this but there is a connection to other people ah that I was associated with it and everybody is concerned strictly a and it's taken a toll on his own current family\nYeah but you can't help people don't want to help themselves right that's true\nI mean I hate to be that blind but I'm you know you're a good man and you're trying to do something and you know I Would search at the family tree ... now and the search I Would try to expand that search into people that she may know and he may know\nAnd and you know put those names into Facebook or you may also want to you know just put her name out there you know as a Google alert to see what can happen obviously look in the county records a\nYou know wherever she may have lived and the court houses and the civil records 'cause all that is now on line\n... ah you know there are ways for you she was applying for a job that you could actually use a company like precision higher or what have you that would do a trace task to tracking rather\nAcross the United states and you might want to look at a PIN PIN is going to cost you around five hundred bucks okay well and if you start doing this on line you're probably looking at fifty dollars two hundred dollars but that surge may not be as throws you would like\nA what I was afraid of yes\nBut if you do want to be I you know I I Know a couple times used over the years you know trying to do background checks on whether it's you know somebody to care for my mother or somebody that were hiring and you know what exactly is going on in this person's life but there are so often you can hop on line you can see it if you start expanding that\n... that ring a few well so outside your friends go to the next you know if you think about it on tree rings go to the next level go to the next level just keep moving out and out and you may find something but you can always like I said started the county courthouse records are online you don't have to go there anymore\nUh the civil records and the criminal record and then in addition to that you can you know by searches at these various sites that I mentioned in a thanks for being a listener thanks for being a club member jam I

S. which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nA said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh can you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly um so you've got the care of and continuing their march\nNow a couple of other things that you got to understand here and there was a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats\nAll terrain vehicles you'd ... foot I'd been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there I saw an entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me uh I've been to the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that have that have been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is going to win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom as promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\nGood luck for the people of California when that disaster happens but you know you watch this and it's not one Democrat saying one thing about this because they've always supported open borders\nNow did they not know that by priests precipitating this confrontation that there could be innocent people that end up getting hurt here\nI guess for them they would use that as just another reason to hate and blame Donald Trump you know or maybe they're hoping that Trump won't do anything and then it's all talk no action they don't have any legitimate claim for asylum in America because you that would be the first country they go to the way they have so we can send them back immediately if we have\nTo but if you have five seven fourteen thousand people confronting our troops along the border of what good is going to come out of this you know it's some you know while they're breaking the law they're criminals there not respecting our laws and our sovereignty and at the end of the day\nIf you let intend fourteen thousand what's gonna happen\nWell if you let in ten fourteen thousand what's gonna happen next week and what's going to happen in the week after I think you\nKnow the Democrats have always believed that the change in ... in you know allowing illegal immigrants in the country of somehow helps them politically in the long term but I don't think the American people won't open borders the American people fundamentally believe in the rule of law\nThe American people believe in immigration but they want legal immigration\nAnd when they see the magnitude in just one crossing and then recognize that this is happening every single day at our borders to me this is going to energize the more to want to go out and elect Republicans that will fund fully the wall\nPresidents only have three and a half billion dollars so far to build the wall he's trying to get the Congress to give them twenty five billion gets the twenty five billion enough to fully completely secure our southern border\nThat me nobody ever gets in not at all we just want legal immigration want to make sure that who you are when you come here can you take care of yourself and do you come here and share our values and do you want your piece of the American dream then fine\nSo you've got a Democratic Party now that is ... ... believes in nothing as it relates to due process Kavanaugh\nNo presumption of innocence capital\nNow they're supporting lawlessness mobs all over the place now they're not speaking out against the confrontation you have leaders in the Democratic party encouraging that kick up we can't be civil with people would disagree with unless we win the election\nAnd I'll get a crowd confront them tell them they don't want it anywhere anymore Maxine Waters follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you see what's happening it happened again even this weekend\nAnd the other issue that should be on everybody's minds and Fifteen days is after eight years of Obama we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty\nThe only president never to hit three percent GDP Growth in his entire presidency for one year\nWe had to a guy accumulate more debt than all forty three other presidents before him combined that's the track record of Obama\nThat's when he left us the lowest labor participation rate since the seventies lowest homeownership breaking fifty one years what do we have now four million new jobs including four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs he told those were never coming back\nWe have eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps for a million Americans now getting jobs we have more than a million jobs available and people are on unemployment we've never had consumer confidence is high\nLowest unemployment rates in Nineteen sixty nine on the world stage little rocket man is not firing rockets every other day over Japan we're not we're not jumping cargo planes full of cash on the tarmac of of people that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel\nThe president has been writes in his handling of the\nEast Saudi national apparently wrote for the Washington Post ... is waiting for all the facts not rushing to judgment but it's very clear that the Saudis have been deployed citizen dishonest about all of this and he's now measuring what the proper response is going to be probably a follow some of what\nThe western European allies did when we found out was poisoning you know some of his citizens\nAnd by the way just moments ago the president who's headed to a campaign rally for Ted Cruz down in Texas that over a hundred and what Fifteen thousand people wanting to go to this like they don't have enough room they already I think they increase the venue twice a month or so the president before he jumped on ...\nIt's a horrible thing and it's a lot bigger than five thousand people\nWe've got to stop them at the border and unfortunately you look at the countries that have not done their job unfortunately they have not done their job\n... Honduras El Salvador that made a lot of money every year we give them far they and they did nothing ... nothing they did nothing for us\nSo we give them tremendous amount of money you know what it is you covered all the time hundreds of millions of dollars they like a lot of others do nothing for our country\nHave I spoke to the ground friends [noise] or we have people over Saudi Arabia now where you have top intelligence people working or we're going to see what we have a lot tomorrow there'll be coming back either tonight or tomorrow morning we have to be his daughter abs ...\nI think that's a long time\nThat they want a month\nFor a long time there's no reason for that by\nLooking at it we have a lot of different ah\nConcept right now I have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now you know that as well as I Do and we're looking at it very seriously protecting everybody you know what I'm doing I'm protecting everybody I Want to protect our country\nHas I think it's going to be I think they wanted to see that I'm undecided I Am a hundred percent um we have I mean you've been reporting cobra\nUm we have I mean you've been reporting over a hundred thousand people\nMay lined up two days ago and it's very exciting for one thing that will be a big factor that I was going to get up really going to make a great ...

S. B. joined me in Studio today the Georgia secretary of state\nBrian Kemp running for governor and ... we've been talking about the voter registration issue in the complaints lodged against her office\nOne of the late breaking stories I'm seeing circulating in the media which I Know having been elections lawyers is just not being reported factually or how the secretary of state's office removed people from voting rolls that it's a seven year process if you wouldn't mind addressing that for a minute\nYou know the way we deal with this one every two years is well we've done it many times in the past were following federal law the help America vote act to keep the voting rolls\nUp to up to speed and you know basically what you do is you get somebody if they're registered voter and they're active and for some reason they don't participate over to general election cycles which would be at least a\nThree year period than that they are considered to be\nOr thought to be a a an maybe an enacted voters so the county registrars will send them a letter asking them are you still this address because what happens is people move though changed neighborhoods they'll\nMove out of state so they may know quip voting here they're voting in another state and you don't want people registered in two states\nSo you send the letter if no one to answer the answer to the letter or do anything to their record even if they sign a petition for a recall or if they go go in and change their address anything they do in their in their system would would get them out of that\nA potential potential status to be looked at\nAnd then if they don't answer the letter then they moved from acted in active so they're still on the rolls that they were inactive all they gotta do dislike the spending people that we have now\nIf they just go up a show up in and vote show their photo ID\nThere'll be moved you know back into the active status but if they then miss to general elections again we'll send them another or the county will send them another letter and then if they don't reply to that letter then they're you know ended up being removed from the role but this is like a seven year process\nHere so when you say to do a lecture cycles that that's two two year period is not a not a local municipal like you\nKnow it's not like night like presidential races it would be ... to federal elections basically so you get out of a presidential year and then the next year when your congressman you\n[laughter] well I'll let you are in there and it all like\nTo to to voting in the end the great response that our local\nA county elections officials in an registrars have done in the wake of that devastating storm I've been down there twice you know continued to pray for those folks we've\nWe've dealt with the relief effort from our campaign perspective my wife Marta got caught driving a forklift other day loading the truck so people are very grateful for the hell they're getting our federal and state response has been unreal but those ...\nIn our federal and state response has been unreal but\nThose can elections officials even with the devastation that they've seen in their own homes and then their local community\nStarted um advance voting with using generators I'm not having air conditioning to give people the ability to cast their ballot on that very first day I think we only had two counties that cannot do that we got the governor\nOr to do an executive order\nTo um give them a couple of days 'cause it was just an unsafe environment and Seminole and Miller county but they're all up and running now people are voting I Know that those Jordan's had more on their mind in an election or and rightly so with the devastation that they've seen but\nVery proud of those hardworking folks that got things together down there and I'm proud of our team and the secretary of state's office you not took a\nChris RV the chief elections official\nUnder myself that runs the division over there and um you know he got to see that first hand made with those folks and we've been working with them from day one to see what we needed other counties that weren't effective and been a resource for them as well and it just shows\nWhat Georgians due in tough times they come together and help their neighbor and our response has been great and that's really\nYou know I told a lot of people seeing that response on the ground down they're seeing how hard those folks were working how folks in our office volunteer to help as well with with Jima\nUm makes me proud and bed Georgia\nThat's good to hear I I Want to shift gears from there into the actual campaign uh against Stacey Abrams a moving beyond your role as secretary state there is some striking contrast that has really shaken up between\nA un Stacey Abrams including her her vision last week down in South southeast Georgia about the role of the governor to\nBe able to transition people from agriculture hospitality jobs into renewable energy jobs because of climate change I I didn't know the governor and George actually had the power to do that\nWell now there's a lot of people in rural Georgia and a lot of people that work in our great hospitality industry and and really people in general that were outraged by by those comments just to even\nYou know come out and say that was really quite shocking I mean the agriculture is the number one industry in the state\nIt makes our growing pork and savannah are so great also the port in Brunswick I mean is helping drive the rural economy\nAnd look it's feeding our people it's closing our people in this state and literally people all over the world I mean we're the breadbasket of the south I think there's much that we can do and agriculture so that was very disappointing that you know she would think that people shouldn't have to go in the agriculture\nHere in Georgia people want to go in the agriculture I've been talking among kids about potentially\nGoing into the act program\nIn college 'cause there's just such great you know great jobs out there especially a even for females which which is appealing to me having three teenage daughters and I've seen that first than when I was in the legislature I work\nA lot with research and extension which literally covers all parts of our states supporting our farmers in our agribusiness people\nAnd it's just you know we're we're the leader in the world in ... when you think about things like blueberry production lotta peaches you know obviously a broiler chickens you know eggs\nCattle beef all kinds of different row crops certainly cotton and peanuts are going to be especially caught and very challenging this year and our pecan farmers is absolutely took it on the chin\nIn southwest Georgia but you know there's a lot of good things that are going on right now with the federal and state response and I'm I'm a big governors going to continue that and work those folks and we're going to make southwest Georgia stronger than ever before the next eight years\nWell ... the other divide that seems to be shaping up is is the Atlanta versus out of Atlanta divide and he it seems like a and my impression of the campaign says you're running a very Georgia focused campaign and her I think naturally her constituency is mostly urban uh and\nFocusing very much on Atlanta but I continue when I travel around the state ... to see this divide between Atlanta versus the rest of us sort of the dynamic than I Do know that it's necessarily fair but it's one that\nHer campaign seems to be amplified just in its\nLanguage catering just to Atlanta\nWell and I think we you know I Want to be a governor represents our whole state I think we gotta we gotta lot a lot of tough issues were facing in rural Georgia when you think about people don't have access to high speed Internet so their kids can simply do their homework at night uh people are moving away 'cause there's no jobs and\nAn opportunity or that makes it tough on rural rural hospitals and that's why I have a plan to deal with those by increasing the rural hospital tax credit that's something that lieutenant governor candidate a Jeff Duncan and I've committed to do and uh and those kinda things will absolutely move the needle but\nWe're not you know we're not given up on the metro area I mean just the opposite we're fighting for every vote that we can get up here and I think George is to really look at the policies and proposals and the records of that\nReally look at the policies in proposals and the records of the two candidates and think about issues that mattered to them you know I Want to cut taxes I Want to continue the tax cut that we got to the state income tax\nLast year next year that's the plan uh she said she wanted to reverse what governor deal in the legislature did when you think about education we rolled out a plan the other day to invest in public education give our teachers of Bob thousand dollar pay raise we have forty four percent\nOf our teachers that leads the profession and the first five years I mean we have heard that on the ground in our schools in from people that are running or work in our schools that's a big problem so we're addressing it we rolled out of Roebuck school a school safety plan\nTo help schools protect themselves from the inside out that um goes for putting account a counselor and every high school in the state\nTo help with that I have real health issues and and then also funding for for school security and that goes with complete local control you'd think about health care policy\nYou know Stacey Abrams wants to radical\nA takeover of government help to health care to a single payer system doing away with Medicaid and Medicare\nOr it's going to raise your taxes you're not going to be able to tell you know who your doctor's gonna be and it's going to make your current insurance ... plan he illegal I mean those are radical positions and there's very big differences and I think Jordan's need to understand about\nI wouldn't jump back real quick to education because you have mentioned giving teacher pay raises in I was kind of surprised to hear a Democrat on the campaign trail say that it's not possible and that nobody should believe you [laughter]\nWell yeah well I mean if that's all she had to say when we rolled out of a teacher pay raises you know I think that's actually a good thing because I think people that they really went back and look ... look at my record of campaigning for the legislature or in the four years that I served I did what I tell people has gone to\nA went back home for three years old Marty raised the girls focused on some business stuff and came back as secretary of state\nRan with a very specific good then ginned up using technology to make all this more efficient and effective in lower cost and also um ran on having secure life since we've already been through the security ...\nUh but we've also you know our new systems whether it's corporations are voter registrations this system that we have now\nEasier to use we've saved millions of dollars doing that and uh they're working working great so I absolutely have a history of doing what I say and that's why\nYou know when we were all that teacher pay rise package out with their school safety package and other things that we've done we're accounting for that money that we're spending\nI'm implementing a spending cap and I'm planning to do that but it also means that when you do that you can you can pay for your priorities in in state government in my priority is going to be public education in education in general that includes\nPaying our our teachers correctly because that's one of the big issues that we've got\nIn our state and for her to say that that I Can't do that is ridiculous on the other hand you have to look at what she's ... she's taking the same pot of money that's available to the next governor and she's spending it three or four times saying she wants to do this big government program and that big government\nProgram and and if you really dig into the numbers that is simply not going to work so I'm looking forward to working on those issues and in moving the needle on\nWell listen to the ... I Want to go on it if I can to Andrew in there um I Want to go in and take a a quick time out because when I come back I Want to circle back to the beginning of the Associated Press story\nAnd the information on registered voters get back and find in the last couple of minutes we have you ever go back to that 'cause I think it's such a big issue and I know the media is not going to cover it as much as it should after beating you up for weeks and now we know Seventy five percent of those people power probably don't exist so we'll see quick time out and be right back\nNews weather in telling us ... Atlanta seeming like I'm living in the morning\nI rabbi again WNBA random guy come to our we are and robbed and get when you buy me down right before ... ... that number forty eight I think I got to believe that you have a crash and said that you played there the trouble\nThat thought before Seventy five I found out that has it altered it out of five forty five minutes or twenty or thirty five", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "22"}
