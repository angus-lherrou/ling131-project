I don't think there's a person in the country that is not aware of what's happening right now as it relates to Brett Kavanaugh and I mean even if they didn't watch the hearings they're very aware of what took place last week and if they wanted to come forward I don't know if they need letters from people to do so that's my opinion\nA it's a yeah I think we need a full fledged investigation absolutely positively no doubt about it and if we don't then we're gonna\nIs it simply no doubt about it and then we don't then we're gonna you know look we get the country we deserve in the end if you like the progress that America has been making under President Trump\nThen you'd better go out and vote and thirty six days if you don't like the radicalism that you see on display now the last Fifteen days\nFifteen days ago Brett Kavanaugh had a stellar reputation if you don't think they're going to have endless investigations into Trump\nThat they don't want to impeach him there this is who they are what they do they can run on their record when Obama was president for eight years 'cause it's a disaster if you want the progress to continue for the country for the forgotten men and women I mean we barely have time to mention that the president got\nYou know incredible new deals with both Canada and Mexico getting rid of a bad deal NAFTA now you had to break a few dishes an ad that threaten the trade war but ultimately you got it done because\nIt was these what one side of trade deals and so if you don't say you're willing to pull out of a deal you're never going to get a deal done and the president is effective at at negotiating\nOn all fronts I don't care if it's\nNATO and those countries that don't pay their fair share European allies countries of ours that have been taken advantage of us on trade issues if you don't say you're willing to do it nobody will believe you and nobody will move but now he's putting America First\nIn thirty six days you'll decide their agenda is endless investigations impeachment open borders eliminating ice keeping Obamacare and they want their crumbs back if you want that than stay home I mean go to go vote on vote for the Democrats on election day in thirty six days if you want to progress to continue for the country\nAnd you don't want to give them this power which way which they will abuse then you can stop it if you voted for Trump two years ago everything you voted for is now in jeopardy and thirty six days they want for them this is\nThey want to redo the twenty sixteen results they think it was a mistake they don't believe in happen somehow we were misled and it's been two years even with Republicans in power\nOf non stop never ending smears slander conspiracy theories ... blood thinning of the president and the media of course the willing accomplices\nYou know every step of the way\nI'm anyway Gina thank you let's say Hi is it Lee is in Virginia how are you glad you called\nI thank you for taking my call I speak to you as a legal immigrant proudly voted for Donald Trump or just\nHave to say I have to say my wife and I have never been angrier and angrier tactical we wait\nOn Thursday it was such a travesty pick up all of this kind of think that the man with two weeks ago was clean with an honorable ... as ... ... feet\nI just want to wait for your listeners if the Republican Party not from this yeah well you need to do for the legislative branch what we expected France ... finding Donald Trump to get a legislative French because\nDonald Trump does not play by the Democratic fateful plead with everybody that's listening to get out there and make it kind of different see Congress that we made in the executive branch thank you for taking my call\nI think that's a good call I think there's a lot at stake and you get to determine all of you I don't get that I have one vote in a state that doesn't matter and the district frankly that doesn't matter I have one vote but if you're in an important state district your votes gonna mean everything", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "02"}
