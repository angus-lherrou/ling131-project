where Gavin Newsom\nLieutenant governor now running for governor out there wants to have\nFree healthcare for every body member in the state of California you got a Thirteen and a half percent state income tax I thought it was bad and New York with a ten percent state income tax\nNow that's a lot of money a lot of people's body and Gavin Newsom now wants to make universal health care available to anybody Californian non California and\nA legal illegal does it matter\nIt would cost a fortune now I Know because California is so radically left wing it's kind of hard to think that a Republican to win the governorship out there but\nI kind of believe in miracles and when I saw a poll that showed it was a five point race with John ... the other candidate running for California Governor against new some I'm thinking Well Donald Trump shocked the world why not\nUm here a couple of the ads that John ... is running out there in California I live\nTrafficking ...\nAnd family moving out of\nMillions of Californians near on a lot of the poverty line\nLike Gavin you talk about change but I think the guy high gas and\nHappened I'm sure why but yeah it is hard for someone\nTo selection is about the status quo versus the change\nWe must have the courage to admit\nThose who have been leading in California for so long\nGavin Newsom stands with\nTime someone stands\nAll right so is it possible that there can be a California miracle out there now one other an addendum to this is there are number braces house races\nEspecially in Southern California and that would be in our friend Dana Rohrabacher seed and Darryl ISIS old seat\nThese are really important speech it as much as they could determine the the balance of power in the U.S house of representatives so anywhere from Los Angeles straight on down well frankly the whole state of California\nYou have to get out and vote for these congressional candidates because otherwise Nancy Pelosi could end up being speaker but\nIs it possible that there could be a California miracle anyway a Republican John Cox who is a I think you're surprised so far a lot of pollsters nobody thought you'd get within single digits ever\nAnd one poll how'd you within five or thanks\nPepper and one poll had you within five\nAh thanks for having me on a Sean and you're right I was a listening to your earlier marks about a Florida and everything and uh you said help is on the way that's actually our message to the people in California that\nGavin Newsom political class as resulted in the highest housing prices the highest gas prices water is being rationed in California you're right he's proposing new open\nThey rationing the water because of the delta smelt like one out there in Denver newness his district is a great guy and if you're in the in the San Joaquin Valley I was out and I did a show from there a couple of years ago when then farmers couldn't form because they was saving water for those little itsy bitsy fish called the delta smelt\nWell that's part of it Shawn but they haven't built a reservoir out here in Thirty years imagine\nCalifornia if it hadn't built a road in the last Thirty years can you imagine what the congestion would be like if it's all horrible anyway and but they haven't built a reservoir and we built one desalination plant that\nTook Twenty years because a lawsuit and regulations and you know we've got to do more to sell nation we got to do more recycling we've got a Bill Maher reservoirs that's all there is to it and what the political class you're right they don't want to do that they want to save a little tiny fish which is wonderful but we got to live\nWell farmers got a farm and that is such a big part of the California economy I mean you're drawing oranges and avocados and and all sorts of other you know strawberries and\nAnd fruits and vegetables you may not know this about me but I Lived in Santa Barbara five years of my life when I was broken and have you on what I was a porous guy in Santa Barbara at the time but\nUh I Love the weather out there and when I had my first orange picked up a tree which I stole a it was like a I think I've ever had in my life um let me ask you this so you have a Thirteen and a half percent state income tax rate out there you are a sanctuary state not a city whole state\nAnd now that avenue someone's free health care for everybody's busy putting up a sign that says if you get sick come here will take care of you know\nI saw that a Newt has said that all the other governors around the country are probably fall it for a noose of so they can send anybody who is ill to California\nAnd our tax payers I'll pay a their health care you know that's ridiculous Sean I mean even per month that they didn't want single payer health care but you know news is basically just offer anything free to anybody and then the process what he's doing is he's going to make California even more unaffordable than it already is a\nI the people know that this guy mismanaged San Francisco you didn't fix the homeless problem there he's personally compromised he's a\nPretty much empty suit he was put in business by uh uh the billionaire Getty family and I think people want somebody like myself I I struggled I built a small business I got results in the private sector a and I think that's what people are looking for\nHow come the people of California and then maybe I should ask the same question to myself because we're not far behind you in New York state with nine point nine percent high the highest income tax rate why did the people of California takeoff Thirteen and a half percent\nIncome state income tax rate and and there's no rebellion out there why are they taking that crap\nIt's beyond me and a lot of people are leaving Sean as you might know California has had an exodus of people\nTo ...
