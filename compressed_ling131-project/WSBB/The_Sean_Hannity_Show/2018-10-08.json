whenever he's caught a engaging in illicit if not illegal activity she climbs his words were misinterpreted over and over again we've seen examples of that\nThe threats to the intelligence committee staff threats to Devin Nunes is\nOh I'm just misunderstood Rosenstein must be the most misunderstood man in Washington DC but it would be imprudent politically for the president\nTo fire him he has no intention of doing shows on\nYou know must receive Mueller's report and I think the president wants to see how that will play out and I think it's beginning to wind down many of the people on Miller's

chairman of the ... community would you investigated for possible impeachment if he is on the Supreme Court and the Senate has investigated than ice in the house will have to investigate we would have to investigate\nAll right joining us now is the man himself he's got a brand new book out say I love the title and I like the content even more why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my friend this book is a must read for everybody and ah how are you going to say I'm\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think this title would be as appropriate as it is also lost Seventy two hours but we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that your patriot\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and we're going to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what did we had we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading it's made by Chinese Chinese re militarization of the end of the Obama administration just one metric pick take politics out of it from second\nWe have sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that ... thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes that even exists read his ... speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing\nWhat he said at the un is absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here even exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who had\nThe probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being a stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next ... days also important showing\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this\nI don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I would've leaning on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in the mid term election that totally not happened three times only probably picked up see three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack die on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here\nAnd that is what it literally jumps off the pages reading through your book that we'd better defeat America's enemies and we'd better do without apologies tactic Gorka we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept but the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThing about the fact that JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today\nA hardcore anti communist strong national security you wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the will cost you a quick test is we have the Maxine Waters and control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply the ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool\nWell guess who use that philosophy in the past about philosophy drives to the labor camps it drives to relax and brush with death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether your freshest whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the will to winter and then again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you're talking about the will to when you talk about it we'll\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out yeah in Iraq and Afghanistan we pull out weaving of dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in there and so many others comeback without their arms and legs and they're in there\nSome kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces his picture fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we are willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start some don't be involved in the\n... so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important is is the one who hitting on it do we have the will to feed our enemies because it is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks in roughly rifles defeat us\nHow possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine a will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual real to win in addition to the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the bombing was two hundred years ago I talk about uh Korea hero a trusted pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years when they ... to handle Hilton but the last story\nIs very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's which chambers\nMost kids have no idea who would it could dream was is this is a man who was Kevin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearings wasn't mantle would occur chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets\nWho went on record saying hey I no longer communist but I eat America to know where the communist off in\nThe government including ... his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what does he do he had the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice Kevin ... social and his his his his the scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it so many years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick break we'll come back more
