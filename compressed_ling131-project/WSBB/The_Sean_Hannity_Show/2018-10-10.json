Ninety five five AM seven fifty ws be depend on it and will rejoin Sean Hannity now live in progress\nShaun Shaun Hannity raunchy you on WSBIU renters warehouse will\nCredibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of United\nThe OJ who on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on an air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nI tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you've you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today Jim\nJordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you are not and bring 'em in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoena the McCain Menlo so the kitten that was what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set Rod Rosenstein was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief it all in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have the Cape metals that reinforced that we've subpoenaed that McCain memos and we've asked Mr Rosenstein\nYou come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr ... is leading that you played Shawn he talked about friends he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and how our our our rule of law and justice system works well\nOne of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us those memos and more importantly come answer our questions that's what bothers both of us\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that the committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize the anybody but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house the majority leader of the house\nA Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is moved expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that uh it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and ...\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath and answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it was set at sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm in that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running department\nShould not be joking with support it's about recording the commander in chief of the United states that ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do the protector even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running Justice Department\nShould not be joking with support it's about recording the commander in chief of the United states\nThat ... that even if it's a joke that is not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on may night the president fires Jim Comey on may seventeenth Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\nIs one of the sheer joy ... happen in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks\nStrategy so that when they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only were they leaking been aired of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this\nYou know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoena testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they\nKnew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media\nFailed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here I'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed that out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they'd never verified they'd never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher ... deals\nYou know ... and as a result was used as the bulk of informational pain the war ends and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all of a thing\nAs a result was used as the bulk of information to attain the war ends and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell Dave today that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Broussard knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get\nPut in a a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sickening it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow\nUnder oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of ... twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte to do he indicated that he would do that so now's the time obviously to get that done and that sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between midnight and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen where he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why
