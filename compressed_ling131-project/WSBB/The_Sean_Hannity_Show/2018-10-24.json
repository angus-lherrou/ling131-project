got it but my credit what let me tell you what we shouldn't have either\nUm if Sarah Sanders in her family want to sit down and eat dinner she's not working leave her alone\nIt Pam Bondi wants to see a movie leave her alone if secretary Nielsen has them eating a private dinner and groups of people are running no matter the restaurant I don't want that either\nI don't want a secretary McConnell and his wife some guy banging part or based on his table throwing his food out either or Ted Cruz being run out with his wife out of a restaurant\nI don't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability um I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore either I'm sure you agree with me right\n[laughter] well let me ask you do you agree with that\nAnd the point at some point you know when you really think about however this ends up\nThis is a group of people that have made a decision to break American laws violate our sovereignty disrespect our constitutional republic if you allow this to stand there is no law and order there's total chaos\nThat we're following that story and of course the other top story of the day and that is a individuals' CNN and now Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and Obama's and Clint\nAnd now Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and Obama's and Clinton's being targeted with suspicious packages and what does the media is quick response blame Trump Fox News and talk radio\nSo predictable having ignored\nAll of the incendiary insane rhetoric that has now we've been chronicling for months get in their faces you you create a crowd you didn't you follow them into restaurants and grocery stores and department stores and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nOr just this week at a Boulder sent through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nThe house majority leader or Henry Kissinger Ninety ... however many years old he and he has to take this or guy banging his fist down on the table where Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao or or actually eating ripping food off the table throwing it out the door and creating a hostile environment up one Democrat not one\nHas spoken up as Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders Mitch McConnell Ted Cruz and his wife and so many others run out of restaurants by their lunatic million friends are because of the hospital environment that has been created by the rhetoric of people like Maxine\nYou know Spartacus Booker Hillary you can't be civil with I'm Eric Holder kick them and even Brock Obama backers ... just south of tears Sean Hannity up getting the ... and their face this\nThis is their rhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened to the ball field ... steam skull east nearly lost his life um and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters that turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that supports him you know decided to become violence\nIs outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been their silence has been deafening\nIn recent months and days uh anyways Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisor spokesmen for American first action and also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris Kobach is back with us and uh he has penned a piece on them migrant caravan he is the\nElected secretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration and ah by the way he's been very successful at what he's doing and uh and I fully support your\nYour victory there in Kansas was a big win that you pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you'd be a great governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to those points is caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush and across that border as in as one we don't have any problem with a choice we will have to arrest them that will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens meanwhile he's got governors\nAh like a Governor Brown out in California giving more effective if federal and state response or the feds out to build the wall and they have to start running out the goodies which gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in they can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for jobs\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government that they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling are capable of doing so\nUh what should America's response be\nWell I think America's response is that with the president has talked about what she's making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country\nWhy they're coming in a and that they not coming in with the areas where humans are to either harm us or the day you know but there's a variety in the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is to protect the people in the president's made very clear and and the one thing I said the the other day that much on I Want to be cleared you'll agree with me I Know\nChris will agree as well don't temp Donald Trump don't temp temp because he's warned them African government he's warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I just I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when\nHe gives you a warning he means that there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse\nI mean let me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people\nThat don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the eight we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nWith that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming that have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him\nPerson that can vouch for anybody in that care of him\nNobody can vouch for anybody and it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people to allow people in ... no idea what their their point of view a world view happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWell and that's that's a very good point you know I'd be there's abundant evidence of terrorists using\nThe traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border to get into the United states\nGoing all the way back to before nine eleven uh people from countries where al ... was active now countries where I suspect active have used this this flow is Margaret close to blend in there's no question that that'll be the case again the only thing that I I wanted to point out is\nI think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just follow this for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans but we need to deport those here legally\nThen in the two thousands they became co amnesty and they no longer want it to deport they wanted to grant amnesty you'll have a million plus year\nNow they're taking the position that we ... they are cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous they're treating people before they're even here to become unlawfully present to the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump\nLet me let me switch gears to these packages the president said he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror he said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages that appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down and the and the whole force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do 'em but before that Shawn we've seen a lot leading up to this\nAnd wondering what have we seen we've been witnessing second how can\nOne quick point to find that because I think you're making an excellent point one laughing it only takes one\nAnd that that leads into what we're talking about today you can have Ninety nine point nine percent you'd be be be doing the right thing but it only takes one to do the wrong thing and I think that's what we need to remember it to this whole process we saw that today one person or however many we don't know it now frightening and terrorizing thousands and thousands of people [noise]\nUm and and you know I'm not making any catchy but while I'm at the point I'm making it it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people through or safely but if we don't protect to get a hundred percent right people can be threatened or hurt and that's the thing that we have to make sure that we're clear on\nI Will tell you I went to take a quick break on this will come back on the other side and talk about the president's comments he will hunt down those people that have been sending these suspicious packages and powder and potential pipe bombs or to varying politicians want to CNN or this is not new I've lived through this myself\nOut of one of my assistance at the time poorly ... was in isolation what was that window what eight nine ten hours one day scared to death yeah it was horrible and it was horrible because she opened up a letter to send to me with white powder in it and it's happened to Don
