actually\nGo out there and say um that deniro is not like the others why Robert De Niro one of the things that I found was on October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting De Niro but things he said on Alec Baldwin show of all places and\nSaid that a Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil let's play a little bit of Robert De Niro and the things that he said why been critical\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's a he's a dog he's a big he's a con\nArtist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks he's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this pool disposal has wound up where he has\nHad like the punch him in the face\nI guess I'm not supposed to talk about that John\n... now and but you know what I like some people are hoping that after this election all goes away it's not going to go away if what this is about is\nDonald Trump is a historic president and the region and he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not he's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so what's going to happen is\nThe presidential race is going to start right after the election November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big field of people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nIt's all about feeding Donald Trump's so this race November six it's not just about control the Congress\nIt's really about the what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three million Trump voters that are out there need to get motivated to vote on November such in fact\nAnd our Cuomo Alec Baldwin all of these Hollywood left is we're all in just trying to attack the president tried to hurt the upper a region of New York where are our middle class taxpayers are finally single break free policies for this president\nWill never things to the governor of New York oh see that in you know the\nDistrict by the way approves of the way the president's doing his job of according to the latest polls and Trump won the district by a healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen eleven points to be specific\nAnd it's a district that has benefited not because of anything Albany has done I mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become\nUnder Cuomo and you know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up tracking before the last election he just liked to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected and meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in in your area and we don't do it\nYeah actually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into ten Broome county which is not the border of Pennsylvania\nAnd you see the stark difference between the southern tier which is why so many jobs this is where I was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in Albany that have just strangled our economy we're actually seeing an uptick I'm a small business owner in this district our family business which started in Nineteen forty six\nI'm I've been around and just see I've traveled to fifty or Seventy five businesses I have yet to meet one that has a priest us for tax reform and they're saying we're actually these tax cuts are we're re investing\nEvery one of them is giving a race to their employees or opponents or both we're finally seeing a glimmer of hope we've rolled back on necessary regulations\nOr we could really open up the southern chaired a responsible gas drilling a Governor Cuomo votes will not let it happen my opponent repeatedly thoughts against that and this is how scary my opponent is getting a debate last night he ever voted four times for government takeover\nOf our health care which is single payer which would cost the taxpayers nprcrowdsource bragged about by the socialist leaning guy who's to sponsored the bill will only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety two billion in New taxes on an annual basis\nIt ... [laughter] that's a good idea to believe what Ninety two billion when we're already take half your money anyway a credit card any at all and\nThis is a solution not voted four times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate you this is a radical you this was a guy who is trying to pretend he is that you know I support the president he's not going to support the president he's going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment caucus he's going to try and write and with all these Democrats you never shown any effect on\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact you can't pick by Sheldon Silver for the job to get an assembly now its hand picked by Chuck Schumer who brags about it and if you're a funny none of them have come to the district to help him get elected but she came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of New York in\nSeven years we had a sitting president come\nWe also has gone Eric I'm there and his daughter a bunker there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why they are having you on this and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the u._k. area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win ... plus eight Republican\nAnd you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raised some incredible amounts of money have been talking to my colleagues all across the country\nThe amount of money they're jumping introduced racist to try to deceive voters Israeli it's outrageous I mean my opponent star outspending make\nI've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservative sent your uh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the top conservatives but we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to witness elections to fight the fight because we got to take it to Washington\nWe got to support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains even in upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping her small business community are small business humidity\nIs about Ninety eight percent of my my this is sitting in my region and they create most of the jobs that just didn't help is alive by Nancy Pelosi\nThat somehow the wealthiest are the only ones benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the recent Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts is because his wealthy donors want to leave New York because they're not getting a lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight this is this is a tough battle because\nThe Democrats have the money to deceive voters and fool them into thinking that this guy somehow in modern he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get to vote at its most important as we can beat the money but we eat are Republican voters to understand the eight ticket out oh it's really really important\nAlright the quality of plenty of running in New York in an important seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com ... the main\nYou know ground zero seats that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so Claudia we wish you the best things for being with us and hopefully we'll send in your back to Congress and eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves that we don't have many good\nBack to Congress and eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves that we don't have many good New York politicians at all um by the way just going back to direct to re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real and that in fact they've been able to identify at least some forensic evidence including fingerprints\nWhich which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today a little more about that as the day unfolds here uh let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny as in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listen to you a lot and I have not been any sense whatsoever but these terms are um believe me in court to get out and about a ... and you hit on it every day I listen to it and not watching it or not I\nWasn't I Hope everyone feels the same way you do is four hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important you vote for democratic voting for policy you stay home it's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home a half a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve\nI've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shocked the world in the media\nYou know I see three scenarios that could unfold but I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win\nIf people identified the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen and you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam\nSchiff of Gerald Nadler and Maxine Waters wants to do to the country and we're not going to go away we're not going to cry we're not going to be quite babies like they've been for the last two years and when they tried to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want endless investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth and then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait I'm telling you what's going to happen we know they only want Obamacare we know they won't open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nWe know they want their crumbs back we know they want higher taxes we know they you know they don't they don't really care they're all things hating Trump all the time\nNot exactly in the best interest of the country to keep focused on that for two years but we'll do our best\nIn or we can win at all or you can lose it all listen to\nAll of us here in the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity and you don't pay to be a member but it has everything you need everything I Need to look feel spell my best your best and when I Love even
