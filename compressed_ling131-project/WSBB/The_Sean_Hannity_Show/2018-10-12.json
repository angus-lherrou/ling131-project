she associated with some prominent nine eleven truther and told a radio host than the interview that she didn't care it'd be joining the Taliban is on top of saying oh Arizona the capital of the world Arizona's are crazy\nAnd then we got the James O'Keefe tape he's going to join us at the bottom of the hour and his undercover cameras going in to the offices of Tennessee democratic want to be senator Bredesen and they're basically saying the people of\nTennessee or ignorant none of basically they're saying it and they're trying to pull a fast one he doesn't wouldn't have supported ever judge Kavanaugh there just lying to the people of Tennessee\nThose are two races that are going to watch the polls and the next week or two of this this information makes its way to the people of Arizona\nAnd Tennessee respectively\nHey listen I have the best coffee you have ever tasted black rifle coffee company and if you're sick or when they get the weak taste of coffee from those left

causes it's the best roasted coffee roaster order coffee delivered right to your door guaranteed fresh you can join their coffee club\nHe's really just saying yes to get into the ground rules\nFor long differently to heal the word that he wouldn't have otherwise it seems reticent and his staff had a pretty low opinion of Tennessee voters like\nThe older voters get done yep straight out [noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nDon't\nSee that out of here of course [laughter]\nLike we don't talk about the way we're not really in trouble all this sort of stuff even though that's why we're all here right now so I'm\nLike why didn't hear from those calls and stuff that's a message we want to be said they were not ready yeah exactly\nThere's a lot of people who are Republicans were going to vote for him but if they know that he's like [noise]\nI don't want to hear like he's like on line with the ... you like within like ...\nYeah exactly that would be like no yeah and that's the whole illness is\nLikely will not run for re probably going to be one term center was on the Internet and we were just like I don't think it was going to be running for reelection he can get in there and do the right thing after six years [noise]\n\nOh is that so [noise]\nWe still actually gets to say that we can [laughter] um\nSo they have tennis the Senate hopeful Democrats Phil Bredesen staff\nLiterally explaining away why he's consciously lying to the people of Tennessee\nThat he would never support somebody like judge Kavanaugh but we're down eight and we're trying to get more Republicans on our side and when he gets in there he'll be the real liberal that he always wants to be and do the right thing it won't be concerned about reelection this is just a political move in a political statement\nAnd um I I mean it doesn't get any more sickness\nAnd thank goodness our friends over at project Vera tops were able to catch all these people including top campaign workers were Bredesen exposing what was the truth with their undercover cameras\nYou know you know ... it's all expose their reticent staff say in a rather than a liar when he said he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh it is purely a blatant political move\nAnd uh when I asked for comment all they said was well project very tough posed as a fake volunteering and use secret video recording equipment to capture uninformed inspect your comments made last weekend by college students and youth organizers\nWell that's not exactly true is that James O'Keefe was the c._e._o. of project ... is with us or some of the more high ranking campaign members weren't they\n[noise] that's right on it and and thanks for highlighting this and yeah they ... this is a coordinated campaign between the Tennessee Democratic Party and the um [noise] and the silk reticent campaign and these these workers have been working at the headquarters for the president campaign for a couple of months\nAnd it's a Greek chorus of voices all saying that it's a quote political move to vote this is a big deal last friday when when the Tennessee Democratic Senate candidate silk Brett reticent enough he was going to be voting for capping off if you were in the Senate he said I Would be voting was a big deal and they're all saying\nThat I Know it was a big lie it was a cheap political move to get rural voters that weren't supporting him in Tennessee I mean I took it\nAnd that that isn't but that isn't your a statement announcing this tape and coming from their own about Sean I don't I'm not speculating here I'm not reporting this anonymously you can actually see the thing I can see it coming out of their own announced they're the ones who are standing it so we're confirming the suspicions what you just said we've confirmed that\nAnd again it's not just one or two or three and a half a dozen of these people are inside the campaign office they have confirmed that the people are real and and then of course you have the bonus material what the president staffer thinks the Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe says quote we don't have this out of these walls he says will be a good Democrat and what that means he'll be a good Democrat that means that he's going to do with the Schumer wing of the party once she gets elected kind of see they don't want them even the Democrats don't want them to be Chuck Schumer democratic so all of this is pretty amazing stuff Sean and uh\nYou know it's it's just we're confirming what was known for years\nYou know if you think back and do you think Peter Struck and he talked about smelly Walmart Trump voters and you think abiding just what like last month saying that Trump voters were the ... of society\nMoving in the course\nAnd then the court of public opinion these forces of intolerance remained determined to undermine honor roll back the progress you all may this time they're\nYou have an on line in the White House this time they have an hour or small percentage of the American people virulent people [noise] some of them the drugs in society\nAnd when people [noise] some of the drugs of society\nDrags is designed so then you got smelly Walmart people ... society era de mobile deplorable that we now learn this week from Hillary you cannot\nBe civil with you know we got Eric Holder saying a kick them a Obama once famously saying that you know these are bitter angry people cling to their God guns bibles in religion I mean there's such hatred in contempt for voters there's another type we showed last night James I don't know if you saw the show we did run your tape and thank you for sharing with us\nBut an Arizona democratic senator a Senate candidate name's Kristen cinema literally caught on tape and twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona crazy and it's even worse than that\nBecause we found out Fox News dot com reported that she was promoting an event at Arizona State university featuring a lawyer is lawyer was convicted of aiding and Islamic terrorist organization in its leader\nAnd the lawyer in question presented represented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the nineties for plotting to blow up the UN and FBI building and more\nThen invite that person to\nYou know just I mean it's unbelievable to me they what they're doing is they're just outright lying to people\nBut they have to Sean that that's the the whole purpose behind our organization ... exposed the real nature of thing the reality and the motivations behind these people and and they have to lie in the red states it's not like a democratic red state Democrats have to lie\nIn order to get elected and when they get into the parents\nCan only one way yes or no but they have to mislead emissions form the voters and and again it's so if people think that it requires all of his espionage it doesn't you walk into the office is asking the questions staffers will tell you the same thing\nThat most people we don't actually believe this and if there's one thing voters won't tolerate shot this one thing my mom left or right thing because it's just so self evident you can't lie to people\nYou can't lie about what your intentions are you have to be honest\nAnd they cannot get elected they gave them\nIf they extend no you're right if they if they state what they really believe they'll never get elected so what do it's like uh they just it's an orchestrated lined campaign and you call them or the other hand\nThey will be the first time we got a bunch more coming\nAnd now there's going to ask you about that and the second and we'll talk about who might be up next on the list\nA James O'Keefe project very ... dot com is the website want to remind you with our friends of blind dot com you know you want to get your home
