and believe we have aren't you going to get the ... pumpkin you got to let it roll the way it goes yup [laughter] I don't\nKnow what he said yep Bye bye pumpkin\n... I'm getting and I'm laughing you keep trying to you know entice them Liam know get the ... that one to Liam gets by get to tell you all getting them out if that's what I Do if I get to three you're going to have to sit in a pumpkin patch I'm gonna leave you here anyway [laughter]\nAnd I had on\nI Am a I'm I'm Down here in Raleigh but I'm formerly from Ron chalk up there on the island or um the\nReason why I'm calling and I appreciate your taking my call but the reason why I'm calling is I I think you Rush Limbaugh and going back a downplaying this red wage I don't think it's the right way and I think it's a rich nominee Democrats are getting fed up with the live in the ... the perception of you know Hillary and all of them and\nThat's really getting sicker and try to bite\nMe Trump so I think they just they just want him silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know\nIf the election were held today I think we'd lose the house by about five seats Bush if the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely holding the father\nI think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana and we'll win North Dakota\nFlorida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate\nRepublicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house or it's gonna be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least\nLikely so you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house and to really try to get in\nPeople's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses because Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a committee chairwoman and Adam Schiff into committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number [noise]\nOne of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors of come out contrast that to two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten can midterm stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase it right you just watch jobs go back overseas see now that's that's the difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six\nI noticed that former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing closest Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district ... million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in Lee high value in Pennsylvania attacking me\nBy the way I say this to everybody I said they're four hundred thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for ... they're just not\nOh for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for ... they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show uh in the district\nTo punch back where the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're and we're gaining momentum uh we we debated several times I made an average debate she will not to agree to any additional debates we caught her actually listen as we caught her in the debates talking about\nSupporting open borders then she correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border twice she said that in the last debate\nWhich completely makes sense because during the primary she was running on a ballot\nEyes open borders but now we're getting the general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're going to expose her for what she really is\nWell this is a really important race a now Marty knows Dina's running for the seventh district of Pennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district\nLehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spend as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election boards you know there's so many presidential election is what they've told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned it so people are really really engage the really engaged\nHe's getting any orders feedback as to you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in I\nHave a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and it'd be laws and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda\nYou know we're in the middle of the great American comeback last two years have given a lot of people hope in this country\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they want opposite when freedom and liberty than one opportunity that is what we want that's what we have and we must continue it\nWhich is the best Marty all the best thing I Know you'll bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of Pennsylvania and Lehigh County uh we'll be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you gotta understand this is now well how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nOne point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience that if everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're going to vote\nAnd you're not going to stay home and you've got to put any effort and you're not going to give a half of ... to ... below zero half a vote to Schumer it could be you know shocked the world again kind of night is happy you stay home than it's you know maybe we splits but the baby in the sense that\nYou know it's okay we said we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any one of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our does he telephones ah let's say Hi\nTo Katherine is in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you enough how much my husband and I just absolutely I think you are the greatest not because of just what you inform us because of your courage and the line I'm hearts\nAnd prayers go out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that said our hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage\nAnd by the way you are right up there with President Trump\nAnd his entire family and those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country is to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way but maintain your credibility by being civil oh stand up\nTo all these bullies and oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing and the lie they're telling about our gear presidents I'm comparing him to Hitler and style and which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to but the problem is we've got a lot of\nA lot of very frightened people I think President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation because he's he's taken the curtain back\nAnd all the corruption in Washington and then something I'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner who have to call it a surgeon five years ago and still fighting today that's that's fine but I just want to say if if the conservatives had some shared risk and stick together and consolidate\nAnd it's hard to shed risk to gather consolidated\nYou gotta let me tell you why are we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they've been so wrong Ben Sasse is one of them Bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them\nYou know the if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh it was Donald Trump that did it you know doesn't matter that he transformed the economy all things that they say that they is conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation\nA energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify\nSecuring America's borders all of the things that doesn't they hate it all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way that that that set everything the way they wanted to say it but\nThe problem is the old establishment way of doing things gets nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington\nAnd exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know they're they're the type of Republicans the basically want to just sit in power in the corner and and act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs that you so I you know it's it is what it is I the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we've built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security or in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nI Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest bad as military and that we can handle any threat to the world throws at us\nAnd we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil when evil you know raises its ugly head but there's it's happened before and it's gonna happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically\n... you know temper tantrum politics of never Trump or is there they're still mad they got it wrong you know we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we will not have the regulations to roll back\nWouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have that's why in eight days when people go out and vote this all matters a major question people have to ask is are you're better off than you were two years ago\nIn terms of the economy peace\nAnd prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue if you want America to remain a leader on the world stage if you're not afraid to have a president that is willing to be a tough negotiator on your behalf\nBe a trade or NATO or Kim Jong un we didn't give anything that Kim Jong un nothing and look at what we've gotten back a shot at peace\nAnd denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula you know if you want a president that says it's going to respect our constitution the rule of law are our laws on borders and security and respect our sovereignty first", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "30"}
