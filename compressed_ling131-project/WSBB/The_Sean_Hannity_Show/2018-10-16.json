fights and put start brawls on march I won't support them\nThat's right I agree too now whether a group we're getting into some sort of group as a hate group has to do with its ideology what it's\nDoing why can't you don't have a field let me let you go first we heard of Proud Boys which is supposed to be I I read a male chauvinist group um and the that's the first time you've heard about

Greg crowds if you see cabinet officials follow them into grocery stores gas stations department stores what do you think is going to happen what will likely scenario if they listen to work\nWell I

preventing more thanks for having to\nYou're always welcome a much gets busy phones will go to Atlanta I Will say Hi to I'm All right let's go to our phones we had a rubber does in a king North Carolina\nPhones we had a Robert is in a king North Carolina Robert Hi how are you glad you called sir\nA very very very honored to speak with you a very but I'll do major help um I have a daughter twenty two awesome she didn't vote for Trump She\nPretty much one against the grain of everything he used on ah luckily have been able to get her to see the good and everything that Trump has done for this country\nWhere I'm Adam ... is with judge Kavanaugh I'm shooting just\nI Can't get her to see the conservative side of it how the Democrats are going to bad mouths anybody anybody four to five miles you know our values and I I Can't ... I\nMean we spend a lot of time going over all the allegations and in the case or professor Ford or Bessie Ramirez or\nThe sweat ... et cetera I mean in every particular case and\nUm I Would just lay out to your daughter and then go all over you know what the allegations were how they came out whereas any corroboration and any of the cases I mean\nI thought the most outrageous one was the final one to get by miss sweating egg you was claiming and her story shifted and changed dramatically within the course of a week from my perspective\nAnd I think you know she was basically claiming almost on a weekend basis that these kids were drugging\nThese young girls teenage girls and boys will wind up in the halls and they were waiting their turn to gang rape the girls\nNow ... hard pressed\nKnow again the day the media ... high or low widened far to find any cooperation\nAnd they weren't able to the case of Mr Ford the one I witnessed she placed in the room so that didn't happen or even her best friend says she doesn't remember any parties that she was out with judge Kavanaugh so\nYou do need some type of corroboration if you believe in due process in presumption of innocence and I think we I think the Republicans handled it with the sensitivity of\nDeserves with the severity it deserves considering the severity of the allegation\nBut I'm not a person that Russia just a judgment on ... you have to I Believe that it served this country well to follow the rule of law and due process\nAnd a presumption of innocence and I think that happened in this case and I think the person that laid out the best case and that was what Susan Collins\nAnyway thank you Robert good luck with that um let me play you know twenty two days I just want to remind you\nWe now know I was telling me earlier in the program today Democrats or advice don't talk about open borders in an elimination against any more it's not helping us don't talk about impeachment is not helping us even Maxine Waters admitting that they're telling your don't talk about these things\nYou know but remember this will be their agenda\nIn twenty two days they will want enlist investigations they wouldn't want impeachment they want to open borders they want to eliminate ice they want Obamacare and they want their crumbs back\nAnd this woman Nancy Pelosi would be your speaker so pretty much if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi and her views on her values which are radical San Francisco views and values listen\nI can still every African ... we have to pass a bill that you can find out what is in ...\nIn terms of the phone is set in ... versus the problems and they say on our camping too far fetched to ... ...\nAnd ... and then we have and the thing that I think the issue of citizenship if not\nJust about these long people which would be tested soon enough for that other ... ... ... or anything in our country was under contention inpatient reform hid in my view is the only pass a long time passing earned pot or in the past ...\nI've ever had before that\nRely on camera\nCable than\nOur ...\nSaying they're asking people at the center of the same ground now to kind of\nThings and say this gives them some stock and then in the in some pretty slow [noise] certainly help sell\nIt said that he was like ... to single payer health care program and cancel rings taxes I think they mean roll back the tax cuts that they pass the fear is that what do you think I might have been tied to evacuate [laughter]\nActually city how law enforcement how how their\nFamily safe I think the country here who are working for a military school who are pregnant\nPeople are suffering kind of asking check I Do think that if there's ever going to be an opportunity to raise the gas tax return\nWhen gas prices are so low oil prices are ... times would do it\nI I I just don't even know why I uprisings fall into the country and maybe they will be\nOne job the quickest way to do\nProvide more finding some stuff\nOver time we're not that person can shop ... theater\n... thinking more of a picture of it stopped the night if he thinks that life than I can do every African ...\nSo that's what's at stake in twenty two days just like in the Senate if you're in Montana or North Dakota Indiana Missouri if here in Arizona and Nevada or Florida well you if you vote for the Democrat you're voting basically for Chuck Schumer is that's who they're going to vote with\nThat's that's who they will be that sold there'll be listening to that ... they will be aligning themselves with that so they will be voting for for their leader\nAnd we already we've had eight years of this and the fact that we're our memories or that short it's frightening at times to me All right back to our busy phones as we say Hi to skip isn't Utah skipped Hi how are you glad you called\nThere's extra thanks for taking my call I'm listening to question what are these people run on the other shoe to most scares me the most is they seem to be running on a hatred for America I'm Around for it but everything that America is known for is just seems to\nDestroyed by these I don't want a sweetheart abroad in St Louis left the left hates America I think there is a a a significant even at times portion of the radical left in this country that literally they hate\nAmerican exceptionalism America's role in the world\nUm they don't like our economic system they believe in they don't believe in capitalism they support socialism they bought redistribution they don't on freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged 'cause I think they are now focused all of their anger on Donald Trump in all things Trump\nAnd you know it's just it's just pouring out of them\nYou know we've tried a lot of these policies we've tried apologizing we've tried bribing dictators under Obama we tried redistribution under Obama we've tried socialized medicine under Obama and he's the first president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in the history of the country\nYou know we know the disaster of Obamacare note of millions lost their doctors their plans and they paid twice three times the amount they weren't pay in spite of promises a we know that at the end of his eight years we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty\nYou know numbers means something\nAnd frankly to go back\nTo the failed policies now look", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "16"}
