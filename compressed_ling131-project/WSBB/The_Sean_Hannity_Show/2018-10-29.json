All right maybe I can get buried by for me he is in Virginia yes and he's actually having a lot more trouble than I Am\nHe had his information was the first time I've seen this on a show the first time I've heard someone call in and say their information was sold on the dark Web\nWas sold crunches ISP had given him a warning that they had seen some sort of a breach and that large amounts of data was being downloaded away from him um\nWhen they were not home like fifty gigs at a at\nChunk wow then who's the security company that he's with contacted him and said that his email and possibly as password or sold on the dark Web\nWell I'm sure it wasn't just as email probably right and that's all of a brave all to probably detect a he also said that he was part of the target breach\nAnd the Equifax breach blue sky part of the Yahoo has been talking about that and just to find my gosh poor guy\nYou know ... and ... did you win the one point six billion dollars this past week buried come

anything I haven't checked my tickets 'cause I don't live in South Carolina [laughter] that's true so you so you've not had a good time or the last couple of months huh\n[noise] well it's all happened just for you in the last month when all this information came to me\nI said okay and so and so you're so the information that that they told you just what he said to Andrew is that that your router was compromised and your Gmail account was compromise is that what I heard\nThe soil they believe is ... and then what steps have you taken sense\nEvery once in the same thing that I needed to immediately change passwords and make them complex on the router and also the change passwords on my email and anything that my email is used for to get into in a kennel Mm So for instance a bank account\nKen Mm So for instance a bank account if I sign up with my email I should change the password correct so I've done all of that okay and now you're wondering what else can you do wow\nYeah I'm Wondering about like is there such a thing as an ... and for all the\nUh or some sort of a bundled up chicken by the yeah monitors things uh it just seems like the alternative is to put\nA different programs are absent place like Mao or I should mention flowers and password manager and so forth and I'm looking for something more comprehensive and this is serious business here\nUm this is all of our data and I'm concerned about maybe some a professional type of protection\nI see okay and you know what and rightfully so I mean because you know it's it's once you get your data compromises you feel so vulnerable don't you I mean it's like sure you know all this was going on and you had no idea until somebody told you that this information is being downloaded through the router\nAnd did they say that maybe are computers are being used to house any type of pirated material\nNever heard a ...\nOr a cause that's a lot of data fifty gigs in a day I mean that's huge\nAh so ... more than once and you feel well yes that's what I was thinking that maybe a cause ... sometimes with\nThe the hackers do is that they find a vulnerable computer and then they house files there and then they tell everybody to go access the files on your computer or so that this way they're not liable or you know they they it's harder for them to be tracked okay to be tracked down [noise]\nUh so I Would definitely go through and look at data usage on any type of gadget that was connected to it you know with the route or like you said like you know you give it a good a password and you can also do Mac addressing have you lived in into that\nYou know get media access\nControl or what that means is that the only devices that are going to have access to your route or a those devices that you permission okay\nAnd and so I Would definitely turn that on for Mac addressing a you also want to make sure that the DNS servers have has not made that they have not been changed as well uh and you can get into your router and also your ... to do that turn on the Mac fire walls also with your\nGoogle Account you want to do a security events check there's a lot you need to do Barry really I'm so

prayers it on your watch some of these people out there pulling out all the stops all weekend long to tie Saturday Saturdays anti Semitic massacre that Trump\nIs too big facts getting in the way all the Republican Party reject anti Semitism out of hand it's it's the Democratic party leaders I never get in a rural what Louis Farrakhan unless I was going to get into the grill and drill him about is anti Semitism and his racism\nThe shooter this guy Bowers despised President Trump because he thought Trump was quote controlled by Jews and not only that part of Trump's family is Jewish\nAnd and so on and so forth you know apparently it you know as Ron ... rightfully said uh this weekend on Fox News that you know these very all an anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that is taking place in this was something that the president raised the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've read it we've studied it they've gone through it all and we still see so much of it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel\nOr president said we will see their destruction which is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism\nYou know Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump but there's the president is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nThe day that they mailed this the first device was sent to George Soros is house first thing I sat on the radio I said we've got ... this can happen in this country\nI Know he's not a fan of mine in any of the people that were threatened by these bombs but the rush to politicize this and turn this into well this is who conservatives are is just one big lie\nWhat you're watching unfold before you're very eyes is you know the race to politicize tragedies thank God those twelve or Thirteen PVC bombs didn't go off and nobody lost their life thank God\nBut that wasn't Donald Trump's fault\nAnd then you can look at this terrible tragedy and they're shooting in the synagogue by this rabid anti Semite racist and also a Trump ... not that it should even be relevant it's getting scary we had real bullets used over the weekend also to shoot up a Republican Party headquarters in Florida\nYou know and that could have killed people\nSouth Daytona police investigating after they said that someone shot out the window of the local county Republican headquarters police work arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities we have another threat of a man who's accused the guy who's been arrested by threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo\nThat story came out this week that he's been threatened there was a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn and you had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half a dozen angry liberal protestors they had to be removed\nYou know you think of the language or we can't be civil with Republicans and kick them and all the other comments that have been made and then the other silence when it happens to a conservative\nReally shouldn't be something that's political\nAnd calling somebody fake news I mean it is so disgusting over CNN\nSomebody sent me a transcript focus was on news busters of hunting dumped the oh I understand that CNN doesn't like fake news and they don't like being called fake news but they are fake news and other news organization anymore they have gone fulltime destroyed Trump every second of every minute pretty much of every day that's what they do\nSo they have this panel I guess that they put together and they're talking about what happened in the synagogue shooting and we have to look closely at the poison being spread sometimes on television sometimes out of the mouths of political leaders and often times on ugly dark corners of social media as can be pretty ugly\nAnd it goes on the first panelist as Bill Kristol and never Trump her he attacks Fox News I'm like hello\nWhat we can't have conservatives in my I support mainstream conservatism bill I don't know what happened to you\nI support original is on the Supreme Court I support lower\nHappen to you I support original is on the Supreme Court I support lower taxes less government burdensome regulation I support energy independence\nI support legal immigration I support border security I support peace through strength and a tough national security posture with a strong military to defend the values that we all believe it and I support\nYou know a free press even to be wrong even criticize the media for being role at Washington Post columnist comes out some woman I've never heard of Margaret Sullivan\nYou know praising or analysis in the Democratic threats et cetera et cetera reads like a list of Sean Hannity's free broad ... broadcast crib notes\nThat is asked point blank if she blame people on the right like\nKennedy for the violence I Love Martin about this this week a diversity bomb attacks or the suspicious packages you said you know looking all this target city this read like a list of Sean Hannity is pre broadcast ... notes that was the way you put in your Washington Post off again are blaming the hands of the world\nI think they have a share of I'm sort of the wrapping up of hatred on without regard for a white defect mighty and without much regard for the truth I mean the way things are being patch on Fox and and\nA pro Trump right wing media is dangerous and it's destructive so I think we need to call it what it is\n... Lewis was on from the Daily Beast of all players and he actually was the only one that made even a little since you said the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be Hannah these targeted\nI don't want to have perverse incentives to gin up their base for elections I\nThink a cable news has incentive to a gentleman anger and anxiety and passion for ratings same thing with websites with clicks and tweets a I agree with everything that we said so far today the only thing I Would add is\nTomorrow it could be Sean Hannity who was targeted for a Republican congressman who was targeted and why agreed with the combination of what Fox has done in terms of gender up this anger over the caravan I think that this is a much more widespread problem\nIt is more widespread than I have had far more instances and I'm willing to talk about a real credible threats towards me and my family including the one that I did share last week\nWas white powder purported to be anthrax sent to my office and one of my employees having to spend an entire day in isolation scared out of her mind\nAnd it's been worse but obviously these people not listening to what I'm saying\nBecause I have been saying we've got to know what what do I advocate I'm like okay I Want I Want these principles stood up for\nI fight for the American forgotten men and women I fight for lower taxes less pure bureaucratic regulation energy independence Supreme Court nominees that believe in the constitution\nI Believe we should secure our borders legal immigration these are things I I believed in my entire life and career a strong military security for the American people a strong stand against evil in our time\nIt's not that complicated\nI Know what the democratic agenda is if they win it's gonna be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they said they want their crumbs back we know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the elimination of ice and they think Obamacare works and it doesn't\nYou know you had an MSNBC you know literally pressing the Israeli ambassador germ are to blame Trump for the synagogue attack that's how sick it's gotten\nYou know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political phones no he's not\nBut I guess it's an easy blame game\nSo now we've taken the predictable every two four years Republicans are racist and sexist a massage therapist and Xena phobic Islamophobia homophobic and they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff and now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true and it's not any conservative I Would ever support\nAnd then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue it was a very ill an anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump\nBut that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing that narrative you know this is you know\nWatch watching the Washington Post alone is unbelievable Fox doesn't their headlights Fox News and the rest of the right wing media can escape responsibility oh I've been the biggest supporter of Israel that I Know in the mainstream media have been my entire\nFriends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades than there during the war and been there at other times reporting showing people the tunnels that nobody else\nShowing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show them friends who they who Brock formerly Shimon Peres\nLet's name names according to the Washington Post Trump's hate analyze our inciting extremist oh this extreme as in the synagogue headed Trump those are the Washington Post headlights that you got\nTrump to GOP defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people on CNN fake news that couldn't identify 'em up for who they are these phony hypocrites\nTrump blames and you know something when the media lives twenty four seven and they get called out that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living in now here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch called\nAnd I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard but possible people in New Jersey clearly\nFed up with an end us then I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why Floridians are flirting with Gil almost got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic\nJob as governor and he'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate I think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada\nI don't know why Christ in similar cinema well we've got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nI don't see how somebody who supported Americans joining the Taliban could win in Arizona and calling her own state crazy and the meth lab a democracy and inviting radical lawyers for the blind shake I don't know how she survives\nAbout her husband does more Asians well on behalf\nGeorge Clooney Tory\nParty costumes Hawaii on the set of the\nEntertainment man when he denied it seven thirty on channel\nThat when you ask me be damned ...\nMedia group station\nTwenty four hour news

let's take you to the Pentagon yeah this'll be the formal announcement of we believe thousands of active duty troops to be sent to the Mexican border a number that is much higher than expected initially let's go there now and we'll hear this lot visual an eminent\nRemarks after which will open enough for a few questions with us turn over two commissioners having the Mac [noise]\nGood afternoon and welcome a commanding general Sean a sea of us northern command and I wanted to update you on our efforts to prepare for enhanced security operations in order to address the potential for large groups of migrants to arrive at the U.S border as part of a so called caravan\nAs up this afternoon we continue to attract a large group of approximately thirty five hundred traveling through southern Mexico for the state and intent to reach the U.S more this group is near the ... border in southern Mexico\nFor also aware of a second large group of migrants at the ... dog and border crossing between Guatemala and Mexico side as soon as for the second group around three thousand as well\nTo put these numbers in context we're already facing a border security and humanitarian crisis at our southwest more each day on average for the last three weeks CBP has encountered a combination of almost Nineteen hundred persons apprehended crossing the border illegally were presenting without documents at ports of entry\nOver half of these arrivals have been made up a family unit an unaccompanied children will play some cells in the hands of violent human smugglers paying seven thousand per person to make the journey they're incentivized to try to cross by our border by the gas in our legal framework and the expectation that they will be allowed to stay\nThis means that at any given moment there are tens of thousands of intending migrants between the Guatemalan border and the U.S for a moving toward this at any given time within that flow and included are about Seventeen thousand criminals last year along with horn smugglers and people from over a hundred countries around the world\nAt our immigration system is unable to effectively process and repatriating those without the right to remain in the United states do to extensive backlogs in our courts are and court restrictions on detaining people through their immigration proceedings\nWhat is new and challenging about this caravan phenomenon is the formation of multiple large groups would present unique safety and border security threats\nFor the two large groups of we're following we've already seen the first one make unlawful entry across to international borders and the second still in Guatemala has deployed violence in dangerous tactics against Guatemalan and Mexican border security teams\nAccordingly we're preparing for the contingency of a large group arriving persons intending to enter the United states in the next several weeks\nOur message to the organizers and participants in this tournament as simple as the president and secretary Nielsen have made clear we will not allow a large group to enter the United states in an unsafe and unlawful manner\nFor those that seek to cross the border illegally we'll apprehend them and fully enforce the laws of the United states\nFor those who seek to make an asylum claim safely unlawfully at a port of entry the governor of Mexico has already offered you protection and employment authorization if he ... alleged persecution at home you have arrived at a safe place to make your claim\nIf you're an economic migrant seeking to join family members in the United states we should return home and apply for the appropriate visa false CBP and\nThe appropriate visa fall CBP and its da chest partners process over thirty eight thousand in admissible persons claiming fear return to their home country safely and efficiently at our ports of entry last year there is no benefit to be part of a large group\nThe caravan has already been offered protections in Mexico you will not be allowed to enter the U.S the same way\nI Would like to note here that we very much appreciate the efforts of the government to Mexico to address the challenging situation and according to the highest principles the protection of human rights and respect for migrants while upholding the integrity of the Mexican border in Mexican immigration law\nWe also appreciate the continuing communication and efforts of our Central American partners especially Guatemala to address the challenges of these large groups\nIn terms of our preparations of the border yesterday we launched launched operation secure line in multi faith and flexible operational response designed to ensure that we're prepared for any number of contingencies\nInvolved with the arrival and it has a crossing of a large group of intending migrants at our border whether they attempt to cross out of port of entry for unlawfully in between ports of entry\nAn important principle here is a border security is a law enforcement mission and as the unified border security agency in the United states CBP as well equipped along with support from inner agency federal state and local partners\nTo manage multiple contingencies varying size since we initiated are planning two weeks ago we've completed updated assessments of each of our twenty six crossing points on the southwest border and already deployed one hundred specially trained special response team operators to prepare plans for each location\nInformation on the approach of a large group at a port of injuries available we have at the ready one thousand CBP officers including two hundred and fifty tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals with training on managing contingencies including riot control\nBetween ports of entry we have an additional eight hundred and thirty border patrol agents on standby ready to deploy to include a hundred and forty special operations agents three hundred and eighty five mobile response team agents and an additional three hundred and fifty agents from unaffected sectors\nThese agents will be augmented and supported by over two dozen CBP air assets for surveillance and mobile response including for black hawks six additional helicopters as well as multiple fixed wing assets an unmanned aerial systems\nDue to the large size of the potential Caribbean may arrive at the border however the department of homeland security has further requested the support of the department of defense\nThis is an addition to the two thousand National Guard personnel already augmenting operations under operation guardian support and making an impact and border security supporting apprehensions and drug seizures since last year\nSpecifically CBP had requested the DOT provide support in several key areas significant air and ground transportation logistic support to move CBP personnel and equipment to locations of operational focus\nEngineering capabilities and equipment to help ensure our ability to secure our illegal crossings in key areas of the border medical support units mobile housing for sustaining CBP deployed personnel and extensive planning support\nI Will turn it over to general Shawna see to detail DOD is robust response to our request for support and just a moment\nBut let me close by saying that regardless of the operational contingencies we face along with his interagency partners and unprecedented support from DOD CBP will ensure more security we will not allow a large group to enter the U.S unlawfully we'll maintain lawful trade and travel the greatest extent possible\nWe will act in accordance with the highest principles of law enforcement\nWe will treat intending migrants humanely and professionally at all times and the safety of CBP personnel especially our law enforcement personnel on the front lines as well as the traveling public will remain paramount thank you for\nA way to W. S. me that is the customs and border service commissioner Kevin ... speaking from Washington\nWill not allow a large group to enter the United states in an unsafe and an unlawful manner he was head was talking about that now famous caravan of migrants still in southern Mexico headed toward the U.S border he's talking about also is the second group further south of about three thousand people\nWe believe about five thousand US you turned out to be deployed to the water here is the U.S northern command general inherent OCE honestly ...\nWith the department of homeland security example is included the recent support for hurricane Michael Hurricane Florence our cyber security initiative and our critical infrastructure protection that we're doing with the department of homeland security\nAre missing a homeland defense is inextricably linked the department of homeland security mission of homeland security operation faithful patriots as we named the military operation supporting CBP in heartening that southwest border is the latest example of this critical partnership\nPeddling wise about Israel and that's very very dangerous if you believe words matter\nWords matter this was the deadliest anti Semitic attacking us history the president also saying we will seek their destruction which I agree with I got to take a ...\nWe will seek their destruction which I agree with\nI got to take a break but we'll come back more with rose tenant and David shown on the other side I saw friends that show many have done it again right if you look in the mirror what do you see maybe feel a little bit of sag along your jaw line um remember ... when he gets rid of bags and pumping this Sunday your eyes at their number one best selling product you can't get it in any store\nAnd don't forget there's sunspot correct or you had a little too much sun in the summertime\nAll ... now done it again they're introducing their brand new Gen you sell jaw line treatment with dual peptide and empty ... technology which is their most advanced technology ever so in other words it tightens any sagging jolt the toll on you might have\nAnd and Linda wants to say that it's what is it do it ...\nIt's not that sensitive skin that we don't pay attention to and aren't drawn line in our next and it's just like feel like a plump set up what is the holy it's like you know every woman wants no wrinkles in your next shouldn't be a you know neglect it and this is a great product and it's just what you're saying it's okay if I ever ankles is that we would never say that now you have no wrinkles looking well they they try\nTerry ingredients natural peptides plan stem cell therapy the only ingredients in a lot of these you can't get in any store that's white Gen yourself so confident in their products you get to try it when you order Gen yourself to get rid of bags and puffing as well you're also going to get this brand new product for free\nIt's January ... jaw line treatment for free just go to Jenny assault dot com or call eight hundred skin vibes zero nine eight hundred skin vibe zero nine hundred percent\nGuaranteed your satisfaction guaranteed all your money back no questions asked so you can start looking better tomorrow is Paul Paul now eight hundred skin vice zero nine go to the website Jen you sell dot com genius L. dot com once again ... has done themselves [noise]\nShaun\nAnd seven fifty you asked me [noise]\nFor Twenty one term O W has got to do a lot of money into the W I began to anybody out out of the doubt God Dr exit the game that I Believe I have been a gab recovery because a separate\nProblems to anybody about the area's large I waited on the on the earlier crash now just don't want to ruin road you'll know\nEnds up north down from ...

for your money just for you right off the cutting we'll come to shame company Atlanta has direct diamond importer now you have a friend in the diamond business Shane Company in shank oh dot com\nSo much to get done today that the print edition network pick up the dry cleaning\nAnd then stop at a grocery store so much to do let's get this day started\nBecause more names are just the lord and you've got places to be your morning news in five minutes or less get in on the morning rush weekdays five to seven am living a lie\nNo other vehicles going back to the cells in Nineteen Mercedes Benz she LA as you go to the MBA usa dot com and see for yourself for a visit your land area dealer or test drive today [noise]\nOr what do you think there will WSBIU heavy downtown what do you have anybody by now that was the lead in the area down the good actors out I'd wanting to work out delays like wanting to build again what do you have to\nFind out that was the chapel at West free weights when he was okay you're going to get a hold of art was the moderate all you got it every county Seventy five or trying to make the way to go out to leave it up to twenty four trouble\nThe traffic all afternoon do we do have the\nRight as we continue rose tenant and David shown you look at article after article in the Washington Post\nRose tenant you know saying that the ... the president to the Senate gone synagogue mass murder\nAnd and that's insane ...\nI'm Sorry to interrupt you shine it isn't saying it it is it ... it it is them desperate trying to help the Democratic allies win elections\nI Love which at the rabbi sat rabbi Myers said that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please come he was not objecting at all to the president's visit which I appreciate and when we start focusing on this blame game which is what we do especially the the left media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happens to you know what really happened is as we just got an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those were the words that were true unspoken from him he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I Know so many of them they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else it of course is rushing away we had a doctor of analysts\nWho went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth\nThese were not acts of a nation divided that's what the last one says to believe the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not\nWe're a nation or community like this one\nLike any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice\nAnd and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it just makes me sick because we miss what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he said the bullet holes are too numerous to count\nBut we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been near one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off some branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nSo that Sean is who we are and date as a nation I Know you agree that we aren't the nation we are not divided\nAnd ... and ... most of us or not but the blame game ... interests on gas and it's\nAll right well thank you both again a rose our thoughts and prayers to all our friends of Pittsburgh and to the community and the synagogue and the rabbi please send more loving and regards and our prayers um\nWe knocked on a million nine hundred and seven thousand three hundred and twenty eight doors or through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and as of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day\nWe think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had a turtle watch\nI Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house or I look at rest muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing the president literally has been going state by state and out doing\nThe timing the president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this was really hard mid term election history is going against the tide here\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats the two oh five Republicans a two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean what our advice to people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignore the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nEverybody ... me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman and Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in a midterm election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen he won by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election where turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nI talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every targeted than in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to as few as twenty three hundred are undecided voters and an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelical for pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got emails on about half of them uh we we have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us more tax and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and\nMinnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power but then I say that and then I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them could tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right and now we really see the house is on the bubble we\nThink it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now a hundred seats in play and probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had all stopped up you know two three four five and he lost by four\nIt's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers and the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters directly\nOn line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get art bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking an election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shocked the world again we can do against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally when I read the exit polls the five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and but at that moment reading the exit polls Trump lost Florida he lost North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he loves Michigan the last was constantly last at all\nI'd be barely won the state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls at five Fifteen election do show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly how do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the vote out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI have to be honest with you Sean I got to give credit where credit's due first of all a to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited and secondly to the Democrats for during the Kavanaugh nomination\nTrying to air and destroy a good man and his family and we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen and we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood we had a woman the other day that was verbally accosted a guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenities at her she sent me an email later and said not only am I not that church that I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's\nThat kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country you know at at times like this Sean ...\nThat kind of commitment to our country you know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of decency and character still alive in this country the answer is a ... yeah it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is the use of social media I don't think anybody has a more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think ah you know for\nRocco bomber was the first social media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president of the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master\nTelevision but if Obama was the pioneer I assure you trust has mastered it or not only in his use of social media platforms but also the thing is that his campaign ... dead in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched\nIt up against social media platforms Seventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact her on Twitter or Facebook or another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get\nDropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing to their social media count then begin to go elsewhere\nSo I agree look anything's possible I ... I don't take things for granted\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening because I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic 'em and you can see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate then they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's a split decision where Republicans get seats in the Senate ... to become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but this will get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half of Oprah below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for ...\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap that one separated the two sides has closed significantly since the cabinet nominations\nYou know you see different polls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president with\nA very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and this\nOne gentleman who was volunteering told me he was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThat we're over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on the jumbotron they stay there to show their support you simply cannot quantity ... quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nOr a quick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition might cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security\nThat's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security is layers of protection spread across computers networks programs\nAnd realize not only ON Technology but also making smart choices\nLike keeping software updated in staying informed on cyber safety now consumers also need cyber security to protect their digital lives in today's connected world it just takes one weak link criminals get in a thank goodness there's the all new life lock identity theft protection with the added power of Norton Security and that protects\nYou against threats to your identity or devices that you can't see or fix on your own now new life lock Norton Security\nWell you can get it now like lock dot com you need it in this day and age protect your name your reputation your finances\nLife locked dot com one eight hundred life lock promo code Hannity you get an extra ten percent off your first year and for a limited time may twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with your annual enrollment as life locked dot com one eight hundred life lock promo code Hannity will continue", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "29"}
