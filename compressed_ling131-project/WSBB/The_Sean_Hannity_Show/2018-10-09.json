we gotta look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\nRight I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with with with this uh\nThe OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is to follow her can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nKnow that it's damning and you're right but you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody would have happened in twenty
