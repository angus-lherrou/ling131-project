a thank you again both of you are familiar with us what about this story of the treasury employee charged with leaking financial information on Trump campaign officials in the Russians now been arrested and charged pretty outrageous and it makes me think why does this happen to Hillary and hopping\n[noise] you know you got to be really concerned about that um and I would like to learn more about the fact that the case and the extent to which the Russian may have thought him out\nBut it's very dangerous when government officials but security clearances or providing um that's of

apologies uh I'd say that's something we really need to remember as a country\nFollow him into grocery stores in gas stations and follow them into\nYou know department stores oh Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen Ted Cruz and his wife\nMitch McConnell and that we got a the latest incident where we have the Minnesota Democratic Party suspended a spokesman recalling violence against Republicans who GOP candidates in Minnesota been assaulted today and what our looks like politically motivated attacks\nDemocratic farmer labor party has had the\nTax democratic farmer labor party has had to suspend their communication staffer uh only for a week without pay after making a Facebook post joking that Democrats would bring Republican to the guillotine the day after the midterm elections and you got the Minnesota Republican Party chairman\nYou know saying the suspension is not enough call for the meter firing here and one state representative Sarah Anderson is her name in Plymouth and Minnesota campaigning Sunday saw man kicking her yard signs\nA daunting her into one thing other GOP candidates and she said please stop he refused saying he's an anarchist could do whatever they want\nSo the politician did what every red blooded American would do she tried to catch the incident on video and then the assailant was having none of that cursing at are backing her into the street and tell her to go kill yourself didn't walk to a nearby BP presumably to stop stock up on\nYou know whatever she does a mountain dew whatever it happens to be\nThey go to source or whatever but Anderson gave chase in her car the man charged her again leaning through the window punching her\nYou know I I mean it's unbelievable and that's fine incident came two days after another House Republican candidate chain that Clinton was punched in the face in St George township northeast of St Cloud is just campaigning in a bar in a restaurant with a larger guy approaches them described the conversation as Amy a bull until the guy\nLiterally and invoke the hallowed name of the middle class the man we can only assume didn't wish to hear another politician talking about or whatever so punches the Republican in the face\nOh getting their faces oh ah create a crowd you know follow them into a grocery stores gas stations department stores restaurants then I Want it anywhere anymore\nAnthony Scaramucci is with us by the way next week he's got a great book I've been reading it I got an early copy it's phenomenal and it's called the Trump the blue collar president\nUh I notice that it's too early to talk about the book but you tell some amazing stories about who really Donald Trump is where he came from and and his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot reading it how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know you're you're you're mentioning a lot of very interesting things and one thing I always remember that the president he may hit hardest shot a buddy always hit second any often hits last I've never seen him unilaterally come after anybody it's only after the attack him\nThat he doubles down and starts to counter punch you know so Elizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas or a Republican candidate in the primary Jackie and then he fires off the nickname\nSo the the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy until you start shooting at him then once you start shooting at him he's going to hit you with the full force there I just think it's a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nAnd let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and he he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street to the heat and ah and I know both I mean\nYou know yell at me he yelled at me after the cursing gotta remember like the guy Ryan Lizz his legs was total wire she basically faded me into the call but then he is asking me to do a profile with them and then that's when I respond to put the expert but you know what it is what it is ... but what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less\nStreet Anthony I Need more Harvard Anthony but you know what John what makes you great on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close is that we both have a little bit of that interest only when you were bussing\nOn I was washing dishes bussing tables I was a cook yeah that's right but you know something like a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything whether years I spent and construction which was two decades of my life and I don't know I mean I think a lot of us in that are blessed and lucky and successful\nI met too many people that forget what they come from and I'm not going to forget where it came from and I'm just not as I was not in ...\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain that your story or my story is a classical American story a law where we were in these aspirational working class families and our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents into the American dream\nAnd so ah what the president is trying to do would you try to do every day what I Try to do in my small way to see if we can make that happen for people\nThat were similarly situated are currently ... similarly situated the way we were in the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks of never broke my oil from the president because I really do believe is horse in the right place and I really believe that uh you know she is the right\nBut that is in line the proof is in the ... I mean when when you go ... ears adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more in poverty you can't get three they only president never to get three percent GDP Growth the worst recovery ... support it\nPresident never to get three percent GDP Growth\nThe worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we got four point two percent for the second quarter of the GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter you know now we have four million more Americans working eight million out of office food stamps and out of poverty\nI'm thinking okay finally the forgotten men and women the young Scaramucci's on Hannity's are now doing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nI you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing to de layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back\nOn shore of the United states I Know you talk a lot about uh the re engineered now after the U.S MCA now\nUh Shaun I'm going through that you know I'm trained as an economist and I'm running an eleven and a half billion dollars on that I found it\nOn that is going to have monumental positive benefits to middle and lower middle class families the re engineering of that trade agreement because it's just the configuration of the cars\nJust the uh the manufacturing coins and the price on labor or that's been agreed to in those agreements is going to need more disposable income working class family and by the way you know where was the establishment politicians\nThinking about those people over the twenty five years of NAFTA shock well where where they\nKnow where a quick break right back will continue more with Anthony Scaramucci on the other side and your calls eight hundred nine four one Sean hey I've got the best home security system to protect your home your family the best the greatest in the industry and it's simply say home security and\nI Know look you got to know the craftsmanship matters the most you can skip out on corners of cut corners I Know that as a contractor\nWhen it comes to protecting your family only one company I trust simply save home security they make a really small sensors that don't destroy the look of your home there's no installation fee it's a simple set up without frustration you can even take the system from home to home even if you're renting you take it with you when you move\nAnd the great thing about simply save home security it works even if there's a power outage redound wires why this is the type of incredible craftsmanship they have unlike any other home security system you never sign a contract\nYou never pay for installation fees you don't have to pay huge monthly bills like fifty bucks a month no fourteen Ninety nine a month\nIs go to simply say ... dot com you'll save ten percent on your system to protect your home and\nFamily today that simply said Hannity dot com simply save Hannity dot com [noise] is\nSean Hannity show\nFive AM seven fifty do you have to be [noise]\n... horrible that the guy got everybody got too many by the Aberdeen somebody's already been there for you about forty to forty five minutes probably gotta do what are you on the twenty five ...\nWorking around twenty three way\nNorth out of committee five is proper died and then what do you get to find out that it's going to pay forty five fifty minutes from Georgia for a hundred people will drive forty one looks to be able to trouble like older still shut down south up to eighty five here for road\nRiver road we also have well they actually wrote earlier crash it believes activity just south of\nInstant information up there on a browser will double ... showing two planes knocked out injury crash Georgia four hundred north down ... seven use\nHighway nine Roswell route as an alternate a filling in as you leave bucket on four hundred north to enrich connected springs Marta station eighty five crowd begins at north through in Hillsboro spot either way's up through eye to what he finds it into a county passed Indian frail northwest Alex Williams Seventy\nFive north than it is not looking too bad you're seen a few break lights right around the duty once paces ferry area so look out for those delays also five Seventy five north and it's getting slower as you leave I Seventy five up the highway Ninety to this report brought you by the Georgia Lottery tonight Powerball jackpot\nIs three hundred and forty five million dollars to like a multi drop feature and stay in the game for the next several jackpot drawings\nDrawings every Wednesday and Saturday triple team traffic jam doing the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "17"}
