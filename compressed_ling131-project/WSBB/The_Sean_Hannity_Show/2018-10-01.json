burn that's why\nYou know we have all this identity politics look at is America better off today than it was two years ago when you the American people elected Trump\nBy every measure yes and look at the trade deal that no one's going to spend any time talking about today are at all which oh the president who's going to start trade wars with the rest of the world actually got a better deal\nFor American manufacturers you know those jobs that are never coming back that we now have a thirty year high of those jobs coming back\nCNBC Trump North American trade deal is a new dawn for the U.S auto industry this is great for American farmers is great for American manufacturers it's great for our auto industry you know a lot of my conservative friends they don't say the same thing I don't like his position on trade and I'm telling you I said to them all\nYou don't know I'm like I Do everything in Donald Trump's life as a negotiation if you don't say to Canada and Mexico that you're pulling out\nIf you don't take a strong stand and make them believe it you know they walked prime minister Trudeau to the final our last night grabbing concessions so that America got a much better deal than we had with NAFTA and this ain't nobody thought it would happen\nThat's a better deal than we had with NAFTA and this ain't nobody thought it would happen with the new president of Mexico and nobody thought that we can get NATO to step up and pay more considering we pay over Seventy cents of every dollar for defending NATO or the NATO alliance and nobody thought that our Western European allies that we're talking and complaining and having an hauling that\nDonald Trump ones better trade deals with our partners nobody goes that can happen if you don't say you're going to start at the start of a trade war if you don't say it and act like you mean you're not going to get concessions and the fact is no American president prior to him even dared broach the subject\nAnd meanwhile we see manufacturing jobs leaving states like Michigan Ohio Wisconsin Pennsylvania and for all the talking hatred of Donald Trump style\nThe fact that he breaks a lot of dishes to get things done and he says a lot of things to negotiate are we better off than we weren't two years ago are Hispanic Americans better off African Americans women in the workforce better off youth unemployment fourteen states unemployment low unemployment records his old records\nConsumer confidence Wall Street fight every objective discernible measure with doing better end result shouldn't matter but I'm thirty six days Democrats are hoping that they've created enough smoke and enough mirrors what did they do an eight years when Obama was president\nTheir policies failed on a spectacular level and if I had time I get back into it\nLet me tell you it was never going to be limited in scope this investigation ever it was never going to be you know just a week or so no that's not what they want and when the FBI comes back\nAnd all they do is real from what under penalty of of a felony the four people and the professor Ford case it said either they don't remember or it didn't happen like the case of the one I witnessed she said was in the room when the alleged incident happened\nThey're not going to be happy and they're going to try and stretch out even further and ask for more investigations they're going to find one little nugget that says because the FBI doesn't get recommendations\nThe ... the FBI is is not gonna give they're just going to give okay there's what they said 'cause they don't have any authority in this particular case you know and now we've got to look into all three claims even the ...\nYou know you wouldn't believe thirty six years ago routinely on weekends that boys were drug in girls\nAnd and then lining up in the halls waiting to you know rape gang rape these young women\nBecause that's what the woman said\nAnd that's what they want to investigate now\nUm it is seemingly having an impact according to the Remington research group forty eight percent in Missouri likely voters planning to vote for the Republican candidate Josh Hawley forty six percent said they plan to vote for McCaskill but\nThen the question of McCaskill's opposition a cabin or whether it's impacting their vote\nForty nine percent said it made them less likely to vote for McCaskill I think Democrats are gonna be watching those kinds of numbers very closely look their hope is is they they hope they've created enough smoke and fire over Russia still no evidence whatsoever\nThey hope that they create enough smoke and fire here that they can make this all about election day and I forget\nHow awful it was under Obama\nAnd that you won't get up and he voted for Trump but most people don't go out in midterms mid term elections are about those people that show up motivating your base to get out there if you want Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer as your majority leader you'll get the government you deserve\nIf you if you want to tune in on election night and thirty six days five weeks from tomorrow and hear Nancy Pelosi the speaker and Chuck Schumer the Senate majority leader if by the way Mitch McConnell railing about Ford was not told of the chairman's offers\nThat's interesting why do they keep them from her that was an interesting side bar\nThere is I Know that Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham on to investigate Dianne Feinstein now why did she holds us for six weeks would have plenty of time by the way it was six extra weeks to investigate why did they hold it because they wanted to create this crisis at this time but no there's a lot at stake\nIn in this upcoming election [noise]\nNow we did have um the case what what is the woman's name Rachel Mitchell was the one that was asking questions for the Republicans in the Senate\nA professor Ford and she did a very strong analysis of the case you said in the legal context here is my bottom line and he said she said case\nIs incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that she said Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate up for the reasons discuss below I Do not think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case\nBased on the evidence before the committee\nNor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient dissatisfied a preponderance of evidence standard\nThe fishing dissatisfied a preponderance of evidence standard even and you know I that's a pretty powerful statement\nNow we have what else do we have here so we got some other blue state numbers that are really interesting to watch um there's a lot of reasons why in New Jersey this was surprising to me Democratic Sen Robert Menendez is having a tough time getting re elected this is not a state anybody's been paying a lot of attention to\n'em it didn't help him this weekend when he used professor Ford's allegations to bash Brett Kavanaugh and he tweeted out Sunday or Saturday the details of professor Ford's testimony or heart wrenching to hear I Hope every single senator not only watches but listens\nAnd two days later the

send you a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is with us of he'll join us on Hannity tonight will be broadcasting from the nation's capital again\nAs the will turn out to be a historic week one way or the other um Mr Speaker thirty six days is election day and I will tell you there's something I never\nEver in a lot of years now witness the anger and the level of anger that exist on behalf of the Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these tactics\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh um is that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people that are wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there are three quarters steps here one is to communicate as you just did that this is about America\nThis was the most important midterm election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in order we keep going forward or we return to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between results and resistance\nAnd whether people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that work to move in the right direction or go back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama\nAnd then third I think the Republicans should have an eye opening next week we'll have sort of very positive think of it as a pledge of if if we were elected hero the next steps are all going to take care of the next good things are going to happen and I think that there are enough things working\nBetween the administration and the house and Senate Republicans that we can put together a very good positive campaign soldiers are three part campaign which America do you want results versus resistance and a commitment to an even better next two years\nThey're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not ... ... men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them\nTo control let's divide and conquer it's my oldest treasure it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans have raised a sexist I won't give the whole list but exactly they want to throw granny over the cliff\nNow with Supreme Court justices or if they have an opening ... there seems to be no\nBeen opening ... there seems to be no ... there's nothing they won't say or do now I mean your friends of the attorney for professor Katz\nDianne Feinstein recommended who herself is pretty radical left\nNow soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement between a senator Coons and not enough in order of ... like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they offer this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that tastes when actually has nothing to do with the details with justice without this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon disastrous an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor and for my very first thought was the San Francisco the races to watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist unit was going to happen because it had to happen\nAnd luckily there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight of radio Adam Missouri by the Democratic party subs a you know be like Republicans black cross cross is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nUh I remember it well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable technique that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... is making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug in girls and then waiting in line to gang and trail raped them\nThat this was happening with the regular cars but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to ... I went to school in one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive public gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody you know what else did either and she on the tenth one was right for self\nAnd didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country with all sorts of real problems to address as to what you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time it's the football\nAnd you have like the senator from Arizona's like don't really need to give us a hearing really if there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in the space Twenty years radical clearance that allowed him the codes ... nuclear arsenal\nThat vetted and yet we need another on the basis of claims that have no substantially shirt all remnant tacking Christian for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happens and for people she says repressive off or say it didn't happen\nAnd no one has the brass to ask questions in the\nBook it's a joke at is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it\nWell this is either some said they had no recollection amber of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor Ford is saying about I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor Ford identified one person and that was mark judge Moore judge having been in the room when this alleged assault took place\nAnd he has said over and over again that's not true\nNow they made statements under\nPenalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to extend it into that aspect and put some\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGot to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and\nUh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake in where the leaders other than when I hate to say it Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person\nWilling to tell the truth but where the rats were the other Nineteen Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but for common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and they they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters\nIf the president ran on getting the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth why aren't you afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but uh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and as Paul conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously as a news division but\nI kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews we have people give opinion um we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe make a lot of news on her show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to find new things to flushed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life to my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts Hawaii\nEvery night and I see our drop water every record explain what this means to really confusing time I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump got elected what what we can get a black crow what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learned any and so voters got mad at punished them are good for them but why we're\nSo that's I that's what I did my job is to explain what this means and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right\nNow I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I Can't tell me like for instance there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there are days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well how do you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that like all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence why don't you\nKnow there there are less than nine Tucker there's I Know it's got a handful of US Soccer there's not that many and by the way it is a orchestrated effort in millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway
