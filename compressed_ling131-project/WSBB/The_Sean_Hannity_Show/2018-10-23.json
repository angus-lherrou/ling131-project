[noise]\nRight as we can when you ...\nThe ... as I call him a he's a great friend of mine these amazing he did something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background real roots his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in a book about how\nWell the mean horrible landlords actually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the camera want a family they in thirty forty your friends and I wanted to relate that story in an all tell us quickly\nUh Fred Trump showing up to collect rent with his twenty six year old son Donald Trump and and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors\nCarolina family cannot pay the rent the father has lost the job is a blue collar worker\nFred and his son are looking at him saying okay no problem\nThere very often guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a sixty short days later a he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story that their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media ... people talk about what does the president that compassion for these people does the president had the apathy and the answer is yes he learnt that at the ... riding shotgun with his father\nIs he was either building these buildings helping to build buildings are collecting rent from collar people that were living shot so so I wanted I get a ton of research on the book\nAh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nUh the here we are right down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to you nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nAnswer I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly fighter jet in combat\nUh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan and we entered and twenty five combat hour and a ten ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear ... cinemas say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban and nearly died\nAt San when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harboring al ... who can and\nAnd on nine eleven uh the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include you know truthful I was deployed over there\nI've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander a we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on the taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes who perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said this is really personal\nFor those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans parish over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more are both on the ground and the air and on the the I mean this is this is you know why we fight to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties and it you know this and it is you know in addition to this\nA comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to\nA flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons in saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east so\nThis isn't just a one off for her uh this is a pattern she advocated a shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at the air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that this was common knowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean\nI I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\nThat absolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer is top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical pass a we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have a ... a number of independents and Republicans who are not Tunisia and unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up an ad to put some of these statements and like you just played it cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now and she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com because we really do need to help to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf the Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they're aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten to get to know you in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think you'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but um that's happened more than willing to under you\nKnow it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took on the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defense\nOr fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity income show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not so it\nWas a very you know that that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American Soldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case\nAh I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh we we were there it was a it was a U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I find\nUnless I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make sure that\nOur values or do we stood up for it yeah well I really wish you the best of and why the president you in here\nI'm a bit more to make is Ali if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha McSally doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country\nAh she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them than she accused him of torture as well\nAs she was a line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group a ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a rare again radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best put plans for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he had Sean we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely with President Trump a it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to\nSecure our border and close the loop holes at the cartels are taken advantage of it has to stop\nEvery single day right now there's people coming in in ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now\nAll they do have been there many times they don't they released\nInto the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nThis is not church President Trump's fault if the Democrats fall for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing our border and the president as frustrated as in I ... everything he's got and it took it to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they use them for building a wall and funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell San I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on a house bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMight wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen counties which has no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now at preventing conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I worked hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and towards something that gives more choice for people more flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing this one size fits all top down penalty taxes and mandates it's\nFailed and so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ring that vote I voted to protect people with preexisting condition\nOh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "23"}
