a few that we saw um let's do rock okay raw like dean hang on to have a direct okay rock\nTweets unless there's a candidate who my agree on every issue in order to vote I have to make some compromises for example I agree with Ted Mets on all but abortion which I Believe as murder and therefore should be legal my vote for him would be choosing the lesser of two evils\n[noise] okay so uh I Love that a lot of things that make me think and ah here's my thought on that is is just disagreeing with someone doesn't make them evil and abortion is a great example for that because\nA murder is evil and if you believe abortion is murder then the person who doesn't agree with you on it has\nTo be evil but especially with abortion and the libertarian contact I I live life my son has Down syndrome I never got an amnio for him or any of my kids I Would not\nMake that choice for sure but I'm libertarians can disagree on a couple of um what are called competing rights issues so immigration for example in this society which has limited uh\nUm and diminished private property rights immigration at the national level has an impact on your ability to control your own private property so it libertarians can don't have to be open borders and like with a portion\nWhere you draw the line between moral law in civil law could be religious it could be that you believe I'm conception of parts of soul\nAnd that's why that's the dividing line and you could believe you can join different line on where you use force so how would you force a woman to incubate a child if she'd rather starve herself to death you have to use force so is it a moral issue of the civil issue so I'm not saying\nHow to come out on those issues I'm just saying to come out on different sides of the issues doesn't necessarily mean you're\nOut on different sides of the issues doesn't necessarily mean you're evil\nBut if you engage in deception and fraud um and corruption and some version and exploitation of different groups for political purposes deceptively for your own ends that is what I mean by evil if they're both bad choices\nAre because they're corrupt and fraudulent that you're playing a game you're trying to game evil versus evil and I'm not sure\nWe have the wisdom for that I actually think it'd be our father which is my favorite prayer that God's will be done on earth as it is an Avon and pleaded Niger

Tupac Bill Cosby and now today are getting demonized or killed or whatever because they\nThey uh point out the problems with the system and\nThey're radical whatever they that they really could cause trouble [noise] but ah\nI feel they call attention to these really systemic structural barriers to equality an achievement\nThat I have I don't even have a taste of that kind of of of of\nPrejudice thing or an inner city thing just simply I have a taste of what it's like to try to master the system from a position of complete ignorance and powerlessness and no money right so I'm not it's not like the car stacked against me I just have no carts\nAnd that was very difficult and I did not make the most of it I I mean you might\nThink this is awesome but I really you know if I had to support a family I'm not sure I Would have a nice to cover off the ball in the long run I'm\nYou know I did fine but it was an uphill battle and I\nI feel like it's like an impossible I so I I've lost siblings to drug abuse who never even got as far as I\nGot a\nAnd I can see how that is an absolute complete deal breaker and that's why this safe he's back story doesn't really rings true in in some of the stuff you've brought me where she like in being and Spelman College with being across the street in the projects there's no there's no difference now I'm\nRight and that's important for a campaign because she's running on that she represents those communities\nYet but there's a profound difference and her past and her future B lie that she is not of that world but she exploits it and this is what you brought to me this is a part of her back story that nobody has talked about that I that I find absolutely fascinating how do you want to introduce it\nLet me or something you said right there from ... in ... minority leader she says my new classmates were the daughters of politicians and famous lawyers and corporate leaders one of my closest friends mentioned in passing that she had\nThe U.S surgeon general's home phone number and then she's turning around and saying that there is no difference in\nA college student this is an elite school and people across the street living in\n... but when she said that what she was what she was talking about it I'm not mistaken was this was happening in the context of her a leading students\nDuring what she called protests during Rodney King but they were physically in the same place as the the riots right\nYeah\nI mean that's the problem like if you you're a little too young to remember this think we probably but I remember those riots\nNow I wasn't here but I was in New York City and uh it was terrible it was really terrible because people in their own communities were the ones who are suffering it wasn't any guilty parties are suffering and that was what the terrible tragedy was of those\nUm misguided acts of violence and and you've got some stuff that\nI Do hide her to a philosophy that I consider at that time to be\nQuite to striking to what you just said there's a quote from and AJC article in Nineteen Ninety two that is talking about the aftermath of the riots and it says\nThree Atlanta University center students into university centers Spelman Morehouse and all those colleges in that same same area\nAlthough black universities it's a three Atlanta University center students Stacey Abrams or Jeffries and Kevin Donaldson say their lives have been turned upside down since they helped lead a UC protests after the Rodney King verdict\nThey helped create these student for African American empowerment\nSpelled with a K African American a group of about two hundred students from these six a UC schools formed after a protest by the students over the king verdict turned violent\nSo she was that last part again after ... wait the laughter a protest by the students over the king verdict turned violent hold on to the what's the the phrase before that they helped create the students were African American empowerment agree as a\n... yes yeah and it fell the African American was to case yes\nYes yeah and it fell the African American was to case yes instead of sees got\nA group of about two hundred students from from these six a UC schools formed after a protest by the students or the king verdict turned violent now Abrams claims that she let a peaceful protest wall the chaos is going on\nBut even if a protest you lead starts peacefully you have no control\nOver a herd with herd mentality and based on all the reporting on this Nineteen Ninety two she truly did lead a protest it's hard to believe that that protest wasn't involved in the cars getting set on fire on stores being rampage on ...\nYeah and private property being trampled but you know what I Would even heal that onion a little bit more and say the Rodney King thing\nA wise I Believe the focus was wrong Rodney King was a troubled guy he he\nHe was trying he was running from the police because he didn't want to get stopped with the drugs or alcohol on a system because he was on probation or something Pearl maybe from a some kind of theft conviction I Believe if I recall correctly\nAnd when they stopped and they were mad at him he was trying to kind of get away and they absolutely as my father is a beat his Chrysler off they absolutely\nAnd why would have been good is to look at that and say this is how we what we allow our cops to do this is how they react\nIs this right or wrong but by turning it to race which is exactly what happened when the militarization of the police became a a ... a nationwide rallying cry Eric Holder directed it towards Trayvon Martin and Zimmerman and made it a race thing and\n[noise] or maybe it was the black versus blue thing that came out of Ferguson but it was that was all a diversion\nFrom a real question that we can all get behind is is is how we want our relationship with the cops to be when you put raisins when it gets the people fighting and you're not going to get a resolution actually makes the cops stronger\nAnd uh and minorities more oppressed and I think her issue with the Georgia flak speak to\nThat kind of

conversation I had a confession\nI'm One of the eighty million people in the U.S to suffer from Maine disease bunch dead of seeing a doctor for years I covered up my legs and lived with the embarrassment and pain of ugly bulging ... veins mistaken thankfully I heard about Bain clinics of America\nPart on Dr Robert Worth and drinker and physician of clicks where America being diseases more common than people realize typically goes undiagnosed often recognizes embarrassing ... left untreated can be debilitating and dangerous I bring clinics of America we're specialist in the diagnosis and treatment the disease\nUsing minimally invasive treatments means of America had me back on my feet in about an hour and we're burning achiever covering up if you suspect you may have the disease called now to see if you qualify for a free evaluation treatments are covered by most insurance including Medicare\nI I don't refer to people as like if you had these people I was probably talking about her and the two people she was working with\nOh I thought you were talking about a group of as as a group of people you know it's it's ... okay so let's just say she did go to predominantly great good schools that you know quote good schools or she had a better life than people in the project or whatever that that make her lead levels I mean so she's trying to fight for a\nFlower no I'm saying wait let me finish but I thought\nIt should be trying to fight it her fighting for it\nAnd I thought it should be trying to fight it's her fighting for its lousy justice for all the false sport less sports he did so careful at school\nI don't think that's what she's doing I don't think that's what she's doing\nAnd you don't think that she's fighting for every once in a\nWhile I don't think she's fighting for anyone I think that she's on she's on a political path and she's doing those guys\nYou want to add this to her resume that's what you think\nI think she's a politician and I think she does what politicians\nDo and I think that's what our politicians at all I Know that's\nIt and let me say that and then you talk about the right in the um the Rodney King you know the riots after that and everything well you know what you got a president on here you know talking about my people and everything I mean it wasn't really\nLike with the Rodney King thing I think that with that and with the militarization of the police and all this stuff is that we would get a lot more done to restrain abuse of power if we\nIf we got together and we saw that we're all in danger they have the power and we can join together and get it done instead we spend our time\nGot having conflicts with each other and it distracts us and that just in my power at that time with\nYou I totally agree with you on that we do want to all come together because we lived together we work together we eat it or restaurants together\nNot just today they\nWere using the same bathroom but you ... minutes straight shifts will tell your body in this country has added more chaos in the business\nHas nothing to do this I that's my administration I'm a libertarian I have nothing to do with that well I say is that we need to pay attention\nTo who really has the power and who is going to be a victim of that power and it's all of us and it's and I think it's politically cynical to divide us because of that increases the power at the top and we all suffer for it and I honestly\nSay that they can see biting is tracking devices that cuts and if they do honestly think that\nYes and I think and I I think you're wrong if you think\nThat okay let me let me play some class my place them specifically sorry sorry I didn't mean to have a ... I Do want to play some class maybe we should play a clip of her mother\nYou know I I'm not trying to feel if I really actually do not like to take the bay of this kind of thing because I'm not talking about yeah about power is what it's about power and and I and what I'm trying to bring out here is that what she said she is what\nWhat Stacy and and a lot of ah\nThe people going from power and I want you to believe but it's not it's not\nShe is a uh in that upper echelon of the powerful she is in ... and she always has been or as you know since high school and that's what she's ... she's wearing where she's a member of the council on Foreign Relations she's she's been through all these foundation she's had\nShe is part of that community and I think that she will serve it with the more power she ask\nI agree and we study these solving ski these are kind of radical tactics always gives a community organizer like Rocco bottom was and uh she's display putting them on display give an example\nThat uh they can help um\nI I think it helped the commentary she and two thousand five\nStacey Abrams I'm drafted an anti panhandle a bill that homeless advocates uh decried as being anti black and us criminalizing poverty yet today she's running on part of her platform saying she's going to decriminalize poverty what she did the opposite in a bill she drafted Thirteen Years ago\nYeah and my point is that these things are politically Expedia that's what politicians do and and so when you think that what you're doing and we fall for this over and over and over again including what's Trump\nYou fall for it you fall for um for you let me tell you why I'm the most outside or you could ever imagine because I curse or you know I I mean it's just everybody's oil and\nChurchill insider along with an insider see the evidence is an insider they are not they're not representatives of us who have sacrificed everything\nTo help us and that that they can be counted on even ... ah in the face of the temptations of power they pursue power there about power and they're saying things that make you react that way because you are going to give him power\nAnd one of the main criticisms of Democrats had her and ... and a lot of them didn't support her\n... is because they believe that she was too focused on her own career path to the presidency\nWow well she did have that for instance where as you said my roads at the White House on the governor's mansion to myself yeah yeah and I'm not trying to make fun of her I'm I really am not and I don't like it that are on the one has to bring all this stuff out\nBut it's not anywhere right so we can bring everything about everyone that is the purpose of the free press and you're not hearing it that's what it's making me so mad about the ...\nIs the purpose of the free press and you're not hearing it that's what is making me so mad about the mall to show the case that guy's family\nWell gee if they could show the one the dealer in the Iran Contra scandal why do we talk about that his cousin's dirty fire at the highest levels of power in the world why does your free press not talk about\nThat stuff they barely stand the guy's name now in case somebody figures that\nI'm just saying that this I don't like it that we are the ones who are responsible for bringing this stuff because sometimes it swings lesson plans with strings right when we came out against cap in the primaries and even\nIn the runoff we got it calls me you're just doing this to Scott I'm him were doing it because of that information that just was not getting the press I had other conservative members of the media criticizing me for a for bringing this stuff I don't\nI mean I just you know I don't I Can't you can't win\nFor losing racial division has been a social issue that has been used for since the rise of civilization to divide and conquer see here's the thing when you play those\nCuts rate of cognac and everybody on the left was saying he's nuts he should he should lose his job you should be committed people should do an intervention when you listen to what he said it was not not the rhetoric of divisiveness and you look at\nSome uh people who get and I feel like that Trump you know if you really want us to get cynical and think that it's all a scam ... might have brought him into the fold to ten because what did they do with Bill Cosby he's in jail for what they choose ... even if he committed that he's in jail for what he said\nFor his politics to pot\nYou know some people think he was murdered because he was trying to change the gang culture Malcolm X when he had enlightened meant ah two members of fair ... organization were convicted for his killing you know I mean you have to think about\nUh uh\nWhere people are really coming from what they're real purposes are and ... you know if your if your press is really telling you everything so I just try I don't I ... everything I Know about\nCamp you know and have arms I'll keep doing it but you know it's a burden\nI don't like it because I'm not a Democrat or Republican I was like well she's not let's give her pad it's like no then you get both sides [laughter] highland on [laughter] anyway so\nWell I have to play what do you want to pick a do you want to pick the one\nOf those clubs or you want to take a break and regroup we got a little derailed

... you know\nWe filed a criminal complaint is Brian Kemp you had me on the show two or three times and more than anyone else them and then in Georgia\nAnd I'm so people only see one side so if you happen to be doing a segment your leg once they thank you for Brian Kemp error and vice versa if you're attacking Brian camp for for good reasons of ethical violations they gear for Stacy eight months and then the unfortunately\nThe voters can't see through this this divisive politics game and understand that you're exposing corruption on both sides of the aisle and you're the only one who does that\nI appreciate that and the thing is this ... stuff that came out today this is the first opportunity we've had to expose it and nobody else has exposed that but I wanted to ask you which I have not I guess you have some way\nWhat here what is your view on the Democrats claim a can't miss handling these voter registrations or what's your what's your view on that issue\nYeah so a great great a point so they they first of all this it's called voter suppression and I think the\nThe claim is is and for the most part very legitimate it dates back to two thousand I'm In Florida when Greg palace did a story or on the\nUh at that time ... state office purge what that he believed to be about fifty nine thousand voters using this exact matched technique so it actually dates all the way back to uh Eighteen years to the two thousand election is the same technique\nBut they're using it now I'm a they use it in Kansas Kris Kobach a Sixers that\nTheir um we're using it on there and now Brian Kemp\nUsed here ironically Donald Trump jumps into the Republican primaries endorses both of the secretary of state candidates\nWhich is almost unheard of for president to involve themselves in a in a primary of their own party you know they use a cat that used to be a campaign for\nFor someone against the other part now yeah so that was kind of bizarre but yeah so I think that the claim is for the most part legitimate a lot of folks don't know that the counties that had a great deal of backlog\nA voter registrations himself so Fulton County for example had about twenty thousand voter about backlog\nAnd I'm back in the sixth district rise and they couldn't get all their voters registered and now if they do then they go through this exact matching a technique that I'm blind camp is using a there's been some uh claims that he's having to do this because that's what the law says but\nBut the law doesn't say that you have to do an exact match down to the period and to you I suppose to have a validated registrations but but not to the extent that they're doing it so\nI'm a haven't we haven't heard of a lot of complaints but uh we have had some I've heard some people who were not allowed to vote on election that\nOh well like I have a question for you that the audience needs now the most important thing I think is that how do how do you recommend securing you're talking about how what is the best way to vote\nYeah so the best way Marco we always recommend voting by mail in ballot and I have already voted by mail and they the the um way to do that we put the instructions up on Jay's website on voter Ga dot org on the events package\nAnd what they'll do is you you could go up there it'll show you how you can download an application from the secretary of state's office and I'll give you the show you how to get the address of your county office you mail that ballot in\nI'm Sorry the application and they will send you a ballot very quickly usually within a maybe a couple of guys\nAnd then you fill that out you look at it for a while and think about it um and I'm like we had to ah about those constitutional members for a long time and then you can send it back in uh um to the county you can mail it in you can take it to the county\nUp into even including election day but you cannot take it to the pre fact you have to either mailed it or or take it to the county office\nOkay and there is time to do that if people act on that right now right as we saw\nAbsolutely you've got plenty of time to do that and they all the instructions throughout their voter G. A. dot org slash events that's our events tab\nA flash of events that candidates pad\nOkay and then there was one more thing I I we do not have time to cover all of the amendments by you it is on your website and I did want you to tell people how to look at your analysis and I ... I Believe there's only one of those\nUh between the referendum the amendments I think there's only one thing that you are now recommending a yes vote on isn't that correct what\nIt that's exactly right and for the reasons that kid and you have discussed and the previous segment\nAll of the constitutional amendments for the most part are special address they're supporting some kind of a special interests that is not necessary to have a constitutional amendment ... they already you already have a law\nFor it or there or they can make a law for it so there's no reason to have a constitutional amendment because if you change your mind down the road is harder much harder to back that out on\nIt because you take the two thirds majority vote so that's the principle why we're recommending no and and now decided to recommend knowing all five of those amendments I'm as well as one of the referenda that it's all it's just all about special interests\nAnd what is the referenda ... referendum that you recommend a yes vote on\nThe one that uh probably doesn't impact so many but we didn't think was so bad was the multi\nDistrict a amend mutt a for a homestead exemption so in other words if you're in ups are multi county so if you're a city of Atlanta resident and you're actually a last chance to counties\nAre those those residents can get a homestead exemption right now as we understand the law and is with us back in ... data referenda ... referendum would allow them to do that show\nThat air\nTo a meeting that they would have the same time that those and and ... counties have\nAll right so that's H. B. eight twenty is the only thing you vote you recommend a yes vote on and if people want to see your analysis of all the other stuff they can go to a voter Ga dot org is not the best place for people to my ... I got one minute to tell people how to get more from you ...\nA yes vote or ... dot org I'm at our you know what I've I've got to make sure that posted but we'll post that on the events\nOf ... proof where's the clock\nOn voter Ga dot org it's easy to click through to your Facebook page which I Believe everything's on your Facebook page\nOh that's right it's also on Twitter you're absolutely right that that would those will be the best way I Do you follow me on Twitter Garland voter Ga Don ... or\nAh or voter God I voted yet and then on Facebook there's voter Ga all one word you ride all of that assistance is out there and that we had we did change one on one of that and when\nI write him boy do we have a lot in there they sell thank you so much and I guess I Want to talk to you again till after the election but um I had met that it's going to be run off anyway so okay to vote libertarian\nGreat I look at for thank you so much for having a thank you for being a a shining light on on all of this corruption and and and you know been making them really really make an equal on both sides\nRight back to your Garland okay Bye bye and I'll be back right after that to wrap it up uh with um some\nParting thoughts for for this election season that says Monica perhaps\nBy forty nine gray carrier WSBIU twenty four hour traffic center Seventy five down down is low and do not just before two eighty five looking for trouble right now in the w._b. jammed up thinking that it there definitely is a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "20"}
