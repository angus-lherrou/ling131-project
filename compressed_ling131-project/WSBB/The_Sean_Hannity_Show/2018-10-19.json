and I'm like I said he's a great performer but we were like board does nothing to do oh here's free tickets to go see a show we walk in and it's Tom jones is not unusual it's not unusual that's right I'll tell you what what motivates me and you know my background and I know your background than in many ways it's similar\nYou know paper boy it ate a dishwasher twelve a cook it Thirteen bus boy bartender then I painted houses frame houses did roofing late tile that's another day\nPainted houses frame houses did roofing laid tile that's another decade of my life it's two decades in my life doing real work and but this is what's happened is we are now not only not only demonizing people we have differences with as Hillary says you can't be civil we are now criminalizing differences\nYou know the the whole witch hunt issue that the president talks about\nWhere the power of intelligence forces used to stop one candidate that they protected from the law who broke who committed kept telling these lines to find the courts without verified information one opponent pays for\nAnd then disseminating it with a media strategy to make it look like something happened that didn't and after that you know two years of investigation they want to destroy people they disagree with that is the modern left today I don't want to destroy anybody I don't want to boycott anybody I don't want people\nYou know I Want everybody has a choice I Can't make people watch Hannity or listen to this radio show I Do the best programs I can and and people have all the power but that's not enough of these groups\nKnown as they can't when they get they can't win on the electoral basis we saw that with Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton that was the last straw\nFor the George Soros is in the far left the media matters all of these people once they went down in the presidential election that all of them thought they were going to win because they have the media in their pocket and still do then they said you know why\nWe got what band and um the free market place we have to now going assassinate people and this is very similar to what happened in Germany and bringing it back to the\nBy the way of saying that you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that they that that people today are like Nazis killing people what you're saying is that there are similar lying ... propaganda mishaps elation demonization very different from saying that they're a death camps\nYeah I mean there's there's look that can't happen in America thank God because our structure is still in place to prevent anything like that happening\nBut I'll tell you what antifa no different than the essay George Soros behind the scenes with tens of millions of dollars alright funneling it into agencies that are bent on destroying human beings and we talked about this last time I was on a program what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nEvery American should pay attention to that because of that guy can go down on uncorroborated are uncorroborated than anybody in his country can\nAs you rightly pointed out they tried it with Trump on the Russian collusion that's collapsing all over the place the fusion GPS guy put out a ... taking the Fifth Amendment now won't testify what does that tell you okay\nSo you know we're living in a dangerous time\nLet's let me in terms of sue this you're I'm agreeing with you ... what really got exposed to me that scares me a lot and there's two things one is we have to do justice system we don't have equal justice\nOr equal application of our laws needs to be looking at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever but the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh abandon\nAll principle constitutional law and the and and literally core values that have served us so well which are due process the presumption of innocence the Republican for the first time in their life that something right they handled it with the seriousness the pop it deserves they with thorough they did it right\nAnd at the end of the day there was no corroboration to the allegations being made and now we see people like what Eric Holder kick them we can't be civil Hillary Clinton getting their face Cory Booker or Maxine Waters you see these cabinet people you get a crowd\nAnd you follow them into the grocery stores department stores gas stations and you tell them we don't want them nowhere anymore that's what she said no way I Will tell you\nIt's amusing that you ran down the list and uh we we could add ten more and then Trump goes to Montana and makes a joke a joke\nAbout the Republican candidate for Senate they're um slam dunk ... a reporter [laughter] you know and it was obviously said ingest and the press goes lie all crazy yet all the things that you pointed out are somehow over look\nAnd not overlooked it they they do not Harris yeah well because now they're in concert there the the American media is in concert\nWith the Democratic party and that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic where the the eighty percent of the media now is promoting a political party so it's gonna be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one I don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know doesn't know I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty sixteen I said it's absolutely possible that Donald Trump is going to win then the then the\nIt was five days a on a factor five days before he was going to win because people didn't like Hillary Clinton and they're they're even stay home or vote against her and not to exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't\nBut against ... exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't say it on your TV and radio show but what\nYou guys you saying that they're going to attribute it to me and I had a lot so rightly say the stuff he won't get it right you have\nNo idea what am I talking about because nobody ever does and nobody tells\nYou or me either no or going to save a court before comes flying out of our mouths now\nBut what would you do every day I mean you're you're putting in four hours a day doing commentary and then you have to go home but you have to have unbelievable security surrounding you that should never happen in a free society\nNever been out of this bill or not the only one oh I'm not talking about it right you know ... something else going on right on and the conservative commentators are all\nIn danger and and this is you know to me I'm I'm saying to myself just got to be exposed number one and it's got to stop number two and you can't have people telling a emotionally disturbed individuals hey surround them when they're in a restaurant\nI mean that should be watching more should be investigated by the ethics committee of the house just for saying that\nBill we're seeing now and two major cities many riots break out we have to politicians Republican candidates in Minnesota had been punched the guy was whole copped in a restaurant got hit from behind\nAnd he's got a concussion and the healing time is a minimum now six weeks one of the people that were punch was a woman a woman you know look at Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz's wipe Heidi\nNow we're going after women and children look at what's been said about ...\nOn a level of cruelty that I've never seen and by the way unfair millennia I she is one of those those lovely people you'll ever meet China same with a bunker\nAnd where where are the spokesmen on the left\nCondemning this uh CNN they won't use the mob word well what is antifa\nOkay you're not going to say the word mop now if the Tea Party had a you know damn well CNN would be saying the word mop okay but what what exactly are those people in ... and black with masks on a gang alright maybe a gang alright but they're organized and they're out to hurt people\nAnd you don't care you're not going to use the word mob come on\nI'm worried in many ways that we're losing the country where so divided and I don't think Rand Paul's too far off I mean this is the canary in the coal mine a preview coming attractions if this continues somebody's gonna get killed or severely injured it's it was that close now it's like a tipping point\nYou can see it on the horizon I going to happen by the way and I'll say that any conservative keep your hands and your pocket and just because you disagree with somebody be respectful\nWere let don't tell me that don't do it\nDon't go down to that level well we've already had the shooting at the softball field you're right which was under covered\nThe national press you know Steve Sebelius everybody a who watches Fox News knows the story but if you just watch MSNBC you wouldn't know ... that happened to him I'm so you're right and that's what I'm Talking to you about today and I'm trying to want to\nHear 'em ...
