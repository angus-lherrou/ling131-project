got some breaking\nNot in significant facts but the most significant facts remember the story was about\nOn a weekend basis and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys lined up the whole you know so they could gang rape exam well hum he gave a red solo cups and I saw him at a party you don't know if he did anything to the punch\nUm this is so Rick was irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation\nIf they had witnesses\nIf there wasn't a changing shifting story if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might have some legitimate reason to air this but because they want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really put\nAir it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic it's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other thing\nThere are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil these people are predators they need to get off our streets but you've gotta have some collaboration to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know if it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process and simple common sense\nOr do we believe in guilt by accusations because in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case what you see is a lot of smearing a lot of smoke a lot of blood shunning but no evidence you know in every single one of these cases they're shifting\nNarratives and stories ... is with us author of the new American Revolution the making of a populist movement Jeffrey Lord former associate political director in the Reagan Administration he wrote the book\nAwhile ago way before anyone else picked up on it what America needs the case of Donald Trump I think Jeffrey thirty four days out of a mid term election which historically has not worked out well for the\nThe party in power in the White House um I Do believe there has been an energizing\nA across the country or uniting of or if you will of pretty much anyone that his conservative fair minded Republican even never Trump or is that they recognize what has gone on here and I think they're all pretty angry and pissed off\nI think that's right San I talked to people I mean people are living and I do mean live at about the treatment of judge Kavanaugh uh yesterday I saw it was a critic picked poll\nThat ah the generic democratic votes had already dropped five points uh because of this nonsense [laughter] this is a Lynch mob plain and simple and and let's be crystal clear here\nIf President Trump not gotten nominated got himself for the Supreme Court they would find a reason to do this kind of thing and it doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh dropped out tomorrow which thank God he's not going to do\nThey substitute somebody else some version of this is going to happen again and again and again because at the end it's all about ... wait it's all about the idea that they get to run the country for the Supreme Court instead of the Congress and that's what it's all about\nWhy would I think it is I I Do believe that after the the shock of November twenty six team\nI think that there's been a collective melt down by people on the left and their and their outrage in their hatred in their venom and it just gets worse Haley we'll go to you every single day I mean I\nI remember back in the day you both worked for fake news CNN and you're always both beyond panels ten ten liberals against one of you [laughter] I don't think you're ever on a panel together for that matter and I just would watch and it was constant never ending pounding Van Jones starting a day well this was on the little white flash\nIt started there and they were all shocked and they never thought Trump Goodwin buddy you one and he wanted a masterful way he actually went to the states and said I'm going to make things better\nOh that's pretty simple way to win\nThe media I fail you accept the idea that President Trump is our president you saw that and then he saw animosity toward candidate Trump ... only increased tenfold when he became President Trump at something that they weren't prepared for the fact\nThat I seem to take a rush
