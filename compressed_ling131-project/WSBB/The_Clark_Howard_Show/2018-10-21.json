there and create fights and put start brawls on knots I won't support them\nThat's right I agree too now whether a group we're getting into a group of hate group has to do with its ideology what it's doing\nWhy can't say that the media covers we heard of Proud Boys which is supposed to be I I read a male chauvinist group\nUm and the that's the first time you've heard about it first time I've heard about ... has been in the news for how long now and you're telling me well I barely know anything about them and you're also telling me something that I find kind of disturbing from you and that is to get in front of ... houses and stand on their lawns and screaming at their houses what do you do with my four\nOkay hang on a second you need to get a job and you hear me I set [laughter]\nAre you hiring listen first first I said it sounds to me those as like both of them are hate groups either way they're both engaging in violence towards the surface of some and then I never think violence is the solution I don't think he'd hate and violence ... violence and that's that so I have one number two\nWhat what has happened I Will listen to Maxine Waters and follow ... a great crowds abusive cabinet officials followed them into grocery stores gas stations department stores what do you think is going to happen what will likely scenario if they listen to her\nI don't know what look what happened when Trump wasn't citing his followers to violence against again look there's a big difference\nWhen you're talking about a campaign event ... sixteen\nSon still talking [laughter]\nOnly make like listen I as I said I didn't like those statements\nI did not support them I'll continue to not support them and at the same time what Maxine and others are talking about is a small woman waters are talking about is getting\nIt's getting visible and active and and and that was part of democracy democracy messy and ugly and it is part of free speech and if we believe in free speech I mean I like it\nAnd I said I don't like it but I Will still defend\nNow that you get offended as well but I end up failing use somebody's going to get killed mark an eye on buddy is going to be severely hurt

coming up next [noise]\nHi Michelle I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was a trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now how the woman goes into a clinic\nComes out there and there's no police report and I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up\nWe had instructions knock them back to where she got ... amazing Cormac God's smell is perhaps the most prolific through American bring friends and family you do not want to pass up the unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion drugs no rated\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate would tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big\nRedistribution skiing now if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh amber\nAnd Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all\nYou can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceutical so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine at a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store it's\nActually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas empty and Dr Lee as gross president of doctors were patient care I'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it at our phones will start bringing and we've got regular patients [laughter] failed you'll have a lot of them too right where we have a a A R o pan over there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it\nI mean so and you have all these ... now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors of you know and friends of mine\nAnd I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well all which has happened occasionally in my life and these guys you know I ...\nI mean I pay them and they take my insurance is but they do it as more of a friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah and sex plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly uh\nYou know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style\nOr Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork that headache the hassles the middleman so that now medicines are pity pill now you can call ... ... email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nI told this is now they implement how many places did you get this finally up and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail enough here explain exactly what the service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and it's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits free tele medicine's so you can call ... ... email your doctor\nWe have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasounds heart monitors lung monitors and then wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out there and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this grow so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nYet it's working everyone I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between\nThe former correct I mean we want to go down there they are trying to take us down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans walk their healthcare chosen by you know Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it that the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nWhere did not leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more and you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven percent\nSo what they try to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age would rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr member\nYeah this is a one size fits all model it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring\nMedicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... thighs I'd a blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents so the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd and lower their price just like Fifteen minutes we'll save your Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and care is affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAre you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government meddling All right well that's true\nThis upfront pricing lower cost no government mentally aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand at an even greater level\nHealthcare is local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors\nAnd one thing that's clear the calorie is not coming from Washington to say now if we wait for ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is to eliminate\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our ...\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr ... gross the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think the Democrats are actually going to help them and it's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number if

George W. Bush um\nWhen Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist French at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nUm you know folks a match whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're one percenters but she also herself detected fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes that's always a warrant\nFifty thousand dollars at old clothes I played the Clintons\nYou know dumping their use the underwear as if that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear [laughter] and they put a value to it\nYou know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pays forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else\nThe tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they want to limit eight eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nShe wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred ... a nice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in Republicans wanting to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people not just right after congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that thing\nAnd I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting it all out a and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even as critical or she went on a twenty six I Believe\nTweet a rant about Donald Trump ... obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I'd actually\nPut ... billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November sex with what happens\nIs it I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders\nWith Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time to sit by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic versus Larry Bird and and parish McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports I'm\n... annual hall then up by bend a Boston alone so beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through those I don't know what to tell them\nLook Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not enjoy my race Curt Schilling indoors but most importantly\nBy the way we're the home right he needs to endorse or [laughter] or need to get that had his locker Tom\nBrady is the most hated man except for the New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight well look at you know ... a lot has changed since you've been here\nUnemployment is now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty man that's that's where the whole country the Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state more money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two\nBillion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like\nA Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that and raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent would be the baseline and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be\nToo much when she was on ah MSNBC\nA few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty six\nTrillion dollar a price tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery but does that give better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs once government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know it was a bit worn complains about the cost of College of course she\nCharged two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or that you know the fact is when government becomes the tire of the loans or whether it's a student defaults or not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive to cost a year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it the competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between will pay attention to you know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here\nOver her to become president you got to re elect er and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well an eraser\nThanks Sean if people want to get involved it's not too late deal for Senate dot com GI ... es all

there's a lot of fun and I think you know the fact that he's talking about positive results and that we're better off than we were two years ago\nA positive results and that we're better off than we were two years ago it's a pretty good message why would the media want that when they're in the pockets of people that the slant solidly Democrats solidly socialist left\nAbsolutely totally agree with you I think I think that would I think I'm doing that would be would bring people out of the woodwork so yeah 'cause people people would watch it addressed the nation just an idea\nWell I think it's a good one I like it and maybe should just do it on cable because you know everyone forgets what this was the most surprised remember Linda when we're battling you know that weirdo pervert late night
