Lee can ten years\nNothing that old should be on her credit items only stay on your credit seven years okay\nAnd so when's the last time that that if you've talked about this together when's the last time she looked at her credit report\nUm our credit report I'm not sure I Know she's got credit ... so I Know she's monitoring it and she's trying to rebuild um so I don't know as far as our credit report that's a good a good idea to see what's\nCritical harmony right on the credit card machines see her reports to and what she should look for is any items that are not what's called age properly because of her problems with credit go back a decade\nThose things should not be present on her report so she should essentially have a no file almost versus a bad file for things from long ago\nIt's not unusual for a collection agency to do what's called refreshed the date to try to keep something active in somebody's mix that shouldn't be\nAnd then what she would do is if something's on there that is too old\nShe challenges that with the credit bureau notify us whoever has it dated wrong that she's challenged it and it needs to be removed and generally when somebody savvy enough to do that the collection agencies behave themselves\n... okay so the other thing is is she's already has credit cards of her own right now um is that is that um the uh her credit scores fires if I'm reporting her on line\nI see you at her as an authorized a user on top of what she's\nOn the line yeah see you at her as an authorized user on top of what she's got that will be really helpful to her as well

gig\nYep and you're self employed for that you're not working for somebody else you're you're burning completely as an independent contractor on the weekends right correct so have you set up a set up a simple pine employee pension\n[noise] um I I haven't ... I I just heard about that and I was like ... rock\nAnd a ... a little boy in it and I still described it to that\nYes and to see that something you want to do because the more money that you can put aside now makes it more and more possible for you down the road to be able to have complete financial independence which sounds like that's what you are really into\nUh-huh so let's go to a certain one that you would recommend for that\nYeah okay so for a set up I Would go with one of the ultra low cost companies who do you have your off with\nThan good\nAll right so I Would just be yourself with vanguard to to keep it simple right so let's go talk about your for three B but you offered the option of a raw form of three B are only a traditional for three be\nJust the traditional\nOkay and do you know what kind of expenses that you're shouldering with that for three B\nOr I think it ... or ... they just don't put any money into it and they they already automatically just twelve percent into it so I'm just going off\nOut here on a free ride there that's great yeah it's it's it's really awesome\nRight let's talk goals and the next five years what things do you because you've got you do the if you do this out you've got this for three baby you're doing fully funding or Ross what things do you want to accomplish before you turn thirty\n... which is the home um but now with them and I'm not\nReally as a shot at and I I'm not I'm not trying to spend the money on a car I'm On a case that it's a lovely lady save up for a house in the probably the biggest expense that I did look fully\nAlright I said for that then you want ... pretty much what I was just talking about with the online banks\nAnd right now you can earn too in a quarter percent it's not going to be our shattering but you're going to be earning money on your money and um you start building up that pile of cash\nAnd then he let's say an opportunity comes along to buy a home and you know right now is not a great time to buy a home\nIn no way for the money into crash\nWell we're not going to see if the rash yeah how was that was an unusual circumstance ten years ago when you were a teenager but we but we are going to see housing become more affordable versus income again because where we're at right now is not sustainable\nFor housing too so outstrips so many people's income so I Would buy your time I would keep stashing the surplus cash beyond what you do in the south the raw and through the employer\nUh for three B and put money into one of these online accounts and then when the opportunity presents itself where there's a good deal on a house you will have already done\nThe key word by living on less than what you make in saving as much as you can if you go to bank rate dot com and click on savings rates you'll see some of the opportunities right now or in about two and a quarter percent\n... and\nIf I'm repeating myself I don't know if I said this those rates are likely going up and down\nRepeating myself I don't know if I said this those rates are likely going up another quarter point over the next few weeks\nMhm shouldn't and do you think I should have put it in that instead of like a finality zero eight on\nYes because when your window is shorter the finality zeroes are really a longer term play\nAnd up to a window of like five years that's why I specifically asked what do you hope to accomplish in your twenties\nNext five years it's too much of a risk\nTo put the money that you're going to want to use for something like a down payment on a house into stock type Joyce's infidelity zeroes or one that it's a total us stock market index or another and international stock market index with no commissions no fees valleys absorbing all those\nAnd so that's a great choice for money there would be a longer term holding\nBut not for money that you're going to use and the next several years gotta move well past five I'd say seven years or longer before that becomes a good place for you to pop your money and congratulations to you Derek for paying so industrious and being such a saver\nNicole is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi

need to support our military personnel and we as a country really need to think long and hard about what I Believe so strongly through and through\nThat all of us could benefit and our nation would benefit enormously if there was a shared sense of service in our country\nWith mandatory service as part of the game I Believe the strong division in public life in the United states is because very few people that served\nIn elective office have any military background at all where you meet people from every walk of life and it doesn't matter who you are where you're from what your religion is what color you are\nIt's all about the one purpose of serving our nation\nAnd I think that's part of where we were missing and understanding how much we share in common versus the differences we have\nMike is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Mike Hi Clark how're you doing today great thank you you want to start investing a little bit at the time\n[noise] yeah I um you know when I go to a restaurant I um I always round the trip up to where it yeah even dollar amount just for convenience sake and and tracking and or last week by San sent me a link to a a company that does that and\nI went under the lake and it was asking for you know checking account number and credit cards that you're using and everything and I got scared I closed it out and I didn't know if it was legitimate or or not because if it's not legitimate I Need to get my shutting out of\nAnd which one is it your son's using acorns\nAwake coins is the real deal oh is it say acorns you pay if I remember a minimum twelve dollars a year to administer your account is that right\nUm I didn't get that far [laughter] [noise]\nUm it it is absolutely yeah yeah okay for you to use acorns\nFor you to use acorns and have it as a path to start building up some money for you for\nFor the years and it is it's where money that might just kind of go in the ether instead goes into an investment account at very low costs\nAre so far he makes more sense for this go into their actual Kurdish are like I Do\nYeah and you know investing\nInvest things for the long haul and you know in the shorter term you might put money in and lose some of that at least temporarily but over time you can end up with a substantial amount of money a dollar here a dollar there through your week three year year\nAnd it's money that becomes painless you don't even realize that it's banished and gone into investing so I'm impressed with what acorns has put together\nOh that's awesome I gives me a comfort level that I can go out there that I'm not worried about sharing information\nI Would feel absolutely fine investing with them\nAwesome well thanks ...\nLove is your son is teaching you things yeah absolutely [laughter]\nIsn't that great Ashley's with us on the Clark Howard show hello actually how're you doing\nI'm doing great care\nAshley you've got a question for me let's see if I can help you with\nYes I'm I'm hiring a virtual assistant she helped me with the line mundane task touches paint fry laundry needy groceries and things like that but it's through up Oregon I\nKnow that you know they're qualified people but I Want to be able to get her into the pay for something without risking credit score it's violating my credit card agreements and things like that while minimizing my risk cute\nSo you're going to give this person the ability to make payments but you want to make sure they don't destroy your credit and at the same time limit access that this individual would have to your funds absolutely\nOkay I've got something I like for that and I've only one other time of I suggested it in a situation something like yours but it seemed to fit and it's called blue bird have you ever heard of bird now\nIf you look at bluebird dot com theater is a payment system that is a joint venture of American Express and Walmart and so you're able to issue a bluebird account to this individual and\nThey can do a bill payment for you they can do transactions on the card you can see every transaction is happening and here's the best part you control the flow of money into the blue bird account\nSo you have any did you put in it only the money that you need this assistant to have to do the transactions that you need them to pay for and take care of\nGreat that's exactly what I Am and meets the exactly my requirements of thank you\nAnd the other thing with blue bird read through all the all the ways it works as long as you jump through all the right hoops with blue bird you'll pay no fees at all\nTo have this as an account for this assistant\nPerfect now you're only risk is let's say you do run into a problem with this individual and you have let's just say for argument's sake you've got three hundred dollars and the blue bird account at that time\n... and so you decide you got to let this person go 'cause they're not performing well or they have not proven to be trustworthy or whatever they'll last amount of money you have on deposit that they have access to may well be at risk\nAbsolutely\nSo but you know we all know the amount and it would be kept by the amount that you put in there that you've trusted them with\nYes and that's a risk and willing to take up to a certain dollar value\nOkay so it is of the possibilities it's number one for what you're trying to accomplish and I hope that you find that it works well for you if it turns out that blue birds a bust I Need to know that so I can take that information into account next time I might talk about it\nDarren is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Darren how are you today\nThe great thanks for Michael certainly you want to talk about your child or children\n[noise] yeah I had a question all of a as obsessed with credit freeze a you are [noise] and my\nWife and I asked a couch or frozen and we froze our daughters\nThat's our frozen and wait for our daughters are ... we had a Social Security number on her but my question is why do they even have a credit files on minors or ... why do they even permit activity if they're not you know legally able to sign for any\nAnger a new accounts\nSo criminals are exploiting a loop hole and how the three major credit bureaus do business so the credit bureaus what they do is they they make money collecting data they make money selling data\nAnd so they build ... on on anybody who anyone reports credit activity on so they didn't start off with a file on your young daughter\nBut what happens with a dinner the theft in childhood entity theft is far more likely to occur then for an adult\nIs someone will assume your child Social Security number and they'll do it for many different reasons their favorite is it there's no history there so they all started applying for things as if\nThey are not necessarily your daughter but using her number\nAnd so that's what creates the file with the credit bureaus and voila suddenly the crook has\nTaken over your daughter's Social Security number and potentially created a whole new identity because remember there was no pre existing record for your daughter\nSo what child credit freeze does\nIs the credit bureau actually creates an empty file for your daughter\nBased on her name and her Social Security number and then freezes it which prevents anybody from applying for credit or doing things is if they are the holder of that Social Security number\nGot you got a credit bureaus alright cross checking the Social Security number against a birth date absolutely not because that would like to watch that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "02"}
