Christmas shopping season is just days away and\nSeason is just days away and uh did you know there was an official start and I mean fill you in on what kind of things are out there to entice you this shopping season right I got a crazy thing for you\nTo you know there are now the monitors being sold that are geared specially marketed towards families with young children where the mom and her hooks up to the Internet and keeps records so when you call the\nPediatricians office and you say a\nJane is not\nDoing well and they'll ask well it'd be taking their temperature and you say yeah at one thirty seven her temperatures blah blah blah I at for fourteen it was this and now at a note to it's Bob la\nAnd that's the kind of thing I can tell you as a parent of three who were all past that stage now I Wish something like that it existed\nWhen my kids were young and you'd call the pediatricians office and you say well I took it I don't remember was that this morning when I take that temperature so having the ability to\nHave the Internet be or record keeper\nAnd be able to track\nIs often is your advice to take temperature of a kid who's not feeling well having those records instantly your fingertips seems like a great idea\nBut listen to this creep out thing so one of the the monitors that is always connected to the Internet is the cancer\nAnd so this one now is in half a million houses New York times reports that cancer is taking the data\nOn all the people having their temperatures taken at all times around the country and then supposedly taking it down to an a anonymous data that tracked by ZIP Code and then they sell it to companies that benefit from when people are sick\nAnd so a company that might sell over the counter meds to\nPharmacies will know okay there's an outbreak has some kind of bug and the ZIP codes let's get extra andme majority of those stores\nThe advantage to you as a parent is it seems whenever you go in the pediatric medicine section in a pharmacy is empty just when your kids sick because like everybody else in the class is sick at the same time\nSo you're right now over withholding and you're ending up having to wait for a big tax refund each year yes\nAll right so there is no a science to his more art and the easiest way to do it unless you suddenly have gotten a big pay raise at work\nIs I did actually oh congratulations so\nYour payroll office will tell you with your normal exemptions what you're going to end up with this check eat in that check each pay period you increase your withholding so less money will be held back\nOkay so is it better than the two existing myself altogether and take a percentage of savings account\nSo how do you work for a big company that has a human resources department or payroll department is a tiny employer\n\nSo this is a big employer you can go to a human resources and say here's what I wanted to do I want to reduce my withholding each pay period by X number of dollars\nHundred two hundred or whatever and they'll just help you do that they'll help you change the exempt will tell you fill out a new uh W. four\nAnd they'll reduce what you're having withheld and then you won't get that refund\nAnd that's what I recommend pretty much everybody do because you don't want to be in a position if you end up being a victim of tax id fraud that you end up waiting tend to fourteen months for that refund you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nNews Ninety five five and am seven fifty W s me [noise] eleven\nTwenty one cool re carrier WSBIU twenty

that for around Seventy dollars is likely where that's going to be most popular screen size\nTends to be right around a forty inches\nLotta TVs now used to be forty or forty two are now thirty nine or forty three I don't know why that is just the way it's played out and those TVs are going to be below two hundred dollars\nAnd not all of them but the lead price the cheaper price is going to be in that range fifty inch screens\nOr going to be a down below a hundred and fifty dollars potentially and so think about that that you're gonna find that\nYou're going to be able to maybe one store\nBuy a fifty inch for equivalent or less than another store is selling a forty three inch TV so watch that compression in price with a larger sized TV a lot of people buy TVs thinking about uh how much\nHow what size of a TV they're comfortable and they only shop within that but if you have a little flexibility watch the the fifties because of the competition in that size may actually be a better price\nThan the smaller screen or equivalent\nAnd fifty five ... which are very popular in people's living rooms are going to be extremely cheap this year I mean\nGoing to be extremely cheap
