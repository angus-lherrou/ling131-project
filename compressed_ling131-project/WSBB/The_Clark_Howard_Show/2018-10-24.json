I'm from two different companies I've worked for in the past um\nOne that's currently sitting about Eighteen thousand some change and the other one around seven thousand um of course I no longer work for them and the company I currently work for does not offer a four one K. so I guess my question is what do I do with his money the city\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were\nThose big companies small we're in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nWith the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right\nSo I was scared that all that money out quickly\nAnd move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs\nAre vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments okay than we have them and let me tell you something do not call the administrator of ... of the four oh one K. and say\nHey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check 'cause what they do\nIs they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you and send it to the IRS as withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days\nOr you end up paying massive tax\nFor not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with is vale do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nOkay and an end you recommend an IRA or the Ross Iraq\nNow you can do to I just I Know I hear you talk about yeah that is\nAll right so the story is you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K. and put it into a Roth without having a big\nBill because all that money they don't want him was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. with that money not a Roth IRA okay\nNot a Roth IRA okay\nAnd you can over time migrate the money from the traditional to a Roth as you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years\nThat you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday then let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is that in a big employers plan or small\nBut it's a very large employer either try to on the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA\nOkay\nSo are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's through one of the three that you mentioned\nDollar and you could just leave that seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that the then you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\nThat right in the last year ... great question so let's say I'm let's keep this simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for\nIts vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of 'em to vanguard in an IRA\nAnd just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause if it's with vanguard the cost will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions so you have the twenty five to grow\nIn the vanguard IRA\nAnd then you open a new account with vanguard for Ross in any current or future contributions he may go into the Roth\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're are you going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw it's really great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Ross\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your wife you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHey Clark thanks for

Chrysler and solar\nCars the Roth is what I Would do next because if you do the raw it has\nSuch and they built in tax advantages and then also has the flexibility in the event you had a financial catastrophe\nLike the job loss not enough money coming in or whatever so with the Roth you can put in with maximum flexibility zero dollars in a year\nUp to fifty five hundred each end of the ... the

O. C. than it would be like its own living breathing thing and each of you would get the equivalent of a tax return for the rental property that would be included on your own personal return\nIn other words if you're going out and not only allow say then we basically\nWe do now is shot an El Al ... I mean the three of you can own it together you all agree on what the business arrangement is and then you reported in thirds is your tax person would say okay it's pretty much the same procedure for reporting\nProfit or loss from the rental property for each of the three of you the only difference would be you may next year will be doing it as an El Al see just something three of us together\nRight [laughter] okay Kevin your recommendation would probably go ahead today the El Al say\nWell if the three of you are going to own it together and you think you're going to be comfortable owning it together I Would go ahead and do the El Al see for the liability issues involved\nAlright safer and I I just like a tank as applicant aid for a lot and it helped me personally so much so you get a great job\nWhere you are so kind to say that and I hope that the three of you end up doing very well with this rental property Christopher you want to bring to the table an organization as a potential outlet for you to do investing for retirement or just investing how're you doing Christopher\nWhile I'm doing great and it's great to talk to you after or Twenty years of listening to you\nWow that's a long time\nI Know I'm trying to get all my friends and family and listening to you but sometimes especially my younger kids that never Larry they say but whatever [laughter]\n[laughter] so you have a question for me about investing a way that no one has ever asked me about what do you think and\nSo we have a a student class\nConsolidated bones and a home improvement loan with a brand new company and they've been good about these other two financial products they offered shopped around a few different places he\nNeeded these things but they also recently for a walk IRA account and\nSo I had a a high curiosity because I ... to their website and I couldn't find their fee structure in if they were comparable to some of the low cost 'em\nRight where are we talking about so fires that who were telling you about correct\nRight and it's so fi is becoming a full supermarket for your wallet\nYou know they're going into banking they have opened up and investing product I mean they want to be your modern one stop shop when you need to borrow when you want to invest when you want to bank when you want to save\nAnd so far so good they seem to be doing a very good job I Can't remember if we've ever had a complaint about so far I even from a student loan borrowers which is usually a source of a lot of complaints and they're investing plans for\nRetirement accounts or just doing a straight investment account\nIt's great especially since you're already a customer of them as a bar where the structure for doing business with them is really great\nSo when you pay almost nothing\nTo invest with them and the fees are a fraction of what they are most anywhere else generally you can figure compared to investing with a traditional full commission broker it's about one tenth to one twentieth of the cost\nTo one twentieth of the cost\nAnd so they compared to some of your other low cost recommendations\nBut you have family there and the same ballpark in terms of what it costs you do invest as being with vanguard or Schwab is an example or using the really low cost products available from fidelity\nWhat's so fires offering is a very very low cost investment approach based on your risk level you're willing to live with they robo invest you they come up with a portfolio\nAnd they charge you off the first ten thousand dollars you put with them as a bar or is free for normal or things that don't have loans was so fi I think it's sixty dollars a year\nWhat about the fact that they haven't been around for as long as somebody other recommendations or you have I mean we're at the ...\nYou mean if they went in to hear of Libyan will because your money would be an ATF six changed traded funds your money is safe\nAnd your account is insured under that brokered system which is not like FDIC it's something that has some some holes in it but S.
