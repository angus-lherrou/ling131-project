called in to your show was the very first time I'd ever called in to any talk radio and you were teasing me about Fela twilight and I told you to get Trump for president that was in two thousand nine\nIs that true I don't remember but I Do remember the uh Bello calling me talking about the twilight series\nThat I remember um I guess we heard it was a it was one of the hottest movies at the time right\nOh I didn't know what you were talking about and then I said you I'm like I only watch Fox and then the last time that I talk to you well okay so the last time I talked to was a couple of days before the inauguration\nAnd by the way I I I'm not a big twilight fed the only reason I Do have the kids you know I'm not really you know bam pliers and Kristen Stewart [laughter] and where does that mean\nNervous because I didn't know what you were talking about but I found I talked to a couple of days before the inauguration and I don't know if you remember but I told you that you inspired me to sit in my pickup truck every night and you're like wow what kind of inspiration is that can I tell you what you inspired me to do\nWith my love to told me I Love inspiring people\nOkay so I ran round telling everybody that I got on your show and everybody was like were you nervous or you're afraid and and I know but what I realized was when we're talking about the young and how are we going to get people to tune into conservative talk radio\nI laugh went out to Willis in North Dakota right worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets I started my own cleaning business out there and the cleaning and catering business right yeah so\nI come in at night and I was in my truck because that's where I could contain audio and I hated the ballet DeAngelis show and it was created for people that don't normally listening to talk radio so the silent majority Eighteen year old rock next six year old black liberal women\nWere listening to my showing at the highlight of it I had a following of like twenty thirty some thousand\nThree awesome internationally as well\nThat's good for you well let me ask you that\nI'm back here in Minneapolis and it might actually go read and do the job that we need to do and prove to try that we a hundred percent hundred and fifty percent support him because it's math of this Trump trained and and\nThe fat in Newburg has closed the gap for Clovis shower ward low is Thirteen percent higher than Allison there's some really good signs here for going red in Minneapolis\nThe last thing is I Want to remind people there are very important house races in\nUh Minneapolis or in well in Minnesota for this race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're in the ... the ... radio show and you started your own business\nDid you make a lot more money um\nYeah I mean here I mean we were in such a bad recession and Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean that excitement and all the jobs are not going to say I want to give us out to the oil fields because contradictory\nLet's talk about the eighth district out there in Washington state and uh you know how do you build the race that you're in because you're on our list of toss ups and that will tip the balance of power and six days\nWell this is one of those twenty three seats that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen that are Republican currently out from Nancy Pelosi thinks it's a half way back to the speakership\nAnd this has been the most expensive house race in America I think she spent more money against the than any other person in America at Bloomberg wearing you know another two or three million dollars in the last week as well um you don't many cultures are number you're out of the various John and I'm proud of mine\nWell you know I mean the same thing we were talking earlier to the waters are Walter season California's forty fifth district but I think there's a Michael Bloomberg the former mayor of New Yorkers spending some nine million dollars alone in Southern California and how much of they poured into the race of negative ads against you\n[laughter] it's been it's been ... about two to one at this point no they're not ... to to wander the good news people know me and so you know the lives that they tell really aren't getting the narrative but we're all male and state every\nSo really aren't getting the narrative but we're all male and state every all ballots have been out for a ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day as election day I got the most left wing opponent I've ever had\nA you know she she woke up the day after Hillary law and decided that you need to be a member of Congress and this march and more angry protests in Seattle the increase in the district\nThinks it hating the president's our qualification to be a member of Congress Sean I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled a as quick as any politician as promised stuff and then make those promises happen [laughter]\nIt's it's it's just ridiculous that's essentially what she's running on and on and so we're we've been doing everything going door to door or a thousand have personally I'm a second pair of shoes or we need people to come to make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come hell\nYeah what what do you think do you get a day by day were turned in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there\nWe don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we've I deed and uh and our people are voting but so we're there's clearly in the ... we really got to get our people are male and about anybody listening to us right now you have a senator but I'll do it now get your family to do it all your friends get it in because\nOf the ... comes in the same or cake after list a heartless do when you get to the heart cases who may or may not vote must we talked to him\nWell she's just writing it running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess he wants to impeach the president he wants to open borders she wants the crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running well\nThat is a checklist we have a few other things that are that we're in the ad obviously we we we don't have a state income tax or state she favorites that that's been turned down nine times by the public are here but she's she's still on that bandwagon\nEffect you know it's time for a for not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare came in last healthcare myself my wife and my\nMy four children and I ended up with a lousy plan to cast too and at times as much coverage things I Want coverage coverage things I didn't want covered their twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their business you could possibly get\nSo you can decide what's your plan versus some bureaucratic politician decided for you it's called freedom\nWell listen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference in this between Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi I keep reminding people vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because they'll electric speaker\nAnd a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a vote for sure so I Hope the people in Washington state's eighth district get out there for Dino Rossi uh I Know you've done a good job and you worked hard and a sadly you have to take all of the incoming it's pretty pathetic\nUm but thank you so much for being with us and we wish you all all the best this is one of those races the Washington state eighth district where this was the tipping point the balance of power\nIs right there if you are indeed ... district All right sir thank you wish you the best thank you very much on take care\nRight eight hundred dollars for one Sean as hard toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program well you've been telling me all day that you want to do something funny and that you're not even paying attention to the show\nWhile I was going to say goodbye to I guess the by all means let's\nTalk about what what would you you all day you been threatening oh I'm going to say something funny what\nIs I ... it's not it's funny to me I think it's funny I think our audience\nA lot of I Want to do a poll poll uh-huh dot com perhaps and I was thinking about Hannity dot\nCom where we have all the tossup races and only the most important race so if you're out there and you're registered Republican you need to go to Hannity dot com and look at the thirty most important races in the country we also have an interactive map which has all Seventy races\nAvailable for you to see everything all by the ... top when you write it's in the carousel\nIt's the first story or a ... if you have any questions or concerns please call us ... nine for one day I came into force story in the first

the phone and this guy was calling from Texas and he had a nice comment but it took him Thirteen Years to get there so I said please be this up a little bit and he goes listen they became [laughter]\nThis is talk you're\nFrom New York I hear you talk real fast [laughter] and that's just the way it's going to be I was like you know what ... oh that's right baby maybe what about the last\nI Would think that will get insulted at anything\nThe last person I Would think that will get insulted at anything settled eighty assigned\nSweetheart dialing honeybee ... like all the baby chicks sugar\nBye honey bunch becoming Assad right I think uh they were yeah so anyways so and I was thinking then it'll be a lonely or I had a good story or a gun keep interrupting your show host your terrible listening oh no you're not\nEntirely on my hands right I can reclaim lifetime just think about Maxine Waters is the head of financial committee to think about that for one second just a brief diversion so\nI was thinking it might be nice if on election night you hosted your own show and I think we should take a poll and see if America would like to see host your own channel okay\nWell what you're saying is which has been a fact all my twenty three years of Fox is I don't work on election I this is true and it's all Fox the news division that takes over and I went one year I went in and uh you know I was on for five minutes and I'm like I I Want to be home alone\nAnd I want to have my three TV sets off for depending if I can set up another one in the meantime\nAnd my six computers and I want to do what I always do I want to be looking at percentages and finding out beforehand whether we're winning or losing\nNow the former president of Fox News bill shine can attest to the fact that has emails to the fact\nThat I have called it right before anybody else every single election year because you know I'm sitting there looking at let's see uh uh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida\nAnd I can figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we can ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important racist Seventy total important races although they're all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi\nMeans to heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you want running your country then by all means staying home listen at the end of the day will deal with whatever it is\nWe are going to rage their ... well you can rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad at Republicans that they don't go out and vote well I have very\nVery sad that we found ... she's already picked out the drapes she got this thing covered\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the ... the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor\nAll bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been on calls me I never get called for a poll and polls you know I look at them\nI Know the conventional wisdom is is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nUh but I also know that they got it wrong and two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not the only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that's why we play the game\nLiving experience beautiful multi

show Hi Ryan\nHow are you doing\nGreat thank you Ryan you have an impossible question for me pretty much\n[laughter] I was hoping that it was not impossible\nHit me with it\nUm I was wondering what the best way to get the best price on all these for vehicle\nGetting a good deal on a lease is really really hard because in a lease it so easy for a profit to be hidden in the deal and gotcha has to be hidden in the mice tight\nSo leases are generally pushed on people that are interested in what the cost is per month and that's really where they focus\nAnd it becomes so hard to know whether or not you're getting a deal\nThe only exception to that\nAnd it's the only one I Know is if a manufacturer is promoting in their ads a specific manufacturing we steal and this isn't done most heavily and the luxury in near luxury vehicle markets\nWhite the price point kind of vehicle or you enter center what Brant\nA stick in you know more of a truck I'm for GMC um you know nothing super luxurious\nAll right ah that would not be a market where I'd recommend leasing\nOkay\nWhen people by a truck what are they tend to do they work at to death and they drive it for a long time\nIf they work it to death and they drive it for a long time right\nTypically blood uh I I don't I don't drive every day so by the company they call it a drive to and from work\nWell then you are you are absolutely not a candidate for a ladies know ruckus leases are calculated based on mileage allowances and if this is like a weekend kind of vehicle going you know going hunting or going fishing or whatever\nIt's definitely not a vehicle to please\nOkay and what I'd recommend if you want a vehicle that you just knock around in for fun that you buy a used pickup truck\nOkay and you're just by the thing because ... that would be the smart money okay but I always talk about having a vehicle inspected by mechanic it's critical with a pickup truck because pickup trucks often are punished by their owners with what they're asked to do\nRight and having one inspected by a mechanic is ultra important because a pickup truck may even looked OK but it may have been beaten to death and you don't want something like that that it's really like an old raised source that's out of gas\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\nTwenty two\n... carrier WSBIU twenty four hour traffic center construction

share a story with you and the aftermath of seeing some of the worst that humans can do to share with you how great human beings can be there's a story about Lisa\nGreg and Zach\nSo Lisa lands on a flight in Tampa, Florida and get a frantic call from her brother in rural Nebraska named Greg Greg's an army veteran he's in great pain he had his surgery so many uh gone wrong with it he couldn't move\nHe's broke he had no way in rural Nebraska to get to the hospital\nAnd be treated and his sister all frantic upset in Tampa calls what she thinks is a number for help in Nebraska missed dial the number ... answers the phone and she says\nGot to get my brother the hospital right now she thinks she's calling kind of emergency services and it turns out she's called back the manager of a Jimmy Johns location\nAnd so this is a really confusing but she's calling and but they realized from the tone of voice something's really wrong and sure enough\nA driver goes and picks up Greg and takes US Army veteran to the hospital so he can be treated and they could have just very easily at the Jimmy Johns\nAnd this is really not about Jimmy Jones is about a human being at the store who realize somebody was in distress and step forward it forward to help them and instead of delivering sandwiches they delivered him to the hospital\nAnd these kinds of things random kindness one American to another one person to another\nThat goes on every day and we forget to appreciate that\nWhere a kid suddenly can be clicking buying stuff and then you as a parent you're the one who had the payment set up with the apple or with Google but more important the time spent on screens\nNow our producer Joe is\nIs someone who has a child who's five and a child who's two or three three and gosh time flies and your kids you and your wife have very strict rules on any screen time at all even including television\nYeah so we try to limit television consumption to forty minutes a day which have been ... honestly seems like a lot especially the way they respond when we turn the TV off\nBut definitely zero cell phone time and zero I pat or any sort of tablet time or no apps or anything like that I I it just in my opinion for our kids at least a disorder stimulus if they get from a lot of those apps it makes some of the more mundane things in life\nFeel even more mundane like it's really hard to adapt to you know the high color high touch I'm super fast world of playing games and an app and then kind of come back to normal life and just have to eat dinner with the family um it's just tougher three and a five year old to actually be able to handle that well\nSo you know as parents I'd ... I'd say that each of us handle it how we do I'd say that I completely failed it this way I mean my oldest daughter this wasn't an issue\n'cause electronics were not everywhere like they are now but I'd say with my two younger kids that I was a big fail at this and my wife was much more aware\nOf the potential for harm then I was I didn't recognize it and I I feel bad about that that we as parents need to recognize\nAbout that that we as parents need to recognize what we do it safely with a very young child you're rewiring their brains and I'm not one of those people who believes that you ban it entirely that's why there's a range of opinions and Joel and his wife have said none at all\nBut having the tight collar on time watching video of any kind and you may find that any app that's free is one you want to avoid\nHis nap it's free how are they gonna pay for it they're going to pay for it by having ads embedded in it so actually cheap guy telling you to pay for it paying for Netflix if you want to let them watch video instead of letting him watch traditional TV where there's going to be all the ads is a way you can\nAh prevent the advertising from having undue influence on a young child's mind\nBut the screens themselves having tight limits that are age appropriate on how much time on the screen\nIs great and with the new fancy wireless mash products that I recommend for you to have in your home but he'd be much more reliable and faster Internet near her home there they're going to be completely calm and if you're out looking at technology at all through this fall\nIs instead of having a traditional wireless router\nThese things all at base or getting back to an out you're able to control how much time you're kids can have on screens automatically So Joel mentioned forty minutes how would you enforce that well with the apps you shot a device down\nWhen it when a child's use would hit forty minutes they're done whatever the the rules are you put in place it's a very easy way for you to enforce it using electronics to defeat electronics yes we've come to that\n[laughter] oh boy met some of those on the Clark Howard show Hi\nMatt Hi click it's an honor to talk to you I've never been on live radio before\nWell it's great to have you here and you have a question for me that if you knew the arguments that go on in our house over what you're about to ask me oh boy hit me with it\nYeah I can imagine so right now I live on my own and Minnesota and in the winter it gets pretty cold and I was wondering what I'm at work for eight ten hours a day what temperature shave my thermostat at when I'm done and there's no one there heat in the house so that I'm saving as much energy as I can\nOkay so wow you didn't ask me what I keep my thermostat that when people ask me a lot so what temperature are you comfortable in when you're home\nThe way I cared about sixty four sixty five weight when you're home yeah\nOh my goodness I found somebody who is worse than I Am also long sleeves and blankets are for [laughter] well see that's my kind\nOf attitude and my family says they all are miserable during winter 'cause they say that I keep the house like it's a refrigerator to save money\nYeah that's after we've done extreme insulation in the house and all kinds of other things to reduce energy consumption so mhm if you are you're shocking me that you like the house at sixty four so you would be okay\nAnd if you get a nest thermostat something like that they're really cheap now ... what a\nSmart thermostat from a different company\nOkay so you've got one I Would say generally if you keep it at fifty five degrees when you're not there and a half hour before you typically come home that you have the smart thermostat set to go up to sixty four sixty five\nYou don't want to let it go below that you have danger with potentially pipes breaking it also makes it much harder for the house to heat backup\nBut if you have a roughly eight to ten degree\nLower temperature when you're not home then you like to have when you're home that would be where you'd want to be\nThat's great thank you because I've been keeping a fifty eight and I felt like it still is too warm when I'm got\nYes I agree so if you were if you like sixty four you could go maybe to fifty for a bit fifty five is a pretty good number\nOkay and I can't ... I Can't even begin to tell you how many people are listening to you and me right now Matt who think both of us are ridiculous\nBut it makes it fun for me when I get called I'm just thinking I'm saving money so so I got extra flannel\nWell good for you [laughter] it's funny I I was uh the other day I was in a store that was selling it was all day and they were selling these men um wintertime\nThese men um wintertime long pajama pants that were like um what's that material like flannel\nAnd it seems like they'll keep me warm when the temperatures like forty four in the house Tom how're you doing today\nGood\nSo you live in California listening to someone in Minnesota talk about winter must sound like really crazy\nYeah it's it's here we are getting towards winter at Seventy one and sunny outside for us [laughter]\nIt's pretty good temp isn't it yes [laughter]\nYeah my wife refers to the temperature and much of California is no temperature it it's just basically you feel perfect and you don't even think about what the number is\nYes it's much nicer energy bills all met\nSo speaking of numbers there's a number that you've been accustomed to getting for free that's not going to be there anymore what number is that\n[noise] or using an account which I learned about some use several years ago and I use it for generally the psycho and also um adults with one of a free credit reports and I've always trusted it [noise]\nAnd um but I just received an email a few days ago saying that they're going to be going away and they're asking me to join something called and create\nYour bank rights completely legitimate and quiz all I think was the pioneer and you must have been listening to me for a long time if you heard me talk about quiz because that was years ago that I talked about them being this great pioneer with free information available and all that\nAnd they'd been eclipse in recent years by credit karma which is the largest source of information and where you can see what's going on with your credit and all that and credit sesame\nWho have both been a quicker and the marketing their bank rate is a very successful\nClearing house of information and quiz all found a good buyer for ah for their customers and I would feel comfortable you know bank raiders setting up a new portal that will give you\nAccess to free information about your credit that is kind of like a more modern adaptation of quiz all\nAnd I would feel comfortable using the bank great platform\nExcellent that [noise] I just want to be sure 'cause I Know that I can trust anything that you recommend it is I always have and I'm comfortable to just go ahead and start seeing a grape and barely realizing that cause it will be going away", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "01"}
