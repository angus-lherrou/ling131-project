American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American in a professional career her political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this they and tries to prove\nTo her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics at the worst than I mean you know ... it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts slant solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but you really want to let somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elected guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible just that uh the people\nI'm so I guess it is possible just that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nShowing great to be a way they think hey this is the state where I'm you know start run one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front to back to um she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're a one percent or but she also herself deducted fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes That's Elizabeth Warren\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons deducting their use the underwear as a U.S that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear\nAnd they put a value to it you know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pays forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else\nThe tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they want to eliminate eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter of about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people now this is right after congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and uh I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod he was critical or she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I've actually\nPut ... billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November six with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time to sit by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish in McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports I'm ... I've been to Boston to lots of beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through this I don't know what to tell them\n[laughter] we'll look Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not enjoy my race Curt Schilling indoors but most importantly\nBy the way where he ... he needs to endorse or [laughter] or we need to get that had his locker Tom Brady is the most\nHated man except for New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight well look at you know Sean a lot has changed since you've been here unemployment's now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty nine that's that's where the whole country but Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state more money as far as new jobs\nWage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like a Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that\nAnd raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent would be the baseline and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be too much room she was on ah MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course\nShe wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty six trillion dollar price tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like uh people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states\nStuart dialysis like people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down cost ones government becomes the guaranteed parents just like student loans you know it was a bit foreign complains about the cost of college course she\nTries to hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or that you know the fact is when government becomes the ... of the loans or whether it's a student just solitaire not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive to ... year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it was competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between will pay attention to you know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here\nFor her to become president you got to re elect her and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well an eraser\nThanks Sean if people want to get involved it's not too late deal for Senate dot com GI ... s ...

heard cash flow taking out the door\nStarting a business moving buy a house\nStarting a business always short order\nYeah\nHow and the world would you sleep at night you must they must feel no anxiety at all your life\nThen goes a specially during this [laughter] 'cause I Would I Will tell you\nDuring the day because I Would I Will\nTell you you know I don't know if you've ever heard me talk about

some cash and some some alone um so we wouldn't be investing at a franchise is is there out we're going to go and then um we have a twenty percent down saved away for the home if they needed a way we can\nYeah I Would really I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be casual positive and how many months and they tell you\nHow proud I say anything they show is their best guy their worst guy in their average guy and and I and even their worst guy would be okay with us\nOkay All right well that's good I I and ... either you you say we as you and your husband are

of one of you going to work for one of the franchise is doing anything and everything for at least three months\nMhm because she got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really like for you to a experience at one or both of you to experience the business before you're all lay on\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk you there's so much you learn\nIn a relatively short period of time that a lemonade or issues concerns mistakes you might make

supplies are you familiar with how Cosco has the business centres\nYes and they approached me as a likely good candidate for their wholesale club and I just did not know what to think of that\nBecause the business centres specifically deal with um a owner operators of small motels they sell 'em you know a facial tissue and private label and huge box quantities you know where do you have\nThe the size of the individual boxes are smaller but they say you big quantities one time huge amounts of toilet paper all those kinds of things Sam's Club if you joined their premium membership\nHas a
