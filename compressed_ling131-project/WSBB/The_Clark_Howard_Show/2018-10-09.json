you're going there instead of a competitor\nWith retail same idea the retailer is trying to get you brand loyal in an industry that no longer really has any brand loyalty\nAnd there's a big difference

this is Rob\nHi Rob it's great to have you here on the car coward show and Rob you want to talk about how I always trash for oh three B plans\nThat's right Clark and at first I just want to say I'm I'm completely did he talking to you I've been listening to you for decades and uh have followed your advice and also myself been interested in personal finance and investments for not since I was a teenager a lot like you so\nI'm right yes so forestry bees I'm as you've talked about there for nonprofits and they do have a bad rap or in some of them are still pretty lousy but my wife and I worked in a a number of uh organizations with\nFor three days that have been excellent and\nI work in health care and she works for a think tank and we've never had anything but fantastic for us to review with\nSome of your favorite companies and very low expense ratio does um so I just want us to make sure that you were aware of that not all for three bees are bad and ah when callers call in asking about their plans making sure they they look under the hood of what they've really got\nWell that is a great thing you said 'cause you know when I talk in such stark terms about four three bees\nI'm trying to really shake people up and get them to do something they don't even know they can do and that is find out what they're paying for the for the ... the problem in the fourth ruby industry is so often even if somebody has a finds offered to them from\nA low cost a fun house they may still be paying very high charges for administration to an insurance company that manages the four three be there at and so\nYeah that's ... go ahead that's right I I think especially um teachers have traditionally\nBeen exposed to pretty lousy plans through their school districts and and whatever plans they've they've worked out um but\nYeah and isn't it ... teachers get beaten up every possible way not physically but I mean\nYou know that teachers have trouble getting enough respect they have trouble getting enough pay for the hard work they do and then on top of it that generally school districts whacked the capability in house\nTo pick good for three B plans and so they just kinda say oh why don't you handled that whoever you are you going to handle that or it's handled by a teacher's union that also lacks\nThe expertise to pick these plans and the teachers ended up getting socked with the expenses that are so high that often a teacher will end up with less money at the end of a year and they started with at the beginning because the fees are so dry norm us\nThat's in the last ... financial term by the way John enormous not really [laughter] housing\nTeacher plans with three percent ... expense ratio is and as an example my plan and my wife's plan has expense ratio is a total expenses down around point ... point oh four percent so\nThat's kind of passing so where you and your wife are is in the range of what a good for three four one K. would be also\nYeah well thanks clerked for everything you do appreciate it\nAnd I and keep saving that money\nMore you save the better off you're going to be and we're speaking now with tied tied welcome to the Clark Howard show\nHigh clerk it's nice to talk to you thank you for taking my call\nCertainly Todd how can I be of service\nYeah well my wife and I have an emergency funds I'm just at a local\nBank and but it's not it's in just a regular checking account and it's not getting any kind of like return on it\nUm and so really I was just kind of wondering if you had any advice to maybe moving it I have a local credit union maybe in our area that I've seen maybe two or three percent for a checking account um this one to kind of get your thoughts on that\nSo that the two percent checking accounts usually two or three or ten years ago there were five percent checking accounts the way those work is you and your wife we'd have to do so many debit card transactions than a month\nAnd clear them as credit card transactions you know how would the debit card you'll use it somewhere or any car and they'll say debit or credit\nAnd with a debit card you can choose to say\nThe debit card you can choose to say credit even though it's a debit card and then the merchant has to pay much higher fees than they would if it clears is a debit card\nSo when a credit union or a bank is offering higher interest rates on checking accounts with those accounts usually they're limited to paying the interest on our balance up to like twenty or twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd you're required to do usually I think it's like a twelve to twenty depending on the bank or credit union debit card transactions a month cleared as credit and that's where the money comes from to pay you the interest is from what they earn on those merchant fees\nOkay so you would most likely will kind of keep it where it's at now just liquid or I'm\nNo sign up for an answer although\nUm you can link your existing account to one of the online banks that are paying now lots of them are paying\nAround two percent even some a little more than two percent on simple savings and the money can be moved on two days' notice you know emergency usually two days will be quick enough you're moving back to your regular bank\n\nAnd then you earn and two percent that's going to go higher over the next six months\nGotcha and that is just simply linking the account to an online bank or is that moving it\nThat's exactly right what you do is you open an account with an online bank and you drink it to your existing bank or credit union account\nAnd then the money can be moved back and forth pretty easily and I'm working right now there's a website that has a pretty good list of the online banks I'm looking at a bank right dot com and the highest rates available today or to point two five percent\nOn simple savings\nAnd so that's that's where things are headed by the end of the year we may have the highest rates people were offering around two point five or so for some\nReally simple to just link your account and no you're going to get a better deal so give it a try you're listening to the Clark Howard show

buying a car it doesn't matter if you're looking at a at a car that's returned from ...\nIt doesn't matter if it was a return from lease actually what matters is it you're getting a deal on a three year old luxury car whether it was traded in after somebody bought it it was least whatever it's just a matter of you buying one\nAt a good deal and with anyone you look at having inspected by

it works and remember higher ground is a better idea\nSusan is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Susan\nHow are you today I'm Susan you want to talk about your family members what's going on with them\nWell I have a couple of family members that have high chairs and one of them got till the time share trauma and it could now why are you from\nAnd why is high and share their thinking like fall and it's a very popular lane\nAnd that's got the limit and I know there's a lot of emails faithful gift of trying to sell and there's the website and I think some of those on the left and he just getting their idea of what to do with high chair\nRight so let me just lay it straight out to you Susan I'm your relative is pretty much stuck with those weeks\nFor class\nTime shares are are virtually completely on sellable and even at a time share\nThat was sold by a well known and recognize brand like some of the hotel chains were in that business for a while even in those cases the value of a time share that you purchase declines by\nAlmost a hundred percent the second is purchased\nSo any of the any of the offers that they receive\nThe any of the offers that they receive saying oh we're going to help you sell your time share we've got a buyer and then if I were in the salad for X number of dollars all we need from you as to pay us this listing fear this money or whatever\nThey're all bogus they're all scams\nAnd what I recommend it in the past and it still is holes is true right now is your relatives need to use their weeks and get some value out of them\nAre these are our points I guess that if we\nDo they have trouble redeeming their points or they don't try\nNow they they are using the one that ... that that's why they don't really have any need for they had a transfer from there and\nWhich means they are they are the nicest people to do that because they took a burden from their hand but there was something they can't now and burden themselves from\nRight generally if you want somebody to take over a timeshare week not only be paid for that week but then you have to turn around and pay them usually in the thousands of dollars to take it over\nTime share weeks or points have a negative value because you're entering into an obligation that goes on and on and on and on and you have no control what the fees are going to be for that obligation\nBut that was why during our show that was the last show for a a Web site\nOh well let me tell you it's funny I'm so glad you mentioned that because we just talked about this on the show recently is that I don't even know who's advertising on the show or our website\nAh also an ad that appears in it the way ads are placed I don't even know who's doing that or you know where the ads are coming for who I Know where they come from but I don't know who's running ads and it could even be a local ad not one of my show ads\nSo I Know that that there's no method that I Know of where you can actually make money\nSelling a timeshare weaker selling timeshare points because\nIt is a a it's a defective market you know it's something for every thousand sellers there's not even a buyer so what I Would say is they need to find a use for that second week\nAnd start using it or even give it to other relatives to use the weeks as long as I'll pay the annual fees for it and one other idea that has worked for some people saw repeat it is that if you go stay at your time share week while you're there there are other people who love time shares I made a lot of that place\nAnd they may be willing to take on the obligation and have you sign it over to them you're not going to make any money but you'll end the obligation for the week and that's usually the best you can hope for with a time share I've also mentioned fake Keisha\nV. A. C. H. T. I. A. which is kind of like a bulletin board\nFor people trying to buy and uh well they don't really buy 'em they get time shares and people trying to unload time shares and you could check that out Michael is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Michael\n... Michael you are a Nissan Leaf owner\nYes I Am proud of it too had in mind going on three years ago three years ago and that's why it's not a purchaser life\nAnd a cricket by federal outlays than ... coming up your monitor and one thing I did not start as a a um a lot about that kind of the better because you know how long does it better laughing electric cars to place and we're about ... ... ...\nOkay so let's deal with all that and the reverse order\nTurn your co Leon when the leases up even if you love it because they're on his age will in your leases if it's like most of the Nissan Leaf says I've heard about would require you to pay somewhere in the mid teens to buy your leaf at the end of the least\nAbout the right man for yours about yeah\nOK because of light now you can buy a use leaf of an age probably similar to your three year old when you're turning in for somewhere six seven or eight thousand dollars 'cause the use leaf market is flooded so if you love your life\nYou're probably going to find is better to dump peers and by another three year old when it less than half the cost you pay under residual now I'm having terrible battery problems with my life\nThe range of it has reduced dramatically and it it it's a problem because I've really got to think about where the ...\nWell because I've really got to think about where the trip if I can take it and the leaf\nAnd mine was a very very early production model it was not a pre production but it was one of the first ones were pretty much commercially available in the U.S\nAnd I've heard that the batteries on the early ones like mine are very unreliable and have deteriorated quite rapidly but other people with newer leafs have not reported that problem at all\nBut if you do follow at my suggestion turning the leaf you have when you go to buy another one you know there's that dial to the right hand side of where you charge relief that will show you how much the leaf battery has deteriorated and if it's still at a hundred percent strength\nYou will be fine buying that as a use leaf but it's had a significant loss and the capacity of the battery if it's really deteriorated don't buy that one Robert's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you\nUm find Clark how are you great thank you you have a question for me about arbitration\nYeah you know I listen to your show a lot and I know that you talked about arbitration a doctor's office or when you signed paperwork and stuff but\nI'm looking to get a new roof on my house and I'm getting a couple a bit from one of the bits I got the contract that the contractor sent me a binding arbitration in it and uh I think you always\nKind of talk down about that\nAnd I do talk down arbitration because when they impose it on you they probably picked the forum for arbitration in there\nAnd the reason it's such a rotten system is that if you agree to their arbitration and they picked the arbitrator the arbitrator only makes money\nIf they keep getting the business well so arbitrators have an unholy alliance with the businesses that select the arbitration panels because if they don't find for the business they don't get work anymore", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "09"}
