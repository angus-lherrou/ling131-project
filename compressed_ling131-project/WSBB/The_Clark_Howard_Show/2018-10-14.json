T. because just like with Don you know we hear a certain size depending upon which channel you're watching you get kind of this\nFiltered view of the world Katie is great because he's he's an insider but he's not and you know he he there's no affiliation there's no political affiliation so we talk with JT about everything that's there and it's just a a a fantastic way to to go about things so\nWith all that you know dating it's great to have you here on investing sense of water talk first in in that way on this too much but uh we saw everything happened with the Kavanaugh circus right now what are insiders seeing as the after effects of that especially as we Wade through these next couple of weeks up to the ...\nIt's it's interesting you're seeing a lot in in the sort of the uh the mainstream media and in other sources out there but I I Do subscribe to the fact that there are a number of folks that said the height of\nDogs you don't pay their bills are grown and all it's All right I'm\nMike Ron did pay the way back when book I don't anymore I'm my question is should I don't really know on a good stock and reinvest in the ones that do pay the evidence\nOr there's you know it it's a great question so there's a couple of things going on here um is what I like to do is is really two things I like to focus on the the clients goal that they're trying to accomplish and then as a function of that I only want to take on the least amount of risk\nThat I got to take on for the client to be able to reach that goal and so was twenty Seventeen and it was a a banner year for the market uh you know your stocks have probably done well here over the summer months\nBut it it may you may be um [noise]\nYou may be presented with an opportunity right now to kind of clear the board\nReevaluate what you're trying to do and and really get yourself into some different investments different types of investments so that you're better position for what we see coming here the rest of the year and then twenty Nineteen\nAnd now the thing about the evidence is this evidence or great until they're not there anymore and just because the company is paying dividends right now in stocks doesn't mean that that's going to continue in the in the future\nSo give me a sense of you know at ... you know with all that in mind give me a sense of what else you might be doing do you have any other investments any other accounts are you married what your wife doing and her four oh one K. outside of these you know handful of stocks that you've got right now\nFor one K. outside of these you know handful of stocks that you've got right now\nWhy are you married or white or before ... when her company um shoot then they're probably recording your word for the company shares or\nWe uh we have a lower rate for the you know I'm a ... we have one of the heritage and the other was\n... just a nice chunk of money and put it in there and I think we've got about three or four one for ...\nFor that all of these are ... for five years All right we\nAlso have a ... a we've got a little bit of money in there and they pay out I'm a\nOnce a year in the ... ... ... a little ... from their okay um we're both fifty nine years old my wife will draw your shoe fifth year she's getting ready to start drifting off the air or on a ... a large okay and I'm a real estate\nBroker is she works for um a measure factory company\nOkay so ... is so here's how I Would look at this you've got a lot of different elements a lot of different\nVariables that are running right now in what I Would call your overall financial picture you've got your uh your your IRA in this handful of stocks you've got the four one K. that air your wife has the four one K. you're still working I'm you're trying to plan for kind of this next run\nBefore you retire at some point you're going to have Social Security that you have to account for\nWhat I Would want you to do is in vast with the end in mind okay where do you want to be an X number of years if you're\nFifty nine if she's fifty eight what's your retirement plan to you want to retire at sixty five sixty six with the real estate brokerage is this something that you want to continue for awhile give me a sense of what the time horizon is on this\nFor me ... I'll probably continue to get rid of the largest to do it any more 'cause I enjoy doing it [noise] um my wife she's talked about retiree ...\nAny debts do you have any debt right now\nA real heavy building that we had our our home and uh we talked about it all but we haven't gone to ...\nAll right so there's um if if you think about things imagine you had a a piece of paper on the table in front of you and your draw a circle\nThere's lots of different parts inside that circle or you've got Social Security your investments how you're going to ... yet you create a retirement income stream or what to do with your wife four one K. had to pay for health care you know what to do with the mortgage\nAll those different things it would probably make some sense um you know to sit down and I I can put you in touch with my local a team down there or Austin and ... and Sean\nI'm but you've done everything right up to this point you've probably been a great saver um the way that you talk about the the stocks that you've picked and how you approached it and just the fact that you have a dividend strategy and and and are trying to figure out what to do [noise]\nYou've got this opportunity to kind of pivot and get ready for kind of this next phase of your life it may be that you still hold a little bit of Pepsi or it may be that you do some different things with your wife four one K. or maybe that you do some different things with the annuities\nBut really what you want to try to do is get ready for twenty Nineteen and you do that you know with trying to evaluate alright why do we need these annuities do we need these annuities um you know with your income can you save inside of a set\nBy or re if you're kind of an independent contractor or you know depending upon what you're doing there\nYou can still save you can still invest\nBut you know again I Would use this opportunity to kind of a not quite wipe the board or you know wipe the slate clean but really say All right I've got this chunk of money what do I need to be doing right now to get ready for twenty Nineteen\nAnd so it's not so much evidence strategy versus non evidence strategy it's not so much do I sound micron or handily or what to do with Ali Baba it's what what types of investments do I need does that make sense I mean ... okay so I mean if you hold on here\nUm I Want to confirm that I've got some information for you I Know that we have a telephone number but we'll we'll talk about some things are fair\nBut really man you've done everything right and what I Want to do is kinda trim around the edges and get you ready here for the next you know couple of quarters\nSo that no matter what comes at us in the market just like what you know no matter what came at you with the hurricane you were ready for for different things you know based on what the based on what happened for ... or I'd rather you hold on and uh we'll get to some good help\nOr by reading\nNow we have an email that Kenny has sent to our inbox\nNow we have an email that Kenny has sent to our inbox it asks candy and investing sense dot com and Kenny writes\nI used to be a smoker and have recently become a successful nonsmoker I've decided to turn my interest to things that I'd been intrigued by like investing my question is where do you suggest starting for a beginner things to read or websites to visit that sort of thing anything helps and keep up the great show\nMan Kenny you are awesome uh for for quitting smoking congrats I Know that ... you know how difficult it can be but how life changing that it really is and and really I Love hearing that you are intrigued by investing All right I mean learning how the financial system in this country works participating as\nAnd and you know and as an investor these can be pretty pretty rewarding things right so a couple of ideas here real quick first totally keep listening to investing sense or most of what Bob and I do is you know we try to educate\nListeners okay at past that think about um invested ...\nUh like it sounds it's this online encyclopedia on investing so invested ... dot com and then Morningstar or they've got tons of free education and tons of research they also have an Academy of sorts that you can kind of step through\nSo Kenny I'd start there it's been a few months kind of devouring everything that you can and then get back to me and we'll ... we'll go from there\nNow mark has a question he's calling from Ohio at eight eight eight eight three three eight six three seven mark thanks for calling how can we help\nBut my son is Seventeen years old and he would like to start a ... he worked in a family business any aid and wanted to get started in Iraq Iran not sure what I find a way to put that in its plan that you\nPut money into it or or five years and they just leave it and let it go though just try to get in fights with them on now where for him to quit it money or I started off\nMark good for you here for helping your son gets started like this I I might have you reconsider having your son put money into this Roth IRA instead a thing about opening a brokerage account and that would have everything to do with you having a little bit more flexibility and option analogy with with the money\nSo that tax free benefit of the Roth that you feel better about their ability of the brokerage account ...\nYeah maybe and really just demand for flexibility is a function of his son's age okay either way or the portfolio that I've been recommending for young investors like your son is you know our sixty thirty ten portfolio and ah so these are the allegations to three different asset\nClasses that your son might consider that going to talk investments because it's just kind of broad ethic classes okay\nSo sixty percent allocated to the ... five hundred a large kept stocks got thirty percent thing about allocating too small kept stocks\nThat last ten percent or maybe think about a core bond fund so that you can kinda round out the portfolio but this is a this is a virtual portfolio could get your son started saving for a very long term goal\nSend me an email ask Andy at investing cents dot com right portfolio review in the subject line um but really just get me that email ask Andy at investing cents dot com and\nThis week's portfolio was sent to us from Henry and Henry writes I all of my retirement money at the bank in an IRA CD I'm sixty eight and a half\nAnd still working and I don't have any plans to retire I've been collecting Social Security for a few years and I just put the money in savings even if I wasn't working I could be about the same financially what if any other suggestions would you have for me well\nI'm first of all I'm really glad that you reached out here a Henry we talk a lot about risk on investing sense and a lotta times it's from the perspective of a the potential of losing my time but you might actually be exposing your heart and savings to some overlooked risks\nAre namely longevity and inflation K but set set those aside here for for a moment I think what this comes down to is that you might not be taking enough risk with these with the savings will\nHenry wrote that he's sixty eight and still working and then said I don't have any plans to retire that's a lot different than other sixty eight year olds and it sounds like that those are a couple of signs that may be in good health and and could live for a good while longer\nSaying he sounds like a hard working guy right or you know so Henry I might actually have you think about getting your money to work a little bit harder for you\nA you've got these dual income sources sounds like you're in a pretty good financial position um you know I might have you consider a portfolio that's a little bit more balanced I fifty percent stock fifty percent bond because\nYou know you're you're not taking any risk with your ear you think that you're not taking any risk with your savings but you're forgetting about inflation and how those could eat into your CD returns and then all of a sudden there's this solid risk that your CD returns\nSo and then all of a sudden there's this solid risk that your CD returns are going to be falling short of of what you need and putting you in a position where you can\nBe losing a lot of money and I I went ahead and log on to bank right dot com and I'm looking at the CD a returns right now here's what I'm seeing the national average for a one year CDs two point four percent\nOr the average return for a three year CD is two point four seven percent and the national average for a five year CD to point seven three percent so that that gives you an idea of where CD rates are\nSo what about the historical rates for the return of the fifty fifty stock bond portfolio that you just mentioned\nRight so vanguard studied this fifty fifty portfolio fifty percent stocks fifty percent bond and they went back and they looked at its historical performance going all the way back to Nineteen twenty six\nSo here's what they found the average annual return was eight point four percent of the best year was in Nineteen thirty three portfolio returns thirty two percent the worst year was in Nineteen thirty one when the portfolio last twenty two percent\nBut since Nineteen twenty six this portfolio has had Seventeen losing years I Know sounds kind of lousy but if you step back and think about that that means since Nineteen twenty six\nThis fifty fifty portfolio stocks bonds it's been profitable on a yearly basis a little bit more than ... eighty percent of the time\nSo confirming the annual average return for the fifty percent stock fifty percent bond portfolio going back to Nineteen twenty six was was eight point four percent correct right okay so I'm thinking of a simple way to try and compare the return of\nOf that portfolio to the three years CD um because that's where Henry said all of his money is in his Iraq right\nSo and then with our as you're thinking about like the requirement of distribution exact right so you know strip that I'll just keep it simple look at the returns in a hypothetical taxable brokerage account\nRun that same example over the next ten years starting balance of four hundred grand a use that twenty two percent marginal tax rates that don't make it more complicated and\nOkay okay well then that that the formula that you just stated that comes to four hundred and eighty four thousand dollars a bad so let me run that same example with the returns from uh the stock portfolio at eight point four percent\nAnd at the end of ten years you would have about seven hundred and fifty four thousand dollars that the traumatic different\nModi right yeah I mean that's the power of compound gross I'm signed called in a miracle to seize this opportunity you got to be willing to take at least some risk with your investments if\nYou do you know it's possible that you could be in a much better place financially than if you'd never taken the risk and the first place so Henry hang tight and when an email you some information on how you might invest\nThe or the fifty fifty allocation and funds you know what do we are going to go um but besides Henry I want you to ask yourself is my money working as hard as I Am\nAnd if your answer is no or if you can't answer the question it's probably time to get some help and there's probably time to create a long term personalized financial plan that makes sense for your particular situation alright get over to investing

about this every single weekend bulls and bears a lot of people whenever I meet someone that says Adam I've been listening to you and champ for a while and I I hear you know weekend and week out that you can make money in a downward move with the market\nPeople get confused on the idea of short selling they think it has something to do with time they don't realize it had something to do a direction\nBut to keep things simple in that fashion that we always do is\nPeople can make money when the market is falling and I want to take a moment I Want to talk about one of the best in the world to explain that let's talk about shorting good we talk about it Wednesday would have been a great day actually this week you look at the S. and P. as a whole yes it'd be five hundred most people benchmark the health of the broad market at the stock market as a whole\nAnd mark the health of the broad market of the stock market as a whole\nBy using the S. and P. what's great is that there's a product out there called exchange traded fund ATF is the acronym and that ATF tracks the S. and P. it's ticker symbol is SBY now the SP why is something that we can trade up or down in other words if the market collapse as we can profit when it falls now this is the difference\nThat Wall Street doesn't want you to understand the wall street wants you to think that if the market goes up that's good to mark goes down that's bad\nAnd people are trained to think that way and who do you nose waiting and excited about to collapse in the market I mean really at the hands just went up here in the studio\nMost people aren't because they think that the market goes down that's a bad day but it's not a bad day because it's a natural progression of price movement and someone profits on that move them think about this for every dollar made as adult last so if you lose money someone makes so if you lose money and a four one K. because the S. and P. fell four percent this week\nSomebody made that money didn't disappear didn't vaporize it went to somebody else who was short your position in other words they were expecting the market in the fall they are prepared for it and they profit from it you realize you can do that folks\nAnd Wall Street doesn't want to understand how to do it because now you're going to compete with them for the money and what's great about that as we have living examples in testimony it was just from this week that you could have treated the S. and P. and made money this week even on a week with the S. and P. fell and what's neat about that is that that's what separates the wheat from the chaff in the market that is what truly separates\nThe most successful traders and investors people don't understand how to make money regardless of direction of the market\nFrom the masses and let me tell you something folks the masses\nAre not where you want to be when it comes to financial success they really don't have any money and for the most part they only know how to make money when the mark goes up when the market was down that's a bad day is not a bad day it's just another day\nExactly and that's the key thing to understand the market goes up the market goes down the average person out there knows how to make money in and out market they wonder how to make money in a down market and when you take that idea\nAnd it's not difficult is just different all of a sudden you know the opportunity every single day every single week every single year two thousand eight was a great year for some of the people I Know two thousand one and two is a great two years for some people I Know and this next correction going to be phenomenal first again people that we know chip\nAnd what a certified financial planner arrested vested Vita somebody's trying to get you to give them your money to manage they want you to think that down is bad and it's not and so let me give an example uh current example from this week\nIt was a product called the SP why we talked about earlier it attracts the U.S and the and the SP why you could have sold that at the beginning of the week\nAnd literally just brought it into marketing sold at at the price it was that it was around two hundred and Ninety bucks\nSo let's just take one share for example\nLet's just say it's two hundred Ninety bucks a share you decide that you want to sell it now here's the difference and this were a lot of people have a disconnect when it comes to shorting was short selling and all we're talking about is selling something to open a position or open a trade see the problem with many people as they can't fathom how can I sell something if I have an already bought it\nWell in the financial markets your broker allows you to use their shares to sell into the market\nAnd the anticipation that's going to fall in price so let me give you an example of how this would look let's just say on Monday you decide that you wanted to sell the SBY\nThe S. and P. exchange traded fund that's a tick the symbol SBY so you went to the market sort of a tuna and that you didn't know that you sold your brokers shares into the market your broker allows you to use their inventory to sell into the market at the market price well on Monday was two hundred Ninety bucks so Monday you sold a share for two hundred Ninety bucks and you waited\nAnd then was the week when by you bought it back on Wednesday maybe Thursday\nAnd he bought it back for two hundred and Seventy bucks because of the fall and twenty dollars a share\nNow what did you just do well you stole something to get to Ninety and you bought it to Seventy see the key to the market is to buy low and sell high\nThe differences you did it in reverse order you sold to enter the position at two Ninety now you didn't own the sheer you use your brokers shares they allow you to use their inventory to sell into the market to Ninety\nWonder why they allow you to inventory because they charge a commission silly goose they're going to charge a fee to use that it's a small fee could be a dollar could be ten bucks depending on the broker it's a small fee but allows you to utilize their inventory to sell into the market because they're commission based in other words they get paid when you executed trade they want you to hit that button\nSo you hit the button to Ninety selling the shares into the market\nNow you're short the stock that's what the term is called your shut the position\nYou have to buy this years back and replace it back into your brokers inventory but your goal is to buy back up to Seventy well when it fell to Seventy you bought it back to Seventy you bought at the moment you bought it went right back and you broke his inventory\nAnd I guess what happened the twenty dollars that was left over because you sold it to Ninety you brought it back to Seventy the minute you bought it back to stock went right back into your brothers have been tore you keep the twenty bucks\nIn a week on a downward moving the S. and P. in other words the market fell you profit no on one share that's twenty bucks on a hundred shares that's two grand\nOn a thousand shares that's twenty grand you realize that there's opportunity to make money regardless of direction the market and this week you could've made money\nThis week you could have made money in the S. and P. when it fell and if we get the major collapse which are calling for a major move down the U.S and ... you can be prepared to make money all the way down\nThat's what show it in the short selling it's a game changer folks and it's not that difficult the wall street wants you to think you're not smart enough to make money regardless of director of the market and that's a lie we keep talking about that\nYou need to learn the skills of shorting and when the market falls take the opportunity that the best traders investors the Goldman Sachs the buffets DePaul tutor Joes the best traders they're taking that moved out and making money and the masses are losing\nGet out of the masses they don't understand how to make money regardless of direction and most importantly the most successful traders to control their money\nAnd make the decision themselves up given that control to some institution is telling you down as bad be careful folks there's great opportunity but you've got to learn the skill of short and short selling and they'll open up whole new avenues for ya absolutely\nIn a lot of people think up as good down his bed and just as you said champ up is good down as good if you know how to short sale and that's why online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears\nThey have a class specifically on short in the market now have you been in the marketing you've never shorter

recently about short selling how to make money in the market collapsed so a lot of great content please like us follow us whatever it's going to take\nAnd exactly exactly champ talking about a variety of things right now though I Want to check in with our sponsor online training academy we have coach shells Chris shells on the phone right now Chris what's going on\nThey buddy a man it's a it's great to be back and I argue just referencing doing a Facebook Live session about short in the market will hold a great time to short the market you see what happened early this week obviously\nYeah yeah I mean getting crushed the dial down three percent on Wednesday just amazing to watch you know what people do to do and where he was showing them you know what there's a way to make money at least to not lose when this happens and that's why we're banging the drum here\nWhen I hear it man I I hear it all the time and and I've heard you say there is a senior coach many times before you know there was no better time to be a part of the academy what a great opportunity was missed for so many people that don't understand how to trade in both directions\nYeah and what's amazing about the academy and I know that you're down there right now just people love the fact that the market falls I mean we were just talking about how many people do you know out there really in your everyday life and I'm Talking to the listeners right now that are excited about the market going down and they say hardly any\nBut yet there's tremendous opportunity if you understand the system of creating a more poorly you know that direction doesn't matter\nYeah well you know what chance speaking about being excited\nUm there's a lot of things going on at the campus and just that you know an online trading outta me as a whole were actually gearing up and again you know this we're gearing up for our international conference where you know we're all of the campus does have an opportunity to gather together and start focusing on some of the new innovative technologies and things that are coming out\nAnd you know representing the school clearly I'm proud of the fact that all my trading economy was up for technology innovation award for some of the process of the procedures we put in place again there's no better time to be a student at the school\nYeah it's amazing because I remember two thousand eight when the market collapsed the last time and people were flocking into the academy saying I don't know what to do I don't want to get crossed I Can't lose forty percent of my nest egg in my four one K. and a straight done moving the market\nIs starting to sense that a lot of the students that are coming to the academy or maybe begin to realize especially with the last couple of weeks it more so this week\nThat maybe that's not the time to not understand how to be safe in the markets and most importantly how do I protective it does go down and you start to see that more and more people will be a little bit concerned with that Chris\nWell you know unfortunately people are scared they're they're they're afraid and the fact of the matter is fear really shouldn't be a part of your decision making process but for so many people they don't understand the opportunity\nSo they're only left with fear that they're going to lose their money you know where you're you said banging the drums about self directing a do it on your own rather than handing it over to someone who's gonna charge you an arm and a leg and then not put you in a position where you can profit of spice fall\nAnd I'm seeing it day in and day out with students at the school to come in and you're saying I got to figure this out on my own I Can't afford to lose that money I'm paying way too much for poor performance in one direction or biased account\nI'm paying way too much for poor performance in one direction or biased account I mean back to the matter chant online trading academies process is going to work at any market condition in any marketing any timeframe if we can just learn to set us a set of rules and and apply that systematically\nSky's the limit and back to the matter is we gather together as a as a school or going to be looking at all of the you know all the new things that are coming up for students to take advantage of all the different resources that they can have at their disposal all the different things that are going to be available to help them with this process of education and and just ultimately do better as a whole\nFact is twenty two years the schools that are they're teaching people how to make better decisions and I said the people all the time that show up at the avenue for the first time I say you know where do you then we've been here waiting on you trying to teach you how to make make better decisions we've been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's amazing because what really is fun to watch is when they really begin to see that it's not as difficult the wall street hasn't believing that they're not smart enough to not sophisticated enough to manage their own money to make this isn't themselves\nAnd then they begin to realize that it's just a process that anybody could follow just by learning the skill and we talked about that earlier skill building process\nWhat do you see as far as people as as far as generation I mean do you see that more the older generation the baby boomers and maybe some of the forties and fifties roles are seeking more so this information or is it kind of across the board\nWell you know obviously different stages of like different concerns going forward you know a lot of baby boomers are concerned about losing this money again because they don't have the time to recover but what a great time as it you know as a young individual to learn actually how to handle that money long term\nBack to the matter is I actually had a student just recently um that had this a ha moment it was just an eye opening moment they said you know for so long I've been led to believe that these markets are so complicated but they started to realize through the process of education that they're the ones that have been complicating it\n... and here we are out there giving people a set of rules to follow a strict guidelines so to speak do this do this do this minimize risk here's how you know regardless of\nAge people have some of the same concerns you know about getting involved in the market and those concerns can be alleviated by following a set of rules and I'm telling you the student had this a moment just I'd over complicated this so much if I can just simplify it down to about one set of rules I could eliminate the emotion I don't have to be of great anymore let's start taking control",
