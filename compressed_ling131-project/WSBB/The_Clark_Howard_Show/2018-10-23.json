child will tell you later that you have become so much smarter than you used to be\nYes I like I'm only helping for those days [laughter]\nIt's coming don't worry\n[laughter] hey I wanted to start by thanking you about something I have been listening to you for a few years and recently I open and online bank account and then afterwards for two weeks later I was listening to it and you were talking about a thousand dollar incentive\nTo do so by the same tank so I called up immediately and I I Am eligible led by like the skin of my teeth by two days so you just made me a thousand bucks I Would never know if I hadn't listened to\nWow okay so that deal is now gone so I don't even know if I should mention that bill was since no one else can get the thousand that you got but I'm Glad that you grabbed it when we had that out there\nYeah I had I didn't notice it on on their website though that was awesome thank you\nSure well we can make the mother money let's see if I can help\nSo I my husband and I have been saving than um my son was born he ... they pass them and\nSo it got four years to go and she was saying there are giving me a little and and I want is the market right now you know seeing as the timeframe that we're now under the second is that we live in New Hampshire which is the second highest in state college tuition country\nAverage college tuition here is thirty grand so\nWell you got to do the other side of the story though for your fellow Americans that is that New Hampshire has overall lower taxes\nThan most other states\nWhere is it ... off\nThat is truly don't have any income tax but they all get you in one way or the other I pay a huge amount of their property tax it washes out I think in the end [laughter]\nOkay it's a great place to live though I'm not complaining about my state okay [laughter]\nSo we have about last week we had a hundred and thirty five thousand they account today we have a hundred and twenty eight\nOh the market decline what what are you invested in in the five twenty nine are you in the age based portfolio or are you in something\nThat we are an age face portfolio and I looked in preparation to call and it you know fifty percent while only thirty one percent stocks bonds at fifty one percent so they've already taken into account that I get nervous considering I think we have most of the money we're going to need help ally\nSo I'm just wondering when cash preservation comes into play versus growth\nWell you're shallow breathing I couldn't hear it so you may be at that point you know I Would I Would encourage you to stay age base because we don't know\nAt what point the market does go through serious decline and since you're the point that the movement in the market only has a thirty percent effect on the college money\nI Would encourage you to stage base except I've heard you loud and clear you've got the money you're going to need so going into a fund the just preserves the cash is fine for you to do and then you'll just rest easy\nThrew his four years of college\nThat was kind of my my vote and women are report ours come freshman year\n[laughter] one problem at a\nTime right right so you know if you know most people are not in the position that you were in that you've already\nBeen able to save a hundred percent of the cost of undergraduate school\nAnd since you have done that then forget the classic advice I Would give of being in the age based mix and just go in to the the thing that will preserve the money and you won't have to worry the next four years\nAnd so even going and find them and that could potentially lose money too right\nThere on is interest rates rise on bonds which they are the value of bonds you hold go down you've got enough years with the higher interest rate should counteract why some of the decline and the value of those bonds\nBut again you've already hit the goal line you've already right on okay you've already scored the touchdown so if you want to just a take victory laps for four years do it\nAnd you learn a little ... a male and the and the preservation fondue might earned a couple of percent a year and that will help a little bit with the cost of inflation and tuition over the next few years to just take the victory lap\nAll right I'm running as we speak\nRight best to you and besides you got a thousand dollars on that savings bonus is with us\nA thousand dollars on that savings bonus pet is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Ted\nHey Clark how're you doing today All right thank you Ted\nYou or I had at the end of a line you've been trying to get to learn while tell me how long this path of getting rid of debt has taken you\nAh well we started really seriously about three years ago and um we had three credit cards within our whole it total and we're we're actually paid off too and we are in the process of getting the third one paid off by November\nCongratulations ... assets\nYeah we're kind of excited about that it's been a lot of that dark cloud over us for a few years so but I did have a question um once we pay off the third and final credit card should we keep one of those accounts active all three of them active or should we just canceled osprey\nYou want to keep all three active uh-huh\nAnd that's really key to your credit score your credit score has been rising probably all through this three year pay down process as you yeah less and less severe available credit if you close accounts it will actually affect your credit score negatively\nBecause it will show last available credit\nIn your credit score and mix so\nAre you going to be tempted though to use them if the accounts stay open and you don't want to do\nI I don't think so unless like something major happens um we're really going to see or read more of a cash you\nCould cut them up but we I accounts open so you'd rather prevented from using the cards\nAnd you would have the benefit of having the cards active it will be a a decent while before any of the three credit card operators decide you been active too long and they are going to end voluntarily close your account\nOK you can let those run for a while the ideal thing would be twice a year to use each of the cards for one small transaction and that would keep them totally active and you wouldn't have to worry about an issue we're trying to get rid of you\nOkay congratulations to you\nOn the discipline living on less than what you make so you could pay off this debt that was just it sounds like it was a burden in your life\nIt was and are a target

to do you want to go for perfection go for perfection but if I was CEO shown me\nOoh so I was eight Fifteen a month ago why divide that I've dropped Seventeen points muggy before that I was only seven eighty compare so you see the movement but movement each month so I went from\nSeven eighty eight Fifteen that's movement or thirty five points and now down from eight Fifteen down to seven Ninety eight makes no\nDifference if I was in a different quadrant the movement or twenty or thirty points could make a big difference but once you've gotten to where you've really got\nYour bill payments being made on time every month you're using a low amount of your available credit you are absolutely golden I Know that lenders refer to golden\nBorrowers paying eight hundred or above but I'm not aware and I've not heard from any feedback from many lender ... being\nAt the numbers we talked about makes any difference in fact when I look at the psycho score scaling they list eight hundred or above in its own category\nWhich means you're also somebody who does everything else in life perfectly I guess anyway I'm being in the upper tier\n... seven forty seven Ninety nine but some lenders again would treat seven sixty seven named that your great All right so if you're not where you want to be\nNo that are pretty much the whole game is two categories one\nThat you pay every bill every month on time\nI Know this is weird but I Know there are always people who don't have the money and can't pay bills but the biggest problem with not having bills paid on time as we forget\nMaybe our lives a little chaotic and we forget to pay so set up a electronic reminders of the bills you need to pay or if you're if you like paper right down every bill you have to pay him when it's too each month and then you make sure you've done that stuff\nAnd so that's more than a third of what makes up your score and the other part of this just a hair under a third is don't use very much of the credit you have available to us\nUse very much of the credit you have available to you I Know that sounds weird but the last of the credit you have available to use the higher your score becomes\nSo you do that stuff you're good\nJordan joins us on the car coward show Jordan\nHey cocker ... great congratulations to you getting married\nYeah I'm getting married in April actually\nWell that's great
