abnormal sound uh you know not the normal lip ah so I looked at the screen or the associate with looking at and it said a do not sell this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it said to attach to this to the bag of shrimp and column manager or and so the manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expire till next year\nI'm In and I said well you know maybe there was some kind of recall\nA and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp in there hadn't been one and a couple of years I'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process um and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag a shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is the kind of thing that's coming is that we will before we can get out of the store\n... there will be items that are still on the shelf that have already been identified as being a risk for whatever reason and before that

employed no employees who the hot ticket right now is what's known as a solo four O. one K. O. are self employed for white K.\nK. it allows him as a ... one person entity\nTo have an ultra low cost plan like he worked for a fortune five hundred company right it's the weirdest thing but it was one person company gets a better four O. one K. than a two hundred person company and they change\nSo it's because for the cello are self employed four one K. the rules were so streamlined that you can go\nTo any of my really low cost companies that I Love and open a self employed four one K. and use their absolute lowest cost investments\nTo go in that self employed four one K. and the limits are very high for the money and put in the advantage of the ... though is there's no paper work I mean it's like half a page and your husband in a year that things go really well can contribute

this up they're both winners\nCharles is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Charles how are you doing just fine how are you\nGreat thank you you're giving advice to a family member is that true or friend\nWell advice but also just hoping to make arrangements myself and stumbled into a challenge trying to\nHelp someone to get a rental car out of state um there's seems to be a few places where you can pre paid for cars but in almost all cases they require you to present the card that you used to repay rental at the rental desk when you pick it up\nWhere we see you're renting a car you're paying for it but somebody else is going to be driving the car in a whole nother state\nRight trying to help and then we'll all get to a town of Christmas for example and just was\nYou're and you're asking to climb a a hill that it's going to be very hard to climb [laughter] the industry is not set up for that because of all the problems that they have with stolen cars\nRight and I so also you would be taking on an enormous liability risk\nIf you are a renter of record in someone else's an additional driver so the whole purpose of this is to get this individual to you is it cheaper than having them fly 'cause usually flying is cheaper when\nIt's when we're trying to to get several people now having children and and\nChristmas gifts and all of that so it's a car would probably be the easiest [noise] uh I don't know if it matters but I'm I was actually looking into renting it in their name with them being the rent or just trying to fill up eight the transaction\nBut even in that case they have to present a card to the rental agency now the the way that I could think of so they have no credit card is that right\nThey do but for just ... they don't have a lot of room on their cards so\nI mean okay but I you're trying to help 'em out you're going to pay for it right okay so that's how you do it\nRight so what you do is instead of trying to rent it on your card or anything like that you make a pre payment on their credit card so that they go into a negative balance so they have a room available on their credit limit\nRight whatever the estimate of the rental is going to be and then they have the room on the card to rent it with their cart gotcha but then you are women ate the liability risk that you're making my heart beat too fast [laughter]\nI understand well that's a good idea I should've thought of that that's that's pretty straightforward\nAnd so you don't want to pay the credit card company too far in advance of when the rental is going to be because some credit card companies as we've had caller say if you over pay or whatever that they\nThey send you a check for it but if you've ever like ten days out that should work perfectly gotcha and allow the relative to rent the car\nTerrific well that that does not like the flu shots worship out\nAll right well you have a great day and a great holiday\nYou to ... park\nDavid with us on the Clark Howard show hello David\nClarke how you doing\nGreat thank you you are a Nissan Leaf driver\nYes I Am actually and a great car\nSo let me tell you the deal I bought it when they had a really good rebate on it and all that actually released it for two years [noise] you know we're coming up on the end of the lease I at this point the cars essentially cost me nothing because the government tax credits pretty much paid for the lease payment to this point so I I Want to buy the car\nOr the problem I'm having is it's worth the open market\nI Want to buy the car or the problem I'm having as it's worth on the open market probably several thousand Seventy five hundred dollars and the residuals Fifteen thousand so question number one is I Do I Do too I just go to a ... or ... something thousand dollar\nExactly what it's called actually because they don't want your ... back\nSo you go to them and you offer um market value and Nissan tells you to get lost that it's Fifteen thousand or nothing you say I'm going to get lost here's your car back\nAnd then leave says you've seen are widely available and they use vehicle market for six to eight thousand dollars depending on the mileage and the year and the condition and you just turn around and and buy another one by used one\nRather than have one that you had known and driven for the two years it'd be better if you could buy the one you have David 'cause you know its history you're the one who created that history\nRight so that's the other side of it you always say when you buy a card you checked out by mechanic but where do you go to find a leak mechanic they don't you don't do anything because you know there's there's simply no maintenance electric\nCars are the only thing you would have a leaf checked out for as best I can tell is the remaining battery life you know that meat or on the right hand side where show right field empty you'd want to check that and the other thing is you'd want to have it checked out by a body shop\nTo see if it had been in Iraq other than that you'd be good to go because as long as the the battery has not degraded too much and it hadn't been in Iraq\nJust a matter of which color leap you want to drive and by ultra cheap you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nEight forty nine cool carrier ws be twenty four hour traffic center\nTravel advisories still in effect on the
