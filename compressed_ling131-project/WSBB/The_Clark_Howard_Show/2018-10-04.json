you've been accustomed to looking at that for the last few years and it being fairly accurate\nWill now those sites are far behind using sales from six twelve months ago which are substantially lower ten to twenty percent in some cases than your current home's value\nThey come out they make you an offer in that range you sign a contract they didn't beat you up in the inspection charge you eight to twelve percent and fees and before long you sold your home partially unwittingly for thirty percent less than it's actually worse\nDon't fall for those scams get an online valuation instantly right

know a day of the week a location how she got to or from uh the location where the crime took place do corroborating evidence no forensic evidence if you don't know where it took place you can't even go back thirty six years later\nA and I'm an avid watcher of forensic files what they can now do and solve the unresolved crimes from decades gone by is pretty amazing and in sworn statements under penalty of ...\nYou know every one of the people that she mentioned would say something said just the opposite or yes don't remember it so there's no in that sense that is over for that case it was far as I'm concerned unless we had to just believe guilt by accusation\nAnd that's what they're doing the Democrats have now it's never enough and they want more FBI that just a week now it's not enough\nYeah even though even though the week was proposed by senator Coons who has now as you can tell disappear you can't find him now he's on a milk carton\nYeah now he's missing in action after we got everything you want what a what a Jeff Flake get out of this look I I don't think anybody can predict what the FBI now pending over their findings in the cabinet probe\nUm you know they still have not interviewed Christine forward but I Would imagine the FBI has not doesn't need to interview Christie Ford they have\nAll of her testimony don't they she testified under oath for very long period of time no interview by the FBI is going to add a thing\nYeah well it gets very very tough and very scary but I Will say\nThis if we lose due process if we lose the presumption of innocence if it's guilt by accusation this is not America anymore\nOr Republicans shot only for Republican yeah well if they were consistent they'd be demanding an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison a and Juanita ...

doesn't make any sense\nAll right Carl you hold down the ship until I got an opportunity to be back down there in Charleston to say Hi to everybody thank you so much for\nBeing with us a can is in

named the town snowflake in uh when I Lived up there and I live in Arizona I had the had the vote for\nBoth flake and John McCain\nAnd I used to call him when I live back there and I would tell them all the time I had to hold my nose to vote for you\nAnd it's up to you to hold your nose to vote for you know what I was ... whatever's going on at the time and now I'm saying the same thing that Jeff Flake I did help him get elected and I would wish he would just hold his nose and support the president he doesn't have to like what do you know the president which we all know he doesn't\nBut he should at least support the people that elected him and they're not well\nBut remember what he said it remember what he said it was sixty minutes on Sunday night he said well would you he was asked would you be able to vote this way if you are facing the voters these Scott\nAbsolutely not which means I'm only at doing this because I don't have to face the voters again otherwise I Would just do what was politically expedient so now I'll do what I Want to do that's basically what he said\nYeah but when he was even in back then when when he was you know this is I've been out of a couple of years he he missed major votes that we needed Amman one was when he was home with his daughter at some dance recital and another one he went through his son's wedding\nAnd he said that you know the heat plant this was planned a long time ago and he wasn't going to miss it sounds wedding well who in the Senate would say okay if you're going to get married get married wire and such\nYou know he he he didn't have a chance I I probably I had a hard time even and I called him in and really hard time being played I always was played to the people I talked to and I always wish them a good weekend but he he had been a disappointment\nFor years and years and years he's he's just a it's a good thing is going away hopefully I think the only thing he had to do is run at a Democrat and you might see that happening\nI Will tell you Arizona's have a choice I'm very impressed with this woman Martha ... salad um she's a war hero and it's it's interesting she's going up against somebody the uh\nAnd

that you saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live in definitely on the money you've saved\nAnd it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say the power that you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Suzie said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living a\nAnd not a ... barebones lifestyle but they're living a more careful frugal lifestyle\nBecause what you want to see one enough money saved that you have invested that you can throw off enough cash to live on each year and at the same time have the piled a stash you built up\nHave enough in it that you can earn enough on it and the years following to cover the cost of inflation but let's go to a core

stories\nOf people that I talked to who did change the direction of their lives and how they were living and created that independence and freedom in their lives so I don't want anybody tell you you

sixteen sixteen and Seventeen\nI did that's a lot of kids all lumped together at one man\n[noise] adopted from uh South Korea and then end up a pregnant with a in\nVitro twins boy girl so\nYou're now wow ugly [laughter] empty nest to three kids and a bleak\nA blank\nWow All right how can I be of help to you because that's a lot for you to deal with\nIt is but thank you for your service been listening for years and I love your program and let you do for the community [noise] ah three children I'm moving from my home schooling environment to a an elevated home schooling uh environment where they're now\nNeeding access to mobile app tops I Know you're a huge fan of the chrome book\nUh done some research shepherd great things about them I just don't know how well they will perform and if they're designed for um a more traditional setting where I'm going to be using excel power point\nSpreadsheets things of that nature\nUm under the additives you have\nTo be a connected to the Internet on the chrome book and I just wanted to get your opinion on that\nRight so schools have been adopting the chrome book is their computer of choice in massive numbers and the ... now completely dominate the educational environment there are still a particularly in the private school environment where\nThey're using Mac books but overall the chrome book dominates not totally but gosh it's moving that direction and Google\nHas a suite of\nPrograms that are similar many of them in nature to the Microsoft sweet you were referring to\nAnd for the educational environment those are generally free and they can be used not just on a chrome book at home they can be used on any computer anywhere even if it's not a crime but so\nThat's why the schools have been adopting that they don't have to I have a an IT department or anything like that since everything on them is Web based and you're right that to make up chrome book useful you have to have an Internet connection for most everything you would do on it\nSo it ... it would be a good question for you to ask going from a home school environment to one that is a more traditional classroom to find out if the school they're going to be attending is a ... school\n[noise] okay that's a perfect point a to follow that quite like um tell me about the call looks ability to function\nTell me about the call looks ability to function in a disconnected state meaning stand alone or not having access\nTo the Internet yes okay they used to be a complete door stop that if you didn't have Internet it was basically a worthless piece of furniture taking up space when it didn't have Internet connection\nNow there are a handful of functions you can do off line but then once you go on line they the items are then stored in the cloud\nAnd that's why a number of chrome books now have more storage on them but if someone has intermittent or rare Internet access or chrome book is not going to make it particularly happy\nOkay All right ... thank you for the higher than the good news with windows computers is they've suffered so much by comparison the chrome books their windows computers that are nicely featured\nAre widely available at a hundred and fifty dollars and up now which is a big change from where windows pricing used to be Gary's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Garry\nHello there Clark how are you great
