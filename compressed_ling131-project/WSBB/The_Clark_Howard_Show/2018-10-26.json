you were actually someone who's in the market for a vehicle it means that you're in a position to have far more negotiating power especially if you're interested in their crossover or an SUV you're much more negotiating power then you've had in recent years\nSo yeah you will face potentially higher interest rates but you can dial back the clock if you historically have gotten your vehicle alone at the car dealer\nAnd instead this time you get it at a credit union you will likely drive the interest straight back to below\nWhat it would have been at a car dealer before interest rates rose cause the interest rate differences so gigantic between a credit union and a car dealer and significant between a credit union and the bank\nThe other thing is as you are\nShopping around for a

I Am thank you\nSo you've got a question for me that how you're doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer the question\nCould they may help in the long run I was just curious about the\nQuestion concerns about taking Social Security at a sixty two and possibly investing that whole amount as opposed to waiting for the higher amount as a later age I feel like the right of investment you probably wouldn't be\nDoing better off than we need tools a sixty six and four months\nSo it seems like a whole chunk of change\nYour government handle and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nStunner is a white investments earn today what savings earn today it is nearly impossible for someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out earn\nWhat the computer to advantage is to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur your cost of living adjustment his base for the rest of your life on a higher initial him out\nSo and also there's no tax you are going to go\nFor waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing Mm So there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to laying right\nNow at age sixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money is when you take it in my case you know what age I'm going to take it where you know eight\nEight Seventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent products my extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to a hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it so you gave the ah you gave the analogy\nOf sixty two and your retirement age would you say sixty six years four months is that what she said yes\nSo if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nYeah I plan on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I'm\nStill feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's going to stop me soon so probably a good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me to take to live in years to regain the money that I like go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but the big problem with um retirement years is later and retirement when we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work\nWe may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefits now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother\nIn January my oldest brother will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us now ever and he will\nBe at that time Seventy two so you know that all we are not a genetically disposed to live as long as guys in my family so it can you imagine I'm going to wait until late Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nA mother that's over Ninety eight inches still chicken so I\nWill say in your case there is a direct advantage to waiting because what you really concerned about is way down the road\nSo I Hope that my brother ah who also waited 'til age Seventy that he ends up live in a really really really long time for many reasons not having anything to do with money\nNoble is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\nBut what is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\nNow cyber talk to you than well thank you so much Yes sir\nSo you have had a nasty gram from a credit card company what did they do to you\nSo I opened up a credit card or as a ... I Know you're not a I Know you're not saying I'm a several years ago and I haven't used it in years and it's only got a limit of about a thousand dollars nothing to do or anything like that on it but I got an email saying that\nUh if I didn't use the card by December ... that they were going to close the cards and I wanted to see if it would be\nIn my best interests I guess in my credits best interests I close the cart before then or if I just let them closer or or or what we'll do that\nThat makes no difference either way but I wanted to ask you a question this store card does it have a visa and MasterCard logo on it or is it just for purchases and that store\nIt looks like it's just for purchases and the store\nThere's no real advantage to you having that if you have you have sufficient credit elsewhere abuses MasterCard's American Express discover\nOh oh yeah it's it's less than two percent of my overall credit\nBecause I ... I Would dump it just how I Am\nJust let them kick you the curb in December and be done with them because there's no real advantage to having store credit is looked at in the industry is junk credit right and you're not intending\nTo use it again so let it just walk away\nOkay if it did as a either a MasterCard logo uh 'cause\nThen I went to then I Want you to keep it I should go keep it leaves some purchase somewhere or whatever you know five dollar purchase somewhere just something that takes it from being an active to an active card\nOkay and then it stays as active and part of your overall credit mix but when it is just a way that I think is referred to as a mano wind where it's just for that particular store right those you don't want to have\nAll right well that sounds great I sure do appreciate you taking me on the call and I've been a big fan for years they very much\nFor your kind to say that thank you so much you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nTen forty nine cool re carrier WSBIU twenty four hour traffic center earlier gridlock alert has been cleared on the east expressway I twenty he's about just before you reach more than ... sixty the trouble now in the ws for Jack and pushed off to the right shoulder state to the far left going from boulevard and into DeKalb County new trouble on the downtown connector", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "26"}
