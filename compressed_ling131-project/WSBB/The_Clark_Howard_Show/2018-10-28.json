tickets\nBought lottery tickets this past week because it was one point six\nBillion dollars and it's you know I I it's just kind of crazy the odds of winning where one in three hundred million which is roughly you know but one person out of America 'cause there's about three hundred million of us\nThat was roughly the odds of winning and let's not get carried away okay was one point six billion actually but the actual number was one point five three seven\nTo be you know technical about it but you know roughly one point six billion dollars but no no no no no no it wasn't that's if you took it as an annuity if you took the money in equal installments over twenty nine years\nYou would end up receiving a total at one point six billion dollar so but no you wouldn't be taking that you'll

Rick Edelman show it's the truth about money I'm very happy very excited to welcome forty new affiliate radio stations to the ... show we're now broadcasting this program to eighty five radio stations across the country\nOr this program as the longest running national personal finance radio show in the nation are talkers magazine has ranks me one of the top one hundred talk radio show hosts in the country\nAnd the number to talk show host that airs weekends only uh so we're very excited to be welcoming all of you who are listening to the Rick Adelman show for the first time\nAnd uh we're going to be talking about the stock market right now and and the reason that this is such a a big deal conversation a is because you've got money invested and that's what we do for a living or at our organization uh we manage a lot of money for a lot of folks all across the country\nYou manage a lot of money for a lot of folks all across the country a bearing says range hour from the number one independent investment advisory firm in the nation\nAre and we're very honored by the barons ranking and we um want to share with you the advice and information that we provide to our own clients\nAnd I'm sure you've been acutely aware of what's been going on in the stock market this past week\nVolatility has returned\nAnd although the numbers look rather shocking you know with the Dow Jones industrial average on Wednesday dropping over six hundred points uh that's nothing compared to the fact that the Dow is at twenty five thousand before the drop occurred\nAnd that's really the the key point isn't it is that we can't be focusing on the point drop\nWe have to look at the percentage drop\nBecause if we put it in that kind of a context on a percentage basis the drought really wasn't ... newsworthy wasn't all that material but regardless of that we do have to acknowledge the facts and the fact is that as a result of the volatility this week year today\nThe Dow Jones industrial average is down one percent the S. and P. five hundred stock index is down one percent the iffy index which is the index of foreign stocks that the Europe Australia and far eastern index is down twelve percent for the year\nIt's not just that the down yes in pay and the ISI are down one percent one percent twelve percent it's actually even worse than that\nThere are thirty stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average sixty percent of them are down ten percent or more from their eyes so although the overall Dow is only down one sixty percent of those thirty socks\nEighteen of them are down ten percent or more in the S. and P. five hundred the absentee itself is down one percent for the year but eighty percent of the S. and P. five hundred we're talking four hundred of the five hundred stocks\nAre down ten percent or more from their hides in the ISI Ninety percent are down ten percent or more from their hives and the NASDAQ\nEighty seven percent of the stocks and the NASDAQ are down ten percent or more from their eyes so if you look at your market performance recently you will see some pretty substantial declines year to date it\nMeans that we have had all the profits accumulated so far this year from January one for the end of September\nThose gains have been largely wiped out the Dow down one the U.S and the down one if you down twelve and it's not just limited to that gold is down six percent year to date\nThe real estate market as measured by the ... real estate index down four percent for the year the bond market as measured by the Barclays aggregate bond index down four percent\nFor the year pretty much everything everywhere is down oh not everything oil is up all of them ... percent\nDemonstrating the critical importance of diversification not everything always goes down simultaneously some stuff goes up while other stuff is going down the problem is you can't predict what that will be\nWe don't know what's going to go up next we don't know what's going to go down next so instead of making a big bet\nWe diversify we diversifying two ways we diversify among classes yes you own stocks but yes you should also I'm bonds and you should also own\nForeign securities and you should also alone commodities and oil and gas and natural resources and precious metals\nAn exponential technologies we should have a highly diversified portfolio because their safety in numbers instead of having twelve eggs in one basket have one egg in each of twelve baskets this way if you break one you gotta love enough that's the first point of diversification the second point\nIs that when you do decide you're going to invest some of your money into stocks that you buy as many stocks as you can notice I said that in the S. and P. five hundred the index itself is down one percent for the year\nBut eighty percent of the stocks have lost ten percent or more in recent weeks eighty percent of them are down ten percent in just a few weeks even though the index itself is only done one person for the year and that's the point instead of trying to pick individual stocks and hoping that they do better than the index you're better off\nOwning a market instead of trying to beat the market because the academic data is very clear\nActively managed mutual funds meaning mutual funds that hire a professional manager whose job it is is to pick stocks that will beat the market they have a dismal track record the overwhelming majority of active managers fail to\nWell I'm a majority of active managers fail to beat their index they fail to beat the benchmark\nAnd it doesn't matter what stock sector we're talking about big stocks midsize stocks are small stocks rose stocks are value stocks us stocks versus foreign stocks doesn't matter it also doesn't matter what time period you look at you can look at your date you can look at the past year three year five years seven year ten year it doesn't matter what time period you look at\nThis data is consistent fund managers are notoriously unable to beat the market and here's what makes it even worse even when you find a manager there does succeed beating the market\nThat managers are unable to duplicate their success so while there will be some managers who do beat the market they aren't the same managers year after year after year so if you pick\nThis year the manager that did best last year\nThey're not going to be able to repeat their success it's a different manager that does it and that's why instead of trying to beat the market it's better to be the market\nThird\nMaintain a long term perspective focusing on\nNot the market not politics not policy not the fed\nBut focusing instead on your goals why are you investing in the first place what are you trying to accomplish is it to get a kid into colleges that to prepare for your own retirement is take care of aging parents wire you investing that determines for us\nHow much money you're going to need how much money do need to achieve those goals how much will college cost how much will your retirement costs how much will cost of care for mom\nOnce we know how much those things will cost and when we're going to encourage those bills now we can work backwards do some calculations to say\nHere so much money you need to be saving and here's the rate of return you need to be earning and in order to get that return at a reasonable expectation hears the investment strategy here's the mix up investments the asset allocation necessary that makes sense\nIf you're not approaching your investment strategy in that way you might be doing it wrong and that's why we encourage you to focus on it in that way if we can help call us a triple late plan wreck\nThat's AAA seven five to sixty seven forty two we make it really easy for you

lose your job is it possible that your occupation could be eliminated not because of a bad economy goodness gracious our economy is absolutely fabulous we have more jobs available in our country than we have people looking\nFabulous we'd have more jobs available in our country than we have people looking for jobs which doesn't seem to make any sense random if everybody was looking for a job and there are jobs out there how come we don't have a hundred percent full employment\nMaybe it's because of the people who are looking for jobs don't have the skills that are required for the jobs that are available in other words we're talking about career development\nIs it possible\nThat despite the fact the economy is strong your job might be threatened due to exponential technologies particularly robotics and artificial intelligence is it possible your job might be wiped out by technology the most common example that everyone's aware of\nA taxi drivers not just because of rubber and left which are examples but the coming self driving vehicles which will wipe out even the ... river and lift drivers\nIn two thousand eight member what was going on in the economy in two thousand eight bad news right state and local governments were struggling to raise tax revenue so San Francisco started selling taxi medallions you want to drive a taxi in San Francisco you got to buy a medallion giving you the right to drive a cab\nThey were selling them for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars dozens of cities sold them to generate revenue and what a medallion you could drive and make seven grand a month pretty good income for being a cabdriver and you could sell your medallion if you felt like it\nBecame a market where people were buying and selling medallions the value of medallions rose really fast\nOr New York the medallions hit one point three million dollars in value people were getting rich trading medallions\nThen came along over\nNew York city medallions fell from one point three million to a hundred and sixty grand in Philadelphia the medallions fell from half a million dollars to ten grand\nThousands of cab drivers around the country have lost huge amounts of money in San Francisco there has not been a single medallion bought or sold in more than two years which means they're virtually worthless seven hundred drivers bought those medallions the city generated sixty three million dollars in revenue\nA hundred and fifty of those drivers of another faulted on the loans that they took out to get those medallions and in New York City\nSeven cab drivers have committed\nSuicide over their financial strife you've got to ask yourself is it possible\nThat my job might be eliminated due to a technological innovation and if so what are you going to do about it how soon are you going to prepare yourself for retraining in a career that will capitalize ON Technology development as opposed to being disrupted\nBy technological innovation\nLet us help you figure this out in my book the truth about your future which debuted at number four on the New York times business that's our last I listen to one hundred Seventy five occupations\nThat are going to be eliminated over the next five to Fifteen Years because of robotics and artificial intelligence\nYou need to find out of your job is on that list and even if your job is not on the list you need to find out if your company is that threat I remember talking with a woman who was accounting and she said I'm not being threatened by technology on an accountant\nShe worked for Toys R us so she her job was being threatened because of tours rest one broke she lost her job\nSo you need to evaluate this not just from your career but the company you were working for and the sooner you identified this the better off you're going to be because if you do need to get retrained what does that money come from how do you maintain your lifestyle all paying the bills that education\nWithout an income

a lot of social media going on out there and she has a lot of stuff that we're filing by\nBanging the drum other social media is less a lot of Facebook Live we've got to do a weekly live broadcast maybe a couple of times a week there's a lot of great people that have tuned in and said man this stuff's really helping us\nYou guys are making the impact with us You're showing us the true way the markets work the lives of Wall Street which we always talk about it and ... and bears understand some folks you're smart enough to imagine self direct your own money we believe that when the market goes down that's not a bad day diversification does it mean that you're safe\nAnd the trend is it always your friend and those are the things that Wall Street teachers the masses and we're here to break that down show you the real Wall Street show you how institutions approached the Balkans and more importantly how you could profit regardless of what's happening exactly and you know a chip\nHow you could profit regardless of what's happening exactly and you know a champ one\nOf the big things right now is a lot of people are concerned you know this is reminding me of the market in two thousand seven I met a bunch of people in those seven and people are like the market's up starting to get shaky I don't know one is going to collapse I don't know one I don't know what to do should I go to cash should I buy more\nAnd really the ultimately comes down to we got to preserve what we have and a lot of people have had a good run since March of two thousand and the market's gone up and now all of a sudden everything's ... around and people are freaking out a little bit let's talk about how they can protect how they can preserve the capital that\nThey have eerily similar to two thousand seven a record high starting to get these big moves daily big intra day movement and the S. and P. and the dial in the Russell I'm it's just a repeat of the film and here's the thing\nIn two thousand eight many people lost a lot of money about forty or fifty percent of money in the four one k.'s and manage diaries was transferred out of those accounts that wasn't lost\nJust went to somebody else some understood how to make money regardless of direction so there's a lot of listeners right now and if you're driving down the road right now and you're hearing us in two thousand and if you're four one K. got hurt badly because of the collapse\nHere we are ten years later\nWe're expecting other collapsed and many of you probably most of you haven't done anything different you're still not four one K. you still got all that money at risk think about that and I'm going to be blunt\nShame on you this is your wealth and you are not changing anything in this things you can do to protect and preserve capital this things you can do even in a four one K. or an IRA\nTo not lose in a collapse of the market at least protect against loss and there's other things you could do to profit from it so the focus is is that if we're not managing risk if we don't have a position of place that says if this thing collapses I'm going to walk away or the ... there was virtually unscathed with a small pre defined loss\nWhat's your plan because we're expecting that were calling for the markets overvalued and when it falls capital preservation got to be so important is the problem if you wait until it happens it's too late\nWell exactly that's it a lot of people in two thousand seven they didn't know what to do they got paralyzed two thousand eight they got crushed they sat there and watch this thing go down and all of a sudden two thousand nine rolls around that go now what what exactly what you said they missed it they don't understand that they need to be they need to be proactive rather than reactive\nAnd capital preservation doesn't mean you get out of mutual funds and go to cast not necessarily cash is probably safer but let me tell you something I met a man of two thousand\nWhen the market fell forty percent and he said well I was okay I went to cash right before the collapse well\nThe currency that he was holding the u._s. dollar because when people tell me they go to cash only means the U.S dollar they're not going to hold off the dollar or the euro and should they should in some cases they should this guy said I cast out right before the collapse of two thousand and I was fine I said you weren't fun\nI said you realize that the value of your dollar fell thirty seven percent between the collapse of two thousand and the bottom of two thousand two in the financial markets so you had the same amount of money but had thirty seven percent less buying power that's a real number of folks in other words cash isn't always the safest haven\nIf he'd had gone to the Australian doll he would have grown as account exponentially because that currency at that time was increasing in value\nLet me tell you something folks capital preservation means there's things that you can use in the market to ensure that you don't lose or to ensure that when you do lose its small and pre defined\nThere's things that we can use like exchange traded funds that are inverse funds so in the market goes down our account grows it it's inverse to the actual performance of the market there's options\nOptions are insurance people couldn't protecting hedge their positions in their portfolios with options if they understand it and the beautiful thing is that a lot of times you're basically ensuring for pennies on the dollar and if the market collapse as you walk away with a very small pre defined loss think about that\nThere's so many things that people can do here's the problem and you're four one K. you believe these two things one that up as good an down is bad and to that if it goes down it's going to have to ride it out because you'll never get out of that four one K. God Forbid you move that money into something else which is a travesty because\nWall Street as you convinced that you shouldn't move that money and you'll just write it down your turn or winter into a loser we see it all the time you can't afford that folks here's the reality of the mass\nOf not protecting your ... your money\nIf you take these big losses like in two thousand two thousand they expect a big loss coming forward\nYou'll run out of ... years before you hit your financial goals in other words you're a lot of time to grow your account because those big losses are draining your account and now you're trying to get back to break even do you realize that a lot of people took them almost eight nine years to get back to break even with the collapse of two thousand eight and here they are now break even or there were they were\nThe problem is or nine years older and here's the other problem\nThe markets geared up for a collapse again think about that is the definition of insanity that's the masses we need to learn the skills of capital preservation we need to understand the things we can do to keep ourselves safe no matter what the market does we can profit no matter what the direction but at least we have to protect because\nIf we wait to their house burned down\nBefore we ensure its\nIt's too late now the insurance is going to cost the replacement value of your house think about that so we have to be proactive and have a plan in place\nIt'll be a house think about that so we have to be proactive and have a plan in place with the market collapse as we're not going to take the brunt of the loss and we could still take the upside of it goes in the direction we think\nThat's truly understanding market movement in price and the problem is with the masses Adam they're convinced that up is good in doubt as bad and they don't want to touch their money because if they touch it they say I don't know what to do with it there's a lot of simple things that you can learn process he's that can help protect and preserve and most importantly\nKeep you on track for those financial goals long term\nWell Jim you said all the time it's a it's a skill learning how to handle your money regardless of market direction as a skill understanding how to protect the money is a skill and if someone just as if someone looks in the mirror and his honest with themselves do I know how to handle my money and the average person the answer's no they put their money outside arm's reach\nBecause if it's in that four one K. if it's in that Iran they can't spend it well and you know I Love about the academy on legit academy a sponsor\nThey teach average people how to protect the wealth in other words if you're in a four one K. if you've got money and IRA there's things in the market instruments you can use ethics classes to protect and preserve and still give you the opportunity hit your goals and the problem is is that many people don't realize how to do it\nThe academy has put together a plan in place and it's helped a lot of people like you and I asked them to\nBe more successful and preserve capital because it becomes that important especially when we're expecting a big move down exactly in capital preservation is paramount and market like this and\nPeople out there they're concerned about the correction they're concerned about the sell off and you've got to understand the protect out four one K. and I are re online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears they have a class specifically on Capitol preservation now you have money in the market if

Know have never had any background that they just learn the skill from the ground up\nExactly and right now we're taking the time to check in with our sponsor online training academy contacted headed down to the school right there talking to education coach Chris Charles Chris what's going on buddy\nHey buddy man listen it's great to be back with you guys as has been one of the highlights of my week for a while now\nWell we appreciate taking the time I Know you've got a lot going on at the campus what's going on down it online trading academy I mean what's one of the key things that are happening in these this week\nOr a fact of the matter is we've got a bunch of classes that are going on in ... and people are exploring you know multiple markets and if I could add um I'd like to take a second just kind of clear up a misconception that I've seen you know a lot of folks orange dissipating that the only people that can participate in the market are the folks that have an abundance of time in fact of the matter is\nThat we're getting a lot of folks coming into the school and and they're living their lives you know they've got jobs lives obligations responsibility that got PTA and soccer practice in gymnastics lessons and horseback riding lessons and they're trying to find a way that they can make ends meet and do all these things at the same time and what we're finding is people are coming to the school with a main focus on trying to generate some additional strings of income\nHey Chris champ good to hear from you\nWhat what's exciting is is that when a lot of people finally realized that the market to provide them that you may income\nThen they start to think will stocks or the way to go you know focus on ... in the United states as you well know that's the main asset class of people use with trading and investing what do you see when people start to realize that there's other things they could trade and what's really the eye opening thing for a lot of students when they do realize that\nWell you know a lot of people do come into the school and then maybe they have a basic understanding of stock\nMaybe they'd never traded before but they realize that there's\nYou know there's an opportunity in the market and they assume that the stocks stock market's going to be the answer for them and usually it's not and the reason is because so many people are coming in here exploring how do I take a little bit of money and and get a decent return and unfortunately stocks not going to get people that opportunity it literally as a marketer requires the most amount of money it's open the fewest hours with the least opportunity\nAnd with folks come in here they start to explore these other markets like the currency market and we got a currency class it's coming up in the ... market or they start to explore things like the futures market\nAnd their goal is to take a little bit of money and get a decent return but you know as as you talk about all this\nA little bit of money and get a decent return but you know as as you talk about all the time champ as a matter of following the rules and being systematic so we can take people do a process of getting started using alternative markets that a lot of times they're not familiar with\nAnd we can start to explore these options that give them an opportunity to generate these additional strings again most of the students here the school or not folks that are trying to figure out a way they can quit their job and live off the market and while that does happen\nThat's not typically the goal for every person that I mean they're trying to figure out how can I in court with this into my life and we can do so with a plan in place that allows them to take some money and using these alternative markets to generate the income that they're looking for the additional stream of income\nIt's a it's a game changer for a lot of folks champ\nAnd and you talk about it a lot of those currency accounts and those futures accounts that people open up\nThey literally can start with a thousand bucks a few hundred bucks so they really don't have to have a high bar of capital to get started and the problem with stocks as we all know is there very capital intensive I'm going to buy shares of stock and got to you like a lot of capital by that year when I use futures encourage these it allows me to be able to have\nLess in the positions still get a good ... a good return what do you see when people start to understand the futures market in the ... what does that do for them personally because\nThey didn't come into the academy know those were alternative asked that causes that could use what's the biggest thing people get surprised when they see the futures are currencies are options as an alternative\nWell you know champ I actually think that the misconception about the market and the stock stock market being their answers scares a lot of people away from it because they assume they do have to have so much money\nAnd the average person is coming ears and sitting in this giant on this giant pile of money and they're they're wanting to play with it they're trying to figure out how can they take a little bit of money out of their budget each month and put it to work\nAnd one of the big eye opening things for students and the environment is when they realize that they can use for action futures and the power of leverage to put a small amount of money at work in a marketing still get a great return back to the matter is for many people they come in here such hitting one thing and when they start to explore the process they realize there's more opportunity that it could have ever possibly imagine\nThat's awesome Chris and we thank you for checking in with us and Ali ... thank you to the sponsor of on trade academy we really appreciate your guys what's amazing what Chris reference was\nIn this country the U.S it's all about stocks I
