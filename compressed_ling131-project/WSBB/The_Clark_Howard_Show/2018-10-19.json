tells you how difficult\nThe forensic research is following a data breach\nAs companies scramble and a data researchers security experts try to drill down into who's affected and how they're affected\nThe other part of this is not the good news the good news was the fifty to thirty the really bad news is what the crux God is much more\nThorough than estimated before it's considered to be the worst breach ever\nOf the Facebook social media platform\nAnd the crux have a lot of stuff like they might have your contact information like your phone numbers\nAs they have for a many millions

Florida we we live part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock at\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plus\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is supposed out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding\nFrom population growth um increase rainfall it's we're in a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland that is an area subject to flooding a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for flood blown air prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them\nNo higher than normal construction it's just re thinking how you build for circumstance we in the United states tend to after a flood or disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before\nThe disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before and a lot of these things if we think about how do we prepare for the unexpected\nA lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just a little amount Soto incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer\nAnd eliminate the thing of wash rents and repeat where a property gets destroyed and then you have to rebuild and then another a active nature happens you have to rebuild again on and on there's no need for us to be fatalistic about this\nThis is an area we just need to be practical\nRalf is with us on the Clark Howard show ...

S.\nNo because we we have an address ... thanks very good friends of ours and we also had a home outside Atlanta on a lake that we kept so we never from that point of view we didn't leave [noise]\nWell that's great because you know the financial reintegration can be really difficult for people\nWho were gone for a number of years but how can I be of service to you today\nThe last thing that we want to do is we purchased the crow look and to do our banking and financial as you have supplies [noise] and I did some research on your website on that as well but\nI'm not quite sure whether I Need to set up a new Gmail account all the way that I can use social Jews and access to um to get them going\nWonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer\nUsing chrome buck for financial it is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account they would not integrate because you know with Gmail\nWith the Google accounts when you sign into a computer it just kind of automatically populate everything from a prior wind on and so having that separate gene male is the best idea you can do\nTo protect yourself and protect what you do elsewhere how much was the chrome book he bought just for financial\nAh I don't know my wife's fault it's fully from my end or service to know well happy anniversary I'm sure she's very little money\nI'm sure she did that go she listens to you too of course\nA perfect so with the ... the whole idea of a crime but they're Ralf and I are talking about is they are ultra inexpensive right now routinely available at a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac\nAnd so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email not then no social media just\nThey'll pay banking brokerage those kinda things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so from books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we\nWe as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we get hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get\nUm insurance to protect you from data breaches from hackers and having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out at your small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why having the insurance is so key\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nFellows Clark thanks for taking my call sure Chris you got to a modern puzzle for me\n[noise] oh yeah I saw a lot glad to hear that actually I uh applied for a life insurance and they set up a net on his ... and\nOf course ask what does all will tell it of course they take your eye white blood pressure\nAnd they said I take a blood sample and I'm like well I Know that that blood samples to be used for genetic testing and I actually called a call and your team and your team's fantastic by the way\nOh thank you and power to anti ... Clark Howard a team but Howard said to call the state or insurance and I said that's a great idea so I gave them a call\n... after a few departments or later I finally spoke with somebody in in the lady said that she could almost guaranteed that wouldn't happen\nWhere there's nothing in the law that prohibits said at this time so there was a law passed a decade ago that prohibited your DNA from being used genetic testing and being able to ... be used for health insurance but since then as more and more\nInformation has become available through genetic testing and how easy it is for people to do it the law has never been updated\nTo cover life insurance long term care disability insurance and so this is an area that the feds need to be all over in the Congress and not permit genetic discrimination\nSo I don't know I don't know anybody doing it yet just like you were told by the person at the state insurance department emphasis on yet\nThat's what I was afraid of because of that actually called the lab that specifically said it was a note for a short genetic test for and I think the lab and if they didn't have instructions to do that I think they would do if\nThey would not do that and you know there's there's a question so many of us like me are done twenty three and me and done ancestry dot com", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "19"}
