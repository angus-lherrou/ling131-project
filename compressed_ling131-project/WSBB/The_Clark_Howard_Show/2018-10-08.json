up\nThe Instagram page made by Google to eat out a photo that shows several sizes of the brand new pixel and attacks the company says that they heard a rumor about the brand new many pixels it's really really tiny and ask how small is too small\nAnd some people would probably love to see a smaller pixel but this one is a phone that's small enough to attach to your key chain\nAnd it's a rumor though in real life that picks those going to have\nAn edge to edge screen no notch\nA front facing camera and then hopefully these new picture phones won't have the same feature that the last one did

fifty though don't you ask me Scott\nIn Charleston South Carolina I called him and he said I just got back from months in Europe and Russia and we're worried about Internet Security and ice and Scott you just got back\nShouldn't this have been the hall you mean for your way just you know it's a little hands up Scott next time give us a hobby for young guy and he said yes I sure do but we're planning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves and be secure\nOK so a friend of mine who lives in London and eager okay is that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing\nAnd so she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel y ou okay and she said all of a sudden the hard drive light like lint okay\nAnd it stayed constantly illuminated for the next eight hours wonder why\nDo you think they were copying the entire hard drive not the Chinese told they would\nNot do that at all\nGosh Scott and neither would the Russians what are you worried about\n[noise] well I Would love to have the opportunity to talk to you before we called but that was not an option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one the the rumors always been ours devices or less vulnerable\nAndroid or PCs now if you just first confirmed that and then I Want to talk about the peons\nOkay um [noise] ... the reason why that people say that Iowa devices are more secure is that there are ... that apple keeps a hold on everything okay\nSo in order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break and I wonder if you wanted to and basically take all the security and the trolls and right away\nBut if you are trying to get a piece of now we're onto an Iowa device that it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] [noise] well what I did do [noise] sorry on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a fold\nDo us a dead set up a VPN and but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the I should be doing in a situation like that [noise] what\nDid you do everything while you were overseas I mean did you bank can pay your credit cards and check Facebook in business and stuff like that\nDid have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I Try to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except that obviously to pay to do with the ah [noise] ah it was mainly just to check your email\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like eh we're where you got like well just going to take the melon\n[noise] it was so much that if there were several types it seemed like the VPN prohibited me from getting on a website and I don't mean that particular website it it just like anything getting on the Internet period\nCould do that depending upon what lockdown can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of the pie ends when if you look at their coverage maps and then you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to ... you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email\nInteresting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course did they didn't have the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic\nWhen you are truck traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is that you make a complete backup of everything [noise] uh so that this way if you need to restore that you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country or going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad uh three or six month you might be able to see it again but quite possibly a year ... and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have had access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN because I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you use your at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that but in my wallet I carry a\n[noise] it's about the size of a thumb drive I don't know if you've ever seen those in the sun Dr has a rotating code on it even now I can tell you I can show you that there's a coat on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that code you can't have access to my bank
