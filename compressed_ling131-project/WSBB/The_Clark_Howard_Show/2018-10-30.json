the Clark Howard show Hi\nDaniel hey how's it going wonderful Daniel Daniel you are thinking of buying a home and you live in the state of Colorado where the housing market has been\nBrutal for people who are trying to buy a home and beautiful for people who are already on one\nExactly where do you fit and all this\nUh well it's beautiful living here but I'm definitely uh as far as trying to first that'd be ... doesn't seem very accessible\n[laughter] that's a beautiful understatement are you in the Denver metro area or where are you\nYeah exactly I guess right outside Denver so\nIn Denver it's become impossible for someone to middle class job to buy a home\nOr someone in the middle class job to buy a home right now\nIt's just the way it is and it's been very frustrating to people I read a story in the last few days I forget which\nI think it was in the Financial Times that did a story about how there are people and middle class professions in Denver they are actually choosing to move somewhere else in the country because they don't see any prospect I'll ever be able to own a home\nIn Denver at the kinds of salaries they make in a middle class kind of job it's tough I I\nI really don't know how people do it is you know we ate my wife and I we you know as a as a household we make well above the median income a site you know I I can only imagine for those people that make below the median income you know what they're facing\n... one of the issues in Denver which is not just to Denver problem it is in other areas as well is the cost of land acquisition for builders\nAnd then the cost of permits the costs of hiring labor and the cost of material new homes are a out of sight and builders because of the base cost they have from ... things like that they only want to build larger more expensive homes\nTo try to make any profit out of the deal so you really have to you and your wife really have to concentrate if you want to go ahead and buy now\nOn used homes but housing markets go in cycles and anybody who's been in Colorado where Utah for a long time knows the swings that have occurred in both states with real estate going on a pendulum\nOf extremely high demand followed by a wave of soft demand\nDo you think you and your wife have a little patience and you are do you want to go ahead and pull the trigger now and get a mess [laughter]\nWell we definitely I definitely have patience you know I'm looking for a long term and that's kind of relate to what my question was is a ... you know for for folks who by during when it's you know the market's really hot\nUm are they more often than people who buy in a in a buyer's market you know just long term or because you know for for a second home no matter when we go as a second home you know housing values are going to be up or down but if if we jumped in when things are very hot um I just\nWonder if such long term um that would impact our finances that I met him in a negative way\nSo the way you make that test is by comparing the cost of renting today versus what your effective cost of homeownership would be today\nIf when you take the cost of the mortgage taxes and insurance and they had those together if they are more than twenty percent higher than what you can rent today your best off waiting a while before you buy\nIf you can buy a place at a margin that is less than twenty percent higher\nFor current cost of mortgage Saxon insurance versus rent then particularly if you're going to own a property for a significant number of years which in an overheated Marco liked the Denver metro area you want to look at a ownership window of ten years\nYou're comfortable in owning a house for ten years and you can buy it within that that price window I'm Talking about no more than twenty percent higher effective cost per month in rent then go ahead and buy\nOtherwise I had my way for a down cycle and they always come\nYeah I I think I'm gonna late [laughter] I think our focus is going to be or just you know stick it out and the apartment and ... you know I'm as much towards my student loans as possible\nWell that is a very effective strategy you know a lot of people don't feel like they've really settled down\nIf they're renting instead of owning but that is something that is um in some sense psychological and if you can get your financial house veteran order and getting rid of student loans is a great thing to do and rent and let the market find a new equilibrium\nI Would do just that\nJames is with us on the car coward show Hi James\nThis new age to speak with you\nGreat to have you here James you are a little muffled sounding right now though\nSorry about that is a little bit if that is better [noise]\nMy question for you is all with the fortune ... company had been contributing to a traditional four O. one K. or passed Seventeen or so years all currently contribute eleven for ... company match and ...\nUh they had advised if they're going to start off ... off the wall four one K. so I'm kind of ash\nThe law for one day and an ashtray and semi retired and say I'm ... I'm going to be contributing to about ... years give or take on that you should switch all he should be more beneficial to me\nI Love the idea of you having done a traditional four one K. all these years moving forward doing the raw four one K.\nBecause whether it'll give you an retirement and your company match that six percent company matches will still be pre tax money even if you do the raw\nFour one K. moving forward\nBut it by having a pile of money that's pre tax pile and a pile of money that's after tax pile which the Roth becomes\nIs extremely helpful in retirement to make sure that you harvest money is you need it\nFrom what would be the most efficient at that time in that year also we have a really good shot the tax rates are going to be higher in the future than they are now and that would make it a potentially better idea\nTo do a raw four one K. instead of traditional moving forward but there is an exception\nAnd let me discuss whether you whether you're an exception you get if you're making huge money and your job then you want to do the traditional\nBecause if you're an extremely high income earner the odds are better that you're in a higher tax bracket working then you'll be in retirement what I Would say if you're a very small percent of people would be in this territory\nUm are you single or married married to both of you work ... right if your income\nIs north of a quarter million dollars a year then you'd want to do the traditional\nHates it so that had that\nSo yeah so you're at one twenty five family income I Would do the raw four one K.\nMoving forward and if you can hang it up ... percent because remember a year and a half to use after tax dollars instead of before tax now if you can keep your contribution at eleven you'll actually effectively be significantly boosting what you're saving for retirement\nNext Wednesday\nSo that would be a wonderful strategy all these years of pre tax all of the future years a mix of pre tax imposed tax employer pre tax dollars post tax that's really good you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nSettled you must be is the soundtrack of Georgia football with a voice of the dogs Scott how are we recovered and exclusive analysis from UGA all American ... that's why you're come to Georgia have opportunities and stuff like this is Georgia Kentucky Saturday\nTailgate show eleven thirty kick off three thirty\n... dogs do you ask me that when you ask me about ... er Cox media group station [noise]\nTwenty four hour news weather and traffic\nFive AM\n\nAt eleven o'clock on she had it for granted I live in the u._s. be twenty four hour news center would tell us your story this hour ... camp reporting the mail bomb case has moved to Atlanta where the discovery of the package threat to the CNN Center\nBomb squad was called the Atlanta post office on prior street and there was a manila envelope with six American flags in uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz return address the package addressed directly to CNN after Cesar ... was arrested last week authorities said it was possible more packages could be discovered\n... made his first court appearance today right now forty nine degrees in Atlanta clear and chilly tonight loose forty to forty five sunshine tomorrow high Seventy one planet most accurate and dependable forecast is coming up new information on a suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting\nEighty six year old Robert Bowers was released from a hospital just hours before facing a Raymond on twenty nine federal charges stemming from the synagogue shooting on Saturday\nPowers described as a socially awkward loner says it was a truck driver is one bedroom apartment described as ... was a little more than a place for him to store his belongings but neighbors say Bowers pretty much lived alone on the road\nFirst first this is double you ask me twenty four hour continuing to\nMind and body was pulled from ... county sheriff's investigators say they have run into a brick wall trying to id him\nThey tried fingerprints they've tried facial recognition neither has worked to name this white man whose body was found floating in lake Altoona macho county sheriff sergeant Jonathan Rogers said the man had been shot in his right temple who pulled the trigger remains a mystery\nObviously no gunshot positive for what the manner of death was when they do that together has off line is is that why is that like the man\nIt's put together his last line is that why he was like\nThe man mid fifties to mid sixties had a small boat anchor tied on his waist and was wearing ankle weights and a backpack holding Roxanne sand described as five ten weighing two thirty his sketch is on our website told us the radio dot com Veronica waters W.

that if you're if you're traveling\nRight so you establish residency wherever it's almost of convenience like a lot of people will register and Montana because the taxes are so favorable and that's where they'll dom asylum or are they do so in Florida you work for a state with no state income tax\nIs rule number one mhm and usually what you do is you do I'm now again this is not the book and so this is what people really do okay if I give you the really do answer\nWhy I call okay so what people will do is if they have a friend or relative or whatever in a zero income tax say you Lisa room from them in their home and you sign up these probably never use the room\nBut you just pay 'em like a hundred dollars a month to be able to call their place you're home\nSo you don't actually fish we have to own property and know your residency states\nKnow the big thing is you don't want to set foot ever in the state you live in now if you come from a high tax state you live in Connecticut\nAnd that's why we want to find yeah say you're never and Connecticut again [laughter] right\nYou go if you go back to visit relatives in Connecticut you stay in a hotel in somewhere else in the tri state area and then you drive over to see 'em but you're not spending any time in Connecticut 'cause the big thing in high tax states they're going to try to come back at you and say way way way way\nWe don't really believe you're a resident or whatever\nAnd you been here a lot you're not there\nThere are a lot you're not there are a lot when you leave Connecticut you leave Connecticut\nOkay so you just basically do the math figure out which is the most tax has been chose your state and decide to live there\nYeah and it practically what most people do is they do for her to Texas or Montana are the three that are done most often but there are special advantages to Montana and so if you look around on the Web ... and you'll see where people posted articles about why\nThey use Montana as their

with us on the Clark Howard show George let's talk about what's going on with your daughter\nYes sir thank you for taking my call Clark I appreciate it certainly\nUm well my daughter is going to be turning Twenty one this coming Sunday and my wife and I have thought to get her started into adulthood to start a a loft IRA for her\nYou're definitely not from Wisconsin because in Wisconsin they would be that you'd have a big party at a bar for her\n[laughter] or to or in our first legal during\nAbsolutely absolutely but no no we're we're the more fiscally responsible parents and we thought we had a little bit and giving her a twenty four pack that will be God within a few hours\nThat hitting or of wealth IRA that allows for you know hopefully decades\nBut my goodness a twenty four pack that would be gone in a few hours do you know do you know how many beer I can actually handle before I'm just like it's over\nWell you're you're probably similar to me I Know that uh I kind of laughed when they put that foreign on day because I joke with folks that the the beer in my fridge should have it died on date\nBecause of fit in there so long [laughter] yeah I I can handle about one and a half the year before I'm just done sure absolutely yeah but ah\nSo you you are not looking for the alcoholics celebration you're looking for the financial celebration for\nHer ... absolutely and so this roster you're going to do has she ever had one before is this brand new for her this what brand new she working\nShe will be a she has a little bit of income right now but I Would expect that by the end of the year she would have at least a thousand dollars of income that\nUh we were planning on opening with a thousand dollars so hopefully by the end of the air she'll she'll actually be graduating and uh hopefully we'll have employment as an elementary school teacher\nJobs is you know are so relatively plentiful\nSo it's not a question of if she can find a job it's just is it going to be the job she wants so yeah I wouldn't worry at all about her\nCrossing the thousand dollar income threshold so doing a raw for her for a grand is such a wonderful gift because at Twenty one way but you said she's graduating from college and she's only Twenty one\nYes you know most people don't finish college now till twenty three twenty four\nShe had she actually had skipped a a year of high school because she entered an advance program with a school up in northwest Missouri and ah it gave her both college credit in high school credits\nAnd uh she found that she didn't particularly like that program is supposed to be a two year program\nBut then she took it upon herself when she found that she would have to go back to high school to finish her a high school diploma at her old high school\nBut as her a high school diploma at her old high school\nShe decided to contact the president of one of our state universities\nAnd contact him directly saying you know\nThe problem she was having at the school and he moved toward the admission officer who then said well if you just get your GED we can go ahead and take those credits in it which went to college and so what she should have been starting her senior year of high school she was actually a a\nFreshman in college that was about halfway through the freshman year already with the number of credit she had\nYou have one industry has daughter there and what I Love is that she advocated for herself\nAt Seventeen years old and made this happen for her and she's got a bright future in front of her and the wrong doing that at Twenty one the number of times her money will double that thousand dollars will double\nYou're adding I mean just simple math you're adding like a whole additional cycle at least of that Johnny doubling by doing it so young\nRight and my my question was is is the ... the best way to go I was\nThree hundred percent okay\nNow there's not even gray on that that is the perfect thing you can do for her cut and um I have a guide I don't know if you've seen it at Clark dot com it's a basic investing guide and how he can get that set up all in like ten minutes time\nAnd you're open a shell account and then she can find it with a thousand you're going to give her and she'll be all set\nAll right very good I appreciate your advice on that thank you\nWell that is great and congratulations to her doing something is like a throwback getting an undergraduate degree by your twenty first birthday John joins us on the Clark Howard show how John\n... thanks for taking my call I have a lot for me over the years\nWell thank you very much you have something that's been pitched to you you want to run by me telling me\nAbsolutely I'd heard you talk about a long term care insurance but mostly the traditional pie and we are just one insurance agent I my uh state planning attorney who recommends a whole life policy\nThat he's got the ability to use for a certain amount of long term care insurance up to ten years at a certain amount for both me and my life\nIt's a very smart move by the insurance industry\nHas the long term care market has mostly exploded\nBecause the number of people who've claim long term care and has turned out to be far larger than the insurance actuaries expected and so the big push in the insurance industry is what you heard the pitch for\nWhat happens is you buy a whole life policy where they ride or for what sometimes is referred to as a living benefit where if you never need long term care you just have a death benefit that goes to the beneficiary designation the policy\nOn the other hand if you do need long term care with money that would have been paid out at death instead is paid for the benefit of care for\nA long term care facility care in your home a nursing home whatever up to the limits that the policy calls for and you've purchased\nSo for the insurance industry what it does is it caps their risk and what it does for you is you have a premium certain that you pay and you know that that benefit up to that dollar amount will be there for you okay is that how it was explained to you\nBoth very much so I I guess the question is I've always ... hour but I think is your philosophy to go which a term insurance ... well yeah\nI'm well covered there and I was wondering what I'd be too much for that to get a whole life policy that I don't need to check that\nYes and now we're dealing with a very broken system so long term care there are a small number of companies that still sell it on my long term care information that Clark dot com and you don't know what will happen with the premiums if you buy one of those\nSo despise you certainty but what it does do is you're paying a great deal of a premium for that certainty\nSo ... are you someone who could ... you might not like it but you could afford the premiums if over the years ... years the long term care premiums escalated\nYes that's true\nIf that's your case go with traditional long term care insurance and go with one of the mutual insurers that are on the list like um northwestern mutual is an example would be a better choice Joe joins us on the Clark Howard show Hello John\nJoe joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Joe\nHey clock that can take like certainly\nPark I got a problem a Charlene hair and age oh my God I Want to live here in age but our city settled kind of the week several full page ads but the competitors are they all have some fun and\nAll that much about it how can I Do about it and the price\nWill you know the United states is almost alone in the world\nWith hearing aids being so expensive and so if you were overseas is kind of typical that for a pair of hearing aids you'd spend around oh four hundred eight hundred dollars\nAnd in the United states\nIt's common that you pay several thousand dollars for a pair of hearing it\nBut now the competition from overseas is coming into the United states plus some homegrown players and one that I Would like you to look at Joe is one call I hear medical dot com\nThe letter I. H. E. A. R. here medical dot com\nAnd they are selling a hearing aid for two hundred Ninety nine dollars\nCome yes I have a medical that Tom yes\nSo ah two Ninety nine per year is very cheap they have an FDA approved process where you do you're you're hearing test at home\nAnd the company is from San Francisco and so two hundred and Ninety nine dollars in the ear is great when I have recommended to people", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Doraville", "day": "30"}
