much are right when totaled Facebook can classify roughly ... fifty two thousand traits\nOf each of its users did you even realize that you had fifty two thousand trench thinking about that fifty two thousand data bit all about you\n[noise] All right this past week Facebook took the wraps up they say two new video communications devices ... what does that a two hundred dollar portal or a three

on to Google dot com and search\nNeed to make money on line quickly because there's so many scams\nWhile there is one scanned in particular that I Want you to be on the lookout for until you more about that and just a moment but first here's the phone number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us and of course when you're calling in there's Andrew ... gay and they came commando show man cave hello there Andrew\nKim Eric is in Cincinnati, Ohio and this is the first I mean I've been answering phones here for a long time long you have to say how many years seven it was Seventy no no sixteen years there's gonna be Seventeen them it's almost Seventy a\nLong time we should probably talk about not being an intern anymore you know what I'm going with it OK yeah less pressure\nI'm and I'm like you scoffed at when I said Seventy I Know\nCan sixteen pretty rough [laughter] God Andrew I Want to exaggerate so\nEric yes or he wants to be able to non I'm asleep put photos on the Internet and when someone\nNormally call for that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to put you on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good ... you know what 'cause it sounds like revenge porn or sharing yeah it sounds like something shady\nYes uh but he has good reason he is have four adopted foster kids and he wants their grandparents to be able to see what they look like but he's not ready to fully dime in on the whole communication front is\nAn interesting question yeah that is because it's so so Eric you want the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yes that's exactly correct but\nI Know I was gonna say so is this an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] no we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us getting them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they'd been out of the biological home for five well okay\nAnd this year the father the biologic father passed away and do we have to be alert for people who have this didn't contact and they asked if we could bring the children to the funeral and we said no we're not ready to do that yet right\nUm but they said well is there any way that we can we do watch them grow up and so I was looking for some way that I could honestly present them pictures that they could see but I also don't want to just throw them out on the Internet for anyone to say I want to be able to target who can say that\nI get that I get that you know first of all what big hearts that you and your wife must have to take him for kids how old are the kids\nRight now they're seven eight ten and eleven\n[laughter] wow okay it's a full household [laughter]\nIt's a full house for their kids of our own so loud that we have a [laughter] that's\nAwesome that's awesome uh a couple of thoughts come into mind or of course when you post photos you're going to make sure that there is no identifiable characteristics you know\n... and so forth\nYeah I Would take out all the all the men of data and the E. X. I. F. data and\nYou're going to have to use the photo editing program to strip all that out right\nSure uh because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I pulled it down is that I can open up the hidden data\nAnd then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera or just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you have school photos number one\nOr you can put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call is that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shut her fly okay\nShutter fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it uh say once a week or once a month and so they can start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of them going\nTo see it as well [noise] okay ah so\nJust had ordered a shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again you're going to be some options when you do this that you really looking for your own unique website and then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access all those photos and again aside from just\nWe'll be able to access all those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids\nAs far as any type of school logos or anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program that just kind of racist stuff in the back and\n[noise] All right let's talk about one of our great sponsors there're works relieve their works relief\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps in your legs and your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works relieve\nFast acting phone get their works relieve today it's into the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their works relief once again dot com\nOr before we go back to all of your phone calls I got to tell you about a phone scam that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year\nAs a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas is that job scams they're claiming to be from Amazon or totally on the rise\nAnd here's how the scam works listen up you get a voice mail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon it sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour to maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month catfish you're working from home\nUsually those are websites with fictitious names like a Amazon cash Amazon cash website Web store jobs you name it\nBut here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment kid and then once you make the payment poof\nScammers gone all your money your dream of a telecommuting earning cash and your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front payment should should set off warning bells and if you are looking for legitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor\nA virtual assistant or maybe you wanna even watch TV and take surveys yes you can make money doing that\nLook no further than the official home page Kim commando show which is of course ...
