can I be of service to you\n[laughter] well over this the last six months maybe a little bit longer up and get offers from companies that are interested in\nBuying my house\nAnd um you know they're pretty persistent and so I just said let me\nLook them up and see what they were all about but ah have really been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is I'm a ... hour shifts

these folks yeah and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for education to learn what they were about what their business model is like so that I can make an informed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching use your house a house in good condition and and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is\nSo go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar\nIs there any particular company that you're curious about\nI'm One of them cause a a thing goes by name open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are sabotaging and they're racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um\nI guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out\nWhat is a fair value for your home\nAnd so what these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and its competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection and then they will make\nA firm offered to you to buy your home\nAnd then with the idea being that you vacate really quickly typically within a month\nCan be quicker but they just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent or so let's say\nJust for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand\nThey would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going so the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems where they can properly price of house\nGet it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not\nThese things are going to stand the test of time the market will decide but when you get out of it is you're just dont know if you like the price they offer you\nBam you're out no questions no gifts you know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay\nAnd you also have to decide the price that you were offered\nDo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nOh okay All right does that make so yes yes it does yeah I I just um you know wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were\nTotally totally\nLegit no doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat and I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis\nOn the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas in the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of ... a a subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price a house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be a neighborhood so let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how're you doing stuff that corporate thank you Tom how can that be of service\nWell about a year and a half ago I got us will stay in the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this 'cause I never

that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security that should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the current issue or may not care as much with a business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections\nThen a consumer card does under pre existing law and the car to act that was passed after the banking scandals so the Congress carved out a exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example\nLet's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successful you are able to take it over and run up charges their credit card company with a business card can say oh well we don't think they you Tom took good precautions\nAnd so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so is it best course of action is just because it had this account close you know\nIf you've been hit three times by people attempting to take

a week or what about advance bookings those kinds of things\nAre so starting at the most fundamental airfares tend to be the cheapest each week on Tuesday Wednesday and Saturday afternoon after three o'clock so any time on Tuesday or Wednesday and then again Saturday afternoon end of the evening\nAnd it's because of the patterns of when people\nFly now you have a lot of business travelers that fly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays but leisure travelers those are the quietest days for leisure travelers that's why on a Tuesday or Wednesday you have people on an airplane paying the absolute highest fares and people paying the lowest fares\nStaying over Saturday Night doesn't matter anymore what does matter a lot is how far in advance you by there been any of a number of attempts to figure out the ideal number of days before travel to buy a ticket for the lowest fare\nAnd I've never found one that truly convinces me\nAnd I've never found one that truly convinces me but as a practical matter

I think that is where a lot of\nClose and transportation and the U.S is going to find a home Bobby is with us on the Clark Howard show hollow Bobby\nHey clerk doing\nGreat thank you you're trying to get your first credit card is that true\nI Am in the ... so I've been in the past few years and finances are looking great but I don't have any history I applied for a a major credit card to a major bank pop declined for that credit card they have no history\nSo I've been getting a lot of different people and all that different places saying a lot of different things\nAnd it's kind of confusing to try to figure out some sort of called up for some advice on what I should be looking for fresh credit card\nSo if you've never had a credit card and you don't have any history of the car loans or personal loans or any loans at all is that right\nAll right so you're starting from scratch you're going to have to do some heavy lifting to establish that first credit and it it's more work than it should have to be but if you it's one of those things if you don't have history how do you get history\nThe way you do it is you need to either go my first preferred choice is to go to a credit union are you a member of a credit union yet\nI'm I Am not but there are several in my area that I could go on at\n'cause a number of credit unions have what are known generally under it's not a trade name it's kind of the general category we're known this fresh start programs\nWhere you can establish an account a membership where the credit union and what they do with those programs as she put money on deposit with the credit union in a credit union CD or savings account and then that establishes your eligibility for a visa and MasterCard\nAnd the limit on how hard is somehow loosely tied into what you put on deposit in savings or in a CD\nAnd then they'll have like a a schedule that if you pay the bill one time month after month they gradually move you from having to have that CD or savings account just having\nA credit card with no restrictions the advantage of the fresh start programs at a credit union versus what you might have heard from ...\nThe union versus what you might have heard from people about secured cards they might mention is gearing card to you\nHave heard about this yes\nRight so the difference is the credit union cards generally are not considered to be secured cards they're just a regular guys or MasterCard but the credit union is protected by the money you have on deposit with them as a member\nA security guard secured cars are issued by banks have various sizes and with the security card you specifically give them money that is equal to the credit limit they're willing to grant you and they have possession of your money\nAs a security deposit if you will like you would have if you went to rent an apartment and then ending on the secure card after twelve or Eighteen months of on time payments they then transition you to a regular credit card\nOkay problem with the security card programs is they have usually very high annual fees and you've got the time period you have to wait and usually the way they're reporting the card to credit bureaus\nIs under a status that lets the credit bureaus know that it's a secured card and not a full real visa or MasterCard\nYeah my bank check a check to get me to sign up for one of those but I did see that it had quite a high interest rates I was sort of shying away from it\nSo this is one of those areas where if you find a credit union that has one of these programs near you it's a vastly superior way to establish your first credit\nOkay fresh our program at a credit union I Will definitely look into that thank you\nYeah there's one other option I'll mention just briefly and that is if you have a family member who's willing to add you\nTo their credit card account ...\nAnd that would give you the ability to establish credit in the fastest way possible\nAnd depending on the issue or a credit card some will only extend you as soon as unauthorized use or others will make you a co owner\nCo owner status is what's really best for you and it would allow you immediately to establish your credit record in credit history with a major credit card your family member can sign you up for it but then not give you possession of the card they don't have to worry about well what you might do with the card\nBut any of the methods will get you\nPretty quickly to where you have that establish credit history and then after that it's just up to you how you handle it\nDaniel with us on the Clark Howard show hello Daniel\nHey what Daniel you have a one year old boy or girl\nGirl she one years old but they're\nHappy birthday should we break out in song what's your daughter's name\n[laughter] spoil well happy birthday to will I Will not say I don't want to hurt your ears and thank you [laughter] so how can we help with one year old well oh\nWe're looking at a study some kind of college savings plans ... okay trivia loaded with only a side where somebody already gave us the college savings fall on earth fading fall not called city on 'em or just wondering you know a five twenty nine plan right for us\nIf so which one because I don't see my own state listed on your your uh twenty nine plan\nYou're a Floridian that's correct so Florida does a different form of a five what comes under the five twenty nine code Florida has a prepaid tuition plant\nAnd so you've got Seventeen years to totally brainwashing ... that the only school she's going to go to is at Florida State school\nOkay now what are the odds though that Seventeen years from now you won't have long moved to who knows where else in America\nProbably very slow and we've got a lot of family here saw probably stay in this area\nIf you're going to stay in Florida you do have the alternative cause a five twenty nine college savings plan is\nBasically a tax free way to put money aside for college and it can be used at any a real college for even colleges overseas and can be used for any eligible college expense so well I Would have enormous flexibility\nWhere to go to school\nOn the other hand if you ... it's an open question how much a school where you're going to be able to cover with the Florida prepaid tuition plan you will be able to buy essentially course credits\nAnd avoid what inflation will do the cost over the next Seventeen years so it's [noise]\nSo it's there to entirely different ways to\nAttack college costs and so you are okay you really need to think through or you are you comfortable for willow saying hey you get to go to any college as long as it's a state school in the state of Florida period\nAnd if you are then you should probably you look at doing the Florida prepaid tuition plan\nAnd that's because the late\n... you'll you'll know we bought this much of willows education\nOkay one more they are living next my wife works at a local college here in the state of Florida and\nShe gets I guess free tuition for spouses and and the and all that assuming she stays there studying teen years from now so I guess that's kind of an option as well so if I did before the curry paid off on twenty nine point how or that he was trying to get my money back because\nI see what happens with a traditional five twenty nine plan if a child scholarships out the ten percent and penalty they would normally affect you with a five twenty nine plan not used for colleges waved\nBut you have to pay tax on any earnings but you know uh\nConsidering we're education's going let's say well oh your wife still working there well goes there gets the free undergraduate degree such a big number of students now go on to some form of graduate school\nFood and the five twenty nine point money would easily be used for graduate school\nOkay yeah so it's", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "17"}
