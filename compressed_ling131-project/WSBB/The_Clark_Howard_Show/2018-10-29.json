mentioning she's like you know we do a lot of debt Fifteen gigabytes goes real fast [laughter] my kids have updates on their video games and I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa\nWait you does she use

we have a a hot spot it's like a jet pack and we have unlimited plan a we have twenty five gigabytes of data and we used it came in like four\nHours and then we go down to the bottom and slow extremely slow pace of ... hours yeah because I have two teenage boy it's you're updating their [laughter]\nVideo game um X. box and and what not and\nAnd then my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and then I have another one that has night petty likes to get games and it's just to the point where I was just I'm frustrated so I was wondering is a\nWe boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked at and you plug it into one of the house the plug it into the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work fresh\nNo [noise]\nLike that would work fresh\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um it's\nAll it's doing at that point is it's boosting the signal okay\nAnd so it's amplifying the signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent cellular coverage is that you can buy this booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay\nOoh ah and it does it by amplifying the connection with them in a certain area around you okay okay so so that's not gonna help you um [noise] I assume that you this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh I teach\nWhat you do what she 'cause you know it's you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through ... you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean\nYou're right there's a\nThere's always satellite\nAnd yeah we try well we've heard our neighbors just gripe about it\nYeah it's you know especially when you're looking at games and you've got three guys in the house that are trying to do games that's not going to work or doesn't work very well it also crawls um have you looked into a DSL line\nAnd that comes from a company ... because we called our a teeny tiny guinea and\nAt the end is that those Bactrim\nYes okay stack them an charter and nobody will come down our roads at fault them since two thousand four [noise] um [noise]\nI just for giggles okay let me tell you let me tell you a couple of things from Kay [noise]\nIs it a friend of mine recently purchased a home in North of this probably isn't going to be the day but north of Scottsdale, Arizona okay [noise] and so you have Phoenix you have Scottsdale and then you had like this stretch of road where there's nothing\nOkay miles will ring and\nAnd she bought this beautiful house in the middle of five acres okay All right it's and it's the house has like a thousand square feet but she likes it because there's she has no neighbors right\nRight now she's also a doctor\nOn call [noise]\nAnd so before so she has the house and ask her and she's totally Cosby she freaks out she's like oh my God what am I going to do I don't think there's Internet and we I have this house in escrow\nSo I told her just to uh I I did some homework for her and I found a a a a gentleman who lives about a mile away from her\nWho who has a line and has set up a point to point Internet access service with some of his neighbors\nOK okay and she pays fifty dollars a month and\nShe said she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that her kids are now in college so she doesn't have to worry about you know three kids gaming she has five kids and no she was worried about that right [noise]\nBut but still she is able to get to to site in and she has to look at you know X rays or whatever it may be just look at them in real time right mhm\nSo but she's able to do that through a point to point service so I see if there were any options in you know if you just Google your ZIP Code with point to point\nThat's what it's called or sometimes it's called fixed point wireless and basically all you need you don't need any lines you need a line of sight\nOkay so if there are a lot of mountains and a lot of mountains around you know OK okay\nSo so if they're sometimes if you have a lot of mountains that it doesn't work\nBut years ago is that I Believe it or not I live in the center of Phoenix and there who are the cable company wouldn't come down the street and I actually had to have a six point wireless lined put in on the roof\nThat I could go down to South Mountain from my house which I Know that doesn't mean luck to you but it's like twenty miles by the bird flies okay well ah so I Would look around to see if there's any type of six point wireless I Would also call when stream in your area\nUh to see if they have any options for you as well you know other than that you know you don't waste your money on a booster a cause you you know these game updates could be a gig right there\nAnd then I start playing you know you're you're looking at even just a movie could be three gigs and ah so you know and then and then of course you're going to have to tell the kids that you know there was a time not too long ago when you used to walk\nYou know there was a time not too long ago when you used to walk to school on the railroad tracks\n[laughter] and the snow with no shoes exactly so they're just going to have to go to the library okay we'd been there at all out TV [laughter] we've tried that\nI could just see you're you're you're like all of a sudden like there is on the street like outside the Starbucks you guys just show up with\nThe truck drop a couch dropping\nTable it's like\nThere's a yeah that's Robin and the kids for doing good hey nice to see you nice to you before actually there's a there's an they're just not a lot of options here\nAt least you can still laugh about it and the kids will always remember this and when they moved to college there'd be like yes a bottom fight Internet connection love this [noise]\nAll right let's talk about

'cause my iPhone is just about rock sitting in my pocket speaking of the phone when's the last time you used a pay phone I don't even know do they even exist anymore or\nI saw them in Great Britain okay summer no I I've been a long time and so I was standing there it's actually quite funny is I'm standing there like in front of ...\nAnd so I was standing there it's actually quite funny is I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booth were inside there's a pay phone and were you on your phone no and I was just standing there like being in towards like Hi okay and in\nBust out laughing and I said what are you laughing at okay behind\nMe there were all these naked women like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers and they found a use for the phone booth ... which\nIs also the phone book\nBut it isn't that something that's crazy you have a phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change and now we just fast forward and when when did the iPhone come out ten years ago two thousand seven\nThat was ten years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone\nOkay did you have an Atari twenty six hundred yeah\nWe're all generations of video games\nGame boys yes how the game boy how a Sega CD game this generation than anything about that no cars on their parents' phone they don't know anything about a road atlas\nLike a map map yeah now now that that's good right yeah okay\nI've never I never learned how to fold up a map and I I don't think I'm gonna try now\nOkay America Online now you know I started the computer section at AOL years ... years and years ago do you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disc play out in the cereal box you went to store it was everywhere that was really a genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes is that and I ... I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says that we'll find out Tuesday [laughter]\nIs that with AOL is that if you gave a desk sometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person is that if that person used your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a while\nI mean this is like in the early nineties I was I was a bank and like ten grand a month\nJust on AOL do ski yeah just how are you getting them in people's hands just stand on a corner trucking about people\nYou know like I spend the time [laughter] no I was I Would put them in like because I had the\nComputer tutor videotapes oh okay I put 'em in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign that had to do one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] yeah you know what happened is that so you know so I'm like I started the computers they actually got this whole AOL thing going on okay and then they changed managers at the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I had gotten an assault numbers I've gotten a check for twenty five grand for the month just by people using the disk you handed that it was the disc and then taken using the computer section okay and I I that I manage I mean this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up and he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us\nThat's a bit different that's a that's a different character I said well that's not going to really work for me [laughter] thanks okay\nAnd so that was when using key were commando instead of going to AOL that I knew we negotiate I negotiate that it would go to commando dot com that's when you watch the website but that is also when I learned a very valuable lesson\nIs not to depend upon a company\nFor the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook because I already gotten screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that which speaking of one less one can you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [noise] what was that anyway [laughter] yeah one on one hand shakes like all the handshaking no garbled [laughter]\nYes I mean it was so bad that you know sometimes we go away and and where there'd be no Internet or anything and I like walking around making that sound like you can only do they do that intentionally\nYes they wanted it to sound like you know they wanted people to know that that was connecting because previous to that it did not make us out if you want to listen to a fascinating podcast and then we got to go to a break fast same ... that no I that I just uh I I was mesmerized by this past week mayor of fact I'm going to write this\nAn email the woman and the guy who started Cisco Systems they they're no longer part of it

tried to register like sixteen different computer names in the seventies and they were all taken\nSo she's standing there on the street and she says I'm In San Francisco she sees the bridge and she says that's a gateway we're building a gateway so that's where Cisco came from San Francisco and you still see the\nGateway bridge there as part of the local but anyway it's fascinating podcast about that [laughter] oh\n[laughter] All right let's talk about be prepared dot com one of our great sponsors here on a Kim commando show and this past week Austin, Texas was issued a boil water notice due to some elevated levels of silt\nRead in the prior weeks flooding ... customers were instructed to boil their water for three minutes wow three minutes before ingesting it\nYou know water main breaks
