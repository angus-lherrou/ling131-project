hear the allegations from insiders that have been published recently\nThe ticket master is playing dirty pool with your wallet [noise]\n\nHe's just a moment [noise]\nI have always despised ticket master\nBecause you go to buy a ticket to something and there's this out rages fee added to it if you're not aware how that all came about ticket master a very cleverly but very diabolical he\nWent to promoters and Venus around the country and offered them\nPretty much whatever they wanted to become the exclusive seller of tickets\nAnd hit a point of critical mass where when you wanted to buy tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all so the cost of the infrastructure\nIs all a basically a monopoly passed through and it's why I despise monopolies so much and you think that that would be enough\nFor ticket master to rake off out of your wallet\nThere's a long form story in Rolling Stone you may have heard about that insiders ... ticket master\nInsiders ticket master\nA spill the beans the ticket master has a system operating where they manipulate the sale of tickets to get them into the hands of their own scalpers\nSo that they're making money both on the fees up front been the fees when the tickets are resold plus the profits no ticket master denies it we'll see what goes on with that but I Want to tell you the whole system is rotten\nWe're getting rocked and it stinks\nAnd when there's a time that I can go to a box office and buy tickets direct and not pay the fee I Do that but there are times I Will not go to an event because I Will not pay the ticket master rip off the\nThe good news for you and me is that a lot of events\nDon't sell out anymore that used to

customer you might get slow down your your priority is lower than it is the mobile customer\nWere which brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what ... is doing with visible at\nHow much a month for I'm already dollars a month now and that's ... plants are Seventy five ten Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month the taxes and fees included again\nOnly for iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones ... name is not anywhere to be found\nAround visible they don't want anybody to know that it's them not it as that is that it's their network and so it's at forty the one guy show would therefore to your mind\nIs that the speeds that you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent ...\nThat's true uh and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit so you want to read through the fine print to know that you are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and a metro buy T Mobile and the boost is how many stores as the Invisible Man was all they really are invisible there's no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you'd sign up for the service there\nThat's right you download the app you'd sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service of done elsewhere in the world without relying on a big network or stores or cricket\nIs suddenly a Eighteen tease second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes\nYeah uh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans\nAnd there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one\nIt does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that I think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great pie price point or fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know drunk the so no it's all included a now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteen T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is there is a grudge match of hate\nBetween a TNT and John ledger the guy from T Mobile bay hate each other Eighteen he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nThe mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile it sixty so then cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competitions great and you've got all this explain were charts and all that\nGot it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go and also compare them to the big four forest plans to see if saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha has that come with all of these unlimited plant\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to live with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month\nFor bona fide real cell phone service with\nI'm not a huge amount of data but\nSome data yeah\nWell thank you and I appreciate how you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone ... plans don't change\nNo they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all its own car\nDot com thank you very much John joins us on the Clark Howard show how John\nHi Clark ... how are you do talk to you it's great to have you\nHere I'm doing well I'm an avid listener and glad to be on um\nHad a question for you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are vanguard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider um\nWell actually I Am I have a favorite children and so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got you got these these four kids which is really your favorite why don't have any favors they're all [laughter] so now you're you're doing that to me with\nInvesting so tell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFidelity you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out they have\nA ton of really low cost no transaction fee each yes or no minimum ... minimum wage to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nZero's that has such a brilliant marketing campaign around the fatalities zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI I think this is absolutely great what fidelity is done fidelity let me tell you why this came about ... had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a nachos fan guard but also to the bigger player out there that most of us in the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share their was out there so fidelity\nComing up with the new product development zero has set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest because obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else\nAnd so they have the total stock market\nAnd so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment at no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks oh free so a fidelity is in the game solid you know what else they've done what's that\nSo Fidel they used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds\nAnd now they have two flavors up them they have an extremely low cost series of a target retirement funds and then they have their old one that still has very high cost well not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering\nSo they have become much more aggressive on the front and so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talking about\nVanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I've invested with Fidel itty and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystem thirty two percent cash card\nGood for you explain that because a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nYou have a two percent cash back on every every purchase you run through um I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your fertility account\nSo that he has managed best timing account or give me an IRA right or a college savings plans exactly yeah\nSo so you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard when Fidel and he's doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were you know asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard and I was just struck by that\nYeah and so uh I should not be offending\nFinality 'cause they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower costs but vanguard really set the pattern and set the tone and took the market share\nAnd that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace for lower costs\nAnd maybe that's a sentimental thing\nBut I ... you're probably right I should be talking about that fidelity is well now offers a series of ultra cheap choices for investing\nThanks for bringing it to my attention you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nTen
