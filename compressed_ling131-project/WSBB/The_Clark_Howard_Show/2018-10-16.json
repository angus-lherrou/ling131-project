Antonio where El Paso and it might cut your price\nEighty Ninety percent when you get to Houston\nYou just don't take the connecting flight and you go visit family or go to work or whatever it is

work as an investment professional as your day job\nSo going in the age based portfolio is what I recommend what I've done going through the plans\nAs I've looked at them to find the ones that are the absolute lowest cost because over let's say a typical investment cycle that someone's putting money on for a child's college the money sits in their roughly ten years\nBased on when people put money on and the money you put in through the years and so for that\nInvestment cycle the costs of the investments matter enormously how much money you'll have there for a kids' college by the time they're spending it and for tuition and other eligible expenses and undergraduate or graduate school\nSo my guide that I've just updated at ... dot com is all about driving down costs period\nAnd the good news is the college five twenty nine plans have gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper with intense competition among those that are the direct salt\nThe ones that involve commissions again I don't even look at because they're so on economic you should never consider them\nBut the great news is that when I first started writing about and reviewing five twenty nine plans long ago the list of those that were good for you to put your money on was teensy tiny\nToday in encompasses most plans sponsored by most states in the country and many states in addition to getting use of money tax free for college you get a tax benefit up front for participating in a plan\nAnd so check out my guide and it's something that I uh do partial revisions overtime and then do a major revisions to roughly every Eighteen months and the reason there are times I Do partial revisions\nAnd the reason there are times I Do partial revisions is to actually won a plan may change sponsors or the existing sponsor main lower costs or two\nI may come to believe that the decision I made about a particular state plan was wrong and I may downgrade planner upgrade a plan on further review but the idea of this is that\nYou have an opportunity if you can afford it to put money aside to defray at least in part the cost of a child's college education and have that done the most efficient way possible tax free growth of your money\nHaving said that though\nNever sacrifice your own retirement\nIn order to put money aside for a kids' college your retirement comes first\nThe reason why is simple there are no scholarship plans for retirement\nBut there are many alternative ways to pay for college including the most overlooked Deval and that's going to a more affordable college\nIs the number one way to reduce the cost goes a dollar never had to be expended for college is a dollar you don't have to say for it\nAnd again if the culture and your family is college is not likely for\nA kid you don't want to save in one of these plans but always save the max you're allowed to enter Roth IRA\nBefore you focus in any meaningful way on a five twenty nine\nI guess the only uh asked or is that\nIs if there's a state tax benefit going into a five twenty nine if you can put in what will get you the maximum tax benefit and state in addition to the tax free growth that would make it a one and then the raw IRA funding would be a one a\nRed anyway you can see my explanation at court dot com the goal with my five twenty nine plan guide is this I Want you to be in a position\nTo review\nPick a plan\nFind it and be done\nIn less than Fifteen minutes this doesn't have to be hard it doesn't in any way I Need to be intimidating and you'll really be glad that you set up a plan with the goal of being to add to it\nEvery month if you can automatically to build up real money towards college\nJill is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jill\nHi cartel are you\nGrade Jill I Hope I can be of help to you\nI Hope so I had a question about the online by [noise] I I've been listening\nTeam racially I took your life to live at ... to one of the online banks and like he quits after they went to a bank rates like the one that had a good interest rate and the five star ratings but my my nagging concern is that I didn't see a direct\nLink to the banks and I had ... it was all that time and that set it up and it looks like it and let that I still have this nagging fear that one of these\nTimes then it got a lot into my account\nMoney's good a ham isn't right okay so let me tell you what\nIs with 'em you worked at a bank Craig list with any of these lists um when if someone doesn't pay them referral fees they're not going to provide a direct like they're going to give you the information\nThat is the best right out there but that's why there was an a hyper lengthy would take you right to it\nOK so doesn't in any way make that a a bad bank or one that you should be wary of it's just that since they wouldn't pay money any kind of commission is going to be a little more work for you to do business with them what kind of raid are you learning\nI'm killing a quarter\nTo quarter already knew that is I think today the highest anybody's pay is too okay yeah I it ...\nIt was when I set it up and I mean I guess my other question is since there's not a brick and mortar bank locally and I think\nThis thanks that case is supposedly based in New York but are there others that self safeguards that you should take when you use an online bank as I guess I'm not sure what I Would give up all the sudden I couldn't access my account or the bank's website\nWhere you can always cross validate that you're dealing with real people by going to F. D. I. C. dot Gov and checking to see that it is a real institution and the you're insured to the quarter million\nReal institution and the your insurer to the quarter million and as long as you have to cross reference you're you're good to go and online banks are going to be a bigger and bigger part of our financial market in the United\nStates because particularly people who have come of age in the last Fifteen\nYears going to physical bank branches just isn't part of how they do things and so the the future's going to be captured by online only institutions and what you're doing is just plain smart\nI Hope so I Am certainly seems slightly money on the table and I appreciate I'll let you get advice and and that makes me feel a little bit better\nAnd I'm curious what were you earning at the place you had the money before\nWell I have to add a credit union and and actually they are currently pay two and a half percent but only on you know up to a certain amount of money so I was getting at that interest rate on some of my savings but there was a lot out there that I wasn't gaining anything on\nWell two and a half is really great that's fantastic um I didn't know any credit unions were paying savings rates that Hi Beverly with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Beverly\nHigh clock how are you great thank you Beverly you got a question for me to save some money\nI sure do but at first I Want to thank you for what you do I we all appreciate everything you do\nWhat year kind thank you\nI had a question about trainers I had heard you on a more than a week ago talking about um H.

I serve you well I've got a situation\nWhere we are looking into hearing aids and they use like air so expensive several thousands of dollars even at my favorite warehouse club or I Know it's at least a reputable price\nOr whether you are you when you say favorite warehouse club are you talking about Sam's or Costco\nUh it'd be Costco\nCosco has some very basic hearing aids that you may be able to buy it like five hundred dollars a year okay but you can do a lot cheaper than that and get a true real hearing aid and that's what you'd like you'd like a better deal right\nWhen I'm starting to see is in the newspapers or magazines some other sharing a type of companies when I'm looking to find out if they're reputable or if there's any other recommendation that would be a little bit better priced\nOkay so there's two things you'll see in the ads one you'll see your ads that are very cleverly written that under the law the devices are not considered to be hearing aids they're referred to as peace saps under the law\nPersonal sound amplification product I think is what it stands for\nAnd those are being very heavily promoted on the Web and as you mentioned a newspaper ads and people are selling those from anywhere like under a hundred dollars to typically tapping out around three hundred dollars\nAnd then there are actual real hearing aids that require that you also have the services of an audiologist in order for you legally to be able to get them there was a hearing aid is licensed by the FDA\nA piece that you and I could go start our own Mike ... piece at company now there is one that's kind of a step in between and I'd like you to look at the website is I hear medical dot com\nAnd they sell a hearing aid they also sell a FDA approved test kit where you can do your own actual fully FDA approved ear test okay because the way the business\nEar test okay because the way the business works right now is a lot of places do the hearing test quote unquote for free\nAnd then they make the massive mark up on the hearing aids is to my knowledge we're the only country on earth that uses this business model and so I hear medical gets around that by you actually paying for the hearing test\nAnd then you get the really inexpensive true hearing aid but\nThe thing about them or any others are reputable so we don't spend money on something that doesn't work for a dollar\nOkay so the thing with hearing aids who's going to sound terrible\nIt doesn't matter of you spent five thousand dollars on hearing aids the customer satisfaction with hearing aids is extremely low [noise]\nSo that's why I'd like you to start off with something much less expensive [noise]\nAnd see if you can find one you're happy with before you spend a zillion dollars you're listening to

that happened last year\nDo you know one of the reasons credit card default spiked last year was people got into the whole mania or the crypto currencies and the initial coin offerings and they were doing it with borrowed money\nDon't\nBorrow money to buy inventory for any multi level marketing organization\nThe ones that push you to\nLay out your money up front to hold inventory that's contrary to the whole original idea of multi levels which is your hard work and time and effort will pay off not you having to be a merchant holding inventory\nWhole inventory side should be all about something that went and orders placed\nThe inventory goes straight from a warehouse of the multi level to the individual by and by the way remember this\nThe way you get to that fuzzy area where it goes from being a multi level to an illegal pyramid\nIs if the big push the big pitch is about you recruiting people into the organization instead of you selling a product or service to strangers\nYou
