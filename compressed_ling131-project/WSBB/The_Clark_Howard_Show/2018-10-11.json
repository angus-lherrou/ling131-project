you're listening to WSBIU continuing coverage of hurricane Michael in Georgia and like you to contribute and I'm David Baker Monica Matthews is also here\nShe Bernal black dog with her dad what's a dog named del ask them feel very good that's right\nBecause normally we're hunker down in our laundry room on night flight tonight\nThat's enough to be there any more about that either on the line right now John top one you know and this Jay ... from the home fix it shows the season electrician Monica\nOkay and now to get his cell phone I'm probably already has his own Molly Hello John John how you doing buddy how you doing\nDoing well just we're going to be real quick here we we talk about generators all the time All right\nThis is\nYou know we can talk about whole house generators right now it's not going to do any good because nobody's gonna run it there's no time to buy one for tonight for tomorrow I but now listening is the second time in ten months maybe now we've had major hurricanes come close enough to Atlanta cost power outages\nA close eighty thousand power outages in the state telling me the benefits and explain what a whole house generator does in a minute and a half or less\nDo get the benefit is a whole house reading all we can take those critical loads and transfer of power automatically you don't have to worry about it [noise] plugging it in crank ended up making sure it wants to cry like we can select loads the whole house partial house\nAnd it will automatically turtle when the power goes off that it isn't that shelled as bad as simple as possible I can explain\nBy critical load team means your heating and air system your refrigerator or your washer dryer your microwave you're stone your dishwasher or anything in your house that runs now if you get a whole house generator and will be like nothing's changed when the power goes out\nThat is correct that is great and I read a lot of people use the word critical Los everybody has different things they ought to rock the critical Los ... are run it and my refrigerator I'm a happy land so is those are critical of [laughter] so that's why you wouldn't get your gas eat\nYour air conditioner ... what size we can get it back up for you\nAnd we had a caller earlier who has to generators in his garage these are totally separate things a whole house generators about the size of your outdoor air conditioning unit and doesn't have wheels on it you don't push it around and you don't have to supply with gas can every every time you need to run and it runs everything in your house that man who was on before his\nCredit has a couple of generations but he's going to decide what he wants to plug into um how long they're going to run as he get gas for when the gas runs out you know hopefully it doesn't last that long but there's a lot of decisions to be made and when we talk whole house generators this is why we're talking you need a whole house generator\nYes it with a portable you miss a lot of people don't realize you've still got to store it like you said you got your records back and forth and they keep it that enough fuel to last you through that outage and make sure that you do have those items that you all plugged up courts running through your house and\nHe's got to still keep that generator five feet away from your house for carbon monoxide\nThe average house generator over under Fifteen thousand dollars\nRight in that area yeah ballpark you're okay so\nHere's the thing it's been it's been in the last ten months we've had two hurricanes we had a winter ice storm all that's knocked out power some people have been without power if you were without power a week each time that's three weeks that's almost a month All right\nSo if you know you're almost a month without power if you've got medical supplies at the house you run your business out of your house if uh you know you had your condition of all the all the conveniences all your electronics and everything that runs out of your house this is the reasons why we push home generators\nEvery single street we would turn down a this is primarily like in the bucket area of the city of Atlanta they were blocked by trees so I Love what you said that when the first segment because I wouldn't have thought that you know you asked me who's the first person that I Would call in the event of a tree falling on my ...\nMy ... of course my first answer with you\nYeah well the first time in order I got that answer I got my roofer there you go to be the best route for an American they just got voted the best driven company in America he said called the tree guy because we can't go out there if you were the rivers and that means non\nDo their own excavation worked before they get in there and the root and the tree guy will put the tarp on your house after he's done\nAnd that's all you got to get you got your major worries to keep the water out to begin with and you guys aren't assessing damage and all let's go back to the phones the lines are open it for all for eight seven two zeroes seven fifty that would be the number I think it's Eli is in Woodstock Eli you're on ws\nHello I'm here I Am well how are you I'm\nTo do it at out they have a little cottage H cut down on the beach and I've heard a lot of talk about it\nAnd I've heard a lot of talk about you know comparing it to a future path half the hurricanes are storm but in Nineteen Ninety four nobody's mentioned tropical storm out there tell which was first name storm of these that year and it was a mandatory evacuation\nIn Ninety four right\nNineteen Ninety four I write pretty shirt July Ninety four no storm\nOut there and I'm at ... at one point three billion dollars in damage thirty kids back it didn't have a high velocity it a lot of damage and I know\nIt is because it was a little off that's not that's no it wasn't good and it wasn't good because we couldn't eat that can't wait I didn't mean merge in the room that day and got home it was to go up to go anywhere and the announcement came over the loudspeaker is about evacuating\nNot the only not to be flip but I thought you meant you were working in the emergency room as a nurse that day or how would you were to drugged up to go on I'm going to do a lot of them are not people neither here\nRight [laughter] panic attack thing does\nThat take me to the emergency room [laughter] so yeah\nBut I can remember being just so guardian and my kids came over the mom mom we gotta go they're telling us that great and I said I Can't go anywhere and we have their share of that and in the morning or one of my neighbors you know they were coming back again and came back at it that you need to move your car your work is about\nTo go and I came out and about a third of our roots peeled right off onto our neighbor's house but it was quite an experience and it did a lot of damage but nobody said anything about it I still got the bumper sticker that says I Survived a tropical storm out there\nYou know ... it wasn't a hurricane so it wasn't a sexy as anything as Michael or is it just it's just a tropical storm is not going to hurt you just going to dump brain into his house nonstop days right [laughter]\nYeah but if they have pretty much how much the same tracking is as Michael and again it didn't have that much it was one of the most expensive storm that I'm Still reading that it was one of the most expensive stores at one point three billion\nYeah over here which is pretty significant but again it never made that though we requirement I guess for it to be named hurricane\nYeah it doesn't need to be really windy of to cause a lot of damage in into your point you didn't have a tree fall on your on your roof just goes okay then call the roof or don't come true you're just disappears without any real just disappears and here's some of the problems they also had\nA and I'll just leave early on line so she can and if she needs to somebody

only Nineteen Ninety five a month visit ... dot com that's oh MA or call an eight six six six one nine nine three seven seven to find out more room on the phone your small business deserves\nYeah so tonight will have gosh we've already have got to about thirty five miles an hour in Atlanta we're not going to see much more than that and I I Would could rely to forty mile in our guts but then after the sunrise tomorrow and the center of Michael starts pushing away from us\nThe winds will gradually subside so tomorrow afternoon it'll be breezy gust twenty twenty five miles an hour or so that's not a problem and a clearing sky tomorrow\nIt's an extra club on a par three I'm sure you're aware of this right what does that what I don't know is that what it's going to take for the for the storm to move a little bit as the sun to come back up and he come back\nAnd to know what's happening is a cold front coming in from the west and I was already turned and you may recall yesterday and even early this morning\nThe hurricane was moving to North through the Gulf of Mexico the approaching front from the west has turned it to the north east okay and it's picking a forward speed so it's moving almost twenty miles an hour now moving to the northeast um that call friends going to continue to push it away\nAnd drier air coming in behind the front and on the back side of the of what tomorrow will be a tropical storm um is going to cause of sunshine to return it ultimately some beautiful weather coming our way\nWould eventually just be known tomorrow is a rain event\nYeah no and drier air coming in behind the front and on the back side of the of what tomorrow will be a tropical storm um is going to cause of sunshine returning ultimately some beautiful weather coming our way\nWhile it eventually just be known tomorrow is a rain event\nYeah no it it it'll it'll keep its name and unlikely maintain tropical storm strength through the day tomorrow it's going to pretty quickly screwed across the Carolinas tomorrow afternoon and and back out I'm near a near the coast or perhaps just back out into the Atlantic by late tomorrow\nOne more quick question unless Monica has won this has been pretty quick I mean Sunday I wasn't even hardly a tropical depression by noon today or your new today it was a category five now it's on the verge of being back into the tropical and then it's going to be a way is that normal or is that\nWe we we ... we had what's called rapid intensification I mean there\nThere's decades to are we at the beginning or the end of the season\nSo we're almost at the end they the hurricane season runs from the first of June to the end of November\nSo we've got another month and a half or so but it's really of those six months if the middle of August through the middle of October those two months that are most active so we're really right at the end of the most active periods um but the hurricane season will last to the to the end of November\nAny way to know if there's anything out there are percolating\nWell there's a couple of things out there right now we've got a a hurricane Leslie way out in the Atlantic has been out there for over a week just kind of meandering around tropical storm lady in the eastern Atlantic ah we haven't talked much about those of course both right now\nBut the two other names storms out there are
