Fox News talk radio and Trump have caused all this as am sat silent for all these weeks or I don't think so pretty outrageous\nWe'll get back to that we'll get your calls on that in a few minutes\nI'm One of the things that we have been airing and many thanks to our friends have project very pest dot com is their undercover videos of exposed\nNow three senators in key Senate races but this election year and then Thirteen Days first it was Phil Bredesen of Tennessee in his staff caught on tape while the they think the people of Tennessee are ignorant and they had no problem saying yeah he's only saying that he's voting for Kavanaugh he would never vote for Kavanaugh\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera toss\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none it it it it her way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated as like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it\nBut thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something all Sean if it's wrong for me to go undercover and record these folks then how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record\nOwners if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way and and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that are happening North Dakota this week\nYeah I think well that should've happened in North Dakota I mean if she's planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know why can't you do it in Pennsylvania and twelve other states\nThere's twelve states that prohibit what they call to party consent laws and I think that these laws basically it means that uh you know if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North Dakota\nAnd middle already hearty consent as long as I'm with you I can record you know I think these laws are unconstitutional I think they do to fight the guilty and I also think\nSean they give the guilty away out\nIt gives them a way out they give them a way to say why didn't say that when in fact they did and and unfortunately a lot of these Democrats just they have to mislead the moderate voters and it's about having integrity it's about it's about removing the gap between the way people project alright house and who they really are\nA

that's happened in New York City that's that's you know we've got to monitor the media close to here because another talking about violence against Democrats are but we do have a number of other states next week I I I'm Wondering if I should say the names of the states I don't know\nWe had what how many women are run out of restaurants in movie theaters Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen Ted Cruz and his wife Henry Kissinger we saw what happened this weekend a Boulder thrown through the window of of Kevin McCarthy's office\nOr Mitch McConnell has a little bit to come up to the table just eating in a restaurant with his wife guide banging on his tables stealing stuff from his table throwing it outside creating a scene\nIn a hospital in environment I don't see conservatives doing that and so we have this sad tragedy today where we have suspicious packages now sent to people like\nUh the Clintons and Obama and CNN and and looks like Maxine Waters\nAnd somehow immediately ... gets turned into blame conservatives blame talk radio blame Fox News my name is mentioned in particular and I've been saying all along I don't want anybody\nOf any political persuasion hurt in any of this yesterday on this program I pointed out a George Soros hates my guts\nAnd I believe is spent millions of dollars to destroy this program apparently an explosive device was found\nThe destroy those program apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported in a billionaire left this global list of George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that would love the show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop that was yesterday I said that this all happens today and I say the same thing we did the uh if you don't call yourself a conservative\nAnd go about being violent do you have Thirteen Days use whatever passion you have and and vote at the ballot box that's how we do it in this country\nWe don't threaten people we don't intimidate people we don't go after women and children in restaurants or like we've been witnessing when\nWe don't listen to the rhetoric of people like Maxine Waters to get in their face creative crowd follow people into the grocery store gas station department store and say you're not wanted a anywhere anymore which is what she said we're Spartacus getting their face or Obama's saying getting their face\nAnd well I'll have missed the bird just tear up Sean Hannity and all the other incendiary rhetoric or Eric Holder kicked up more Hillary you can't be symbol Rand Paul was right something's gonna happen thank God we have the best law enforcement in New York and elsewhere that have been able to stop\nPotential tragedies from happening maybe now the Democrats will speak out about members of their own party and the horrific rhetoric they've had\nBack to my pope point Brendan struck a is a now a conservative and he's leading this movement which is has to walk away from the Democratic party he joins us as well as post Paterson who memory he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book Darryl electric dereliction of duty a welcome both W brand and tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left to a Democrat and you started this campaign and this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so it's great to be our son thank you um so I you know my whole life I considered myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself I was at the Democratic party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand and sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was\nOne of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the media had been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and\nThey also have been telling me for months and months that he was a racist in a big hit and homophobia and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler at that his followers were no better and\nYou know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people making people believe these stories and this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I\nI'll never be able to understand how people could vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody reached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled\nThat Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch the compilation his that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who is caught in a lie or doing something shady or grumbling\nBecause they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now Sean but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative and then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do is news or the truth brand\nAnd let me ask you something now once your eyes are open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that once you see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next\nPart of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny and\nWhen the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nLet me ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'll give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is\nThat there are homophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia that they want dirty air and water Obama use those actual words that they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granting over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true there's not one thing that is true about that look look at the stakes for African Americans\nHispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nUm the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most ah these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well\nThat's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because\nSeeing so how many people have joined your mood but\nSo the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand of press or something like ... yeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand it to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign\nSo these are people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this was forming like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary queen we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that ... the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington\nBlumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show a night when you know and this was right in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings and he was being a lunatic and I ... I was ... and how are you\nWhat's going on man because um I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that I mean I don't get this behavior I don't it's not affect him I said if you'd like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people acting that way\nYeah well you know my story shot I I yeah I went up to the White House has air

you take an electronic image of yours check your depositing and your deposit into your account I had no idea\nThat there were people who were depositing and one account and then going to cash that same check somewhere else\nAnd sticking losses through the banking system well now there's new guidance issued by the Federal Reserve who get stuck with the law is the second time somebody presents a check it's not who wrote the check\nThis out the second financial institution you go to deposit the check is the one that you deposit the check with electronically according to kept playing there's\nSo there's a new federal procedure guidelines issued\nOn who will be liable in the future based on what you're required to do to not be surprised\nIf in the next few weeks you get a notification from your bank credit union brokerage whoever it is you do electronic deposit with there will be a phrase they require\nThat you are right on the face of the check you're going to deposit\nAnd that will be something white for mobile deposit only or something of similar wording that the bank is requiring and that is\nWhat you'll have to put on before your deposit will be accepted the idea being that will lemonade you've trying to deposit fat check the second time somewhere else [noise] who knew people would try to run again like that any way\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments\nAt Quicken Loans we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with rate shield you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing rates shield\nWe don't think so and then they turned out the first amendment and said you can't compel us to say things we don't want and I put out so called to some constitutional lawyers to say well is that true I mean they've got a list all the side effects cat they also be forced to list the price\nAnd the lawyers say now it looks like you can make a case from the government's point of view to coerce speech if they were the public interest or public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement for all the side effects\nBut it would be very difficult for the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys with the scarlet letter of having to publicize their prices and so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court where they will probably win in a Citizens United environment where drugs or\nBusiness has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government is the way to win and second of all if the drug industry is for us to litigate yes what they'll just pass those costs on us\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors ... this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold doc\nI Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me\nAnd so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem more than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be too influenced by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic patient in healthcare terms which means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in\nThat's an out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not going to take no for an answer [noise]\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's\nKinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing than it does into research because they know what's affective they don't need to get everybody demanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a a significant number\nTo make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is\nAnd let's also underlined disappoint Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs in that off\nAnd New Zealand and that's it every other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practices said no we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained license health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that if in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end to this practice because they see it as just inflating drug prices and steering people into expensive treatment regimens that there would be\nMuch cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum\nWe're not that powerful sorry changed that momentum so we've got to drill back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also\nPeople need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that\nWell there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore the cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers and on all of the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person\nAnd I would also encourage people to write to their elected representatives because indeed\nIf we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product\nGetting rid of the direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's billions of dollars that would therefore be redirected backing to Laurie useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son went to ... D is when we're watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nBest thing you said was that [laughter] was gosh\nI Can't get past the revenue explain that to your son the best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make\nDrugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth they have all that money going to the ads and so don't mind them change your mind don't like those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting a sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nWell David Lazarus or in the Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son what he did his family radio\nWell I Would say that things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh okay\n... with us on the court were to show how I'm Corey how you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you great thank you [noise] Corey you've got\nSomething that happened in your life that's not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately yes those after my wife has a my wife's dad passed away\nWell I'm very sorry about her loss\nWell thank you\nSo how can I be of service in this situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our a auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while it kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage\nSo are we are going to be adding a\nSix sixteen and Seventeen year old son under the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh oh I just have your wallet just take that not even stab your wallet a lot you know 'cause that's what happens\nWhen you get a teen driver on your insurance\nWhen you get a team driver on your insurance\nYes yeah we're lucky enough though that we didn't have to buy a car\nTrue so or saving money there any other cars\nYou have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that to my wife but that was one of the first thoughts had along with 'em lazy to duck tools\nYeah I'm a ... fan and raising deductibles okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to\nOkay but if that helps and we were hundred now so\nYeah so raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway because the insurer will just eat you up in premiums so you want to avoid that and then how old are your vehicles\nOur oldest vehicle is a ... for\nYeah you only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's okay if that's what I was thinking too or the other two are newer we have a two thousand just in the car we just got his uh two thousand at fourteen so\nYour teenager needs to be driving the ... for if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the ... but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most that's for sure\nSo sure as you in this case there may be an advantage in talking with an independent agent\nOkay or you know something people really don't do any more but there are agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older because a lot of young people I have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations they've done with new drivers with teenagers what's gonna be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nSometimes depending on the state and how rates tend to be set in a state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that vehicle though affair and be on a separate policy and then and other places it may be better for him to only be named in additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to him\nPerfect that's where the independent agent becomes so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Doraville", "day": "25"}
