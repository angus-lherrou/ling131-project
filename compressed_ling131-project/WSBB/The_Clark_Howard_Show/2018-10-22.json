choose to make sure the lighting is right at the camera looks good and we should look good on camera before she jumps in and starts talking to a patient\nYeah because you don't want to look bad no no you have to look you know body you have to look hot\n[laughter] yes yes uh this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac\nLaptop or even my eye pad and iPhone right [noise] yeah so um I just didn't know there was a way that I can do is ... feet check to see you know if the lighting is okay maybe the background the position that the camera\nI Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen writing things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before you actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on ya okay\nAnd in Chicago you have sunny days and you have cloudy days right yes and you have a cold winter days okay I've been there and like get so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a Ringo light I don't know if you've heard of this and it's a it is a rank\nUh I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com and so what does it has it's for a facial ... like portraits that people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a webcam\nIs that you have a tendency to be washed out okay with the ring light is it exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face K.\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lot of people say oh no I Lived veteran or dark restaurant\nNothing not so much on K now when you're faces illuminated within the background will appear darker OK okay and so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall\nAnd so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall meaning I I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them I Want to see\nAll your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'm not gonna be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as that person but you know we've interviewed people before like this guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have this like there was a hoarders behind them and you're like ... what is that a child that has to write so we clean all that up\nNow there are ways when you have faced time for example that you can hit a button this was going to be hard but what I Would do is I Would just\nRecord say a couple of seconds and\nThen you don't worry about just taking a picture so if you can record some video of yourself for thirty seconds\nThe big thing too that a lot of people don't realize funny is that you want to smile OK okay and because when you smile you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you know race or is there's a whole side of\nI mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors night I hear a lot of the bad story but I also hear the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality comes through have you ever done this before\nAre only end wedding hours but not actually as a patient doctor saying\nThis is so cool I'm so excited for you um the ring lights are about sixty bucks okay and it\nMakes like I said it makes total difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point you're going to say yes a little extra blush sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because uh you seem to get a little bit washed out even if you do have this ring light and again thank

ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and\nThey you know and they're trying to get a they need a new you know they're getting ready for college knowing their cheekbones looking really hungry [laughter] whatever it may be\nA said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty per cent on just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nSee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I said so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and\nSome people are going like thirty percent\n[noise] but see the isn't that different though because that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on the screen so when you're a bone marrow do you tip\nYeah really\nI Do that's why they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay here's the reason why\nGay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston right in ... and\nWhen you really tables and I also waited tables\nAnd when I was at a a ship at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but\nYeah the person that I've worked in the register no of course you want\nBut if I had but ... but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said\nIn and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed\nMe a muffin that it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThe ... percent point eight hundred dollars something around ... had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right [noise] one was one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people\nAnd the iPhone chip drivers like overflowing [laughter] and\nThe Android One didn't have anything yeah I was at a a video games thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks to appear if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we ordered or my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like which has got a bunch of barbecue shall we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total\nAnd it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you\nYeah and you know ... for that and also overeat because they'll say like\nPricing search okay and so they add another\nFive dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever it may be\nBut maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life I actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday\nAnd it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nSo you got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars okay and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave them an extra four\nOr five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this works otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't included\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay\n'cause they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right\nOkay so if they can get that ... thinking about this if they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the tip of the dollar is no no no you you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction then\nYou have to pay a fee for them collecting the money and doing things like that and he does have a minute I'm Still not tipping well I'll just as hard it is hard and you know\nI I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are there was maybe about\nUh that I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally and what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin\n[laughter] so here's ten percent I'm just instead of having an African limited use use the cash that you're expecting them to like my ... something like that [noise]\nAll right let me tell you something over the years epson printers may have earned my trust which is why I'm a committed user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the
