based on the time that you can afford to take risk\nSo money that you are putting in let's say is most people do most people's involvement with the stock market is through a four one K. or Roth IRA\nAnd through a plan where you're invested in fines\nAnd if you're putting in each pay period or putting in regularly each month let's say in a Roth IRA\nDon't even Fred about any of this just remember that what happens today is pretty much irrelevant if you're ten or more years away from when you're going to need any of the money\nAnd you just keep going steady as you go as long as the money you're putting aside in a retirement plan is well diversified well diversified what that means in simple English\nIs that having money and a variety of stocks not your employer zone fact the percentage like view to having employers own stock in a four one K. is zero percent\nThat your money should be well spread out the easiest choice of investing bores you confuses you were intimidates

a Roth IRA again if the whole thing about how to pick and choose\nInvestments is not your thing\nGo into a target retirement fund because that is a simple way so you diversify your money across many different types of investments\nAnd your diversify overtime as long as you're doing those two things\nPutting money on regularly steadily\nPutting money on regularly steadily for years to come\nWhatever they report about the Dow up the Dow down the U.S and the the the U.S and the that the NASDAQ whatever if that's how we're going to do you find is not important as long as you were

thank you Pam you want to money saving tip for me I gather\nWell yes I'm a ... you hadn't I hadn't listen I listen to on my way home from work and you mentioned something about a jacket or how the new oil air that you put your knees instead of luggage essentially\nYeah so when I fly on one of the deep discounters which we have three in the United states spirit frontier in a legion\nCharge you know the way the business model works is they may sell you a ticket for twenty dollars one way but the baggage charge will be more than the costs of the ticket even for a carry on\nMhm so there are now a variety of sellers selling jackets clothing items that you can stuff with um clothes and them and you know or whatever electronics chargers whatever\nAnd nobody charges you for wearing a jacket so light or there's the biggest seller of the the one that's best known as Scotty vast as so\nSCOTT E. V. victory E. S. T. Scotty vast dot com\nAnd the cost of their items is really expensive\nBut I only buy from their outlet where they're getting rid of the things that were slow sellers\nAnd they sell vast jackets pants I'm a variety of clothing items that inside have all kinds of pockets you can stop in and I have a puffer jacket\nThat I bought from their outlet\nThat has nine pockets inside\nThat I can walk up a ton of stuff so um last flight on spirit I flew with the big puffy jacket and this micro carry on I have that I got a Costco that costs go sells for twenty nine dollars\nAnd so I had no baggage charge at all\nWow and all that work to to Europe and out of the internationally as well oh yeah All right\nYeah so ah people stopping step and clothing is something Europeans have done for as far back as I can remember 'cause there's a giant airline and Europe historically it's been one of the most profitable airlines in the world called Ryan air\nAnd Ryan air was the one that originally came up with the idea of charging people separately for everything and so Europeans have been way ahead of us on wearing clothing that you could just stuff everything in the pocket so you wouldn't have to pay baggage charges\nWell that's great well thank you very much and I'm going to check out the website and of course their outlet store\nYes or anywhere else you should buy other than the discount you can get cars Scotty best normal prices they are some serious prices and so the only way I Would ever buy one was something that had been a failed it was on the outlet\nI Am cheap sometimes aren't it Scott with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Scott\nClark thanks for taking my call how you doing today\nI'm doing great thank you hope you are\nSingle I'm getting a little rain here from the storm coming through\nOh I'm Sorry ... not too much\nTo show my question is I I own two duplex\nIn uh upstate New York and I have runners that turn over every couple of years or so I'm just not very frequently but my question is um who would you recommend a for to provide a service for doing background checks after ten shall renters\nWell I'm going to suggest a couple of sites that have grown up since the real estate buses so many people are lamb orange now owning from typically one to five properties and it's hard to know how to do the background checks how to collect out and all that and I lived on the Internet\nAnd there's a lot of available services out there that want to charge anywhere from you know Nineteen dollars to you know upwards of fifty dollars\nSure well let me tell you about several first cozy CEOs the why have you seen that one no cozy dot C. oh gosh when people use something of\nShe oh gosh when people use something other than dot com they get so confusing but it's not CEO and cozy is set up specifically with an entire suite of services for independent landlords their number one thing\nIs doing rent collection for people [noise] where the whole idea is that\nYour tenets pay electronically through their platform and if somebody had entered paid on time their system automatically nose to build them whatever late fee is in your face type of service charge they typically charge\nCut him a lot of the stuff they offer is free it's one of those premium business models like a lot of apps on a smartphone\nAnd they don't publish their priceless for the things that they charge for\nBut if you'll let them bother you from time to time was so stunning emails you put in your email address and they'll send you the priceless for the things they do charge for but you are allowed\nOn a background check you charge the tennis for that right and do so these services white\nCozy dot CEO and another one I'll mention that's owned by trends union\nCalled my smart move dot com they're set up these guys ethically\nFor you as part of your application which is perfectly legal on any big apartment operator would do it for you to have an application fee in that applications be\nCovers the cost of you running the background check ... what you'll find as you look through different sites if you want to find a list of a lot of them probably you could look at ... dot com which is kind of a clearinghouse of information for landlords\nBut the what they consider to be a background check varies from site to site\nLike some of them all they do basically is a simple credit check where others will do a more thorough background check see if somebody has been in trouble with the law and that kinda stuff [noise]\nSo what what level would you recommend as far as going how deep would you do a background check a potential to\nThat is impossible to answer and I think it depends on your experience as a landlord\nWhat areas have been traumatic for you with tenets that there have been any I mean it really\n... for a lot of lamb or it's the only real issue is ever been to somebody pay on time and in that case if that's been your historical pattern doing a traditional credit check is all you need to do\nOn the other hand if you've had problems with tenets of skip to maybe have done the illegal activities in one of your rental properties or anything like that then ... really based on that experience would want to do a much more involved background check the judgment of a criminal background check as well", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018",
