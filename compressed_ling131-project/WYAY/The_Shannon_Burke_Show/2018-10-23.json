think a propane [noise] Mm Mm\n[noise] we're talking about the uh my grants the caravan I'm\n... and ... we ... we we we've done this to ourselves because of our laws have been so lax we've just been known as a country that has no real well we have a super poor southern border with ... it's been that way for a long time for a long time how long have you been around but you've heard people bitch and moan about illegal immigration\nForever my entire life I've heard people complaining bitch about about about illegal immigration illegal immigration ...\nWow the cost we've done it forever ever and it's and it's the ball it's the bar that's handed to the ... we pass it on down to the next guy\nYou don't remember back in the day when you heard Clinton and\nAnd pick up pick a Democrat talk about the scourge of illegal immigration way to stop\nThe flow of out of what happened to that\nPoint I mean Republicans always had the same thing if the Democrats who have changed up in the last ... two decades or decade was the last decade or so to where they're not a scourge anymore but who we are we have to take care of these people\nI mean if that's not enough to convince you that it's a scam\nBut I don't know what it is 'cause why why a ... in the nineties during the Clinton was a a a administration when it was the scourge away they're taking our jobs in ... you know blah blah blah to now take our jobs is a joke it's it's a it's a it's\nA you know it's a punch line oh the ... what are you worried about the chicken jobs you know now about ... literally Clinton did say that in a state of union address that they're here they'll take our jobs ... was a scourge of law law now it's a joke\nWell now it's the jobs that Americans want to yeah yeah yeah ah\nNow they're sixteen thousand headed his way dirty barefoot disease written\nAnd what are these leading heart liberals really think it's going to happen and what are we going to build them a habitat for humanity house and then they're just going to get them welfare and food stamps and and I just live happily ever after\nI mean once they get here okay so like the last time I was kept out of yesterday saying oh you don't have any of the last caravan were actually granted asylum three which we don't even know the true or not but what are the other twenty seven hundred Ninety ... you know a Ninety go\nBig they learned the country the only three over here legally the rest are here illegally\nI mean it boggles my mind and okay so to think about well they come in the minute they step foot into the country they are a burden\nWhat are they going to go to the cousin Carl's house that just just immigrate no matter what the chairman damage at at my my my cousin Carlos Minnesota you go to places okay go ahead and later so here is a is Scott Scott go ahead\n[noise] and then a basically a sample every time I hear you know in the news that there's a influx of people from various countries that are you know for whatever reason I feel like they can't live there and I don't see how that's a solution to the problem in America had issues before yeah we thought out\nIs laid out your sibling or a better country now for\nIt didn't ever what would have to happen in America if it to make people like you and I ... this country\nRight but nothing there's nothing that would still make me flags and yeah we're going to fight and argue and you said over and and and work it out or you know get get the bad guy or whatever it is\nRight ... thanks got pretty good\nI mean this is\n... and it's not like we can't do anything about it we can\nSometimes I think it's just let's let's keep immigration on the table but so it gives us some kind of\nBS thing to fight about you know and and for far too long where all the same side and and Democrats realize there was a giant and juicy piece of red meat out there that we're that we're just we're agreeing with Republicans about we could turn to flip of the other way and we can fight like hell against them\nAnd that's exactly what's happened and they're cheap will follow yeah Democrats\nTurning their backs on the American people use the ... at least in terms of of immigration used a fight you know if we're on the same thing but at the same on the same side we both looked at mass illegal immigration as a scourge that's why we have laws in the first place\nNot anymore\nHere's Steve Steve go ahead\nHey I wanted to talk about the logistics of feeding giving water to Kevin supplies one estimate says that it's about seven thousand\nDollars per person yeah forty\nThousand people that's Ninety eight million dollars not including the semi trucks the gasoline or their truck and those people in from all over Mexico now there's a huge crowd waiting to me the big crowd that's already on the way\nThis thing somebody's funded this thing to the tune of about a hundred to a hundred and fifty million dollars and it's got Obama source written all over with\nBack from the DNC no doubt yeah and that's it it's all designed to create chaos\nUs and embarrassed to present and no matter how it goes down the border they're going to use it for political fodder against President Trump\nYeah but I I think in the long run it helps the GOP because if it proves it proved Trump's point we desperately need\nNew immigration laws and we desperately need a wall let's see if we had a well I wouldn't do Iraq sixteen thousand people were coming in on the other side of the wall that's right ... to be on your side of the wall care about their you know fill your paperwork maybe go ahead\nWell let me go deal with\nBut yeah thank you let me ask you deal with them and then we just put you know a pattern of applications out there in a in a in a cup full of pets [laughter]\n\nThat's what you how how do we get to do with America uh fill out this application there's a pen please return it a ... give 'em a clipboard\nMexico should be the waiting room for America

your dog about their hair is a real blame everybody\nWas going to lay out a whole different take on this care of and there's a lot of stuff happening all watching ... impact I call it Spanish will hit because it's fun\n[laughter] so they're in it they're interviewing people that are marching in the care they okay yeah there is an adjunct caters\nOr what they call at this low people in the care that talking bad about a truck says it's your way to kill it killers ah America doesn't ... firing\nAnd who you know yeah I Love mine channel uh I don't think that the mayor I mean I think the Mexican\nGovernment is funding because they know the people that are marching keep saying how like the Mexican people are kidding they're feeding in there and give a little clothes shoes and all that other kind of stuff yeah I Believe the cartel\nThat we all know the art of Mexico's double it's in their best interest to head this controversy because we all know that they don't get the ... they're allowing people of low and the care of their walkers to agitate them and make this\nA a march of ... versus you know they don't have to admit that define job right the Mexican government did offer some of the jobs that you've got people marching at the water bottle border waiting to fill out paperwork for\nYou know the odds are if it's the ... when the uh [noise] uh the governor the governor's

water Brian happy you know equal number of Americans go hold hands on hormones\nChange [laughter] I mean you got it right now to get out and yeah\nYeah I don't know if you don't like Trump who knows I still\nYeah you know you go to the point is that your bank I don't drink the baggage here Brigitte\n\n... even if you said if you don't like Trump ... for ... here's Rick\nRick how are you\nAre are you doing surveys I Want a call about the care they just sort of a well first of our most I think uh hey if I went to the United states to realize none of us are really through America who all brought

think [laughter] mine's yeah I mean unbelievable like like some now so poor inner city kids will get fifty thousand dollar account so when they turn adult they can use that to buy a house or or\nI mean this it sounds to me if it's could you use also for college tuition and you'd get it at an age Eighteen\nHe said it will be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty we can rapidly bring security into those families and that is really exciting to me\n[noise] wow\nThat's that that is absurd might sound like a middle class family wouldn't no no so middle class I mean I I I I was middle class I couldn't afford to pay\nThem a lower middle class there's no way I could I just know could afford a down payment on a house when I got one to turn Eighteen years old\nCola only super super bearing Trump's they're going to be able to do that right you know what I mean right\nYou have to have an ... an ... an intern\nI didn't give my daughter fifty thousand dollars when she got out of a high school\nNo that's the key thing I've ever heard man\nSo now the new some here here's this is what this is what the Democrats are running on\nA A N twenty twenty right if this this one they give big pork is fifty grand with a get out of high school so that I have some money\nWhich you know most of them just go by of all we can go to the strip clubs and coke north some coke a or a car you know\nSo you have that from Booker then you've got Bernie Sanders Medicare for all of 'em are ... Harris has the cash assistance plan on giving away money that's ... that's the only thing they think up give money away give it away\n\nGod I'm not just some guy really he's really serious about it we'll give each kid fifty\nThousand dollars\nEvery child born in the United states would start to have a savings account with a thousand each year until the child turns Eighteen the government will deposit as much as two thousand into that account the size of the annual payments would depend on the child's family income with Laura ... families receiving Laurie competitors getting larger checks\n[noise] so the poorer you are the more money to government I eat us is going to put in your ... kids a bank account they counsel be off limits to the child until they turn Eighteen at which point the child can use it for specific asset building purchases like down payment on a home or college tuition\nBooker hasn't come up with a full list of eligible purchases yet he's probably going to have ... to it\nNinety nine point nine percent at Eighteen year olds cannot manage fifty thousand dollars twenty out\nThey estimate that ... that the child there remains a bill in the lowest income bracket ... of the program a would accrue forty six thousand two hundred and Fifteen dollars by the Eighteenth birthday\n\nUnbelievable on the ... and and and and of course we we\nAre you able to say that you have forty six thousand dollars ...\nI I'm a middle class guy I couldn't write a check to my daughter for forty six thousand dollars when she got graduate high school of course not as firm ...\nChild the highest income bracket to the program about five hundred percent of the poverty line would end up with one thousand six hundred eighty one dollars just the original thousand dollar payment I'm a grown\nWith interest over the over the Seventeen years [noise] so if you're rich you only going to have sixteen hundred dollars because you're rich you rich from parents probably going to give you a million dollars\nWhat's considered ...\nUm poverty out it was because I don't know um\nThey say they are they protect [noise] obviously the benefits of the program would go largely the minority children the average black child would accrue thirty grand in their account the average Latino twenty seven thousand the average white child would end up with about Fifteen thousand seven hundred Ninety\nIts its reparations to say yeah why why is it that it can be expected just go\nOut there and earn a living I thought about the same Iraqi why can't that the American dream be that you pull yourself out of that that you left and right yeah ... and this is\nThe American dream is you know you want to be as poor as possible as long as possible through your childhood so you'll get a fat
