opinion my candles at the top ten am alive he's awesome\nYeah absolutely I I Would agree I don't know that I Would put and Lindsay Buckingham at the top ten\nWell it would you do is good that they are saying brought that up because I tell you you're talking about a ... um but she was hurt for where to Lindsey 'cause I Love new they date it varies some also is relationship over Twenty years that I never got married I had kids but\nAnyway that goes back to the early sixties and when they lost their guitars named Bob well they were looking for right guitars and they'd heard Lindsay Buckingham that club in LA and they posted it and said hey we need a great guitarists would you be interested in joining Fleetwood Mac\nHe was dating a steamy at the time he said yeah I'll do it but\nOne yeah yeah you got to have a girlfriend yeah your heart rate and I think that's right she writes very well and the rest is history and the rest is saying is that they appreciate that\nI think a lot of ... still as you could still have ... here's the deal here's the power she has is it you could still have\n... uh Fleetwood Mac without\nBuckingham but you can't have Fleetwood Mac without Stevie Nicks
