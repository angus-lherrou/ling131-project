things the basic definition is that a reasonable person under circumstances would feel that they are not free to leave\nThen your interests have to be read to you\nAnd I will tell you right now that that definition will not protect you all the time depending upon the fact that circumstance okay because for example the police can detain you\nAnd and put that tell you to sit somewhere simply for

the show but\nUh you know again a damn there's something for everybody out there and uh\nUh what do you you know you've had your kids out there what do you think makes fright fest so inviting well within the last such mass appeal I actually did not go with that last year but they were super excited about it and then they're young right they're little so this isn't just for teenagers in adults\nRight there there are three and five and I can tell you my five year old he literally plays with Halloween decorations out out of it is the greatest thing in the world for him when he sees scary stuff he absolutely loves it and\nThey really are just talking about is talking about is of course it's it's good for me and my wife to hold it over their heads little bits of the behavior is a little better in the end we tell them we're going to take it away they\nThey'd all be ... but I can tell you the is that the decorations everything that goes with it it's got to be just a real tradition because I'm you know I hear about it every year about ... and I'm looking forward to finally going this year\nThing people may not know is right that started a Six Flags over Georgia back in Nineteen eighty eight and so we're celebrating Thirty years of ... and her when you know it's a tremendous holiday what else can you dress up\nAnything you want get candy for it and no one black guy right so how is it is definitely a hell of a special place in our hearts ... over Georgia because again we you know left during thrills left to bring the fun out and we get really creative they see our entertainment department has gone above and beyond to you know really get down\nIn deep into the details some of which will share throughout the program a symptom things to look out for a while you're there\nWhere everybody loves the rides when they stick a Six Flags were there were no matter what season it is tell us about the rides people who have not been out there I mean you there's no ... no place as better rises Six Flags\nYou write Six Flags over Georgia is the thrill capital of the south and we really take that seriously up for all all new for twenty Eighteen is twisted side clown which is our brand new coaster it's wood and still rather than to renew ride he'll be\nBut out there before you need to get on the ...\nUsed to be George aside clown which was you know obviously a ... a favorite at the park and we revamped it it is now a hybrid which is a a wooden coaster with the steel tracks what's really smooth\nIt's got you know Ken airtime moments you go up about a hundred feet in the air drops you had a Seventy five degree angle you flip not once not twice\nBut three times in my favorite part is when there's a a wave wall what she literally makes you feel like you're going out of your seat so you got to hang on the cool thing about ride that Six Flags over Georgia during that says we turn up a light so now you're doing all of that\nAt night completely in the dark and it is an amazing experience of course you've got Goliath everyone loved that one our oldest coaster Delano mind train's been there since Nineteen sixty seven they've got a lot of your old ones and new favorites um and it's it's a really cool time and you mentioned having young kids\nThrills by day of the great opportunity to come out and ride them rides for the little ones we've got D.C super friends and Bugs Bunny boom town which we turn into Bugs Bunny spooky town which is ... uh for the kids during the day to well\nThat was going to be my next question them actually get a section correct me if I'm wrong for the little ... little people right\nYes we have a whole section dedicated for right that's where smaller up bands of coasters um and we I still do a costume contests where kids twelve and under can wear their costumes participate in the costume contest ... which is always nice oh no we don't want to get too many of us ...\nBring 'em to the park will decorate them pumpkins what then they can do a trick or treating through those areas they ride the train so there's plenty of things for the younger folks to do to a but just remember after six we turn out the lights on the rides and it gets a little scary\nRight All right so is it then it's not just does not just exciting and scary but it's also a lot of good wholesome fun for\nThe little people well yeah when we go out there is nice to you know sometimes you gotta worry about the measurements right you can't get on certain ride but it's nice to take the the little ones like my kids' age\nAnd they still have plenty rides Dryden and plenty of things to do and that things like carbon the pumpkins things like that it feels like you always have something like that going on throughout the year\nYeah we do we we carry that same theme all the way through the end of the year for holiday in the park to um Six Flags you know builds family memories and traditions and so we like to carry that carry that all the way through the through the year it's a great place to come make those memories\nYeah yeah yeah it's great well you know um there are plenty of games that challenge of skills ah to ride and win prizes tossed talk those talk to us about the games that I Know everybody wants to win a stuffed animal or some little souvenir uh\nYeah so you have that real carnival field which is always great darned fall for it you know the rest of all the all of it and what we've done over and Goliath games which is one of our largest areas to play some of those skill games on these transformed it we have a new a maze called alien abduction on and we'll talk about that a little bit but\nWe carry that theme out through the live games and now we've got a game where you can play with the kids can stick their hands and slime and try to pull out an eyeball and depending on what color it is\nThey get a price for that I bond so that's just one of the games that we have for you know ... that um but of course you've got your traditional ah you know dark games and basketball games and all that kind of stuff to to test your luck\nHow creative and and the games can be a little for little children are teenagers in adults\nThey asked that we had a levels a skill that you absolutely absolutely and you can always watch dad you know spend all this money trying to knock down different balls and bats and all sorts of things too so it's really fun\nJust like a carnival you know you get the carnival to Jim not just the I Know but it's a great ride that you get sick so I usually\nGo around the line waiting for a ride you know you could have so many different things are going on there and and and and I love all the games and skills you know I remember when I was I\nWas a young man are always dated some girl who wanted to tell you better or some kind of big stuffed animal rights and she always let ... [laughter] you see the restaurant again to the basketball [laughter] oh my goodness there but\nYou know what what are they knew I was I was just from being there or do we get a season pass every year for the kids and you've got some some offers out there to where you can kind of get the all you can easy like where every time you come you're getting a certain amount of food certain amount of drink bring your cut back maybe talk a little bit about that\nYeah so memberships in season passes are really great way to enjoy everything that we have to offer\nOne of the questions that we get a lot is which one membership or season pass which one is best for me so here's a couple of things to think about um if you like earning that free food and merchandise and unique experiences and stuff like that maybe think about a membership um versus\nIf you just care about it mission and trying to get into the park that day and you don't really care about extra discounts and benefits then go for a season pass\nI'd hate to interrupt you but we're up against the brake ladies and gentleman you're listening to process that Six Flags over\nGeorgia on the on the show we'll be right

and that's so important nowadays with the family don't you agree then\nYes I I I Believe it is I think also you used to think of this is just the summertime when the kids were out of school right somewhere to take them but this is a year round thing now so um it's not just for summer anymore it's not just for summer school no schools out\nYeah so we start in the early spring um in March with grant nights we invite all of our graduates for the end of the year to come in and celebrate that incredible achievement and we go into the summer the summer to schedule votes um and then we take that into fourth of July for our fourth fast but we do like all American food festival\nThen we transform the park again for ... fast which is headed towards Halloween and fall and then in November we transform over the holiday and the part and it goes all the way through January stakes\nNow what about um if I remember correctly there in the parking is great you have an RV area if somebody has like an RV or a camper whatever there's a special place for that yet we even have a picnic area right just right there in the parking lot or a section talk to us about if you want to bring your own picnicking kind of do like it almost that tailgating sits\nYou absolutely can so we have some picnic table set up a around some of the areas outside of our parking for families who want to enjoy that are just you know there are a lot of time there there could be dietary concerns and other reasons why you may want to have your food outside of the park\nAnd so we try to accommodate that as well and because obviously there's no food or drink to be brought inside except for water inside the park um but you know there are options for you if you want to try to do that too so we we try to make it very affordable for you but for some families who just want to have a picnic with you know with grandma fried chicken you can do that it\nIs a well we're up against the bread began but we're here with the vena from fry fast Six Flags over Georgia and you got to get out there are folks and we're going to hear more with just halfway through the show there's a lot more to hear about this said don't go

it has more of a\nUm a a different tone but it's a comedy show it's it's really funny um and this year for twenty eight team we've got the matrix unleashed and and this show is a band of female demons that try to lure you in and they danced with ... cent change to some you know ...\nChopping hit send and you know it you know hopefully you can make it out of that one alive because that one is definitely a\n... if it puts the hair on the back of your neck starts to stand up and then we'd have the uprising which kicks off everything for ... that\nEvery year sorry every night and that one starts at six o'clock and that's how you know when the park is changing from thrills by day and to thrilled by night with the uprising where they do a little show and then all of the scare actors\nCome out and then and they stay out until the end of the night\nOr these shows that you just measures this uh on one basis or this every night of these shows are going on during practice\nEvery night that we have ... that we have these shows available you know it takes about two hundred and fifty scare actors and dancers and performers to pull off writes every night and our entertainment team worked really hard to make sure that we hit those marks and they're doing make up for every single one of those actors every single night a fright fast and it's really incredible to watch\nWell you know one thing I Want to emphasize this isn't a bunch of people they just are off the streets it never acted before I've known some people that worked out there and these are actors this is professional makeup ... doesn't get any better if you're in Hollywood Rice's has done like top notch\nYeah well it it is a very skilled\nPerformance that they do I mean the whole thing is very choreographed throughout the night to get these guys out into the park we use high tech air brush equipment to really create some cool techniques on the skin that we have everything from aliens to zombies to you know something we call the riders which are demons and\nDevils and witches and you know it it's it's amazing to see I actually was one ad I said you know how can I be out talking about this unless I actually become one of the few weeks ago they created a and turned me into a witch doctor for our by you burial grounds scare us zone and I had an amazing time here and all the gas\n'em and you know it was it was really cool to watch you know we we started out with a fresh foundation and they started to apply that I didn't even recognize myself after we were done but it was really really fun\nAnd it's not just the shows these actors and these costumes and all the makeup mirror wandering through the park and you're going to walk through the park and when you least expect it what happens they\nPop out they hop out of everywhere we've got seemed scare zones situated threw out the park or in some of our high traffic area is\nSo unfortunately you can't get to one side of the park without walking through one of these scare zones um but the thing is none of our scare actors can touch you so you know the most that will happen is you'll just be really really scared which is which is our plans to try to scare the pants off if\nIt and what about the haunted houses that job so\nCheck it all out on Instagram Facebook in their websites are single gun dot com bust and bill gun fifty

financial and man where were you able to help them with that how about a surprisingly simple strategy that can help you save thousands of dollars in taxes when the market does drop\nYeah when you want to know that it's pretty opportunistic and then why attempting to time the market is a fool's errand but what do you do instead do you just sit and hope for the best or do you make some logical moves\nBut that's not the same thing as time in the market\nWow got a lot to talk about in this show today and hopefully you scratch your own head hopefully you said you know what I Need to call woody at ... for three four ... five five three five if you already our client\nGreat you are positioned at Rollins to deal with these types of things they did that for you do not panic in fact I think you're going to see some good results if you do or talk to your own advisor now the first\nOne of the strategies that I'm going to talk about right this word down but I Am going to dwell on it I think this number one is going to take at least half of the show and it's a simple word that you've heard a million times and it's called diversify diversify now\nHere's the thing I really felt like I needed to define what that means to us what we do how do we deal with diversification because\nI've heard it my entire career more than Thirty years now is how important that is and yet no one's really sat down and explained in detail what do you do as a professional advisor to make sure somebody is properly diversified I have a lot to cover just on that I'm going to dive right and listen\nAsset allocation diversification it is it is one of if not the most important critical pillar of retirement planning now you've got to have this diversified portfolio mirror your risk\nFor your appetite for risk you have to because if we just go out and do whatever we think is best\nYou may not be able to handle it ever seen that movie you can't handle the truth\nAnd that's okay we've got to factor that end because what we can't have happened is people panic\nAnd pull the plug at the exact wrong time even when we know their position to be able to weather the storm your emotions may get the best to you cannot let that happen\nRight we got to make sure that you will most elite can deal with these types of volatility and downturn that will always come in the market\nIt's really important especially when you are right now in the midst of the longest bull marketing history and\nEspecially if you just entered retirement\nNow it's a troubled spot I told you it's almost the trouble spot with every new client we meet with and they're typically taking on\nMuch more risk than they know because of their stuff is all over the place it's in different accounts it can different fun to to a different bar managers it with different investment managers\nAnd that's just not the time to have that going on you got a real it and get it organized so that we can deal with diversification properly I have a lot more on that\nI have a lot more on that but here's what I'm going to offer you I'm going to continue with this are so much on just this one point I Want you to really listen today [noise]\nIf there's just one single take away out but I Want everybody to take away from today show one thing\nThat's it that's all you got to do is take this one thing away is that you need to rebalance your investments and given the state of the markets right now you could not do that soon enough\nOkay if you leave today show with just that one thing I'm going to applaud myself I Will be happy\nNow it is not something you put off for thirty or sixty days no way if something you need to do I'm telling you right now because the people who do put this off\nOr the people

about four hundred dollars a month and that's before taxes discover proven and successful strategies to generate more income in retirement called the CPA wealth advisors for retirement income analysis and now back to ... on the CPA wealth advisors show\n\nBrea\nWhat do you hear about on new talk when I was six seven is the CPA wealth advisors radio show proudly\nProudly longest running financial show now here on new talk when I was six seven been doing this quite a while I think I'm over five years because of you thank you so much for that\nForget about timing the market Chinatown in the market is an absolute fool was there and even the pros and they spent a lifetime at this as investors are traders they don't know what's next for the market it can only get you into trouble\nInstead have a comprehensive financial game plan and then do yourself a favor and stick to it don't panic\nThese include many things many many things so I wrote down what that means what does it mean that this financial comprehensive game plan because we see some from some rather large wants one in particular here in the Atlanta area it's been here a while\nThey don't do this for their clients I'm shocked we asked their class last year ... the financial game plan and man they just ignore some little lay up stuff\nSome lab stuff or their clients like when a convert to a raw or they're loading them up in these royalty trusting closed and bond funds just garbage here's what I mean you got to have a plan to maximize your Social Security benefits\nYou've got to be able to generate income in retirement you've got to reduce your taxes\nHow to stay one step ahead of inflation yeah have to have a strategy to withdraw money from your IRAs and you're for one cage and your other retirement accounts you still have to have an estate plan\nYou have to reduce your fees and expenses and you have to have a plan for the sky rocketing cost\nOf health care and long term care instead of trying to time the market look for buying opportunities you know what throughout history markets always have come back and that's my message they never\nThis year oh when the markets go low it may be a good time to buy a crisis means one thing stocks are cheap so it's a great opportunity stay the course and possibly buy more\nRemember that remember that as you're getting nervous throughout this turmoil okay it's gonna be okay but if you had a plan then you can weather the storm now here's the next big one used tax last harvesting to your advantage\nLet me give you an example it happened this week I Know if she does the same from Rollins financial he will absolutely ah remember this\nHad a listener come in with his wife they've been listening for a long time and I never know what the one trigger ward is that's going to make somebody called me I never know what it is [noise] but\nAnyways I hit that trigger word obviously because they came in now\nWhat we saw is that he had recently lowered his four one K. contributions\nI think he got it down to where he was only putting in one or two percent of their salary and it was just enough to make sure that he took advantage of the company match and that's okay but we said why are you not putting in more\nWell he said I just I I'm worried at the end of each month and I'm not going to have enough money to live\nBut then and these are the differences this is what other firms don't do Joe combed through his tax return and noticed that he had a very lost a six figure loss carry over I capital last carry over and then he had another stuck\nWhere we had a lot of his money in one stock so of course Joe said look first of all we've got to get your diversified especially with all this volatility guy said yeah but if I sell a lot of that one stock I'm going to have a loss to know you will\nIn fact we can sell up to six figures on this stock we can offset six figures worth of gain listen to what it does number wanted diversified as you number two you just freed up a ton of cash\nNow you can live off of that cash and increase your four one K. contributions to the absolute maximum do the remainder of the year [noise]\nYou'll have plenty of cash so won't impact you financially 'cause we just free it up that cash we freed up tax free now it may seem obvious to see but it be honest with yourself like do you look for those things within your own portfolio\nHe said wow this other very large investment management firm that they are with they never told me that they just ignored it but that's the kind of stuff that our CPA wealth advisors look for it was a beautiful opportunity they are going to become a client and\nThink of the benefit that he's going to get now by increasing those four one K. contributions to see tax law harvesting is a perfect opportunity right now right because we know it's going to be one of the big expenses in retirement [noise]\nNow if you do have a plan for your retirement great you're being proactive if you don't have a plan and then see that's reactive you really winging it and that is exactly the way to get yourself into trouble you got to have a plan that's where we got to start\nSaving for retirement that's really the starting point what you do with the money is what's going to matter\nAnd if you think that having a financial game plan is just for the super rich you are absolutely wrong nobody zero no what is exempt from a market downturn and in fact I Would argue that it's even more important to have a plan\nIf you don't have millions and millions of dollars because every single dollar must count [noise]\nHow about this talk about on point Forbes says quote investors you take the time to create a financial plan tend to make more informed investment decisions because their decisions are aligned with their objectives\nListen to that again their decisions are lined with their objectives in this way they don't just wing it and get hurt when the market falls and I also don't panic that's so important [noise]\nI mean as your financial advisor or they truly creating value\nAnd are you having conversations with your financial advisor\nThat is a lot more than just about investing so what should you be talking about well how about taxes\nThe German financial advisor bring you in on one of the meetings and talk specifically about your taxes like they opened up your tax return and they wrote down specific tax planning ideas for you how about your Social Security\nWhat did they do have they changed it\nHow they come up with their strategy regarding your Social Security generating income dealing with health care\nMedical care risk inflation required minimum distributions are coming up what have they done about that and so on if you're advisor is not building value you know what\nYou're going to pay for it\nAnd you owe it to yourself to get a second opinion do you get in a second opinion it's going to just help us can help your family and there's no downside risk\nYou're either gonna confirmed that great I Love my financial advisor woody I got a second opinion and you know what they've been doing everything you said or\nIt so literally going to open your eyes and you're going to say wow I cannot believe they never told me these things now\n[noise] also if you're not having regular meetings with your financial advisor and consistently rebalancing your portfolio then you should be searching for somebody who was going to do that for you [noise]\nComplacency is absolute enemy and retirement you got to make decisions and be constantly updating your plan you need to learn\nAnd grow\nFrom these meetings every single time you have one and that includes getting ... rational advice\nAnd isn't it great that we offer that professional advice for free if you didn't want to hire an adviser you just want her to go somewhere and get an opinion then never go see him again okay I'm giving you that opportunity\nThe more the story is this putting together a strong financial plan and make sure you're getting the right advice is critical and it's especially apparent right now when you're having to stomach\nPains up these Paul backs these Paul backs [noise]\nHere are some who resources that you can look up for but you can Google this Forbes Google five things to look for when picking a financial advisor I'm so proud of it because I read those things and I'm like yeah\nOur CPA wealth advisors meet those characteristics or Forbes again you can Google this top ten things to look for in a financial advisor I'm not going to read them all but\nYou know there's some really really important things in there\nAnd um [noise]\nI Want you to take a look at those because frankly it only bodes well for us because I've told you over and over for over five years now it is much more than them simply being able to pick investments for you if it was just for picking investments I tell you that you could do that yourself\nYou don't need a financial advisor is way way more than that way more than that now [noise]\nI've also talk to you about this I talk to you about\nPraising you\nBecause most of us have done a good job with this saving and investing for retirement and that that also is just to start though it's just a start because now I said you ask yourself what do I do right now because it's ... it is it's what you do what the money that really matters\nHow you ensure you get the most out of your Social Security benefits\nHow are you going to reduce your taxes in retirement\nHow are you going to generate income which out dumping your money into bonds or closed down ... don't go into royalty trust and master limited partnership like this one other big advisor firms seems to be dumping all of their clients and do they are getting killed\nAnd then how do you navigate required minimum distributions with your IRAs and you're for one case and your other retirement accounts because that's gonna make you pull your money out even when you don't want to you know what\nI what I really do sincerely want your money to go further in retirement I Do it it's like my ... I think that's what kept me going on this show for so long people here that sincerity so we for years\nHave talked about our five step retirement action plan love the word action we put things into action\nIn about an hour you're going to learn how you can potentially save thousands of dollars in taxes in retirement do I sound like a broken record does it sound like I think taxes are so important to deal with in retirement you back [noise]\nHow about how to bring every single nickel out of your Social Security benefits if I sound like a broken record on that you bet I am we have to maximize that\nHow other people are successfully generating income in retirement today the key on that has successfully generating income not depleting your assets while generating your income\nAnd there's just so much more there really is and I don't know what we're going to do for you\nI just know that every time I sit in a meeting I look at Rollins I look at Joe Rawlins an Eddie and Robbie and Matthew whoever's in the meeting with us and I smile because we always come up with ideas and other just\nDidn't come up with [noise]\nCome on in and see a schedule your appointment by calling us at four zero for\nThree or four oh one five five three five no costs no obligation we do not have any products to sell if you are the kind of person who needs to make the most out of every dollar you save for retirement I Am\nCall us right now at four zero for three four one five five three five again for zero for three four one\nFive five three five it's forty next Saturday and Sunday I already can't wait to be here at ten am right here on new top one I was six seven on the CPA wealth advisors radio show thank you so much everybody [noise]\n\nThis program was paid for by CPA wealth advisors Elsie\nThe preceding was paid program and does not necessarily represent their views on opinions of talk when I'm sick sibling or cumulus media\nOn the next chilly winter show here's\nMy thought on Halloween costumes and black face if you're a white guy or a white woman or you want to play a black character feel free press a few offensive to whatever you want is hollow people dress up as ... no one says they're really ...\nSays the black guy with the kiss me on my research is feeling any one's culture\nShelley winter morning six to nine on the new one in six siblings Linda combs to talk of the\nRepublican Party Democratic Party how about some party favors gates the new ... an election party and big jak syndicator like Haiti\nDot com white wine\nAnd jailed in the record books I'm Christopher cruise a man said to be ... with President Trump is in jail in Miami this morning charge with mailing pipe bombs to prominent Democrats fifty six year old Cesar ... was arrested yesterday he has a long arrest record it has been described as troubled correspondent Jo Jones in Miami this morning the\nPicture that is emerging as a man who harbor some very dark thoughts particularly about minorities and others in this country particularly on the left and now authorities are trying to find out if the fourteen bombs they know of or the end of it\nYou're not just another potential client you're not just another prospect you're not another number\nI cringe when I think about you know some of the banks and some of the big wire houses the big companies out here it 'cause it's you know sometimes you feel like I'm more secure if I'm dealing with a big company versus a smaller company and the big companies sometimes I feel like you're just another number\nOr maybe your situation is is that they've they've pond you off on your advisor that you told your story too is gone now there's another advisor there was another broker then you're you're on your ...\nYour fourth your fist broker and there you are telling your story all over again I mean I'm One thing I'm really proud of is how many years are folks have been here are visors had been with me and we're a family company\nSo during that twenty plus years of doing this Ron I've come across a lot of families that divorce has happened sure you know some before they met me\nAnd some while they were my client\nWe were invested with them emotionally\nYou know I hate to see that happen I really do you never want to see that and I understand sometimes it's inevitable you never want to see it though but when it happens you got to know that financially you're going to be in good shape\nAnd one thing we do and we put our plans together is you know we're always talking about the what ifs and sometimes when we talk about that the what is our we need you know we need healthcare we weren't expecting we have to pay for that the what it might be death you know the death of a spouse then\nAgain the what is maybe a divorce we've seen it we've helped our clients through it financially and emotionally we don't like to see it but at the end of the day as part of life\nWhile you know you're dealing with a lot of folks who are having divorce issues or perhaps they did in the past and perhaps are about to go through it but also there are lots of folks out there who are having career difficulties and that's tough to\nAbsolutely and it seems that you know more and more and more big companies or or even to this day as great as the economy isn't as low as unemployment is we're still seeing that senior management upper management people that have got twenty twenty five thirty years' experience\nYou're seeing companies still trying to cut their make cuts you\nAnd they're trim in those positions and in some cases they're offering early retirement I to be honest with you you know Frank with you\nSome of my clients have opted for early retirement they're like whoa this is too good to be true I'm I'm In the retirement red zone anyway and if I can get somebody to pay my salary for a year or two I'm all over that and then I'll take advantage of that\nIt's almost like companies are still trying to trim where they're getting rid of long time employees just to hire new people at a lower lower wage that makes sense around if they see that where you're at it as well yeah absolutely it has to do you know we see that here\nSo again we have to factor that into our financial roadmap our retirement plan\nYou know we might have a target date that we were hoping to retire but that may get adjusted so what's good is that you know when that happens like I had one of my clients that come in a couple of weeks ago\nI tried to get a hold of her and she wouldn't you know she wasn't answering calls I'm like\nCitizens sound like her wonder why I haven't gotten a call back\nThen finally I got a call back one day and she says I haven't been emotionally ready to talk to you and she explained that she'd been dealing with some health issues and she says I just did not want to talk to anybody right now I said hey I get it I get it but\nThen she went on to say since I've seen her last that she had to had a job change right well I had all of her financial information already said than our financial road map\nAnd we just we just plugged in the new salary it didn't affect the over all plan very much when you have to hardly tweak anything so there was some peace of mind there\nAnd the good news was is that the but she was dealing with with their health that has subsided and she's got some good news there so it's almost like okay we're back on track again but I Love no and that's all that work we did years ago\nThat's why we did it so that when these situations happen it wasn't going to be you know financial threatening or in her situation\nThere are some other in some situations where it becomes necessary to offer a little financial therapy and and you're so good at that one of the person who comes in and money distresses them out all together and they don't even like talking about money or making any kind of financial decisions what kind of therapy can you offer that person\nSo again everyone's situation is different and every person handles talking about money differently as well so I have some folks who love the educational process\nWhere we go through on our white board here at the office so you know and every conference room has one where we sit down and we kinda right out\nWhat we do for you I mean you walk out of there and you know not even just knowing what we do but we explain it very easily very thoroughly where anyone can understand\nIf you're a fifth grader you can understand what we're going to say I mean that's kind of member that show are you smarter than a fifth graders yeah we kind of set are set this up when you know my whole team has been you know educated and taught how to communicate in a way where if you're a fifth grader or older you're you're going to understand this\nBut some folks just don't want to know all that sounds fine\nThey trust us and I prefer to to be that person who explains everything in detail but for folks who say mark up several clients to say I don't want you to get into the weeds\nJust tell me what you know what my situation is and how would you would fix it almost like a doctor instead of explaining everything this is what you need to do and some people want that and that's okay if that's you don't get overwhelmed\nBy coming in here and think you have to have a finance degree because you don't we will keep it simple and we'll go as detailed as you want us to\nOkay Dr Mark just fix it you know there has to be able to say that you know you've touched on this a moment ago you touched on medical issues maybe someone has received a troubling diagnosis and under that it's hard to deal with and and you can help there to\nAbsolutely because one thing we do know is that when it comes to health care it's only as good as the insurance we have so if we have to tap into the money\nOr again we know we have some extra bills coming down the road we gotta make sure there's enough in the buckets of money to pay for that\nSo when we put together a plan you know we always talk about covering are basis and by the way anybody who calls into day you're going to have an opportunity for a complementary you know book are new book that just came out\nHow to compose your own financial symphony and we talk about the five bases that you need to have covered before you even think about retirement so if you're already retired you got to have these bases covered and it's not too late to cover them if you haven't already done it if you're contemplating retirement or you know retirement is not that far away\nYou know you want to get this book because this books going to explain the things you've got to be thinking about before you retire and one of those five major concerns is health care\nWe know that Medicare does a great job when we retire and more we turn sixty five for hospitalization for doctors coverages and if you have\nA supplement to go along with that your co payments are paid for Medicare part D does a great job on prescription drugs but it does nothing for a long term care basically a hundred days of skilled nursing care I mean you are on your own when it comes to long term care\nSo we gotta make sure there's enough money here till fun that with and and if there's not how can we leverage the money again to get the maximum amount of income\nTo be able to pay for that care or what other alternatives around here to pay for it because if we're put our head in the sand and we don't think about that\nWe could come back and bite us and it could devastate our retirement and if we're married we could be leaving our spouse and the poor house so we have to make sure that you know medical problems are covered financially and emotionally because an emotional time as well\nA couple of other quick scenarios here first of all maybe someone's kids are frustrating them with their life decisions and and maybe the worst one of all and I know this is tough to deal with shortly after losing a spouse those are really tough situations too I think\nReally is you know every child is different you know everybody who knows me knows I raised five children six grandkids five children they're all different\nI look back on I wouldn't change any of it for the world but uh every one of them are different and the thing about it is you know what might be a you know devastating for one child might be like water offered up back on another child I mean it's the way it is it's right but you know you you're in\nThat in your children I get it and sometimes we have to make sure that financially we don't overdo it you know I talk about in my book about the story of one mother who just started buying everything in the world for her daughter\nAnd she was she was going through her retirement and I had to have a heart to heart weather and told her I said at this pace at this rate you won't make it you will run out of money\nAnd you know she ended up passing away with very little left\nAnd it was almost like you know I look back on I'm like\nYou know the God take her at that time because she was running out of money you know you it makes you wonder because she was just no enabling her children you know I look back on it I just think of that story all the time I mean I'll I'll go to my grave thinking of that story\nThat's because they take the design just the right new records\n... my needs plan ... years together used to take some time to make sure if her for a plan for\nHow when your financial nice to mark ... serving the Atlanta area ... eight hundred seven

house produce more male when listening to relaxing music that's according to a study conducted in England in two thousand one and recorded by the BBC did you also know that people achieve a higher level of financial satisfaction while listening to the financial ...\nNever reported by the BBC primarily because we made it out and I keep listening anyway\nWelcome back to the financial symphony well the one and only mark ... he's been doing this for nearly three decades helping folks with their planning for retirement and doing it the right way\nAnd we appreciate you're listening to the show today if you're a regular listener to the show you know the show was all about\nAll about planning for retirement particularly if you are in the red zone as the years leading up to your retirement you want to make sure you do it right maybe you're already retired maybe you need a little tweaking with your plan or maybe you don't have a plan to do you've certainly come to the right place in either case\nEight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight is your number to call eight\nHundred seven for nine four to eight eight well you got to do is leave a message with your name and your contact information member Lloyd group will get back with you and then you can come in and have a conversation to assess where you are it is eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nMark Lloyd dispense is a lot of information on the show a lot of wisdom our colleague Dr marks wisdom but there's such a thing as grandma's financial\nWe all you can't beat that now grandma's financial wisdom you can't beat\nThat we sort of you know all of us grew up with that kind of thing you know you learn from your elders even if she wasn't actually talking about money grandma settled smart things that we all realize as adults now that we can apply to financial planning\nSo let's take some of these classic grandma's sayings and see how they relate to our financial lives\nYou're reading mark yeah that'd be fun just jump into this now I've heard my grandmother say a hundred times and God rest his soul she's been gone a very long time but she used to say all the time when it rains it pours and she'd say that about just about every kind of situation\nSo are you like me do you find yourself saying that now yes now slated to my kids are migrating [laughter] exactly it's good or set up you know and so here's what she hears what grandma was saying good news usually comes in waves\nBut also bad news as well yeah and you know and then the marketing you know be booming like it was an twenty Seventeen with a very very little volatility\nAnd then we see here in twenty Eighteen where it's been more like a roller coaster and the thing about it is what drives a lot of this you know we're part of it and we're in the media but what drives a lot of this is the information age\nYou know we've got this thing in our hands called a cell phone and when we hear bad news or we hear that we're in a trade war with China or ... or there's an election around the corner or you know something bad is happening you know throughout the country or something we're not happy with it so easy to get on our cell phone\nAnd trade stocks that easy go from the stock market to cash oh things are well go from ... to the stock market\nAnd it makes it makes a big swings in the market because of technology sometimes it used to be a lot more difficult rod you had to call the broker the broker had to sit there and make the trades and it was more actually more of a hassle so because of convenience\nWe're seeing an increase of volatility just because it's so easy to do your as I say oh I think a lot so I think it's more important than ever\nThat you have a plan in place that allow for that\nSo that when bad things start to happen and that's the thing that's unfortunate\nSee we haven't had a market crash we've had some mini corrections but we haven't had a huge drop in the market since two thousand and eight you know from the tail end of those seven to march of ... that was the last significant crashed we had\nSome people are saying well markets long overdue I don't know there's a due date but I Do know this much when it starts to rain and it starts the poor and starts going down if even take a look at history it goes down fast\nMore important yeah more important reason why you need to know how much risk\nIs in your portfolio has anyone ever stress tested it to tell you what your portfolio today would have done on the last crash the kind of see apples to apples has anybody ever showed you that\nIs not we will because that's what we do anyone who ever has come in here\nFrom our our radio program TV program or any of our educational\nThat we've always dress tested their portfolio to see exactly how much risk they're taking and if you don't know that answer you could be in for a rude awakening the next time it pours\nWe're talking to my grandma's financial wisdom here on today's edition of the financial symphony and when it rains it pours in the ... and mark ... since you're a music enthusiast like I Am and you're\nSong by the asthma brothers one bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch of girls yeah\nDonny Osmond [laughter] flag when they had like a girl exactly you know long\nBefore the arguments ever did that and long before somebody rubbed cats are my grandmother used to say a bad apple spoils the whole barrel and she was right and that applies to financial matters as well\nYeah you could have a bad investment and it can ruin the portfolio and when we're sitting there analyzing folks portfolios that come in\nYou know we might see some good things and one thing that we we will do when we share the findings of the analysis we plug everything that that you own into our software to print out these reports and it tells us all it tells us the good things I share the good things with you\nBut then if I see something like a bad investment that could be spoiling the rest of your retirement\nI Want to share that with you too and sometimes I find where some broker got a hold of somebody Iran and\nAnd and put too much of their portfolio in something called ... real estate investment trust and those particular investments may not be doing so hot and then when you try to get the money out of there they're not liquid and we call the different companies that own those ... those real estate investment trust we call them read their own those rates\nAnd then they say oh I'm Sorry we don't uh it's not open for any withdrawals other than just the interest you can't take any money out it's closed right now are you kidding me [laughter]\nDo you think the broker explain that to the to the investor or they just have you ever need this money we can't get to it yeah you know I I hear so many times the answer's no they don't so you know to me that 'cause boy all everything else that you're doing and how about this\nHow about a variable annuity you know how I feel about that yes I Do I'm not an anti annuity guy my parents are living off of two annuities\nYou know my dad's pension from the state of Delaware and my mom's pension from the ... company and both of those pension checks at Ninety three Ninety years old have cost of living increases on it I Know the value of an annuity\nBut at the end of the day when I sit here and see these variable annuities\nAnd I know the fees that these folks are paying for most of these products it just makes me cringe\nAnd usually when I Do the analysis usually most of the time those are the products that are under performing those are the products that are bringing the whole barrel of apple down because they're underperforming and the fees are sky high\nAnd then once I point that out to the folks just like wow an aha moment I did not know that\nAnd I can sit there and show on exactly what I'm Talking about\nSo you know yeah I I Know exactly what you're saying when ... when it comes to bad products like that bad things inside the portfolio\nYeah and most people have no idea what kind of fees are paying you know we do a\nComplementary the analysis for everybody who comes in that's one of the things they get with this complimentary review that we do not only do we actually look at the performance of the portfolio and we find out exactly how much risk you're taking\nBut we also dig in their ... yeah we've peeled back the layers what are you paying fees what kind of impact does that having on the returns\nYou know we also look at the tax implications\nI mean we're looking at everything I mean when it comes to these analysis that we do\nAnother thing my grandmother used to say I've heard it more than once actually ever more than a hundred times [laughter] I heard it straight from the horse's mouth what does that mean mark\n[laughter] there's a fun game a week sometimes play called called the company so I mentioned those variable annuities earlier", "year":
