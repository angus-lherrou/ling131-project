age\nAnd my my mom boxed up my sister and I end up in the car and took us over to spend time with this kid covered in chicken pox hoping that we get the chicken pox yeah that's the way he did it back in the Daschle gold and you get the chicken pox when someone's ah 'cause it's very contagious and you rub around some other kids and they all get the chicken pox and they just get it over with right it's the whole thing\nAnd I think the younger you are the milder it as for you right as you get older it gets yeah worst\nUm\n... against a deadly in in in adults mothers ... chickenpox parties where thing\nUm\nIt it until Nineteen Ninety five when you could you could uh you could you could get a vaccine for them\nFor kids so there's there's a there's a lady or a nurse shared\nOn an anti vaccination Facebook page offering to share the virus with other unvaccinated kids\nNow she's on her address the gay she'd by the state nursing board for her proposing a chicken pox party but she could lose your job and her certification or all that stuff\nThat is that um she announced it\nLike chicken pox at our house exclamation point exclamation point just in case you live in the vicinity around Boulder, Colorado and you want to expose your children are very active chicken pox vaccine police private message me ... let me know my daughter will be that is kind of weird advertising for it\nYou know what I mean to strangers yeah ... well you wouldn't sign in your yard [laughter] chicken pox here come on by ten dollars what would you blame a kid\n[laughter] she wasn't charging for it\nUm [noise] she said my daughter will be happy to share\nAnd your child will have lifelong immunity as a result just let me know\nI wouldn't miss I Would let the kids I think you should have the chicken pox right\nI don't know if you do have the chicken pox do ... do you have the uh the uh the red and look at Los Angles the shingles is in your ah the viruses in your body right right but that

five to seven PM preferably before five thirty she's scheduled for a stranger to come by the house and get the chicken pox and it's kind of admit that that's weird\nThat's weird but I think I think if you get the vaccine do you have to keep getting like booster shots or whatever because then you run the risk when you get old that if you get around the chicken pox or going to die\nAnd uh yeah\nMy grandmother had at that remember Everytime anybody had chicken pox he was quarantined away from everybody\nI guess it's a really bad idea because pregnant women and people that it was weak immune systems that are not protected or I Can't be vaccinated are more likely to get a serious case of it\nSo that you post on our on the same Facebook page hey everybody just want to let you know I just received a complaint from the CEO registered nurse board about my nursing license which is which is current about being reviewed I Need to respond within thirty days I have to get an attorney it's
