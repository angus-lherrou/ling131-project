where on the phone with Derrick Stafford retired NBA rap spent Thirty years in the NBA as a referee a misstep but what's the craziest game that you are you have a referee\nUh [noise] let me see two games come to mind and and they're crazy for different reasons uh the first one is I have Michael Jordan's first going back to Chicago where he came back up his two years\nA retirement Titus or whatever you want to call it\nAnd in the place was just crazy I mean the fans are crazy outside the ... it was ... it was I'd ever seen anything like that to someone coming back to plan a basketball game that was incredible\nWow uh the second thing that comes to mind was when a okay see hey go stay down and I've never seen anybody in in a daze like clay Thompson was decided that he was making was just incredible\nUh using them exactly how many points the sport but\nYou're talking about when I when they had him down an end game seven cup when they were doing well they were\nIt was actually I think it was game\nI think it was game five of game six and a okay see had that game one they were about to win that game and Golden State was about\nTo be lemonade Ryan that's when Iraq right yeah and clay Thompson just went ballistic and you say you was that okay see\nAnd you saw a look at it as I say\nUh never seen anything like it\nSo when you see that looking guys on when you see a guy lining up like that do you ... ... am I I Know it's it you say you're human do you almost become a fan at that point\nNo I'm your training in order to to do your job and you know what your job is at hand\nRight but now he's looking like that and score like that my job is still not miss any files my mouth my job is still to look for the ... legal screens illegal picks so that's that's what I'm looking for I'm not I don't have to stay focused on what I'm\nDoing my my uh my um executive producer Brett Barnett he he's got a question here uh\nI was wondering as you were saying talking about the ... I Want to know who's to blame for kind of like the woods suffocation of the NBA because if you want to talk about back in the eighties your bill and beer taking people's heads off and now it's like all these swaps now is this the referees that are just getting softer\nTrying to watch out for the players calling too much I mean it's turned from less almost like football and ... soccer\nWell that's a that's a very good question and I can tell you that we have people that look at our game we have a board of governors have our rules and competition committee and these people may\nJust like you guys meet before you have a show and they decided how they want the game to be played may want to be a free flowing game or they feel like the fans will be more interested in the game is the most scoring\n[laughter] and less physicality and that's what they've decided wow they meet\nWith the commissioner and and they decide how they want to be played in this ... ... and they are the ones that set the rules\nBut but don't they understand that when you make a lot of calls that slows the game down\nYeah they they look at the time and again trust me they they have people that have the ... the number of files looked at the time of the game and so that's why I noticed the three years they've done things to try to speed up the game they want the game to\nBe somewhere around two hours okay and and most of our games or around to our equal even with the number of calls so right now they're they're pretty happy school and this up and that's and that's what they see\nWell that sounds that you kind of eliminated defense by doing there's only two teams last night scored under a hundred points the warriors scored a hundred and forty four of the wizard one twenty two in that game only two teams last night under a hundred points there is no more defense I don't know if that's because players are scared they're gonna fail out because you guys are just calling everything on them and people are flopping over\nOr if they're kind of like ... I don't get paid to play defense I get paid to score points I mean the more points to score the bigger the contract\nWell it ended a day you have to remember it still comes down to the coaches and how they close their players so if I'm more concerned about scorn if I feel like the game was free flowing and apple took advantage is on that's what I that's what I'm going to be concerned with so\nThat the coaches are ... are running their change in a way where they score ... points and until the coaches decide which I'm sure they won't and then next couple of years because the general manager and everybody's looking at the office that they're drafting players that can play off and so they're not really concerned that much about\nHaving defensive stoppers and the league as long as the ratings don't go down and will be will be sent a lotta swollen\nOdd that you remember Tim Donna he was a I Would say you guys as as a fraternity or a small fraternity of referee probably saw him um as a black sheep or the guy that was I'm accused of and and found guilty of cheating on NBA basketball we want to play this clip from sixty minutes and get your reaction OK\nOkay I knew that there were certain relationships that exist between referees umpires referees and coaches and referees and owners\nThat um influence the points for game ... was that true or was he just lying\n[noise] well I you know it's it's hard to find a sixty perfect people to do anything number one a number to the people that I was trained with the people\nThat I Know very well we we were only concerned about\nTrying to get our players right night in a night out\nI mean I I ended up meeting Charles Barkley over the years and we had a decent relationship but also to jog dark out of the game right so when I when I had to court and most of my co workers at the court and and I can't say this is true for everybody because we're we're sixty people\nPick from all over the country and I'm sure we have people that bought it for ... people to vote for both the Hillary\nRight so so so we you know we're human so gosh I Can't say that every body is not influenced by something but I Can't say that the majority of the people that I Know that I Know personally we just are worn out night in a night out just to try to get my plays Reich that's all I focused on who\nLast question before we let you go we appreciate you so much um the bronze goes down the middle Everytime with his elbow out he travels we know what he does why don't why those calls made is it because he's the Bronx or is it because he got hacked that the other end and that call wasn't made\nNo well back in the old days you know we would do things like that where if\nYou know like oh man I missed the call so I'm gonna try to try not to call the next on him just to try to eating it out there that were there were a veteran guys that work like that when I first got hired and and it was kind of accepted you know to\nEvery team had like a super star player and a super star player kind of ran the chain and as long as the referees could cook could work with the superstar player and he will control this team that's kind of how the gang work but right now with the Otay a you know\nCamera phone is just too much technology out there now to try to make things up you have to try to call it a game as best you can see some of these guys are big some of the guys are fast and then you have to understand that some of the plays a look light travels\nTo you guys are not travels but you used to growing up with high school routes growing up with what a reps they call the travel Everytime something look funny write all that that's why people\nFor or what you're saying when I see a guy take three steps he's not really taking three steps\nWell the first question out after as you do you know exactly when he picked up the basketball\nBecause see on auto pilot effort [laughter] well and I didn't\nI tell you what I like for you to do I like for you to do I mean it's very easy not a videotape so uh like for you to videotape one or two game Brian and just make make a note of ways where where you say okay I'm sure it has got to travel\nAnd then senator name will will bring you back on\nYeah you can do that yeah and we can look at it and I can show you when the ball was picked up and tell me when the ... the late ... what we're number one thing that judgment as to when the ball was picked\nUp yeah marriage Stafford Thirty years in the NBA retired MBA Rapp thank you for your time we appreciate you so much and Ralph said to tell you to get to a golf game together 'cause he's come in for you you're listening so Haley went to show\nHere's the story of whom he wants to blame for the love of the game\nRochelle came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing time\nWith good friend the chairman of the uh Georgia Republican Party the Georgia GOP Mr John Watson chair of the Georgia GOP and we're talking about a little his response or the ... response\nTo the debate the other night I'm Stacey how do you think I I the flag issue this this burning up as a state flag\nUm I Know you probably don't know just like I don't know but I have a feeling this was the Abrams campaign who sent this out that was my feeling because I thought to give her credibility within the far left because she's she's not she's not credible to the far left\nUm the far you know those are those outside the the the bounds left the voters or what do you think who do you think sent out that are burning flag story\nShelly I I'm I'm a I'm not in the speculation\nGame I have no clue I have no I have no clue but I\nDo want to what I think what you just said is that she she doesn't have legitimacy with the far left\nFor hours yeah but you know what I'm saying like your ... for people I Know I Know I don't I Know she's radical in our thoughts her on her her her ... and sank or sanctuary cities and things like that that we know that\nBut there is a far more radical lefty that's out there on the on the youth side um that don't see her they see it specially when she runs that thing I worked with the Republicans on tax cuts I work a little public hands on that that crowd doesn't see working with the Republicans as anything positive\nWell there's there's no question about that I again I have no idea where the where where the fly picture story came from Shelly but the reality is that uh if if if if if one need to be appealing to that audience than one's losing an election really quickly\nEspecially in Georgia and that that's the that's what I wanted to drag out and get right there [laughter] well I Know when I Know there's a lot of Republicans knocking on doors now as I have you on the phone I Want you to make a last\nMinute please to people that are gonna vote but what do you how do you what how does one help\nBesides voting we know you go pull a lever you voted but a lot of Republicans feel like they've done their job what can

game is played\nBecause you absolutely positively no the only black that black people only vote Democrat so if you support if you suppressed black votes you suppressing Democrat votes you see because we don't vote for anybody else but Democrat so that's what the argument goes\n[noise] and the republic and the Republicans are smart enough to know this is the all the other argument quote unquote

entire life savings\nAnd why attempting to time the market is a fool's errand so why do you do instead All right let's jump back to diversification I've gotta finish this up\nNow [noise] I [noise] do you think that you have a diversified portfolio well many investors what they end up doing because we see it you know we see\nAll the time if they buy some mutual funds and an index fund or two and then they think they're set\nBut they're not they're not set here are three mistakes write this down member I said this is probably the most important show I've ever gone to write these things down and then challenge us here are three mistakes that people make with their asset allocation\nThey sound basic but\nDig deep and be honest with yourself number one they choose multiple mutual fund that share similar strategies I mean isn't that nice those of you that I have an advisor that they are dealing with that for you\nThat they look at not only what they feel are the best mutual funds that are for the most opportunity based on your risk tolerance but that they're not\nOverlapping each other okay they're not the same strategy so that in fact you're not diversify that's very hard to do it's hard to have the discipline to do it and the time it takes to really understand that\nSo if you're looking to become a real estate investor without getting dirty fixing\nUp houses they call one

when I was six seven is the CPA wealth advisors radio show proudly proudly longest running financial show now here on new talk when I was six seven been doing this quite a while I think I'm over five years\nBecause of you thank you so much for that\nForget about timing the market Chinatown in the market is an absolute fool was there and even the pros and they spent a lifetime at this as investors are traders they don't know what's next for the market it can only get you into trouble\nInstead have a comprehensive financial game plan and then do yourself a favor and stick to it don't panic\nThese include many things many many things so I wrote down what that means what does it mean that this financial comprehensive game plan because we see some from some rather large wants one in particular here in the Atlanta area that's been here a while\nThey don't do this for their clients I'm shocked we asked their class last year ... the financial game plan and man they just ignore some little lay up stuff\nSome lab stuff for their clients like when the convert to a raw or they're loading them up in these royalty trusting closed and bond funds just garbage here's what I mean\nYou got to have a plan to maximize your Social Security benefits\nYou've got to be able to generate income in retirement you've got to reduce your taxes\nHow to stay one step ahead of inflation yeah have to have a strategy to withdraw money from your IRAs and you're for when Cajun your or their retirement accounts you still have to have an estate plan\nYou have to reduce your fees and expenses and you have to have a plan for the sky rocketing cost\nOf health care and long term care is it a try and time the market look for buying opportunities you know what throughout history markets always have come back and that's my message they never go to zero when the markets go low it may be a good time to buy\nA crisis means one\nThing stocks are cheap so it's a great opportunity stay the course and possibly buy more\nRemember that remember that as you're getting nervous throughout this turmoil okay it's gonna be okay but if you had a plan then you can weather the storm now here's the next big one used tax last harvesting to your advantage\nLet me give you an example it happened this week I Know if she does the same from Rollins financial he will absolutely or remember this\nHad a listener come in with his wife they've been listening for a long time and I never know what the one trigger ward is that's going to make somebody called me I never know what it is but\nAnyways I hit that trigger word obviously because they came in now\nWhat we saw is that he had recently lowered his four one K. contributions\nI think he got it down to where he was always putting in one or two percent of their salary and it was just enough to make sure that he took advantage of the company match and that's okay but we said why are you not putting in more well he said I just\nI I'm worried at the end of each month that I'm not going to have enough money to live\nBut then and these are the difference is this is what other firms don't do Joe home to the ... tax return and noticed that he had a very lost a six figure loss carry over I capital last carry over and then he had another stop\nWhere we had a lot of his money in one stock so of course Joe said look first of all we've got to get your diversified especially with all this volatility guy said yeah but if I sell a lot of that one stock I'm going to have a loss\nTo know you will in fact we can sell up to six figures on this stock we can offset six figures worth of gain listen to what it does number wanted diversified as you number two you just freed up a\nTon of cash now you can live off of that cash and increase your four O. one K. contributions to the absolute maximum do the remainder of the year\nYou'll have plenty of cash so won't impact you financially 'cause we just freed up that cash we freed up tax free now it may seem obvious you see but be honest with yourself like do you look for those things within your own portfolio\nHe said wow this other very large investment management firm that they are with they never told me that they just ignored it but that's the kind of stuff that our CPA wealth advisors look for\nIt was a beautiful opportunity they are going to become a client and think of the benefit that he's going to get now by increasing those four one K.\nContributions to see tax law harvesting is a perfect opportunity right now right because we know it's going to be one of the big expenses in retirement\nBut you really have a lot of control over how much you pay in taxes in retirement more than any other time of your life\nAnd that's why you may be able to turn a market loss into a real tax savings opportunities it's a lot easier than you think [noise] but you got to look for it you got to look for it [noise]\nYou got to be prepared and take advantage of the opportunities and it's got to be customized and sometimes you're blind to your own financial situation\nWhich is why we encourage you when you come in and see us\nBring your Social Security tape and bring your tax return\nWill come through it for you bring your investments statement because\nI've never seen somebody come in and we don't sniff out\nSome kind of an opportunity like the one I just told you about it happens all the time it's really a shame because many advisors they just they just missed this stuff they shouldn't but they do and we don't I mean I don't know how to say it any clearer but we just don't [noise]\nNow we call all of this a tax efficient investment strategy\nYou up money saved in these pre tax and these after tax retirement accounts and that's great but what percentage of your money really should be in a pre tax versus after tax accounts which accounts\nShould you in fact kept first in retirement and how how exactly will be withdrawals along with your other investments and your Social Security benefits impact\nYour taxes in retirement and that in fact is what got that couple that I just mentioned to call me when they heard me say that as much as eighty five percent of their Social Security benefits could be taxed\nThey were somewhat outrage\nAnd came in and we dealt with it it was\nIt was the trigger that made them come see us so I don't know what your triggers going to be but I sure hope this volatility\nThis week is your trigger to call me and these all these things I mentioned there really critical questions\nAnd the consequences they're big they're not minor but we can help you avoid what can turn into a mountain of avalanche of taxes and we want you to keep more of your hard earned money\nSo the answer to this is in this retirement tax analysis we automatically do that for you when you bring your tax return and we're going to give you a ... tax ideas along with a lot more of course and you know what it doesn't cost you a dime\nWhy would you not take advantage of that there's nothing to lose what you in fact can learn very well in most cases saves people\nThousands and thousands of dollars every year\nWhy not come in call us at four zero for three four one\nFive five three five that is for zero for three four one\nThese Paul backs\n[noise] here are some who resources that you can look up for but you can Google this Forbes Google five things to look for when picking a financial advisor I'm so proud of it because I read those things and I'm like yeah\nOur CPA wealth advisors meet those characteristics or Forbes again you could Google this top ten things to look for in a financial advisor I'm not going to read them all but\nYou know there's some really really important things in there\nAnd um [noise]\nI Want you to take a look at those because frankly it only bodes well for us because I've told you over and over for over five years now it is much more than them simply being able to pick investments for you if it was just for picking investments I tell you that you could do that yourself\nYou don't need a financial advisor is way way more than that way more than that\nNow [noise]\nI've also talk to you about this I've talked to you about\nPraising you\nMost of us have done a good job with this saving and investing for retirement and that that also is just to start though it's just to start because now I said you ask yourself what do I do right now because it's ... it is it's what you do what the money that really matters\nHow you ensure you get the most out of your Social Security benefits\nHow are you going to reduce your taxes in retirement\nHow are you going to generate income with out dumping money into bonds or closed and bon ... don't go into royalty trust and master limited partnership like this one other big advisor firms seems to be\nDumping all of their clients and do they are getting killed and then how do you navigate required minimum distributions with your IRAs and you're for one case and your other retirement accounts because that's gonna make you pull your money out even when you don't want to you know what\nI what I really do sincerely want your money to go further and retirement I'd do it it's like my ... I think that's what kept me going on this show for so long people here that sincerity so we for years\nHave talked about our five step retirement action plan loved the word action we put things into action\nIn about an hour you're going to learn how you can potentially save thousands of dollars in taxes in retirement do I sound like a broken record does it sound like I think taxes are so important to deal with in retirement you bet [noise]\nHow about how to ring every single nickel out of your Social Security benefits if I sound like a broken record on that you bet I am we have to maximize that\nHow other people are successfully generating income in retirement today the key on that as successfully generating income not depleting your assets while generating your income\nAnd there's just so much more there really is and I don't know what we're going to do for you I just know that every time I sit in a meeting I look at Rollins I look at Joe Rawlins\nAnd Eddie and Robbie and Matthew whoever's in the meeting with us and I smile because we always come up with ideas that other just didn't come up with [noise]\nCome on and then see a schedule your appointment by calling us it four zero for\nThree four ... five five three five no cost no obligation we do not have any products to sell if you are the kind of person who needs to make the most out of every dollar you save for retirement I Am\nCall us right now at four zero for three four ... five five three five again for zero for three four one\nFive five three five It's MORNING next Saturday and Sunday I already can't wait to be here at ten am right here on new top one of six seven on the CPA wealth advisors radio show thank you so much everybody [noise]\n\nThe proceeding program was paid for by CPA wealth advisors L L\nPreceding was paid program and does not necessarily represent their views on opinions of talk one oh six seven or cumulus media\nSaid garbage piece of music making two hundred and fifty million dollars he's\nYou can make an ATM sauce\nThat's all we have to do and it makes them worse gung\nHo and ...

victims who were exercising their religious beliefs their eleven counts of using a firearm to commit murder and each of these counts as\nThat is a prudent style of investing now the closer I get to retirement this this this could be serious with the stock market ... you need to have that risk\nControlled to where we're still taking advantage of volatility in the market ups and downs but at the same time we're on the small or roller coaster we don't need to be on the big ride it's Six Flags\nOut and on for dear life set our knuckles or white because we can we're we're holding all we got the death grip on the rollercoaster we don't need to be there when we were closer\nTo retirement volatility is not our enemy Ron but we uh we got to take advantage of the volatility and we got to control it and the prescription is to have a stress test\nPerformed on your portfolio to really see how much riskier taking and really what kind of return or are you getting for the rest of your taking\nI don't want to be rock and roll and quite a bit hard not to like those ride [laughter] give me the game either I'm a grown out of them into a saying that you have another patient who has problems with paralysis in his or her financial decision making process\nBecause this person feels that then they have too many investment options to choose one\nOr ... doctor okay so that's called paralysis my analysis sometimes so one thing I think we're really good here at the way the ... group is that we'll be explained things in a way Ron but it's so simple\nFolks she'd do not need to have a finance degree to come in here and learn about your portfolio you don't need to have a finance degree to be able to understand what our solution would be to fix your situation I feel like my whole team\nHas been educated on how to explain things in a simple matter you know my my oldest granddaughter is going into middle school next year\nSo she's like what's that sixth grade seventh grade yeah back when she was in the fifth grade I told my team I said you know what I Want to be able to explain things to my clients\nWhere you don't have to be smarter than a fifth grader you know that show that Jeff Foxworthy used to host yes you don't need to be smarter than a fifth grader to understand what we're saying and that's one of the compliments I hear all the time around is that\nI've learned so much and just coming and visiting with you on my portfolio is doing what retirement is supposed to look like\nWhat retirement you know am I able to retire when I Want to retire these are the things I was able to learn by just sitting down and talking to you folks and you've done it in a way where I understand it that is the best compliment we can hear here in our firm and we hear it all the time I'm just so proud of that\nYeah well that takes care to patients that you've seen today okay now already run behind schedule like most doctors do [laughter] so we got other people in the waiting room you know here's another one who says that he has high levels of anxiety from watching the news every day what do you tell him\nOh well you've got to understand something that when you're dealing with the news with the media by design they're trying to make you anxious truth anxious means that you're going to stay tuned in the more you're tuned in the more commercials you're watching and listening to\nAnd the more commercials you watch and listen to hopefully you're spending with those people that you're listening and watching the commercials from\nThat's all about ratings and it's all about producing revenue for that TV station and it's like when you know bad storm is on the way we kinda gravitate\nTo the weather channel right well it's the same thing when this bad news in the market would gravitate to to the media to find out what's going on why did the Dow lose five hundred points today\nHere's the bottom line there's nothing wrong with learning something\nBut you've gotta have the right mentality you've got to have the comfort level and this all goes back to really do you know what you're invested in the you know what your risk is do you have the appropriate amount of risk for where you're at in your life and take your sleep at night knowing\nYou know what your portfolio could potentially do not if the market goes down but when the market goes down do you really know what's gonna happen if you don't have the answers to those questions you've got to really learn you really need to take the time to learn\nWe have seen here and twenty Eighteen Ron more and more and more volatility and you don't need to get all anxious and and be worried all the time if you knew the answers to these questions you could in fact\nHave the opportunity to have less stress and more more relaxation and be able to sleep at night and this is all part of knowing me being better educated and then again that's what we do here at the white group and would advisory\nFolks we're well known for a long time but mark ... is your financial maestro but you might not have known that he has your financial position as well so\nOkay and Mr rock and roll doctor okay tell us about this for a patient who suffers from high blood pressure resulting from anger about band financial advice that they got from somebody else in the past\nWell the key words there within the past ... you know but some of the things you can't cry over spilt milk or water under the bridge or something over the damn [laughter] whatever happened to us I mean you know you you look into its history its history you just don't repeat the same mistakes\nYou know again one thing that we try to point out to our clients is that\nIt's all about transparency it's about having regular meetings and having regular checkups and having regular education a little bit so that you can stay on top and and really have more peace of mind and comfort they you know what's going on you're not sitting here guessing whether or not you're making a mistake or not\nSo part of it as the on going relationship that you should be having with your financial advisor\nIf you're a self investor and you're and you're still angry about something you know the bottom line is you know if it's been fixed than just psychologically it it's not healthy to continue to be mad about it yeah don't get on the move on and say okay that's in the past\nThere's nothing I can do about it but I learned from that and now we can move forward you know with better decisions\nAnd when you sat there and read that Ron I thought to myself\nHow about all those folks out there through the years who bought variable annuities yes right\nI mean everybody who's been listening to show for a long period of time those how I feel about variable annuities\nI mean I you know this past week I had a a family that came in\nAnd their broker sold them to variable annuity but a big chunk of their portfolio was into variable annuities and the fees were sky high the money was tied up in the investments really didn't perform because the fees were eating into the returns\nIt just made me sad if anything I got mad I got mad because of\nHow they were taken advantage of\nBut at the end of the day you that was all fixable we were able to fix it for the people and that's what about the bottom line is if you can move forward and let that\nBad baggage just build behind you and not worry about it anymore and look at the bright side and look at what the what positive things you've done or what positive things you can do moving forward that's what it's all about\nDon't need no baggage you just get on board here you go you remember this other song called the well it was called tossing and turning I could\nOnly go to all our last body and it was that Bobby Darin [laughter] and now I've gone asleep at all last night as lobby Lewis Bobby Lewis his body\nNow this patient complains of losing sleep because he or she is retiring soon and worried about not having enough money\nRon that's number one concern we hear about on financial Seventy radio every week is I don't know if I Can't afford to retire when I Want to retire\nI don't have a plan in place I I don't know how much I've noticed and I just know what my Social Security is going to be and I may have or I may not have a pension that's what I hear every week at the end of the day when we plug the all the numbers in\nAnd we sit down and we take a look at what these folks have saved\nHow much is their nest egg worse and then I sit down and I look at how much of their life

the date allow us to use Folsom Prison blues are theme song\nThat requests for South every few but keep listening anyway\nWelcome back to the financial symphonies right sets along with mark Lloyd I get the opportunity to hang out with mark for awhile today on all of our shows is one of my main pleasures in life mark I just like hanging out with you and learning a lot too\nIt's great that you can

the things that you might hear from people who wish they had done differently hang in the rearview mirror\nYeah so what you're saying is like would've could should\nUh [laughter] back and isn't that I left there isn't that a nice reflection on you when you're looking to get [laughter] the first one of my list here is a lot of people and we talked about this so many times\nAnd I got scared after two thousand eight I put my money in cash and now I'm kicking myself are missing a great decade and the stock market yeah yeah yeah we\nWe we see that situation periodically and I I just my heart just bills for\nYou know I get it because in some cases even to this day mark I don't regret that decision because at least I Know I'm not going to lose because I'm In cash\nBut the problem is they're losing money safely Ron and we're starting to see now thanks to the feds are raising interest rates the economy is starting to move faster and that's what the feds do they bump up interest rates when that happens\nBond markets take a hit when that happens we also see that when that happens inflation rises\nAnd if you're not investing and even if it's in a safe bucket of money where you don't have to worry about market volatility if you're not getting enough interest on your portfolio\nThen you're losing money safely if you're not beating inflation and unfortunately that's what we say I've had many folks\nYou know they they still are just as aggressively in the stock market that now as they were back then\nAnd they don't even need to be I see the opposite so it's a kind of thing where it's a balance it really needs you need to have a diversified portfolio that's blended in many many different kinds of investments so that you're not relying on getting in and getting out\nMarket timing is hard for even the best money managers so I don't expect you to do it yourself or to be able to time the market adult\nSo how do we how do we avoid timing the market\nWell according to many many study that's out here one has it been since Ninety two percent of the of what grows your portfolio in the market is asset allocation how you have the pieces of pie in your portfolio designed\nWhat we do really well here is asset allocation designing a strategy to protect you designing strategy to mitigate the risk designing a strategy for some folks to minimize the risk designed the strategy for most folks that we let the risk work for us\nSo it depends upon your situation and your risk tolerance and if you felt a need to go to cash in two thousand and eight and you still hadn't gotten out\nYou know ... you say well the markets at an all time on the market doesn't notes at an all time high\nAnd the ... well you gotta look at the economy and as long as the economy is moving forward there's ways of working around volatility to still make money and you need to be taken advantage of it because we know inflation is rising we've just seen recent reports so bad it's rising and your interest rates are keeping up with a\nMark you know we have taught countless times about how most people have no idea what kind of risk there is in their portfolios and I'm sure you have a lot of people come in to meet with you for the first time and they've said gee I Wish we don't have much risk we had before we took this huge loss what do you tell him\nThey never had a stress test I said you know the thing about working with our firm is that our portfolios that we've designed and put together all these years every quarter we stress test them we stress test our own portfolios\nSo that we know it's staying within the guard rails at staying within the fairway staying within the lines to make sure that the risk is what it needs to be for our clients wellbeing for our clients\nFor our clients happiness for our clients needs were constantly stress testing our own portfolios to see where they're at\nSo if you don't have an advisor stress testing your portfolio on a regular basis the risk is getting higher and higher and higher and they can get out of whack\nIt's like checking your blood pressure if you didn't go and have regular checkups the doctor or if you didn't have your blood pressure checked regularly how do you know if your blood pressure is not high\nWell it's the same thing with your risk if you're not having your portfolio stress tests that how do you know if it's in line of where it needs to be based on your particular situation and I like to say based on your comfort level sometimes I've got a coach people abroad I got to tell them we need to take a little bit more risk\nWhere the other folks I can sit there and say whoa you don't need all that risk we could actually take less risk instill accomplished your goals\nAnd you know that's what a coach does it coach will coach you on what you need to where you need to be and what you need to do so in this case right here when I see that that could have been avoided you got to work with the people that are managing risk officially for ya and again\nWe've said there's so many times as well everybody's situation is different there is no generic solution everybody's problems everyone is unique\nYou know here here's the decision that people have to make it at one time on Social Security and there's so many options to consider and I know that folks have come in and they told you Jean Marc I should have waited to start taking my Social Security later once you do it cannot yeah\nYeah I had a married couple of days came and said yeah um I I I started my wife's early so when she died she's not going to get on line is she I said well no it's going to be a pro rated them out but\nThat's not the end of the world but what I tried to do is I Try to with all of my clients have not taken Social Security yet\nWe're going to run a complementary Social Security optimization report where we're going to look at the other income that you have coming in and if you have a pension we're going to look at the other income that your portfolio can generate\nAnd we're going to say based on that we feel that it's an optimal time at this time and whenever whenever that time is that you should turn your Social Security on and if you are a married couple\nWe know that when one spouse passes away the other spouse loses it you know one spouse the surviving spouse loses one of the paychecks one of the Social Security check\nSo we know that based on that and especially if there's a gap of age between the husband and the wife or the wife and the husband were going to look at when is the optimal time to turn there's on\nSo by doing that our clients are maximizing their cash flow or maximizing their income and that's what we're trying to do with all the decisions we make with these portfolios so if you don't have an adviser who's doing Social Security optimization I'd be concerned with that if they're just doing investing and they're not they're not looking at a holistic approach\nTo everything that the that affects retirement\nYou need to be possibly going for a second opinion and you're going to have an opportunity here in a few minutes to learn how to do that\nIf you're a client of the group and white and visors services and you know mark Lloyd the financial maestro then you're up to date on what's happening in your portfolio and and certainly gets adapted from time to time has to be quick sometimes and you can't just assume that you're broke or whoever that is\nIs taking care of ... there are folks who come in and say mark I should have put more money in a rough\nThe IRA instead of saving so much in my four oh one K. once you respond to that yeah I had another family we were helping this past week that uh we did just that their their employer only matched to a certain",
