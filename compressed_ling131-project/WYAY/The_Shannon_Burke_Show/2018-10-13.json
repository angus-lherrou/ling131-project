A. R. to eight or nine eight or nine\nYou're listening to the all four seasons home show [noise] here all your host damn Watkins and Gemini or goes [noise] welcome back\nTo the all four seasons home show with your sponsor Dan Watkins I'm Jim New York us and we're here with Bert concrete and Dennis ... of us window factory and we were discussing how important a installation is in the process of purchasing windows and having them installed\nDennis you want to continue with that and may and and I know you were talking during the break\nI'm a proud you are of of your team that it that you're in ... team of installers\nWell thanks Jim are installers ah yeah once again they were trained by us one to factory or they have been with us one of the factory for Fifteen Years we're very proud of our installation crews\nUm yeah when are when they're running a little bit slower and wanted to say actually come into the plant and helped manufacture the windows so therefore they are extremely familiar with the product that they are installing\n'em what we try to express with our homeowners are they you know most of the homeowners have gone through I'm remodeling process at one time or another and it's just an absolute nightmare [noise] um [noise]\nDoing windows and or doors there is no nightmare process here are the installer site you know one window out at a time they don't walk in and got the house they type one at a time out reinstall one at a time\nUm so it's a very clean process uh there's no mass uh the only way that you know that you've had one has installed is when the star leaves\nYou have a new one is installed they don't have to go out and pick up trash or clean up after the crew it's done and they're extremely happy\nAnd you you mentioned earlier on the show that you're actually a lots of times you get involved right and the installation you're on your own premise during these jobs right ... ... over saying things and making sure the qualities stays at the level that Bert requires\nI Do I wasn't installer or thirty five years before I actually started the sales and ... a bill with us when in fact true for a year now as as sales\nI did some installation for us when the factory and as it as I turned sixty two years old a installations become harder than ever use ... right right right so they've allowed me to you know do the cells and it seems to be working pretty well because of my knowledge of the installation of the windows um\nIt's kind of unique or you know I can express you know discuss that with the homeowners\nA which is not something that they normally here on a regular sales pitch they hear about the windows the company and all of the different things but on on my cells they get a you know what's gonna happen how it's going to happen or who's going to be doing it and I'm In all the information that they need to know on the installation\nAnd you get the measurements right there and I get from us right to I I Do know how to read as a\nVeteran if that's helpful I can tell you that ah ... the other day I wanted with installation I Know people are thinking well how long is this going to take I got a lot of windows here what is kind of your timeline to to to wrap up a job how long does it typically take per per window well\nBasically on I Would wonder job out ah say Twenty one is it can be done in one day it is a long day but it can be done in one day they usually start about eight thirty nine o'clock they arrive on saying\nA set up the windows a walk through the house you know make sure what they need to do ... that any furniture that needs to be moved we require the Hummer to move any foreign tree of about four feet away\nSo that the installer has access to it\nUm again it's a very clean process and usually by four thirty five o'clock in the afternoon they're complete cleaned up and ready to go\nOkay so there's er there's your answer Jim yeah in fact when he when he was a day sounds like and what is that a couple of guys do three guys you guys for crew\nOkay we you know I'm a lot of people uh they\nHate the process the sales process dealing with sales people from different companies and you know being being a conned into\nThis or or or or or the bait and switch and all that talk to us a bird or Dennis whoever wants to jump in here talk to us about how us window factory handles the sales process so walk us through from the time somebody calls and so our listeners and get an idea how you guys operate\nIs a very simple process as far as you as one of the size of his concerns gym\nOr the cost of ... will contact us and expressed their desire to get an estimate from us so we set up an ... of the office level and the ones that day and time one of ... with ... mile with add ... both the windows\nAnd we will show them to the homeowners are typically has a husband and wife team [noise] uh and we'll only talk to them all the\n... of the windows and then the benefits how those features are going to work in their benefits in any in the\nSense of ... of a in a ... and savings\nAnd how the windows the new windows and doors with ... at a lot of beauty or to the their their home\nAnd I'm a severely we get to the point we don't waste their time something like that by being there for three four hours or ... or anything like that okay on on average our\nAt time with the costs somebody is about an hour\nIt sounds like it's more of an education process taking a hardcore sales\nMitch exactly and one thing I Want to point out to you I totally about the way we make our windows DCIS these sort of thing that separates us when the factors that distinguishes that I've done it from the bulk of the windows out there in the market\nFor instance we only use\nGlobal strength glass standup glasses one sixties offending each\nHowever we don't have that at all and we used only one eighth which is twice as thick as once these things and these two or three poor glass so let's say billboard paying so you'll have like for the Cleveland I built a quarter of ... and glass\nAnd the space here we use is probably the most expensive in the industry bought is by far the most energy efficient or\nEat it prevents condensation from forming inside the glass\nNow the homeowners get a written warranty from us window factory at warranty that we are more them proud to honor we're if you aggregate as the homeowner on that one of our customers\nAnd Nick ...\nInside the glass ... plays the entire such decides she's comprised of the glass and the frame I round the the glass free of charge for ever\nCame out we don't ask questions or anything like that to gain a the the last ... that any compensation and they replaced for free ...\nYour ... everything you talked about you are a stickler for quality from a to Z\nWhere did that come from where you you you're a big believer in quality oh you you you you know because everything you say I mean everything is just the best thing or a materials and the way it's constructed and it just seems like they're very proud of that\nYes I Am a I'm maybe I'm just guessing a that comes from my a\nNatural way of being I have always being flooded in mind that they never seen that I Do I have a new steal my children the fact that even if you see on the floor doing it properly\nWith no energy efficiency whatsoever I a glass know lowly ... article guys a looming don't or metal space there's a I mean the you at ... at least say both died early as before\nAnd to bring it down to brass tacks stand that that directly reflects on your monthly bill ... tangible people can relate to your your your electric bill your\n... ... when you're an so late in your home it it\nMeans real dollars this is not just talk is not just green or receiving the environment here this is saving money\nUh every single month when you get your ... and it's not just the static solo the windows are beautiful day are and and you know that's one of the things I Want to get through NATO has talked about grids a little bit um I it seems to me or that that the new trend\nSeems to be no grits people want plain windows um I tell me about that you feel like that's still a friend or if I'm seeing this correctly or and then secondly barely talk about some of the different options you get aesthetically with the windows are or what what can often as you provide\nWell on the grid um we try we listen to the homeowner first on that because it is an option you can do with grits or without grits again we manufacture the one that's all we can do it anywhere you want we can do it with one vertical grid or too vertical grits or any way that you've seen a window that you like\nYou have a midtown look you have a colonial look you have a prairie look you have all sorts of different looks and us one factor we can duplicate any grid pattern that you want\n'em but we look at the home we look at the neighborhood sometimes you have an age or what the H away is going to tell you how the birds are going to be in the front of the house so we listened and look\nOn the grid or in between the two paying so glass we only use what we call a con to regret it actually has a G edge to it it is not a flat grid which looks like\nHorrible [noise] um [noise]\nThe grid is a it's called the G bitchy grits between ... we all also offer an as steel which is assimilated divide a lot which\nGoes that just applied to the outside and inside of the window so you can physically touched the grid that is approved for historic restoration and that is the only way that you could do that in a historic is using as steel\nUm on our windows we offer custom color matching for the next year where you have a white one at a beige one and then again the custom color matching um so we can pretty much match anything that you want\nAny color you are going to end the call or have that's that's pretty cool\nYou know that's a that's a big deal to him right there if you can listen you don't want to probably have the grades and left the historical home on the exterior it'd be pain and that thing every few years or whatever else so if you can get that I'm assuming that's a lifetime warranty as well on the the coloring\nAnd now that you're a mission and a a lifetime warranted then that is something that\nWe provide because so much waste in writing\nAnd something that again with the uh extremely proud of to honor our word our commitment our warranty warranted in blues glass breaking all do we have an absolutely nothing to do with the glass breaking for instance a\nTree falls when the window is it our fault no ... however we will replace the glass at no charge\nOnly because somebody has to do is\nTo sit out of the frame and he takes literally between one and two seconds bringing to the factory and the will replace it at no charge and it takes in order to say it goes so slow to put it back in place\nOkay with everything original the same way the way the was originally built for you and that's a warranty that we honor lets her while\nAnother theme is not because we're in local factory we can do that within an hour or two that he said all going\nThrough your dealer ... three or four weeks or longer\nYou know where we're at the end of our show but real quick let's say somebody says Bert I Love your window I Want to call the window and I'm willing to pay for it but I Need some help what about financing\nWill we provide financing zero money down\nOn twelve months they must gosh Eighteen months they must not kidding around longer financing wow that fail you two or three four five years yes either way oh they're great and we accept all major very cards right ... well you can pay by Chet whichever way easier and more more convenience\nNow I Want to ask you guys before when the show is there any type of special were offering or anything that you want to mention to our listeners out there that if they call up and contact

carefully eight without panicking [laughter] without panicking listened carefully a perfect storm above events is brewing on the horizon\nAnd on less remember I said this unless you take specific steps to protect yourself now it could decimate your entire life savings\nWelcome back everybody want to welcome to the CPA wealth advisors radio show [noise]\nI'm Talking about seven specific challenges that you're going to face in retirement but more importantly what we do what Rawlings does to protect yourself from this and as long as we have those basics covered\nYou're going to be in really good shape but you may need some ham and holding and you certainly are going to need a plan so I'm now going to talk about [noise]\nThe fact that things are really good today but water the financial consequences are retiring exactly in a bear market we've got to talk about that some more [noise] and then how to avoid the retirement tax trap that could needlessly Rob you up ten\nThousands of dollars that's what I got to talk about in this segment so I got to move quickly 'cause there's a lot just in those two things second of the challenges is a stock market at all time highs\nNow you know what that does the first thing that comes to my mind is you've had this huge run up I've seen a lot of you come in that can have your asset allocation completely totally out of whack\nAnd it happens because you just said it and forget it we don't do that you see it rounds financial I got to tell you Joe mentioned it this week we are active we don't just put\nOur clients into investments and sit there and do nothing for decades now you're going to see changes in your ... when you are a client act of management we are always looking out into the future how 'bout this historically speaking\nWe really are well well overdue for a bear market here here's a recent ... article I've mentioned it before from Nineteen twenty six\nThrough the year two thousand Seventeen bull markets lasted on average nine years now if that's the case right we're looking at our bridges than this market that we're in right now it should be ending right about now because it turned nine\nOn march night the two thousand Eighteen\nAlso also the typical bear market last one point four years with an average cumulative lost a forty one percent means trouble could be on the horizon right we've got so much volatility\nThat's a sign of ... sometimes these are a few years out I'm not saying we're in trouble this year or next year but in a few years from now we gotta start planning for some changes okay [noise] so\n[noise] we got to have a diversified portfolio dealt with that goes without saying and I'm telling you you may not be diversified\nAnd we'll do a complete review of your four one K. for you whether you sign up or not ... absolutely help you rebalance it may just bring that it alone that's worth the call just come in will help you with that but this one I talked about so often sequence of return risk\nAnd that is the risk of retiring right smack\nIn the middle of a bear market\nIt's like taking your bowed out of the harbor and you went right smack a second you got offshore boom you're in a hurricane we got to be careful with that you see the returns you compound during those first five and ten years those are critical to your access\nRetiring the fair market though can have significant consequences on those investment in savings those who are retiring a bull market are going to do way better than those that don't it's those early years that are really critical\nEven a short term volatility averages out into strong long term returns than\nRetirees you see you could still be a hot water if these sequence of those returns are bad right at the very beginning there's so many articles on this\nNow we've got on top of that these crazy required minimum distributions those can pose a major threat during bear market threat because you've got to sell your investments pull the money out whether you want to or not when the markets are down\nBut do you really do you really are there ways around that are their great great things we can do to help you deal with that yes there are jokes talks about those so often when you come in for me but we got to see what you got first we gotta we gotta customize this for you\nSo that is very important now\nChallenges number three is good old Uncle Sam they can't wait for you to retire\nBecause he's got to attach it to return so good old Uncle Sam is my challenge and number three\nNow that ties into taxes because you see taxes can end up being your biggest expense you have to have a tax up fish an investment strategy\nOtherwise it can cost you tens of thousands of dollars possibly more I mean this same big from but I keep being worried about recently with a client completely ignored a lay up\nBut if you're in front of me and you get this free plan just may be\nYou're going to like what we have to say because I tell you what I'm seeing a lot of you come in and other people simply are not\nDealing with specific remedies that we implement for you know here's what I got to cover for this segment the\nDangers of not planning for the skyrocketing costs of health care long term care got to deal with that and\nThe complications with claiming your Social Security benefits and how can needlessly costs you tens of thousands of dollars so here is challenged Ford the cost of health care and long term care are through the roof\nThat's it and the story I don't even have to explain that do I I mean you need to ensure that a health issue with you or your spouse or your parent or child does not turn into a financial catastrophe latest estimates\nTheir staggering says that the average sixty five year old couple retired today could march past the\nFour hundred thousand dollar mark when you factor in Medicare premiums supplemental insurance premiums that Dr Boyles and co pay show up you said or and bought bought me up you planned for an extra four hundred thousand dollars for retirement just for that\nIn most people think that Medicare is going to cover the majority of their health care costs in retirement no it's not that is not true according to voyage Medicare will cover about sixty percent of all retirement healthcare costs about the other forty percent\nWhat do you do\nMedicare data finds that does in their seventies spend seven thousand five hundred and sixty six dollars per person in health care costs in nearly a third or more than doubles to ... over six to ... thousand dollars by the time the person reaches age Ninety six\nI don't think you're not going to reach age Ninety six\nYeah we're we are getting lots of data saying you're gonna and we've got to deal with it we've got to deal with it then and what about long term care you may think I don't need it no you know what you're wrong here's these are facts Ford says that nearly Seventy percent of all people\nWho lived at age sixty five will require some form of long term care and it ain't cheap it is not cheap private room in a nursing home now cost consumers more than eight thousand dollars per month\nIt's a lot of money and that listen that's\nUp five point five percent from just one year ago and it's nearly a fifty percent increase since two thousand four so this is going up and it's going up a lot far faster than the normal rate of inflation\nSo I bring that up because you see I see your plans when you come in and I know when I see the bass majority simply don't deal with this topic alone which is challenged number for the cost of healthcare in long term care are through the roof\nHere's challenge five\nGetting the most of your Social Security benefits now I have to admit if when I Do a show on Social Security I cannot sit here and rattle off all the rules but I must Tanishia I'm blown away when I watch Joe Rawlins an Eddie and Robbie our team over there and Matt [noise]\nWhen you all\nRight in front of our listeners come up with right off the top of your head\nSocial Security optimization strategies for them I'm like man that's awesome I I just I Can't think of that quickly because this stuff is complicated you would think it would be easy but you know you'd think you just look at your statement it's black and white but this is not easy\nIt's not easy here's the hard truth most Americans the tens of thousands of dollars on the table when they're claiming their Social Security benefits\nBecause um there are are you ready here's my latest update\nQuote there are two thousand seven hundred twenty eight rules in their hand book and there's literally hundreds of thousands of rules about those two thousand seven hundred twenty eight rules in what's called their program operating manual it's crazy\nIt's crazy\nAnd what I'm about to tell you it really does defy conventional wisdom about claiming your Social Security benefits here's their traditional rule of thumb it says you should do leg claiming your benefits that sort of traditional rule of thumb as long as you can\nBut I'm here to tell you that's not necessarily true in fact\nIf you made a good living if you've been a good saber delaying your benefits can actually wind up costing you\nTens of thousands of dollars possibly more wow you're saying I never heard that before I Know I hear the other speakers on the radio they're not right I'm Sorry they just aren't studying this stuff like Rawlins does\nThe problem with you see that much of the one size fits all advice that we hear out there about claim your Social Security benefits is that it's only focused on one thing and that's your benefits\nMost people are failing to realize that this decision can also trigger\nAn avalanche of taxes you've got a factor that and you can't just isolated and say am I making more per month you gotta deal with the tax ramifications because that can also double your Medicare premiums did they tell you that [noise]\nSo you must consider what is the net net of your decision not just the size of your benefits check because the strategy that can help you get the most out of your money could likely be exact opposite of conventional wisdom\nNow\nWe will personally sit down with un Renee customize Social Security analysis it will show you the optimal time for you and your spouse\nTo claim your benefits in what you can learn would that can really change how when when you claim your Social Security benefits and it can help you avoid losing tens of thousands of dollars\nAnd we will

cannot precisely placed your dental implant with the help of a computer got\nOkay and Mr rock and roll doctor okay tell us about this for a patient who suffers from high blood pressure resulting from anger about bad financial advice that they got from somebody else in the past\nWell the key words there within the past ... you know but some of the things you can't cry over spilt milk or water under the bridge or ... something over the damn yeah water amount of damage [laughter] I mean you know you you look into its history its history you just don't repeat the same mistakes\nYou know again one thing that we try to point out to our clients is that\nIt's all about transparency it's about having regular meetings and having regular checkups and having regular education a little bit so that you can stay on top and and really have more peace of mind and comfort they you know what's going on you're not sitting here guessing whether or not you're making a mistake or not\nSo part of it as the on going relationship that you should be having with your financial advisor\nIf you're a self investor and you're and you're still angry about something you know the bottom line is you know if it's been fixed than just psychologically it it's not healthy to continue to be mad about it yeah don't get on the move on and say okay that's in the past\nThere is nothing I can do about it but I learned from that and now we can move forward you know with better decisions\nAnd when you sat there and read that Ron I thought to myself\nHow about all those folks out there through the years who bought variable annuities yes right\nI mean everybody who's been listening to show for a long period of time those how I feel about variable annuities\nI mean I you know this past week I had a a family that came in\nAnd their broker sold them to variable annuity but a big chunk of their portfolio was into variable annuities and the fees were sky high the money was tied up in the investments really didn't perform because the fees were eating into the returns\nIt just made me sad if anything I got mad I got mad because of\nHow they were taken advantage of\nBut at the end of the day you that was all fixable we were able to fix it for the people and that's what above the bottom line is if you can move forward and let that\nBad baggage just build behind you and not worry about it any more and look at the bright side and look at what the what positive things you've done or what positive things you can do moving forward that's what it's all about\nDon't need no baggage you just get on board here you go you remember this other song called the well it was called tossing and turning\nA good holiday oh I'll ask my body and it was that Bobby Darin [laughter] and now I live with oh last night as lobby Lewis Bobby Lewis his body\nNow this patient complains of losing sleep because he or she is retiring soon and worried about not having enough money\nRon that's number one concern we hear about on financial Seventy radio every week is I don't know if I can afford to retire when I Want to retire\nI don't have a plan in place I I don't know how much I'm known to spend I just know what my Social Security is going to be and I may have or I may not have a pension that's what I hear every week mhm at the end of the day when we plug all the numbers in\nAnd we sit down and we take a look at what these folks have saved\nHow much is their nest egg worse and then I sit down and I look at how much of their lifestyle expenses and I'm not talking about what's all your bills I'm Talking about how much money do you spend on a monthly basis and in a perfect world\nI Would love for you to be able to continue to spend what you're used to spending and not have to be a ... retirement in a perfect world\nI Would love for you to be able to spend a little bit more money and enjoy retirement go take some trips maybe you've got family\nOut of town or maybe you want to spend more time with your family in my case my grandkids maybe you want to spend more time with your family or your grandkids maybe you want to you know do those hobbies that you weren't able to do because you're a punch in the ... you know nine to five every day you might want to spend a couple of days a week playing golf or maybe fishing\nOr maybe it's gardening or maybe something maybe you're more charity minded and you want to invest some of your time with doing some mission work or something\nWell at all costs money unfortunately and you need to make sure that you have a financial planning an income plan in place\nI'm not bragging Ron but I my folks we what we do really really really well here are two things for our future retirees\nAssessing how much risk they have because the last thing you want to have happened is that the market has a crash or even a correction before your retirement or after right after your retirement because then you've locked in losses that you'll never get back because you're spending money every month\nOr the second thing we do really really well is that we create income we are different buckets of money that we use and we recommend here we were able to put together multiple income stream from different places to be able to supplement\nThe Social Security so that you can have that quality lifestyle that quality retirement that you've been working all these years for protecting what you have asset preservation but still have enough accumulation enough growth to factor in higher expenses higher inflation and taxes\nDown the road at the end of the day be able to have that retirement that you really want to have and not have to worry about whether or not you're spending too much money or or you don't have enough money to spend\nThe bottom line is our folks know that answer because we put together our financial road map to answer that question but you know what they all had to do around you know what the next step is\nYou gotta take the time

eight hundred seven or nine four to eight eight call the number and then you can arrange time to come in and have a conversation you're listening to the financial symphony camera goes along\n[noise] it's time for another musical connection we're we blend the worlds of\nMusic and finance to gather\nHere's randomly show financial advisor and musician\nLloyd with Ron\n... is down now for another musical connection here on the financial Seventy so mark lied to think about your favorite bands and pretend like you're going to see them on their farewell tour\nOf oh well oh top out most of my band that I like could be on a fair and a lot of them\nSay you know this is going to be the last two and then two years later they're out during again you know so but if they were going to play the\nAbsolute last two or think about your favorite band or bans what songs would you just have to hear them play and you'd be completely crushed if you didn't get to hear him live er here that particular song lied before they fade away oh that's hard that's hard\nBecause I liked so much of my favorite bands I like so much of the music that they play yeah I'd I'd go to Billy Joel every year or wherever bellies plenty and I'll go with some of his concerts I even go to ... when I go to New York I always time my New York visits around when he's gonna be at Madison Square garden or I watch him play\nYou know ... you say well the markets at an all time on the market doesn't notes at an all time high\nAnd the ... well you gotta look at the economy and as long as the economy is moving forward there's ways of working around volatility to still make money and you need to be taken advantage of it because we know inflation is rising we've just seen recent reports of that it's rising and your interest rates are keeping up with a\nMark you know we have taught countless times about how most people have no idea what kind of risk there isn't their portfolios and I'm sure you have a lot of people come in to meet with you for the first time and they've said gee I Wish we don't have much risk we had before we took this huge loss what do you tell him\nThey never had a stress test I said you know the thing about working with our firm is that our portfolios that we've designed and put together all these years every quarter we stress test them we stress test our own portfolios\nSo that we know it's staying within the guard rails at staying within the fairway staying within the lines to make sure that the risk is what it needs to be for our clients wellbeing for our clients tolerance for our clients happiness for our clients needs\nWere constantly stress testing our own portfolios to see where they're at\nSo if you don't have an advisor stress testing your portfolio on a regular basis the risk is getting higher and higher and higher and they can get out of whack\nIt's like checking your blood pressure if you didn't go and have regular checkups the doctor or if you didn't have your blood pressure check regularly how do you know if your blood pressure is not high\nWell it's the same thing with your risk if you're not having your portfolio stress tested how do you know if it's in line of where it needs to be based on your particular situation and I like to say based on your comfort level sometimes I've got a coach people abroad I got to tell them when you take a little bit more risk\nWere the other folks I can sit there and say whoa you don't need all that risk we could actually take less risk and still accomplish their goals\nAnd you know that's what a coach does it coach will coach you and what you need to where you need to be and what you need to do so in this case right here when I see that that could have been avoided you got to work with the ...\nLet our managing risk officially for you\nAnd again we've said there's so many times as well everybody's situation is different there's no generic solution everybody's problems everyone is unique\nYou know here here's a decision that people have to make it at one time on Social Security and there's so many options to consider and I know that folks have come in and they told you Jean Marc I should have waited to start taking my Social Security later once you do it you cannot yeah\nYeah I had a married couple of days came and said yeah I I I started my wife's early so when she died she's not going to get on mine is she I said well no it's going to be a pro rated them out but\nThat's not the end of the world but what I tried to do is I Try to with all of my clients have not taken Social Security yet\nWe're going to run a complementary Social Security optimization report where we're going to look at the other income that you have coming and if you have a pension we're going to look at the other income that your portfolio can generate\nAnd we're going to say based on that we feel that it's an optimal time at this time and whenever whenever that time is\nThat you should turn your Social Security on and if you are a married couple\nWe know that when one spouse passes away the other spouse loses it you know one spouse the surviving spouse loses one of the paychecks one of the Social Security check\nSo we know that based on that and especially if there's a gap of age between the husband and the wife or the wife and the husband were going to look at when is the optimal time the term there's on\nSo by doing that our clients are maximizing their cash flow or maximizing their income and that's what we're trying to do with all the decisions we make with these portfolios\nSo if you don't have an adviser who's doing Social Security optimization I'd be concerned with that if they're just doing investing and they're not they're not looking at a holistic approach to everything that the that affects retirement\nYou need to be possibly going for a second opinion and you're going to have an opportunity here a few minutes to learn how to do that\nIf you're a client of the group and white and visors services than you know mark ... the financial maestro then you're up to date on what's happening in your portfolio and and certainly gets adapted from time to time has to be quick sometimes and you can't just assume that you're broke or whoever it is\nIs taking care of fix there are folks who come in and say\nMark I should have put more money in a rough IRA instead of saving so much in my four oh one K. what's your response to that\nYeah I had another family we were helping this past week that uh we did just that their their employer only matched to a certain amount and you know so it's kind of like in ... and the four oh one K. performance wasn't all that hot\nSo it is made all the sense of the world to to go to the match and do the match one of the spouses had retired so their income level went down so the tax deduction wasn't a big deal but it opened up the door to start making ... or re contributions and if we can create a tax free bucket\nFor later on down the road when taxes aren't on sale\nAnd here I just said ride I said taxes are on sale has because I don't expect these tax rates to stay like this forever yeah we've got too big of a deficit in our country and it seems like Congress now\nYou know ... they don't mind just up and the debt up and the debt up and the debt up in the dead just pass another bill pass another law is go up and down the debt even more\nAnd that debt is going to come back and bite you know our kids are our grandkids\nAnd in a case of a raw pie or raised down the road of taxes are higher that tax free income force that's a tax free inheritance for our family that and and the advantage of having a rough IRA as huge\nI don't want to be a downer here mark but let's talk about a really sad situation you know we all have hopes and dreams when it comes to what we want out of retirement what kind of lifestyle we want to have and all that kind of thing and there are people who say I probably retired too early and now it's difficult to make ends meet\nSo I might have to go back to work I have here that I\nHate to hear that too you know it's just it's sad it's a shame [noise] can I just say that if that is your scenario where you know you've already retired and you're nervous and worried that whether or not you're going to make it\nYou know come on and for complimentary financial road map and what the financial roadmap does is all plug in your expenses will plug in your ... inflation with this because we do think that it's your expenses are going to go up we can look and see if there's any tweaking we can do on the expenses are some expense is going to go away or some expenses go increase\nYou know if you're not on Medicare yet health insurance you know probably going craze\nBut when we we know when you get on Medicare and sixty five year health insurance premiums may go down that kind of a good thing we'll look at all that for you and then at the end of the day will be able to say okay yeah I think you can make it or now you might need to go back to work I I Will tell you straight up one way or the other\nBut if there's some way of creating more cash flow or maybe creating more growth\nWithout gambling and speculating with the money\nThat might be the ticket and keeping you from having to go back to work\nBut in order to do this you gotta invest one hour time\nYou need to pick up the phone and give us a call and see if you can just be patient get on our calendar we get a lot of calls every week from this program get on our calendar and will be more than happy to do a complementary review for you and I and I mean this is complimentary you're not going to pay one thin dime for this\nMy goal is that when you leave this process you have more knowledge and you're going to have an a better idea of how you are positioned you're gonna learn something from this and you're going to be able to make good decisions because no one's going to talk over your head\nWe don't talk finance speak here we talk just in general terms where you don't even have to be a finance major you're going to understand what we're talking about\nAnd we do it in a way we're we're very visual so we'll put it up on the board for you so you can understand that you know putting a copy of it lets you get home with you they're going to have something you can go back and look at the notes we make it's so simple\nThat my pledge to you is that you're going to learn something you're going to see and you're going to get a good feel of where you're at\nBut like I said earlier you've got to act you've got to be willing to pick up the phone and give us a call so for all callers who called\nAnd the next Fifteen minutes get that financial road map review performed on your portfolio let me go one more time the value that you can get when you come in and get that and then you visit one of our neighborhood offices again it's called the financial road map\nAnd it's called the financial roadmap for a reason because the first thing we do is we create a financial picture of what's your situation is right now some people say markets too simple no it's not too simple it's sometimes the first discussion that you have to have with one of our teammates here at\nThe ... group and Lloyd advisory services where did you get a clear picture of exactly where you stand\nYou'd get our recommendations were going to give you some recommendations on how maybe you can better things were going to list the concerns right on our financial road map we're going to show you the concerns that we feel are there we can tell you exactly what we think\nYou should be doing to improve your situation obviously you can be the judge of whether or not you want to act on it or not there's no pressure year literally no pressure is very educational\nIn addition to receiving that financial plan as part of the financial roadmap we give you a retirement income projection or you're going to be okay for the rest of your life do I have", "show_name": "The Shannon Burke Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "13"}
