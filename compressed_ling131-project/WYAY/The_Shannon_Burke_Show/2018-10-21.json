Donald Trump but he went up any talk and everything and so at the end of the day they all the criticisms were bought one guy bakari sellers who who\nTold me that the weakest well acquainted to him was like oh my phone's doing Facebook Live a can't look at it but\nHe made it back to me I invited him to come on and debate it right he says oh I never heard of ... I never heard of you before okay what does that mean\nYou know based on the level of viewers that CNN has a lot of people never heard of you either\nI probably have to tell a hundred percent of my audience I have a car sellers on who is because they never heard of you either right but I mean that does his little day got me right that's fine I'll take it\nSo I said well let's debate in says well

with college dropout\nBut that's neither here nor there one of the biggest criticisms\nOf tiny West was\nThat he wants to abolish he used the term abolished the thirteenth amendment\nSo here's what the thirteenth amendment of the constitution said we've talked about this but you understand it says about slavery being abolishing involuntary servitude and then it goes on to say except as a punishment for crime where of the party shallow being duly convicted right\nSo one I don't want people to tell you how they are so dive into wool sold out to the Democratic party\nBecause that's what these attacks were about they want about they really disagree tiny west it was a fear that at ... moving young people in particular African Americans in particular African American men and women are waiting for the Democratic party that's what these elite people say\nThat 'cause they work for the ... the Democratic party so ... so their whole thing is a one kind or you sound stupid abolishing the thirty were you trying to bring back slavery this where they all say\nWell Colorado has on their ballot\nRight now here's what they had one about article two of the Colorado constitution section twenty six cents then she'll never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party she'll have been duly convicted\nThat's what the Colorado constitution says you know people in Colorado gonna be voting on in November\nThat us or the ... worrying about amendment will say that she'll never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude their abolishing vents are their idea of the thirteenth amendment that taking out the part of a punishment for crying wherever the party show up\nAnd do the convicted that whether you agree or disagree we don't want to have that that argument if you want to you can call in aid for for for all for one of six seven if you don't agree with\nThat that's fine the point here is that people were yelling at ... west when he was saying the exact same thing that Colorado's got on the ballot right now\n[laughter] but you all are so sick with love for the Democratic party\nBut

I. N. F. treaty ins stands for intermediate nuclear forces the treaty was signed in Nineteen eighty seven between the U.S and the Soviet Union\nAnd these ideas that they put into play\nThey really are tailored in their customized because we ask you questions when you come in and they see people small fortune and many of you have switched over become clients of art because you're like wow my advisor particularly there's one very large from here in the Atlanta area\nThere are huge and they ignore this stuff or at least so far it seems like they have so coming up on the today show I'm going to rebuild five exactly five retirement tax traps\nPlus as I always do the strategies that can avoid them and they're going to include how you can save thousands of dollars in taxes when you withdraw your money from your IRA and your four one K. I got to address that one right away because I sat untapped money we're talking about\nThen I have to talk about a loop hole which I Love with the Trump\nExit plan that can be a financial windfall plus how you can avoid or certainly minimize\nTaxes on your Social Security benefits I just told you that one drives me crazy 'cause it's like a double tax thing to let's dive right in number one retirement tax trap the one that drives me crazy Social Security you know I talk so much about Social Security on the show because\nIt's a pillar of your financial plan it's a pillar of your financial plan but it's a gotcha\nGotcha because people don't know how to maximize it and it's a gotcha because\nYou could pay taxes on as much as eighty five percent of those Social Security benefits and what else happens at the same time is it raises your Medicare premiums and most people don't realize this or they don't even really know what's happening we pointed out when you come in and\nWhen you when you get that tax bill it's really too late at that point there is nothing much we can do so we like to be proactive and look down the road we project down the road for you and make changes now that affect you for decades\nYeah that's how long you're going to be in retirement we're talking decades and you got to count on that money it's really important we don't want that to be a fraction of what you thought it was going to be so\nWe gotta do something about it you know Forbes is all over this I've I've read these quotes before from Forbes just about the concept of tax senior Social Security and how low those thresholds are before that becomes taxable\nYou don't have to make very much money if you're earning between twenty five and thirty four thousand dollars once your income surpasses thirty four thousand dollars you're going to pay\nTaxes on eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits so we don't have a lot to work on ... ... ... work with here it's a thirty four thousand dollar number but we can do it we do it all the time we do it all the time\nNow it's a little higher if you're married that's fine you know phases up that will be more than forty four thousand dollars if you're a married couple\nBut forty four thousand dollars for a married couple was not a lot of money that can quickly tax those Social Security benefits so\nForbes is all over this I'm I applaud them for being because I think it's very very important\nNow here's what else can happen your benefits at the same time you're getting whacked on Social Security they're throwing you into a higher tax bracket\nSo that that will also trigger a whole avalanche of other taxes and\nHow are these Social Security benefits going to impact your other investments you gotta be able to answer this question before you claim those benefits it's very very important that we plan around that there's a lot there's a lot here that I could go through just on this one topic alone\nEighty five percent that's what I said\nAccording to the IRS when you claim your Social Security benefits\nYou can and we see it get taxed as much as on eighty five percent of your benefits so that money which you absolutely we're counting on to help pay for your retirement it becomes a small fraction of what you thought it was going to be and that drives me crazy [noise]\nYou know what your best defense to ensure that you bring up you squeeze out every single nickel of your benefits is to get a customized\nSocial Security analysis even with everything else we give you we want to give you a separate analysis just just

going to learn you're going to have strategies to eliminate or minimize the taxes on those benefits that's pretty incredible and that's pretty bold of me to say\nYou were going there also received the

knows you always laughing at me I'm always cold I Can't help it listen\nI Want you to hear this this is why put this on Facebook Live it has been reported that Americans will over pay taxes over pay

financial\nThey're incredible they're not just investment advisers I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that investment management or wealth planning\nIs not\nSimply about your investments in fact that's the smallest part that's the smallest part there's so much more that goes into wealth planting the full circle\nCPAs are just the best at it man you're talking about guys that have been dealing with reducing your taxes\nFor decades so that is what I'm Talking about I Can't keep they'll live feed going on no be way too long tuned in for those of you watching Facebook Live to an end and new talk one oh six seven a year the rest\nI'm going to say goodbye to you live on Facebook and continue with the ah ah mayor listeners\nNow\nLet's talk about this a more um on retirement tax trap number three retirements tax trap number three is not switching to a Ross IRA or a Ross four O. one K. yep\nThis is a big one and here's the thing that confuses me it's it's kind of a lay up a lot of times and so many times [noise]\nExample after example particularly from this one from I Can't mention their name I Wish I could they absolutely ignore this they know who they are they're big they are large they're here in the Atlanta area and they missed this so often [noise]\nThey they don't encourage or they don't set up the mechanisms to have their clients switch to a raw fire air four one K. yeah\nLet me set up some basics and I know you may know this may sound obvious but I Want to I still want to say it you know that you're four one K.\nAllows for those tax free concert\nAnd then when you take the money out that's what we've been talking about why by the government it's taxed right that's a pre tax account and when you're Seventy and a half\nIt's also going to be subject to required minimum distributions means you got to take the money out and you're going to pay taxes\nNow a Ross Iraq does not allow any tax free contributions to see you don't necessarily get that up front satisfaction\nBut you'll pay zero taxes when you withdraw the money and retirement and you don't have to deal with those required minimum distributions on the wrong that means tax free gross now here's where I'm going with this here's what's missed\n[noise] even if you haven't made any Ross contributions you're now entering into retirement so just\nVisualize this in your plan your end during into retirement and then about let's say six months or a year what's gonna happen to your overall income\nIt's going to drop isn't it and it's going to drop by a lot and guess what happens when your income and drops to your tax bracket\nIt goes down huge flea could go down as low as ten percent could go down as low as zero percent [noise]\nThis is where we step back a baby we love this one we love this one you see what we see there is opportunities and we do this year after year to convert those free tax accounts in to weigh Ross\nNow when you do that conversion and this is where the magic sauce has to come in you're taxed on the amount of money that you convert to take a certain amount of your pre tax accounts you can avert them into Iraq that is taxable income\nSo the art here is how much do you convert\nWell just enough so that you don't get it taxed more than ten percent and then her golden and we can you that year after year and many of you\nSay well yeah well I don't know and so forth but yet you're sitting in a whole bucket of Castro that emergency fun and you can live off of that where you don't have to withdraw from those pre tax accounts wall or in this conversion mode you see when you meet live off of that\n[noise] savings that you have that are in regular investment accounts that's not taxable\nSo this is really how we go about massaging plans and we really focus on this because that is tax planning that's just an example it's going to be different for everybody but that's a big deal that's a big deal now also one more thing\nThe new Trump tax plan there are some things to look out for one convert into a rough\nAnd also Ross re characterization that means oh I converted too much into the Ross\nAnd I didn't stay in that lower tax bracket this is a big change with the new Chuck Trump tax plan\nFinally number five retirement tax ... number five and I I'm remiss here I Want to apologize I haven't talked about this enough\nAnd it's not having in a state plan [noise]\nNow it's not all in financial fault it's not Joe Rawlins fault but I haven't talked about an update brought it up a bunch to me I just for some reason found it well frankly kind of boring because this deals with when you're no longer here\nBut today I said what you've got to deal with this is important we've got to deal with what happens to spouses that are going to be left when maybe one spouse has gone or children you can ignore it and they certainly don't ignore it but I have been ignoring it on the show well\nWhat is the most cost efficient way to pass your parents or your inlaws a state to the people that they love you better have the answer or their money can pass right on to get to\nThe IRS you think that's what they wanted you don't want that to happen that money needs to go to who they intended it to go to and I guarantee you it wasn't the IRS if you do not have an estate plan\nThen everything that\nYou've own including houses cars investments everything it can get tied up in court ... it's not just the taxes it's the dang courts for a year or longer\nAnd the kid needlessly costs there are state tens of thousands of dollars in probate and legal fees it's such a pain in the neck\nYou got to pay these attorneys to deal with appropriate and that's terrible and then the state\nTo state comes in and could even get double tax by the government because you got state income taxes as well again I've been calling for a lot today\nQuote Seventy percent of a state incur asset losses or reduction in family harmony\nAnd a state planners know that many plans don't produce the results the owners intended few failure sprang from the tax strategies or language and the whale unquote it's one of the most important things you can do for

program we're always talking about risk and volatility but it's kind of similar we have to make sure as we're getting closer to retirement that that risk and volatility under control when you agree\nAbsolutely and I think one of the things that kind of his prompted me to look at this is my own personal situation\nI'm sixty eight years old like myself and I'm all my friends we all have tax deferred IRA for one case and so forth and so it got me thinking a lot about what are the different types of risks that I Am going to have to encounter during my retirement years and what am I doing to eliminate those risk\nSo when we talk about risk like that we were talking about market volatility like we said earlier but you mentioned something just now taxes\nAnd you know we've been saying on the show for quite a while since the Trump tax plan has come into existence that we taxes basically right now are on sale so it was giving folks like us an opportunity to sit down and really look at this taking tax time bomb that our listeners have\nAnd they ... some cases they don't even realize they have it so talk a little bit about four oh one K. is in IRAs and how that affects people in retirement well\nOne of the things I talk about my book the no compromise retirement plan is that people have kind of forgotten about what tax deferred means most people say even IRAs and for one case everybody said oh that's what you should always do because you get that tax deduction up front\nWhat they don't tell you about as much as what happens when you start to spend that money at that point not only your tax on what you put in your tax on all of that growth\nIs a huge ticking time bomb and whether you think about pain that tax today or paying that tax ten years from now Twenty years from now world when you die and your kids inherited IRA and they have to pay the taxes\nSo those taxes don't even go away when you die\nThat's right they never go away and I view the tax liability of it are a kind of like it's like that\nIs that called debt but basically the IRS has a hold on twenty or twenty five percent of your RA whether you like it or not that's where you are today and whether you pay a today or wait later on down the road they claim a portion of your IRA no matter what\nAnd it's important to really understand how the tax code is set up an and how these tax brackets are not permanent\nWhen Trump and the Republicans got them pass through Congress it was with a stipulation called the sunset provision that been ten years they're going back to the old tax rates\nBut folks it could be worse than that it could go to a higher tax rate just because of the debt that we have well I think we were looking at the ... not too long ago Marty\nYeah well let me give me an example because you're absolutely right we're running a trillion dollar deficits annually now and I don't see it getting any better but but let me tell you what town are you know I have a business degree as well\nAnd you're kind of look at economic cycles and what you've seen is once a generation about every Thirty years there's a major tax rate cut\nAnd from then on to the next Thirty years where you see your tax rates gradually creeping up not just the right to themselves but other ways that your income is being taxed or other ways or income triggers other taxes\nSo right now we're probably in the best world will ever be in at least for most of your listeners assuming during the late fifties sixties and so forth you probably will never see a better tax environment then you see today and pushing that along these record deficits\nLittle hard to see how those are going to go down in the future ... with all the problems with Medicare with Social Security with our overall spending so today is this kind of a window of opportunity to do something while taxes are low\nCan you explain to our listeners when you say picking tax time bomb what you mean now I I kinda know what you mean but explained it layman's terms what you mean by taking tax time bomb for people who have fault they were doing all the right thing\nBy just funding their four O. one K. put as much as they could put in there have their company match it if they didn't have a four O. one K. max out their traditional i._r._a. save on their ten forty so that they would not have to pay as much on taxes why is that now a ticking time bomb\nWell here's a problem with tax deferred savings again you get that conduct struck the front but every dollar you turn on that account\nPortion of that will go to Uncle Sam and taxes you can't get out and once you're in it the question is what's the best way to minimize it but the fact is you will start paying that tax and it gets worse than that because at time bomb for everybody slows when they become savvy and a half\nThey have this thing called required minimum distributions and whether you like it or not if you save under one of the tax\nDeferred parts of the IRS cold wet that says is when you reached Seventy and a half you must start taking money out of your IRA or four one K. whether you like it or not because Uncle Sam was start collecting taxes and there is no way to get out of that and that's one of the inflexible parts of tax deferred savings is\nYou may not want the income that year you don't have a choice you have to start taking\nSo I tell you a quick story about one of my clients who owns a chain of stores retail stores and when he came in he was sixty nine years old so he was about a year and a half away from taking out his required minimum distribution\nAnd when I sat there and did the calculation a news names Jack ass jak you're gonna have to take fifty eight thousand dollars out of that accounts\nAnd he looked at many says mark just leaving and I don't need it I said well oh you you got to take that out he says mark you know what fifty eight thousand dollars will already due to my tax bracket it's going to make my tax bracket go up to the highest bracket that there is\nI said I Know that but the you can relate it all this all this time and if you don't take it out it's the fifty percent tax penalty you can't mess around with this\nSo this is one of the reasons why it's important that the listeners now find out a way to be able to fix this before they get into a situation where they looked like jak\nAbsolutely and let me make that even a little worse case because there are some payments taxes and other things that are triggered by how much income you report for example your Medicare part B premium yeah to Justin ... your income so every dollar that goes onto your income\nI eat when you're Seventy and a half you got to start taking your requirement of distributions every dollar income could force you to pay higher Medicare premiums the percentage of your Social Security this tax is affected by your overall income\nSo basically these are what I call ... taxes and I think a lot of time in the future we're going to see more and more of these cells taxes that are amounts triggered by your adjusted gross income\nSo ... in your book the no compromise retirement plan\nI saw some stories in there and there was one situation with a gentleman who was kinda younger\nWho was forty two and he was just saving as much as he could into his ... four one K. can you talk a little bit about what potential tax liability we're talking about here always said so far we've got a tax liability numbers wise what are we looking at\nWell actually the younger you are the worst of it comes right when I first started looking at my own situation I realized that nobody is asking to me what the right question was and that is if you save tax deferred how much additional tax\nWell you have to pay over your lifetime by the fact that you do for tax to begin with now for John or my little sample in the book he was saving a couple of hundred thousand dollars it as a ...\nThat's how much you had a desire to hundred dollars on\nAnd he was saving about sixteen thousand dollars a year and a four one K.\nAnd he was in a twenty five percent tax bracket if I remember\nHer out and we asked them I I think it was a seven percent or so earnings rate on his IRA money and I developed software which we'll talk about later on to calculate how much\nIs John I'm going to have to pay in taxes over his lifetime by choosing to save on attack suffered basis\nJust pick up the phone call eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight that's eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight you can get a complementary review of your financial plan just call now they take advantage eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nIt's remarkable sometimes the emotions and feelings music brings to our daily lives it was there for graduation [noise]\nOn our wedding\nSometimes even resume on on talking\n\nCan you look back on line and remember them you're going to take a moment to look forward to your retirement we'll let me turn right through the uncertainty\nOr will not be a time of July [noise]\nIf you stop now you don't think you're currently and what deserves ... kind of celebration when you reach retirement [noise] maybe it's time to get a second opinion come visit when your financial ... Michael ... having the Atlanta area\n... eight hundred send him for nine four to eight eight eight hundred seven forty nine forty two eighty eight\n[noise] walking back to the financial Sanford cameras sets along with mark Lloyd and mark has a special guest today Marty ruby we'll talk more about taxes\nComing up the first year in the financial symphony I Want to give you a usual number's eight hundred seven for nine four to eight age than is eight hundred seven for nine four to eight age if you prefer you can text rather than call but all you have to do is leave a message with your contact information and someone will get back with you\nAnd we also have a special book offered today or this very special show with our special\nGuest mark ... of course as known all over Atlanta and all over the country in fact\nHe is in financial maestro for the entire nation and has hurt all over the country and certainly if you are here in the Atlanta area you're fortunate because the group Lloyd advisory services Lloyd learning center all serving you in Atlanta\nAnd we certainly would recommend that you get in touch with mark Lloyd's office he appears on Fox five Atlanta He's seen on Fox Business\nHas his OWN TV show featured in ... and get finance Wall Street journal the whole bit you know if you're a regular listener to the ship\nAnd its financial symphony and one more time and the number eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight now will go back to mark Lloyd and today special guest Marty\nRuby we kind of use an example of a forty two year old gentleman who was saving in his four oh one K. he had about two hundred thousand dollars already saved you know but a lot of our listeners\nAlready have a healthy nest egg I mean they may have a ... million dollar sitting in their portfolio and they may be older than that they may be in their sixties they may be baby boomers what do you say that people like that who has already ... to a lot of tax deferred money all these years\nMark this was the genesis of my book because a couple of years ago when I was in my mid sixties I was asking myself these questions I said it looks like I have saved faithfully and today I started work after college and a four one K. I built up a substantial IRA over time through rovers and so forth\nAnd I stopped to say well what happens now as I approached at seven and a half that requirement um distribution age what am I looking at in terms of tax liability\nAnd because I cannot find any way to answer that question being an ... spreadsheet and start calculating how much tax do I have to be prepared for over my remaining lifetime\nI actually are good at predicting mortality rate so I said maybe outlived age nine to ... for for ... twenty four years is two years ago when I'm sixty six I took a half million dollar IRA\nAnd I said last assume that I'm going to defer my withdrawals using the requirement of distribution they'll release them out there are so let me take out every year so I applied the iris tables or that\nI said let's assume that I don't spend that money I'm just going to let it reinvest it but no longer tax tougher because it's no longer the IRA\nAnd finally as we talked about before when I die whatever remaining amount or in my IRA my kids are my wife will have to pay taxes on so I said let's run the numbers and so I did that for my half million dollar IRA and when I found was when I was sixty six years old\nThat my tax go over the next twenty four years and toys Ninety\nWas writing about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars wow so when I first saw that number I said this can't be right\nI've saved I've taken the risk I've done all the work to save five hundred thousand dollars and you're telling me that most of that work has been up until now the pay Uncle Sam\nSo I went out to my CPA in a number of either a CPAs in Louisville which is where I'm from and I said this is right that I Do something wrong here they took a look like model and they said you know I never thought about this but this looks right to me\nAnd that kind of was the genesis of software that we've developed at the ... group has access to now that we trained you and to start saying that people stop what you're doing today take a step back look at what kind of tax liability that you will likely have over your lifetime\nAnd then ask yourself is there something we can do about it\nWe believe in having different buckets of money you don't have all of your eggs in one basket you need to have some long term growth out here that is in the market we realize that\nThe greatest wealth creation to on the planet is still equities\nWe also need to have income buckets some buckets that are safe some buckets that bring the risk down of your total portfolio some that are leaning interest in dividends we don't have all of our eggs in one basket because the markets are changing and we need to make sure that but do diversification that we're having steady growth and not this big roller\nSir you're talking about something even more advanced than that\nCorrect in fact the one diversification that almost no retirees are people closer time and has his tax diversification\nDiversified in terms of facts that risk longevity risk using annuities are kind of risk out there but they're all in mainly in the tax deferred which will eventually be taxable arena\nMy proposal was and what I've done for myself and others and what I talk about my book is to say you need another bucket in your portfolio and that has to be a tax free bucket and how do we get that\nSo there's a couple of ways to get that because people think about how they're saving today and what they don't realize is\nHow they choose to save is being driven by the IRS coat for most people don't maybe realize it but the term four O. one K. plan simply refers to section four one K. or the Internal Revenue code it says if you decide to save that way this is the tax consequences of what you're doing IRA similar part of the cold\nBut I realized based on my background that there was another part of the Internal Revenue code that you can also save Andrea that actually predates four one K. and that section Seventy seven oh two Seventy seven oh two okay\nNow I'm sure none of your listeners today nobody Seventy seven oh two is wrong and tell you what it is that's life insurance okay now when I say the words like insurance\nPeople say oh you know I don't want to pay the premium my kids get all the benefits that costs too much or too old I hear all kinds of excuses and what I tell them is keep an open mind\nLet's hear the story let's examine the facts and let's see if\nUsing a section Seventy seven oh two cannot literally save you hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes versus what you're doing today so what I tell people is there is a product out there called index universal life how you will and it is designed by the industry specifically\nTo accumulate amounts of tax free money that can be used during the person's lifetime to generate retirement income so this is not the kind of insurance to necessarily get if all you worried about was leading a big that benefit to your kid\nSo this is not like buying term insurance and just having a had died and somebody inherits tax free money correct this is something more than that\nIt's actually on the exact opposite side of the spectrum okay this is generating using the advantages sects Seventy seven up to the coat generating after tax dollars in a life insurance policy that is designed to generate substantial amounts of income in the future during your retirement years tax free\nSo it's almost like a savings account that's growing inside of a life insurance policy that could be use for income down the road\nCorrect in fact that's usually what it is for and what I talk about in my book is really not just the benefits of of the tax savings of index universal life\nBut it also does have a death benefit and I don't want to ignore that because at the end of the day I mean maybe other listeners are like this but as I'm getting older I think about what kind of legacy am I going to leave my kids\nAnd it'd be nice leaving something a typical IRA zero some kind of game every dollar you spend is one less power that you're going to leave your kids the nice thing about index universal life it's double duty you know provide substantial tax free income when you're living in an additional amount as a direct benefit tax free to your ears\nSo you're really taking care of two concerns",
