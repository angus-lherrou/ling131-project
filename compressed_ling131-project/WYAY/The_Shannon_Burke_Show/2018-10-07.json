... thanks man appreciate it here's William on a new top six seven almost three thirty hello William on the radio\nA camera supervise thanks match up are fine I I don't know if I misunderstood you weren't you talking about the guy Colorado to kill the Stanley earlier yeah what do you yes you're on a low like humanely they gave me the needle and let me do it myself\nWell you know they they're saying now that he was having an affair with some girl at work\nAnd yeah ... and apparently he asked his wife for a separation and then we're assuming that's what started some kind of a fight and that's when the police believe me just killed her and but I\nI don't understand any I don't I don't know how you can kill a four year old and thirty thirty three year old your own daughters Koester as if he strangled others bare hands I mean I just God\nI Can't I Can't imagine Colorado\nHad the death penalty or we know I don't\nYou know I'm not sure I I used to they used to have the firing squad Gary you'll stay here to do if I if I'm not mistaken he wasn't very well maybe that was Utah\n[laughter]\nYeah but I could Nuremberg a prison Ninety five year old guy but apparently it was an armed guard at a that'd be ... labor camp and help to kill six thousand Jews in one day in Nineteen forty three up\nOne day that is what Fox called the polish camp camp yeah uh\nAnd by the way that if he was telling me the polish people are not very happy with it because every they're describing is at a at a polish death camp well it happened to be important but it wasn't run by the polling you're putting trust me it was done by the German polish had nothing to do that so I mean there's there just wasn't a polar staff cat who happened to be there but\nAnyway so they're trying to make the point he had his citizenship revoked Fifteen Years ago he appealed and that was denied in two thousand five\nAnd a ... oh and find a way this guy maintain friendships with Nazi guards who also came to America under false pretenses back when he did in the late for like Nineteen forty nine and how about this for a a coincidence\nThe Nazi and his wife bought a home in Queens near La Guardia airport in Nineteen sixty six\nThey bought that home near La Guardia airport in Queens from a polish couple who were Jewish and survived the Holocaust all week and he bought their house\nThey didn't know anything about it but they do about it now and a great he's been deported\nSix thousand and by the way a he was saying well I was a you know I was a German and during the war but he he denies that he was responsible for the thing and then you have the whole question again even even the German government is saying this is a troubling situation where they call it uh the U.S ambassador to Germany called it a difficult task\nDeporting this guy back to Germany and no one's going to do with um there I assume\nI don't want to put them on trial he won't be dead you know ... before too long I Can't imagine so but I was going to happen to him now I don't know but this has been going on for almost Twenty years\nActually more than Twenty years from the family and his neighbors first realized that he was a belief was announced anyway they're going to and then people are saying hey wait a minute it was just following orders [laughter] you know and here's the other thing I actually did think about this I suppose you it was Nineteen\nForty one and you were drafted into the German army and given a gun and helmets and stuff and he said he our guard this uh enter into this camp here and is it okay so you're gardening evidence to the camp that's all you did was ... to the cap you didn't shoot anybody just stood there and guard at the entrance for a couple of years when the war was over are you a Nazi war criminal\nYou know you didn't have to be a notch you to be in now and then where am I right\nYou know you just where you were war criminal not necessarily Nazi but I mean if you'd anything that didn't stop the slaughter or whatever I mean I don't know I I don't have an answer that but clearly a ... this last known one Ninety five years old\n[noise] and then we got to know what we call the\nBike in town keeps running me over joy said now it's a vicious cycle a cycle the vicious cycle\n[noise] past presidents I was like some kind of rainy day theater play house one could be

is trying to keep everybody's spirits up\nUh he's been home for about three weeks now and he does what other eleven year old kids do as much as you can but then he gets tired really easily and he's hoping to get some racing stickers to cover his casket when he dies\nThat's what the eleven year old boy says he wants to racing's tickets are stickers to cover his casket when he died from leukemia

got sprayed with me\nAnd Paul Canton or got body slammed or the floor when police showed up after a Jefferson Airplane show in Akron, Ohio somebody phoned in a bomb threat fans started throwing rocks at the top the cops responded with tear gas and then all hell broke loose in Nineteen Seventy two in Akron, Ohio Jefferson Airplane\nNineteen Ninety six on this day Rick James gotten out of prison [noise] regime served two years for beating up a woman remember that story but ironically on this day two days earlier in Ninety six the woman he was going to\nMarry got put in jail for shoplifting a pair of thirty nine dollar boots [laughter] the [noise]\nAh let's see ... up happening around the same time yeah been on that in the report like three or four yeah yeah absolutely I almost every day

quarter after for joining the camera peach coming up later all the crap it's almost baseball game tonight at a seven year on at six for five six o'clock and we won ... different Colorado Rockies cooked for in a row from us yeah Pittsburgh we want\nWally as a ... well they went ... wins or good or a for for for all for ten sixty seven a lot of things going on including Michael Cohen the president's personal lawyers in court right now pleading guilty\nTo a bank fraud and tax evasion or something again and has nothing to do with Donald Trump's election has nothing to do with Donald Trump's so-called Russian collusion Paul Manafort's jury is now in its fourth day they sent another note to the judge\nAnd clearly they're stuck on something we don't know whether they're stuck on one of the Eighteenth things or on all parts of the things we don't know\nBut there are Manafort jury is or has some of the new no to the judge so they're struggling with something\nOr if I'm guessing that there's no way to like I'm totally guessing my guess is they're going to have to convict him of something or or also feel they waste your time wasting their time I think I'm guessing so that probably get 'em convicted of something but I don't know whether it'd be will probably will be everything by a long shot\nAnd how about this story here in Georgia a very very sad story ally handwritten could've been a lot worse oh\nI'll I'll Hendra Suarez is uh twenty six year old mother [laughter] excuse me\n[noise] uh who uh had her kids in the car she took two children inside their grandmother's house a couple of weeks ago\nActually about ten days ago I took two kids into her grandmother into the grandmother's house and left them there and then uh she went about her business and then realized that she had left another kid in the\nCar for about three hours a three year old child she left in the car outside the grandmother's house now this was in the afternoon eight o'clock that night the woman realized what she had done and called nine one one and said my God Bless my kid in the car\nAnd so the cop showed up and they arrested her\nAnd they took the boy to a physical checkup at the hospital he's in good condition he's fine uh but uh miss Juarez was arrested for child cruelty\nEven though she said oh my God my kids in the car called the cops to make sure he was okay for them to the hospital is going to be fine and now she's arrested she's being cooperative with the police\nBut my God she's charged with second degree cruelty to children\nUh she drop your kids off to grandma's house third was had fallen asleep in the car or she went home and realize later it was like eight o'clock you realize that kid was must still be in the car and she called the cops on herself and they arrested her and put her in jail what happens when you were a snitch that's right things do you know your\nSelf snitching a slightly different story\nOr a for for for all four to six years of it you know I don't understand how Michael Cohen can be an all this trouble\nAs Trump's lawyer when the only reason he's in trouble is because the FBI broke into his office and is a home and his condo apartment that he stays in when he's not home with the family and they stole all the stuff including all this tape recordings as a uh conversations with clients including the president United States all his lawyers notes\nAnd then they supposedly are saying well we only looked at the ones that are relevant to our charge uh-huh they took 'em all they took all of it\nIf it's not it's not rocket stop on time yes exactly what they did that's what they did and the same thing\nWith Manafort wasn't a Manafort they broke into his house at three o'clock in the morning or something if he would have showed up and then he went to they would have said hey come on down we're going to rescue night I'll be I'll be there\nI mean but no they show up to you know break into the house brand class and the doors and just to show Donald Trump and by the way Manafort\nOr his trial has nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing and Michael Cohen his up pleading guilty today has to do with his tax evasion and his bank fraud has nothing to do with Donald Trump's presidency or a campaign or the Russians\nSo so far Robert Mueller's investigation for millions of dollars over two years has resulted in two trials that have nothing to do with Donald Trump\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd you know he's not gonna yeah he is not going to ever clear Donald Trump Mohler we'll never clear Donald Trump

they've been best with close friends best friends for Twenty years\nI tell you this whole thing is just a ... it's obviously a conflict of interest in when when Donald Trump talks about the angry
