used car what if people need to know when they're going to go by when they've made up their mind I'm going to buy used\n[noise] well [noise] I I'm going to kind of back into this\nFirst place you need to know where it's coming from All right um he's one of the things that happened people were going to individuals because they didn't want to pay the sales tax to a dealer and they didn't want to pay the dock these okay the dock the by the way is just snake oil money that's all it is it's additional dealer profit period no more no less\nA but they all do it and that they can't charge one and not another if you raise enough hell with them they'll back it out of the deal but it's still going to be on there\nAre doctor he was thirty two dollars back then we had people wouldn't pay it and once in a blue moon the guy said if you don't cross that line I'm not going to take the car so we do it in the minute hit the office they'd take it right back out of the of the deal but the ... back\nYou know so it's it's it's it's one of those things um\nWhere are you by the car is very very important you've got to watch some of these places like Craig's list for example\nUm they're real quick when I had lunch with a friend of mine not too long ago he wanted me to talk to his son he sees a thirty five hundred series dodge diesel truck for sale in California uh probably thirty thousand dollar thirty five thousand dollar truck for eighty five hundred dollars he calls them guys will tell you what I'll do it if you'll wire me the money right now our ship it to you free\nTo go to the bank and why is it five hundred dollars you know you're looking at a probably Fifteen hundred dollar trait to ship that car from California\nAnd ah I mean it was just too ludicrous but he just sat there he acted like he didn't care about us he's lost eighty five hundred dollars he's tried to call him back now no answer phones gone but they're out there they're doing this stuff's if you see something\nThat huge thinks it's too good to be true it probably is\nSo be real careful and especially when they say to you yeah I'm In the military and I'm Out on a I'm On maneuvers in Guam but to cars all packed up and shipped in Omaha Nebraska ready to go just wire the money what you want to wire them as a dial tone stay away from this okay I'm\nA ... another thing real quick you attacked by the ... maybe talk a little bit also about the um what's\nChanged with the title feet now that that's a little\nOkay well the the dealers um the problem before was that people would go in and then two individuals because they don't want to pay sales tax okay well today there is no more sales tax so the deal is love they're so the playing field level whether you go to an individual or you go buy it from a dealer\nThey it's called the uh TV taxes they titled transfer attacks and just to give you a quick example if I have a car sitting outside then you want to buy and sell it to you you go to the DMV you're going to have to pay the tax and two days later Jim wanting you sell to him Jim's going to have to pay that tax\nUm where it benefits you is if you're keeping the car if you're going to keep the cartoon have three years you're way ahead of the game because tags only twenty dollars a year\nAnd well you can get caught in this is let's say you go to a deal you bought you pay the seven percent sales tax back then or eight depending on where you are and um your birthdays ten months later on that rolls around that you could get hit for the long tax this encompasses all that there is no more Advil on tax and there is no more sales tax is the TV ... which\nBenefits you by holding on to the ... car if you're if you're\nBuying or raping rise it back to real quick about should you buy the year and year old car two year old car remember nobody drives a new car the minute you go across the curb so few by last year's model you have an instant one year old car and and it's going to be looked at that way even though it's a low mileage car you're going to get a big hit 'em so is it really worth the price not to me\nAren't defense right I I Would have had it with him I get in the end of the month you want to sell if you don't there's plenty of the deal as to how much over are you going to sell me the car or what would you do\nAnd if you can keep them close to end voice also another thing always check with your bank a credit union see what they'll do so then you'll know you'll have an intelligent answer as to what the loan is what your interest rate will be before you walk in there\nAnd and like I said I Would weigh this warranty a a very closely I I see so many people that they they they come out of there they're just shaking their head thinking they're going to have at three fifty payment and it's six hundred dollars time you get through with all these other things that you're you're buying\nAnd remember even when you're looking at these numbers of TV tax has to be paid for so if they're going to finance that as well as the warranty you know it it runs up quick\nWell you know when I was wondering Richard when we when you when you go to a dealership where do they get their used cars where do they come from\nOkay here's the deal but we used to do um we had a big rental fleet but on a daily rental fleet you don't see quite as much of that today and the dealers because it's too competitive everybody has to loan your car um what I Would do when I was short I would either\nGo to other dealers or go to the auctions things have changed a lot today a lot and especially when you big chains the used car managers a lot of them are not allowed to wholesale cars\nMultitude of reasons and again we're getting off here another tangent but a used car manage it can make or break a dealership\nIf he doesn't put enough money in the car you can't trade it if he puts too much money in the car they call at water in your inventory you turn around Ninety Days later you got a whole bunch of cars sitting out in the back\nAnd you got a tremendous amount of water 'cause he didn't have praise them right I've seen many a dealership or when they used car manager quits gets fired he'll hand somebody a little black book which is our our main Bible back then and he'll say hey this guy's been here six months good fella you're the used car manager here's the book as very dangerous thing to do\nUm if he says to well I mean one story after another you best probably leaving that alone okay but if you go to the guy and you look at it you want to check the V. I. N. number that's on the titled against the V. I. N. number that's on the attack\nI mean excuse me on the vehicle to make sure that's correct look at the date uh how long he's had the car now here's something that's very important to look and see what the miles is showing my age discrepancies are nightmares I Wish we had more time 'cause I got some great stories to tell you about that\nBut anyway um make sure if you buy that car that they put the miles on the back of the car because he's certifying that to you if you ever sell your car the same exact thing do not ever give somebody an open title and by the way it's the man's name is Bob Smith that you're going to see\nAnd the title on the front as Bob Smith and you flip it over now it says a a bill Jones on the back the titles dead\nThat title cannot be transferred dealers can do it with delivery assignments once it goes in an individual's name it's over it now has to be titled in the man's name who's on the back or you have to get an affidavit of correction a notarized documents taking that off raising red flags to me\nA lot of cars have got stickers on the doors defenders\nSome on the ... of course it's about a two two and a half inch sticker and they'll have the serial number of the car look and see if your car has it don't look on the drivers door because you don't want to convince a confused that with a factory sticker these are factory stickers\nBut if this has been an accident for example has been hit on the right side the stickers there'll be missing\nSo once you see that that stickers they are they should be on the panels\nWill you know Richard was saying that always bothered me about selling a used car was you know you you you put it out there and you advertise it and most people have the car at their house and you have these ... I mean you don't know who's coming to your house it's true I mean talk about that aspect of that so it was kind of\nConcerned me well if it was a lady for example I Would try to have some mail there to just keep an eye on it and or make them in a public place\nLike I said I'm reversing the role if it was you and the ... thing I Would prefer you went to the man's house\nThere have been so many scenarios I've seen them all family goes out of town nephew staying at the house or maybe he's got a drug habit the cars are sitting there he knows where the titles are hate advertisers to car real cheap to move it and he tells you yeah I'm such and such there's nothing wrong with asking to see the driver's license so the man's selling the car\nAnother thing I'm not a big fan of his I got a credit union give me a cashier's check to the credit union I'm not a big fan of that\nYou know unless you can just afford to lose the money what I say to people is if there's a payoff and I'm fine with the pay off I'll meet you at the bank tell them to have the title sometimes they have electronic titles an hour it's not been issued you need a letter from the credit union sharing you the loans paid off and that they're going to clear the title\nBut never pay somebody without that and or in diameter certificate\nBecause you know years ago wasn't illegal lot of people did it by the dealerships ... it was a very common place I I Would not I can't put a percentage on it today but I can tell you I'm sure it's still going on\nSo if you sell a car and your car has got a lot of miles you make darn sure those miles are written on the back of the title\nAnd if your car's a hundred and forty three thousand two hundred fifty miles you put one forty three do not put a comma they don't want to just put just write the numbers and if you make a mistake you better be real careful because any alteration on that mileage in any way the state will kick it\nWell you know Richard real quick how how do you find out what your car's worth how do you how do you how do people know that are listening right now how how can they go and find\nOut when it's a it's a very good very good question Dan I'm you do a lot of homework on it or go to any da guys for example I think that that's one of your most accurate um fill out the information and then go on line and look\nAnd try to look at cars in this area you know you go I look out west there higher um Georgia Alabama cars generally bring real premium money and again that's something else if we had more time and talking about cars that have been an accident and depreciation value with insurance companies is is something else that people need to know about\n'em or another question people ask me all the time or say I've got a lease and I've got to turn the car in and it's got a bunch of dings on\nLeasing is not all that you think it is leasing is very profitable for the deal that I Do not recommend leasing a car\nI had a friend at least one for a nanny it was a foreigner and they turned the car back and he got a bill for five thousand dollars after the thing went back and so when you started and all that up to get the idea

I got to address\nThat one right away because I sat untapped money we're talking about then I have to talk about a loophole which I Love with the Trump tax plan that can be a financial windfall plus how you can avoid or certainly minimize\nTaxes on your Social Security benefits I just told you that one drives me crazy because it's like a double tax thing to let's dive right in number one retirement tax trap the one that drives me crazy Social Security you know I talk so much about Social Security on the show because\nIt's a pillar of your financial plan it's a pillar of your financial plan but it's a gotcha [noise]\nIt's got you because people don't know how to maximize it and it's a gotcha because\nYou could pay taxes on as much as eighty five percent of those Social Security benefit and what else happens at the same time is it raises your Medicare premiums and most people don't realize this or they don't even really know what's happening we pointed out when you come in\nAnd when you when you get that tax bill it's really too late at that point there is nothing much we can do so we like to be proactive and look down the road we project down the road for you and make changes now that affect you for decades\nYeah that's how long you're going to be in retirement we're talking decades and you got to count on that money it's really important we don't want that to be a fraction of what\nYou thought it was going to be so\nWe got to do something about it you know Forbes is all over this I've I've read these quotes before\nFrom Forbes just about the concept of taxing your Social Security and how low those thresholds are before that becomes taxable\nYou don't have to make very much money if you're earning between twenty five and thirty four thousand dollars once your income surpasses thirty four thousand dollars you're gonna pay\nTaxes on eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits so we don't have a lot to work on ... ... ... work with here it's a thirty four thousand dollar number but we can do it we do it all the time we do it all the time\nNow it's a little higher if you're married that's fine you know faces up that will be more than forty four thousand dollars if you're a married couple\nBut forty four thousand dollars for a married couple is not a lot of money that can quickly tax those Social Security benefits so\nForbes is all over this I'm I applaud them for being 'cause I think it's very very important\nNow here's what else can happen your benefits at the same time you're getting whacked on Social Security they're throwing you into a higher tax bracket\nSo that that will also trigger a whole avalanche of other taxes and\nHow are these Social Security benefits going to impact your other investments you got to be able to answer this question before you claim those benefits it's very very important that we plan around that there's a lot there's a lot here that I could go through just on this one topic alone\nEighty five percent that's what I said\nAccording to the Irish when you claim your Social Security benefits\nYou can and we see it get taxed as much as on eighty five percent of your benefits so that money which you absolutely we're counting on to help pay for your retirement it becomes a small fraction of what you thought it was going to be and that drives me crazy\nYou know what your best defense to ensure that you bring up you squeeze out every single nickel of your benefits is to get a customized\nSocial Security analysis even with everything else we give you we want to give you

possible that you can save thousands of dollars in taxes every\nYear in retirement and I'm telling you you absolutely that\nYou can you can and that's what I've been going over with this entire show it's a favorite topic of mine in fact I've been telling you how you can avoid five specific retirement tax traps now when you\nCome in and see us in you know my chosen CPA wealth advisors are Rollins financial they're incredible they're not just investment advisers I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that investment management or wealth planning is not\nSimply about your investments in fact that's the smallest part that's the smallest part there's so much more that goes into wealth planning the full circle\nCPAs are just the best at it man you're talking about guys that have been dealing with reducing your taxes\nFor decades so that is what I'm Talking about I Can't keep the live feed going on you know be way too long tuned in for those of you watching Facebook Live tune into new talk one oh six seven a year the rest\nI'm going to say goodbye to you live on Facebook and continue with the ah Amir listeners\nNow\nLet's talk about this a more I'm On retirement tax trap number three retirements tax trap number three is not switching to a Ross\nIRA or a Ross four O. one K. yep this is a big one and here's the thing that confuses me it's it's kind of a lay up a lot of times and so many times [noise]\nExample after example particularly from this one from I Can't mention their name I Wish I could they absolutely ignore this they know who they are they're big they are large they're here in the Atlanta area and they missed the show often [noise]\nThey they don't encourage or they don't set up the mechanisms to have their clients switch to a Roth IRA ... four one K. yeah let me set up some basics and I know you may know this may sound obvious but I Want to I still want to say it you know that you're four one K.\nAllows for those tax free contributions and then when you take the money out that's what we've been talking about why by the government it's taxed right that's a pre tax account and when you're Seventy and a half\nIt's also going to be subject to required minimum distributions means you've got to take the money out and you're going to pay taxes now a Ross\nIraq does not allow any tax free contributions to you don't necessarily get that up front satisfaction\nBut you'll pay zero taxes when you withdraw the money and retirement and you don't have to deal with those required minimum distributions on the rocks that means tax free grows now here's where I'm going with this here's what's missed\n[noise] even if you haven't made any Ross contributions you're now entering into retirement so just visualize this in your plan you're doing into retirement and then about let's say six months or a year what's gonna happen to your overall income\nIt's going to drop isn't it and it's going to drop by a lot and guess what happens when your income drops to your tax bracket\nIt goes down hugely could go down as low as ten percent could go down as low as zero percent [noise]\nThis is where we step back how baby we love this one we love this one you see what we see there is opportunities and we do this year after year to convert those free tax account into a rough\nNow when you do that conversion and this is where the magic sauce has to come in you're taxed on the amount of money that you convert to take a certain amount of your pre tax accounts you can avert them into Iraq that is taxable income\nSo the art here is how much do you convert\nWell just enough so that you don't get it taxed more than ten percent and then er golden and we can do that year after year and many of you\nWell yeah well I don't know and so forth but yet you're sitting in a whole bucket of Castro that emergency fund\nAnd you can live off of that where you don't have to withdraw from those pre tax accounts wall or in this conversion mode if you when you live off of that\nSavings that you have that are in regular investment accounts that's not taxable\nSo this is really how we go about massaging plans and we really focus on this because that is tax planning that's just an example it's going to be different for everybody but that's a big deal that's a big deal now also one more thing\nThe new Trump tax plan there are some things to look out for what converting to a rough\nAnd also Roth re characterization that means oh I converted too much into the Ross and\nI didn't stay in that lower tax bracket this is a big change with the new Chuck Trump tax plan\nWell here's the thing retirees you really are going to face or hurt or here when you do a rough conversion because when you do it it's hard to know exactly how much you're going to pay in taxes until typically the years over well it used to be\nThat you could do that Rob conversion all the way up until the time you filed your tax return not anymore\nYou can't undo it you only have through December thirty first so we really have to be precise\nNow who was best to do a tax projection for you\nWho has been doing tax projections their whole career well it's a CPA from that ... also has a tax department which is we're all in financial that's what they do they can't do this by hand they're going to run those numbers for you\nI mean is your investment advisor doing that it's really complicated and it's really important you see this is all about what we do this is in fact I Know a lot of you have heard a lot about the new Trump tax plan but you're not necessarily doing anything about it because I see it I see you come in\nAnd really little attention has been given how it impacts those who are retired or nearing retirement and for some people converting your IRA or your four one K. tour Ross\nIt could potentially save you tens of thousands of dollars possibly more and but you don't know when you run the numbers\nAnd I'm asking you argue capitalizing on your opportunities with the new Trump tax plan well why not let a show you how some of these little known loopholes can potentially save you fouls in the dollars with a complementary Ross review\nWhy not why wouldn't you do that\nNow all you have to do to schedule and here's what can happen you're going to call this phone number you'll get our core wraps\nThey're going to ask you for a little bit of info be

unique situation their\nOwn unique story and we know that we want to know what that is and we want to be able to help them individually so sometimes it firms do get bigger but you need to have a plan in place to still take care of your clients\nAnd there's nothing wrong with being old school if you mentioned that\nYou know I I don't ... I Believe in customer service I Believe and talk to the people live on the phone I really do\nAbsolutely well another person mark says I went to a dinner seminar with a financial adviser and found them to be very entertaining and engaging much more so than my current advisor should\nI switched to this new guy\nWell what's entertaining engaging [laughter]\nI mean [laughter] I mean is that the criteria they just do like comedy show or the song and dance I maybe I mean you know what does that mean [laughter] or you know you can have someone who may be a good communicator but then again they may be slick talking yeah\nSo you know one thing that we really really harp on and I and I do regular appearances here in Atlanta on TV and\nAnd we talk about how important it is to work with a fiduciary\nAnd if it do Sherry should always be looking out for your best interest there is no broker in the in that person's ear saying you need to sell this product\nYou need to make sure you know you use these funds because these funds make us more money where we get a kick back from these funds\nI mean there's big companies big banks big firms out here that actually get a kickback from mutual fund companies if you use their funds are you kidding me yeah how can that be it's what's best for the client\nSo you know the way I look at it as don't get caught up and all that\nMake sure that when you're talking to a person who doesn't mean that that person's bad because they're a good communicator it just means that you got to make sure you ask the right questions how do you get paid for do share those things\nYou here's another question for you and I think this is really a legitimate question a lot of people probably have this because people tend to move around I like my advisor but I've recently moved to a different state and I'm Wondering if I should be working with somebody local instead\nWell yes I think there is some value to that and we see that a lot here especially in the Atlanta area because we're such a transient city just this week I've had to folks to families\nBoth from Michigan by the way I mean I don't know what it is about Michigan maybe it's just not a lot of migration south but both of these families one has had a long term relationship with their financial firm\nAnd really the financial firms in a really good job for them when we did the analysis I really couldn't find anything that I dislike the what the firm was doing but they had come to the realization that it made sense to work with someone local\nAnd they you know they told the financial advisor because they were going to be here in Georgia for the rest of their lives is is there\nThis is where they're going to retire that they needed to\nShift from you know just the investment firm to more of a holistic financial advisor that's going to put together a retirement plan and income plan we call that our financial roadmap\nThat's literally going to sit there and look at health care issues how do we pay for those extra health care expenses that's going to look at the tax sufficiency up their portfolio that's going to manage the risk and volatility so that you know the closer they get to retirement or in retirement\nTheir portfolio doesn't look the same as they were when they were twenty thirty forty years old because one thing we cannot allow to have happen is loose thirty forty percent of that portfolio and in some cases you won't be able to retire you'll have to if you're already retired possibly go back to work\nTo make up for the ... huge losses that could happen in the stock market so sometimes it makes sense to work with someone local\nHey let me just say that to you know a lot of people find themselves in that situation and I'm Glad that a particular person you were just talking about this couple came in and they found you to talk to you about that yeah they\nThey interviewed several firms um but they you know they end up choosing not to because they knew that the plan we put together\nYou know one thing I Do run I think a little different than people here in that I talked to this is what I'm this is what I'm hearing from folks who come in is that we explain things more simple I'm proud of that I'm proud when someone says you know I understand what you're saying no one's talking over my head\nAnd then another thing I hear is not only do you tell me what you do\nBut you tell me why you do it yeah I support and I think people need to know why we recommend what we recommend and I think by explaining that there's more of a comfort level\nMm okay one last question I Want to throw out here and in our greener grass on the other side conversation market the market crashed and I lost a ton of money in my portfolio is that a reason to change advisors\nWhoa again you know everyone's situation is different Ron I mean if I'm the again like I mentioned earlier from Thirty years old and\nYou're vested a hundred percent into stocks\nThen you know your portfolio is going to go up and down it's going to be you know I call that the big roller coaster\nNow I Know that I've got Eighteen year old clients where I Know how to tweak that portfolio to potentially long term get the highest return for the risk worth taking\nAnd you do that through diversification not having all of your eggs in one basket not having all of your eggs at a handful of stocks not trying to chase returns but having a really well balanced approach a bean diversified in many many different pieces of pie\nBut the key here is is that if you're closer to retirement\nWe owe the the finished product of a music superstar the sold out performances the TV and I didn't have\nAny eventually something Randy [noise]\nLike I don't I think the way to get to that stage two hours and hours of practice the traveling the printing the improvement all these little details happened in the background we now that noticing and you know what your financial mine's girl picks together financial plan for you in much the same range may make the process is easy for you on the surface\nAnd you'll get some marvel product your plan\nBut don't forget about the all important details and kind of going on in the background to print of your financial masterpiece and remember your plan to be a thing of beauty county when your financial my son Michael ... serving the Atlanta area called eight hundred and forty nine point here eight eight hundred seven\nForty nine forty here eighty [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nJohnny Cash at the state was approached by an advertising company not give permission to ease ring of fire on an ad for him right brain surgery last was freaky [noise] on a similar note here the financial symphonies we requested that Johnny Cash and the date allow us to use Folsom Prison as our theme song\nThat requests for South every piece but keep listening anyway\nBack now with more of the financial symphony mark Lloyd your financial maestro the founder and principal at the Lloyd group and Lloyd advisory services\nHome of the boy learning center and Merkel and it's the same guy that you see on Fox five Atlanta basing it on Fox Business

and then you can look at your calendar and all that kind of thing\nWas talking about finishing the race and by that I mean getting through retirement can be a lot like running a marathon marketing to Europe\nMarathon runner yourself yeah right here being sarcastic yes I Am [laughter] but none of us like you're a marathon runner in Europe or is it might have a marathon runners on here in our dream of there\nAre some things there are some similarities to marathon runners and folks who are getting ready to retire so I thought we could talk about some of the similarities are first of all you don't just go out of here and we'll run a marathon without thinking about it or without preparing for it\nThere's a great deal of planning and preparation that goes into that so you can do it and the same goes for your retirement planning\nYeah when you think about it I Do have some friends who are runners and they love the run and they're constantly training\nYou know most marathoners will spend I'd read an article one time at least six months and training before they even think about it yeah you know mixing in days would light runs and some days long runs and they simulate what a marathon would be so that they're ready for it when it when the when the time comes\nYou know the other day that might be doing a shorter fast runs sprints and things like that\nIn your retirement plan you should have different buckets of money invested in different ways does the same thing you trained differently you need to have your money invested differently because there's different things that your money is needed for so we talked about having a rainy day bucket of money you know that we can get to it's at the bank\nYou know unfortunately it's not hardly earning any interest but that's why we don't put a whole lot there and we just put enough there to take care of emergencies and you know I like to say a rule of thumb that if we lost our job we need to have six months worth of income in there you know to be we can get our hands on\nYou know but anything above and beyond that unless you have something you're getting ready to buy or spend it on you probably need to have that invested so it may be something that's more conservative maybe interest and dividends something that we can get some higher interest but we can get to the money if we need to\nWe also need to have some money put away more long term was a long term ten plus years we need that money to grow because of the light and you mentioned of ill or your retirement like a marathon\nTo me a retirement as a thirty year window\nYou know I Want to see my clients go all the way the age one hundred without the fear running out of money that could be thirty five to forty year window it is a marathon\nSo we need to have some money growing long term to keep up with longevity and to make sure that we're going to have money when we get into our seventies eighties nineties or whenever\nYou know and then we also need to have income buckets buckets where we can supplement our Social Security even if we have a pension it may be a smaller pension or maybe there is no cost of living on your pension and we need to be able to pull income interest and dividends or you know maybe some structured income to supplement\nThat Social Security check it's critical that money does it need to be risky we need to have that money more conservative because the last thing we want to do is be drawing income from a bucket of ...\nLee that's losing money that means we're locking in law says that will never get back every time we cash a check\nSo it's critical that we have the risk under control we can have some risk in some buckets but somebody just need to be safer so when we have folks come in we talk about the power\nOf having different buckets of money where you don't have all of your eggs in one basket we've heard that term forever don't put all your eggs in one basket it's critical that you don't do that\nIn retirement you're listening to the financial symphony and we certainly appreciate your being there and and Mark I'm I'm not talking about you here but I'm Talking about listeners out there who may be marathon runners I'm guessing that if you're a marathon runner you probably have a pretty good diet\nAnd uh that's one of the reasons that I'm not American on just one of the many you know an athlete in general yeah actually\nI had an opportunity to meet Michael Phelps when he was training for the Olympics did you read one time at the amount of food that that man I had to eat [laughter]\nTo have all the you know and how many carbs he ate just to have the energy to swim all those you know racism everything any kind of training like that you know you got to make sure your body burns cards more efficiently than it burns fat so I mean these are things that athletes will tell you all the time in retirement planning\nYou need to be paying very very close attention to your portfolio in the years leading up to retirement\nSo before this correction that we've had here recently\nAnd the month of September\nThe market's hit an all time high we hit a the longest Bull Run and the history of Wall Street we used to say that was in the nineties not any more it's now we hit the largest Bull Run in the history of Wall Street where back in March of two thousand nine the last crashed we had\nThe Dow Jones industrial close it's sixty five forty seven that was the low and then got the twenty six thousand in January gave some back then got backed up to twenty six thousand again in September ... given some back bottom line is that is the largest Bull Run in the history of Wall Street\nNow there is no calendar that tells us that the Bull Run is over\nBut we've got to be prepared that in case there is something going on something blows up there's a you know bubble out here that burst we do end up you know not being able to come to a agreement with China and then that trade war accelerates\nYou know something happens geo politically\nI read an article where the scrolling through a Yahoo Finance and I read in the headlights of the article is to you know Donald Trump junior be ready to go to jail I mean like you know something like that happens you know I'm not wanting to get into politics I'm not going to talk politics\nBut if something think about if something like that happens what effect does that have on our portfolio\nWe need to make sure the closer we are to retirement that we know exactly or at least how they stress tests performed the no the impact it's going to have on our portfolio going down because we don't want to have that happened when it's too late when we've lost our paycheck but\nWe're talking about the parallels between running a marathon and preparing for your retirement and you know experience marathoners notice that you can't go out and start to fast you have to pace yourself but if you're a beginning marathoner you might make that mistake of starting to fast and that can put you in a whole heap of trouble\nOh exactly you're a burned out and you know you see that happen every time the Olympics on the longer races where somebody's come out of the blocks and they're setting the pace and then some on in the back that there was not even in the picture", "show_name": "The Shannon Burke Show", "year": "2018", "city":
