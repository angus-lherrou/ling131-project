chill out a you know don't tell anybody I'm Serious about that make sure that you sign your ticket I Would make a couple of copies and hold on\nHear you should sign your ticket yet you should put it in a safe deposit box set up a trust fund or a blind trust and then find it in the name of the trust that way you can remain\nThat's the best idea is to get in there and somebody\nTold us floors you like to be for money whatsoever every one oh yeah ... hey do you know can you come up with a couple of million you know like I'm Out of the woodwork so I don't want people to know that I had the money\nWell that's why you set up something called her vocal trust or vocal living trust and now that trust is no longer and your name it is in the name of the trust\nWhat can they build every one where you can end the trust whatever you want I wouldn't want a name of the ... so probably not dead giveaway [laughter]\n\nSo I set up a lot of trust and trust and then when you eventually when you know my lawyers go down to the lottery I Would definitely have the money that I stay at home\nDefinitely that's great\nYeah and and you know the big thing is getting your tax plan in place because you can choose to take the lump sum and pay taxes or you can take this over thirty installments it's up to you about how you take the cash but still you have to have a tax plan because there are

the money upfront to worry about the money or the bank to that\nYeah the dirt in terms of income and it's like they should have the money to turn off of that principle that's right\nBut the risk is there was a lot of people Shannon that have won lotteries and then they go broke because they buy a car they get a yacht they did they think they can buy an island and so the question is do have the discipline to really manage that money right once you get it\nNo that's why I'm calling you had you been able to manage the money I mean I don't I Can't see who I Can't name names obviously but I've

from that and if you're white you can't claim your black\nUnless you got curly hair like that one brought up in a you know there was the white trick the polar which was black and white parents pay for it is it that low\nAnd they hate her and she when she she didn't do anything worse than what he didn't do you think she ran the N. double ACP as a black woman she's going to say the first woman of color or\nWashed Harvard said that was because she told her that all the claim that she and then afterwards outta that she was why she says she identified\nAnd there's a bizarre that no one ever asked for any proof of that yeah you have to take their word for it she's a woman yeah you can get you questioning her old women should be believed\nSee I think that's worse than the N. double ACP women they way the people I mean wasn't trying to get any special favors no she's looking at about his black she just wanted to be part of the N. double ACP\nBut I wanted to hang out with black people all the building you know she can do anyways you lose the white person\nBut for some reason [laughter] unbelievable I think what would happen during this way worse\nShe got a job ... well that that lady

along with the election I should've said that after she was going to turn and she came and it was awesome and we went to ... I'll go out a blast\nCool was lost but it's funny story training with what you've got to talk about what can be in a so ... sister has a very very very sick husband and he had to have the bone marrow transplant and his sister was the ball now I don't\nKnow so now he's got his sister's bloodhounds so her adult daughter did a DNA and ... or ... whatever those things aren't right she did one of those and got super upset because when the ... came back I came back\nThat her father was actually ... stated it shouldn't Dina that it was her uncle that what was her father\nAnd she was and she had an adult so she has a dealt with their own hidden sure like what do you mean that's not my father you know like what like they they were all foot\nDown and and um and\nThen my sister explained to us as a funny story that yeah because he had his sister in law and narrow from the transfusion several years ago the day the DNA picked up on that basically has ... changed and picked up that how far that DNA why now Carl\nPerson wow that is weird wow right huh\nHow do I do that would change you did have you got a bone marrow donation the transplant\nYeah but but kind of makes sense right well let's see if we had the surgery like well I've been like lab and Robert since I'm a ... and they basically enjoying his whole body if you well and then put her bone marrow his sister in law now 'cause she will not\nGo to his body and it will be generated his blood\nAnd so now with his DNA is done it's hard and I\nShow and so when he when ... when my niece which I Know in the beginning very convoluted and confusing but when ... when when it came back that her father actually now being able to why it was going back to coming up here that are ...\nThat is weird I what I mean I guess maybe a dog bone marrow different but I Wonder if uh if if you got a blood transfusion in the hospital you know uh I don't know who have measured in a while that's a weird story how was your family your sister came

really a full blooded that\nClose to me and not have a considerable amount more well that just cause cause a huge city in my family all my aunts got upset with me they couldn't explain it they were
