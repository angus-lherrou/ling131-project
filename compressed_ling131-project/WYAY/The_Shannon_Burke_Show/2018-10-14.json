guest is going to be coming up caffeine Abraham a gang Carmen ...\nGood morning Shelley it's been a while we just ran out we just rent but you forgot about us\nNo nope not at all um but I I did want to make a comment or regards to the Eric Holder\nOn comet ass kicking and kicking people and we kick them you know Rand Paul I think they have very good point when he said the rhetoric\nAnd not everyone will take that rhetoric and apply it uh you know everyone would take that rhetoric and use it in a way that going to hurt someone else but what the media is reporting is it there are many incidents\nThat have happened and that are happening that they did you I'm In the Washington state where his truck was shot at yard he could have been in that vehicle absolutely there is\nThat a pro life I'm pro life acted is that an has gone she had to have police protection and\nPeople there are some very unstable people out there so when these people use rhetoric like is I heard no one asked Eric Holder you know well what does it what ... what what you mean when you sit and you what do you mean when you say by kicking kick them when they're down what exactly\nDoes that mean what does that mean you mean by that exactly laugh they actually left\nYes yes well I'm Angela Davis was in Atlanta last night and you know for those who don't know age ... she's a former Black Panther a member a former member of the ... party she is an activist she has just for some things on my resume reform some things that I think have been good but I'm a ...\nIn particular she um and I know a young woman that went to the to the meeting last night at in particular on the Web site where Angela Davis was I'm accepting I guess the um people that were coming in and taking the\nAwesome now what is the age to have a conversation with your teenagers around opioids and stuff because I can imagine when I was growing up hard drugs were hard drugs you knew heroin you knew cocaine you knew we were back then we'd was considered a hard drugs\nWhat you knew what these things where you couldn't buy them in a store you had to go some CD plays and behind the de ... alley\nWay or something you know what I mean do you sort of heroin addict to walk down the street in stolen bright guy named Keith in our neighborhood stole my mother's battery out of her car and then when she came down to leave work he had a battery for sale and he was trying to write back her own battery so we knew repeatedly with the problems you know now\nLike these drugs as in the case with your your son these drugs are coming over the counter\nThese drugs are proud of there's an implied it's okay for you to do because it's being sold and\nPrescribe by Dr so how do we have a conversation with our children around drug abuse when the drugs are actually coming from doctors\nWell and they're coming from the doctors and then uh and then these these kids at that age are then selling them back to other kids on the street you know so it's kind of going from one thing to the other end and basically what happens at what's happening is that\nYou know they get into the wrong hands and they may precedent and all and to them to try to make them cheaper and then that's\nAnd what happened when my son has he got hold of a drug that had sent and all in it and that's basically a lead little you know a combination but um as far as conversations um in retrospect you know I I Wish that we would have had I'd I'd do more in depth conversation when he was in middle school\nAnd Ali unethical Yes sir and as an educator I really feel you know the average age these kids are experimenting with drugs is now nine years old wow so as as a teenager I think fourth and fifth grade I'd say it's great for sure yeah right wow yeah we need to be aware and parents think that we are where\nI couldn't imagine and fifth grade having this conversation I Know with my parents in fifth grade oh my God I\nArea and it you know and it's a matter of the depths that you go into it but just to know at least as as a parent and there are other parents and my situation to just say hey you know Mr Abraham or Cathy Avraham sun passed away he was the all American Kid and the middle class community\nRight and it can happen to anybody you know he wasn't that typical like you were describing right behind the dumpster and by doing that I met\nA should parents should parents get word ... I I went to the doctor several years goes in a\nCar accident we went to the hospital and they gave me the um oxycontin and I refused to take it um because you know I've had my past and I've gone through my stuff in life and so I refuse to take I didn't want to take this stuff I heard a lot about I don't want to take it but\nShould should parents back off of 'em are there are kids being prescribed\nADHD medicine pain medicine all these kinds of things that such a young age should they just say hey you know when my kids in pain right now they're ride it out\nWell I I Know that there are certain situations where the ADHD medication is very effective now the interesting thing was my son was prescribed that as a as a freshman in high school and as a teacher all through his elementary middle school years on my key\nYou never had problems with that before you know and I think that you know doctors are readily want to give something to it because you're when you go to the dogs you're looking for a prescription\nBasically if you don't leave with a prescription most people are unhappy gotcha but I think that we need to be real cognizant of of the history and I should have probably not let him you know that prescription go through but as far as the pain meds um you know I think they're really back off but I think you know the extra strength Tylenol\nYou know things like that we don't need to go straight for the pain meds although if they do require them to maybe just go at lower doses fewer you know fewer pills that sort of thing and not this you know one prescription for thirty pills\nAnd right here you go exactly her father\nDay that's it's it's extreme but um I think kinda tapering off but yeah we just need to be super cognizant of the amount and I know that that the state of Georgia is cracking down on that also uh fortunately we have that either side\nAnd I ... I think the state of I think governor deal is done a wonderful job of cracking down on a blank ... who's running for governor is has been talking about it and one of the things I Do disagree with well I don't think I disagree with it as much as I Want to see them just go a step further is is the insurance companies on their own volition or cracking down on paying for\nDrugs so when you get a prescription for thirty oxycontin assumption\nInsurance coverage just say no we're only going to give you three you know we're only going to correctly\nSo that's a good thing but I think the doctors to I think we need to start cracking down on these doctors who so willy nilly prescribing these pills to our children\nWell and it's interesting you say that because I just got information that uh the U.S attorney general's office\nAnd our district of Georgia here a BJ retarded pack yes he has yet recently cracked down and uh\nOn the on doctors and I think there was thirty of them he sent letters to or information to that you're you're over prescribing\nYou know and we're well aware of it so yeah I'm definitely so all that together and and sadly you know for\nUs that wasn't the case when Joe was growing up but you know whatever we can do to kind of help to the future of our\nYou know adults and children here is a step in the right direction but I think\nFor parents has the education and just being aware you know as a parent you go into a doctor they prescribe your your child the pain meds because he just got for wisdom teeth out yeah that really hurts right um but when you have thirty or so\nUm it's just giving the wrong message\nAwesome thank you miss Abraham God Bless you and your family please stay strong and again if there's anything that we can do for you or we could pray will pray for you and and I noticed a tough time of year for you guys could just drove birthday is coming up so we will keep you and God Bless you and thank you so much for coming on\nOne other thing about navigate recovery is that we do have an honor Joe scholarship set up through them okay going at tech for anyone that's a recovering addict can apply to that tech and a an honor Joe scholarships for a thousand dollars for these kids that or adults that need help getting their education\nThat's awesome and going to ask them what a great ah ah drug courts too so that's a good way to catch people to take advantage of that scholarship by letting are going to the drug court and getting those graduates out of\nTheir exactly that help is out there and we're trying to increase that amount and so these folks that have had problems yeah\nGod Bless you miss Abraham All right I'm going to have me on yesterday I ride\nMy our condolences also you're listening to the best of show you went to show\nIf you're searching for a new job looking to jumpstart your career or looking for a new relationship\nThe number one thing people look at it as your smile mess ride your smile and ... and he's working dental implants are part of your make over them look no further\nHalf price dental implant dot com seven seven o seven for for two three one zero I'm a surgeon and have said to him but now I'm guaranteed the ideal implant placement\nBecause all do surgery on a computer model of you before you come in to have your Dylan plant placed on doctor for a board certified oral surgeon with over Nineteen years of dental implant surgery experience I've help hundreds of people and I can help you seven seven ... seven for for two three one zero\n... dot com for a limited time I'm offering you the deal the year half price on do implant surgery\nI please more Dylan plants in one month in most places in an entire year Paul implants in the u._s. or FDA approved same implant half the price\nWho doesn't like a bargain seven seven o seven more for two three one zero ... dot com\nHave you been lied to lie to by Washington politicians in the wall street propaganda machine ... magazine best selling author Brett kitchen and if you're over fifty five with an IRA or four one K.

that supports our show they do that yeah they do the big time yeah so someone was sales person listening\nDo we have anybody in sales or listen to any more [laughter] I'm Sorry I say in the national review of sorry I had to do the bees leading Fox five meteorologist Ryan ...\nHe's also the official the official when I say the official I mean the official the one and only meteorologist from my good friend Mike Brooks his show on from twelve to three everyday and he'll probably be on their this afternoon Hey Ron welcome back to the show he went to show\nMe your much glad to be with them\nYes sir so aware we now is that the rainiest tapering off\nYes the rain is tapering off the clouds are still sticking around uh we definitely still have some wet roads out they're standing water I'm In a few isolated pockets but again the Toronto rain\nUm has pretty much come to an end which is I'm a good sign of what's to come in regard to us rain and uh of actually a good amount of sunshine and cooler temperatures\nAnd so when we look at the end of the cooler temperatures how long will they last we get back up into the nineties anytime soon or a\n... here here's your a fun fact for the day the latest Ninety degree day or hotter we've had on record was on October ...\n... so as far as us getting back to the nineties I'm very very very confident that will not happen the rest of the year\nSo we're done with that we're in to fall now we can safely pull out 'cause I'm asking because I still have my fall winter stuff in storage so I could pull out my sweat shirts and my ... and everything now\nI guarantee you everybody will be shocked if how cold the fifties field tomorrow because of how um warm we've been and we really haven't had a good shock of cold air so I think um people will get a rude awakening tomorrow morning if they're not aware of the colder temperatures headed our way\nI've slowly so right now we have colder temperatures heading our way is that because of the time of year or is that because of hurricane Michael\nIt's a combination so uh the steering mechanism for Michael ... is this cold front that's pushing through um that's why you know a couple of days ago we were wondering when it was going to make it right turn to the east and it had to do with\nHow fast that cold front was moving so the ... literally picked up Michael and there's now pushing it off the eastern seaboard\nAnd that cold front still going to make a clean pass through our area which then filters and a nice cool crisp fall heir are down from Canada so it's a combination of two you know Michael sure had its influence but this\nWhole front is the main driving factor of the cooler air\nAnd when you say the driver it's pushing that's what you mean or\nYeah I I just I there are different ways you can phrase it I've one common way I've always said is you know it's just driving a or ushering in that cold air down down from Canada so uh that is\nCommon for this time of year to actually uh unusual we haven't had 'em any you know good full blast up until it's fairly delayed of the arrival of fall or because remember started three weeks ago\nFall actually started so anxiously awaiting it\nNow you said earlier you're on with us for those of you miss it rhymes on with us are at a earlier\nThis morning and he said there was a possible tornado incident or possible tornado in East Point have you found on a new news on that possible tornado in East Point\nUm I was in communication with the national weather service so right after your show and because of staffing because of how old you know uh how much they had to staff overnight in the last couple of days they're not sure if they're going to head out there today or not to survey the damage\nBut they are planning a on surveying the damage in East Point and also down towards making 'em show it might not be for another day or two that we got to the official word\nBut all we're waiting for is the strength\nIn size so that's when that's when we can come from all the information because right now all we see is the damage\nAnd then a meteorologist a team of meteorologist will go out there and say okay I see trees laying all in the same direction that would be wind damage or if you see them laying in different directions and uprooted\nThen that the tornado and then they look at the damage and they have a chart where they um\nGot to figure out how strong estimate how strong the winds would be and it's really cool now everything is a um used via ap they have like this app or they use gee I asked to look at 'em you know where they are\nAnd they can literally plot what they're tracking and keep track of it and take pictures to great system if they have in place now\nRyan Beasley Fox five meteorologist also the official meteorologist of the my Brooke show on from twelve to three Ryan will you be on my rug show later on [noise]\nUm I'm not sure I I think I Am a but I'm not a hundred percent sure I haven't been in contact with\nHim he he's going to have you on and tell us the right what's going to pass\nBut ... rhyme or reason please check them out on Fox five in my humble opinion it's only my opinion is what I give you every day Fox five has the most accurate wet weather on a consistent and regular basis so thank you very much Ryan and have a wonderful wonderful day you too thank you very much thank you\nWould you would you agree to a proposal or would you vote on a proposal to drug test your local lawmakers aid for for for all for one\nThat's probably true because they don't have I mean I see that yeah I got all hogwash I yeah I Would read on this one yeah I see I mean I find it a cycle is probably you know they probably pay a lot by these guys but they act like they're in a\nVeteran now that's different the way they add right now they the way they act as like what they are the biggest a hose on your hands down as a ...\nLot of the biggest a bicycle is every

Saturday market manager well before we go to Shawn we've got to go to sports with red party\nBut it's not there's hockey women's soccer in pre season basketball real electric night very exciting but what's more exciting the NFL tonight Philadelphia Eagles at the New York giants kickoffs at eight twenty to sports out there to sponsored by our standards heating and air\nThank you Brett so uh\nUh Shaun let me ask you so we had this issue with the flag yeah right and so I Want to ask the first question would ask is was it a lot of people complained about our flag on Trump flag in the studio that we had to take down or was it a few people one person you know was it\nWhat was that the number really wasn't the issue it ... it was that we had a flag that was essentially a campaign flags for a person and it's my feeling in my belief and\nThe support of the folks I work for that also believe that political science don't belong in any of our business so\nWould that would that apply to say I'm a Hillary picture on someone's desk or cubicle\nYou know I think the last\nProbably four or five years has changed things yeah I Would uh if if there was a Hillary sign up in a cubicle or an Obama signed her yes we can send it back\nIn Seattle in two thousand eight there were a couple of my account executive that had yes we can size up and I made him take him down it just wasn't hurt but it's not appropriate in a business so\nWhat about religious or a ... a symbols they cross or a a a a star David is that is that the same as religion and politics and they say don't talk religion and politics so\nYeah no I I you know again it's it's it's the context that it's in guys if somebody has a a you know a nice little biblical quote up the chemical that's their business\nSo now when you talk about political speech we're talk station here we all talk about Trump and I understand the flag was you know in my mind it was the one way or another I didn't really care everyone knows where I stand yet they know I like from sort of flag doesn't make a difference\nBut if if if someone is offended by the flag and they work in a department like say sales or promotion of marketing or email all the different things that we do around here to help promote our station if they're offended by the flight are they also can I assume that they're also offended by my political position or the political position of the stations\nMore than likely so if they are then how do I ensured that that person is doing the job that they're paid for if they're offended by my political speech because I Need marketing I Need promoted Chinese sales I Need those guys no they don't like me or like my positions or the position of Shannon and the rest of the guys\nHow do I insure them well as a manager how do you how can I get to them to let them know hey guys we can disagree in politics but we still have a job to do\nYeah you know listen to you do a great job of going out and work and one the one with all the sales but I think we're ... gets you nowhere in fact one particular I think what you're talking about is is it you know do I have a group of sales people to just won't go out and sell the\n... and that really sounds we were just in general if you're offended by the flag yeah and you work in any department yeah does that extend to your knowing your job is\nAgain going back to to a level of professionalism it's my expectation that we are going to be professional enough to put not to put campaign flags up in our cubicles in our studios I also expect us that we're going to be professional enough that even if I don't like the format I'm going to do my best job around it and I got a whole bunch of people here don't like rock right took ...\nReally who doesn't like how do you hire people I Know who doesn't like All right Ryan who doesn't like rock\nMusic well let's see uh anybody under the age of thirty\nYou really think that I I Love it well I I got out of fall in that category I wouldn't know\nSo you know we we we we have people who you know quite frankly don't care for classic hip hop and we have done it in but our job is to produce and in in and provide to our audience is the very best entertainment the very best information the very best connection and engagement we can write and that's that's our job\nAnd so so us being a hearing state of Georgia Trump won by a large amount\nOf blind camp is up in the polls yet we have a Republican led legislature wherever Republican governor so this state by all definition of ... politically as conservative yes so we're talking to those people on a daily basis so I mean how I I guess my question is I Want to be able to reach out to those guys in those departments who may disagree with me\nI get that question so often what do we do now listen I really feel like I have a great great show in store for you to put a lot of thought into it I always do but in particular\nThis one has specific Lee seven specific challenges that can be rail your retirement and how to protect yourself from it to I Want you to write these down\nBecause I Would love for you to challenge me with these come and see us at Rollins financial you know there are\nAre CPAs and there are total wealth advisors you know at one point and I feel that it had a listener come in this week and said absolutely the reason he came in and is likely going to become a client is because they were also CPAs ensure it up like always ...\nA few incredible ideas including\nSomething related to his Social Security that other people missed that is absolutely going to increase it significantly in fact so I I don't want you to be fooled by this booming economy and the stock market really over the past decade because you can pay some more challenges more challenges in retirement than\nAny previous generation now let me give you some examples\nYou won't likely live a lot longer that's a great example of a challenge right that could totally change how you plan for retirement we can't ignore that\nHow about the cost of health care and long term care\nI choke on him there are huge we cannot ignored if that's not built into your planning quest junior advisor or question yourself and come in and let us help you with that how about this\n[noise] taxes are lower now are you ready they're lower than they've been in decades\nNow that's good news isn't it but what happens typically when we get a big decrease in taxes and then we have a change in Congress and then we have a change potentially and the president yeah they're going to rise in the future\nWhat do we do about that how do we deal with that right who knows what the future holds in terms of our Congress and and our government we got a plan for it either way you see this is really just getting started in the planning process so that's why\nOn today show I'm revealing seven challenges seven facing anyone retiring in the next several years and more importantly strategies to protect yourself and these are what I'm going to talk about it's going to include the following specific\nSpecific tax strategies\nThat can help you save a fortune on your IRAs for one

benefits that can deal with thousands more in benefits joke just came up with this and implemented this for a listener just this week very interesting\nPlus how other people that we are seeing are successfully generating income in retirement today with out betting the farm without taking enormous risk in other words they're not\nIn these crazy mastered limited partnerships and royalty ... closed and bond funds I mean we look just as we get somebody they got like no return last year they came from this\nRather large from that I keep seeing this pattern on and they were horrible results so what do we do what we do how do we deal with this well let's jump right in\nAnd challenge number one right topic is seven challenges that can be real your retirement challenge number one\nI think it's fair to say it's pretty difficult one is generating income\nYes because you see your retirement a successful retirement it's not simply built on all those assets that you accumulate it or the amount of money that you've saved\nOver your lifetime they're built on your ability to generate income in retirement not easy stock markets go up and then they go down put your income is the backbone\nOf a successful retirement game plan because you see once you've got that down packed and we can make sure we meet your income needs with out taking enormous risks\nThan we can do some really interesting things with your other baskets of money that you may not need if you're generating enough income in retirement\nSo now what do you do with this information what do you do you know you've saved you've invested and that's always a great start but what do you do now and I always told you it's\nWhat you do with that money that really matters how you ensure that you get the most out

little bit too loud but I kinda liked it because it was making that beep beep warning sign\nAnd that's kind of what the show is about because I have I have to admit some unsettling news for you\nYou can face more challenges in retirement than any single previous generation I've been telling you if you're just tuning into the show don't panic today don't freak out over my message instead\nPlanned\nYeah deal with these things and these things are stepping challenges that could derail your retirement seven challengers that could derail your retirement\nUm here's what I'm Talking about here some of the things I'm Talking about [noise] you can live a lot longer than bank\nI think most people now that have reached age sixty are going to become centenarians\nA hundred years old that's a long time and retirement how 'bout traditional ways of generating income hey man they're dead\nAnd for that from out there the one I Can't mention their name but man they are putting people in some awful like closed and bond funds and royalty trusted master limited partnerships they're killing these folks they are dead that Ryan bring your stuff into us\nTaxes may be alone now but their shirt or rise in the future we've seen these patterns before you see I'm just getting started here I've been talking about seven specific challenges that you're going to face in retirement I'm also talking about\nHow you can protect yourself but I Can't generalize because\nThe way we are going to help you is going to be different for each and every person absolutely we are going to customize a plan for you we really are and it's free look if you come in I promise\nDo you are not going to get a sales pitch we aren't salesmen we're not selling a product we bring you in front of us because we say to ourselves if we prove ourselves to you in that meeting and we really work hard and listen to you and you'll be so impressed with Rawlins financial our CPA wealth advisors [laughter]\nThen maybe just maybe you'll say you know what I Want you\nGuys to manage my money and create a\nLong term wealth strategy and implement it for me and we do that every single quarter you're going to hear from us we are constantly hold in your hand looking down the road making changes so I Want the opportunity I may not win it\nBut if you're in front of me and you get this free plan just may be\nYou're going to like what we have to say 'cause I tell you what I'm seeing a lot of you come in and other people simply are not\nDealing with specific\nRemedies that we implement for you know\nHere's what I got to cover for this segment the dangers of not planning for the skyrocketing costs of health care long term care got to deal with that and\nThe complications with claiming your Social Security benefits and how can needlessly cautious tens of thousands of dollars so here is a challenge for the cost of health care and long term care are through the roof\nThat's it and the story I don't even have to explain that do I I mean you need to ensure that a health issue with you or your spouse or your parent or child does not turn into a financial catastrophe latest estimates\nTheir staggering says that the average sixty five year old couple retired today could march past the\nFour hundred thousand dollar mark when you factor in Medicare premiums supplemental insurance premiums that Dr Boyles and co pay so have you said or in Bor and put me up you plan for an extra four hundred thousand dollars for retirement just for that\nIn most people think that Medicare is going to cover the majority of their health care costs and retirement no it's not that is not true according to voyeur Medicare will cover about sixty percent of all retirement healthcare costs about the other forty percent\nWhat do you do\nMedicare data finds that does in their seventies spend seven thousand five hundred and sixty six dollars per person in health care costs and nearly the finger more than doubles to ... over six to ... thousand dollars by the time the person reaches age Ninety six\nI don't think you're not going to reach age Ninety six\nYeah we're we are getting lots of data saying you're gotta and we've got to deal with it we've got to deal with it then what about long term care you may think I don't need it no you know what\nYou're wrong here's these are facts Ford says that nearly Seventy percent of all people who lived at age sixty five will require some form of long term care and it ain't cheap it is not cheap private room in a nursing home now cost consumers more than\nThis is the fastest growing population age group is eighty five plus years old and living to age one hundred maybe come relatively common with all the developments in biotechnology nanotechnology and healthcare\nCentenarians people living told their one hundredth birthday there's now an estimated four hundred and fifty thousand centenarians living in the world\nToday imagine what that number is going to be in twenty Thirty years from now now I imagine you're retired five to ten years sooner than you expected\nThat even makes the problem worse [noise]\nThe world was home to nearly half a million centenarians people age is one hundred in order in two thousand Fifteen more than four times as many as in Nineteen Ninety that's according to the United nations estimates\nAnd this growth is expected to accelerate projections suggest it will be three point seven million\nCentenarians across the globe in two thousand fifty pure research pure research is his real data folks longevity it can be a snowball effect\nLoggia live more expenses you have you see it snowballs right they pile up to a greater chance you have other experience in a bear market 'cause you just got\nYou know multiple market changes because of all those decades and then the more money you need for ongoing health care and ... sensitive items like\nThe increase in health care and I already told you long term care it's just really never ending you have to plan for it you have to put that into your plan so we're going to do that for you\nAnd then finally challenge number seven to fly you know challenge is\nBattling inflation\n[noise] you know this one's tricky because you don't necessarily feel it\nOr you kind of become blind or numb to it [noise]\nIt steals from retirees\nIts fuel from you buy lessening the value of your savings it erodes you're purchasing power a dollar today will be worth less tomorrow and for those of you who have recently come in and we see that you've made one or two percent or even zero percent because you're in a\nYou know what you're in you're in these fixed income products like master limited partnerships in royalty trust enclosed and bond from from this one from in particular you're getting killed ... kick your literally because of inflation for example a dollar in Nineteen fifty it had the same buying power\nAs ten dollars and twenty three cents in two thousand Seventeen\nPatch inflation man that's inflation I mean Nineteen thirties the average cost of a one pound of hamburger meat was twelve cents two thousand Thirteen cost four dollars and sixty eight cents there's inflation it's never not been there\nTalking to go away yeah hopped are factored in\nEven or one or two or three percent inflation rate that may not seem like much but if\nAdded up over twenty or Thirty years or even forty or fifty years because of our longevity problem it can have a huge impact on the way you're going to live and retirement and that's why I call it or they call inflation the silent killer the silent killer\nNow don't you want to maintain the same lifestyle in retirement you typically do and you may want to travel a but us inflation accelerate to a six year high recently\nIt's starting to her road wages the dollar has lost Twenty one percent of its purchasing power in the last decade alone\nWhat value\nWill lose in the next twenty or Thirty years you know I bring these up and fixed incomes forget about it getting crushed getting crushed\nBecause it's being ignored\nI bring it up because we don't ignore it you see these things that I bring up these things I I I always used the word I think that seven challenges that can be real your retirement which is what I've talked about on the show\nWe're going to deal with it and other financial advisors may not so get a second opinion come in and see if you don't have anything to lose\nAs you plan for your retirement you've got these critical choices and you've got these forks in your road about Social Security and Medicare and taxes how much risk you want to take generating income and so on and every single one of these decisions\nIs going to come with significant consequences good or bad you're gonna have to make these decisions but here's the thing we can talk about these things on the show all day long but this specific strategies that are going to be used for you are going to be totally unique\nI I don't know what it's going to be until you come in nobody on the show was like\nWe got to see you even a minor difference in your age your assets that you say your risk tolerance longevity that can trigger a major major shift in the strategy that we're going to recommend for you and we put a lot of time and thought into it\nOur CPA wealth advisors think about this stuff it takes a few days to create these plans for you and that is exactly why we have created where so proud of it are customize five steps\nRetirement action plan and we will focus on the five biggest issues\nThat will help you make the most out of every dollar you have to save for retirement there is no cost\nAre no products for you to buy and it will not cost you a dime all you have to do is

dot com Katie I'm hoping dot com studios why why Gainesville Mueller stay with\nBest devastation pope names saints Christopher cruise the death toll from hurricane Michael is no Eighteen and is almost certain derives\nOfficials say there is virtually no cell phone service in Mexico Beach Florida a damage been virtually wiped off the map Senator Marco Rubio this morning so the devastation is widespread on the Florida Panhandle\nPanama City is it looks like her homestead down here in South Florida after Andrew what I saw where I didn't see any electricity Paul standing or any wires still up so that's gonna have to be totally rebuilt talked communications is still a challenge Mexico beach is wiped out I mean literally flattened out\nSome people say well I was had been a lot of Bull Run that whole time no I mean we literally we literally have some flat years but they consider that a Bull Run because of of how long it's been growing\nAnd no one knows how much longer it's going to grow the market doesn't know it's been a a record the markets basically looking at what's going on with the economy what's going on with unemployment was going on with the tax rates all the good stuff that's happening right now but then there's also these\nThe red flags out here you know still ... waving that we have to be cautious about where in the middle of a trade war with China\nAnd we got to look at every little move that's happening between the Trump Administration and then in Chinese about we'll negotiating terrorists are not to have ... much of our goods are gonna be\n... and they get these things affect the market affects volatility and if things go well it could just mean you know full speed ahead on the markets\nAt the same time it got to look at what's going on politically and I'm not going to get in and out on the show you can go to any other talk radio station that's politically motivated our political agenda and listen to all that stuff but we have to look at what's happening in the markets as that is happening\nAnd the closer you get to retirement that peace of mind is a big deal so we are stress testing portfolios all the time our own portfolios\nPeople who call in from the radio program Ron they come into our office and we run a complementary stress test on their portfolio I happened to be talked into a a referral from one of my clients and and as I was talking to them and kind of just getting to know them and chatting I said you know\nWhen you want to retire and this gentleman was fifty four and he wants to retire when he's sixty two so he's got an eight year time horizon I said okay I said we haven't looked at your portfolio yet but let me ask you one question\nHow much are you willing to let your portfolio you've accumulated to date and you're still working so there's more time you'll ... some or how much are you willing to let that dip\nBefore you really start getting nervous about retirement started getting nervous about do I have enough money to live comfortably you start getting nervous when do I pull the plug in being in the market what is that that number how much are you willing to let a drop\nAnd I started throwing examples out like you know five percent ten percent Fifteen Percent twenty percent and I said you know ten percent what do you think about that number he goes\nUh [laughter] as high\nAs ... I'm probably closer to the five percent now Ron I have not run a stress test on that portfolio\nBut just by looking at things um you know we're in the process of doing his analysis he is going to have a lot more than just five percent stress\nAnd when I share that result it's going to shocking\nAnd I see this all the time because as the markets go up so does your risk\nIf you don't have a plan a regular rebalancing that's why it's important to take the time and have occasional stress testing done on your portfolio which we do for our clients all the time but we also do it for our listening audience as well\nThe subject of our conversations day is I Can't get no satisfaction but actually you can you can have peace of mind and your retirement and one of the ways to get there and Margot I can tell you all about this is if you have a diversity of the income streams why is that so important\nWell because when we retire Ron we lose a paycheck but kind of joke around about it here on the show all for years we have and we call that permit it\nOther than that [laughter] yeah which you know it's a look at it this way I retired I'm getting a Social Security check\nWhich might be you know a stipend compared to my paycheck\nIt's kinda like that Social Security check might remind you of another employment check or something you know it's not the same thing but it kind of reminds you of that Richard getting that yeah that's it you have to have you can't live off of that Social Security check and you're not blessed enough to have a pension check where is the rest of the money coming from\nWell it's coming from your investments\nAnd like I tell folks all the time I think we really nailed down to things really really good year at the Lloyd group and motive Andre services\nHow to manage risk inside of a portfolio use risk to our advantage but at the same time help our clients protect their assets\nEfficiently more efficiently than just rolling the dice with everything in a mutual fund and hoping for the best we actually have a plan in place to manage risk and the second thing I think we do very very well here is how do we create income\nAnd I think it's important not only to have diversity in having different kinds of income but where that income comes from\nSo we have talked for years about the having different buckets of money and this particular case I use a three bucket approach when the markets are going up like they are right now\nSometimes it makes sense to take some of those gains from our growth bucket and lock those in and that could be some of the money that we use for future income\nOr we might look more towards an income driven buckets that is going to be paying interest in dividends and we use that that's coming in\nOr we may be look at it more of a protected income buckets something that's safer or have you know no risk in the market\nBut we know that that incomes going to be based on the uh the growth that it has or the guaranteed interest that it pays those kinds of buckets are what we used to create income and they all work differently because as the markets change Ron where we choose our income from needs to be flexible\nAnother way that you can achieve peace of mind and your retirement and not have to worry is if you have a diversity of income streams as mark is just explained but also you can be confident in your ability to spend money every month without having to worry and stressed out about whether you're going to run out of that money\nNot so true I mean in a perfect world we would love for everyone to be able to continue with the same lifestyle you had when you were bringing in a paycheck or if you were both working husband and wife both working to pay checks\nIf you could live with that kind of income and had that kind of income coming in at retirement and live the quality lifestyle you have now or in some cases one of my clients that you know mark I don't think I have a quality lifestyle right now because I'm working all the time I'd like to spend a little bit more and I'm spending now\nWhat if we put a plan together where it enabled you to especially during the early times of your retirement\nBe able to spend more money and go traveling go do the things that you're not able to do because you're you're working all the time now that you have free time let's go ahead and reap the rewards and spend some of this money and you know all the fruits of our labor and take advantage of that well you need to have a plan you need to have an income plan\nAnd we called our financial road map and I can literally plug in the numbers and say okay this is what you're spending now let's up that\nLet's put some extra spending in there at least for me on that ten years or so while we're young and healthy that's go ahead and spend some more what what kind of impact would that have on our retirement and I can show that\nAnd I can we can change the numbers on the screen print the report our client flood it because it is a road map it is a blueprint of what retirement would or could or should look like\nAnd then we can tweak it each year and say okay we're we're between the guard rails we're on track or we need to make some changes to get us back on track\nI Love working with that what we call our financial road map and our clients see a big value I Believe from that because as we sit down and talk about it it's ... opening its educational and it gives you confidence that you're are on the right track to be able to retire comfortably\nAnd listening to the financial company with mark Lloyd on rice steps and mark and we're talking about how people can have complete confidence in their retirement and of course another way is that if you have security in your health care plan that takes a huge\nBlow it off your mind it does if we retire before age sixty five round then you know we've got a a gap there to fill sure and we got to make sure we have good health care whether it be through Obamacare or whether it would be group coverage that we have a retirement benefits and then when we get to Medicare in a lot of cases\nMedicare takes over we kind of get a pay raise and then a lot of our clients they end up spending less on Medicare and Medicare supplement than they did on their private health insurance which is a good thing\nNow where Medicare fall short run is in long term care this is like home health care around the clock or a license sitter assisted living facilities which are very very popular today\nIt is our expensive and heaven forbid a full blown nursing home where you need a skilled person around the clock to care for you that can be devastating to your finances in some cases you retire when you become impoverished because you spend it on what we call nursing home spend down\nSo you know as a holistic advisor or what I'm educating my clients are what choices are out there\nTo be able to kind of protect ourselves from that or prepare for that\nWhether we're using our own money or using some type of insurance based product and I'm not talking strictly about going out and buying long term care insurance because that has issues as well I'm Talking about other ways of being able to put a solution and to the plan to cover us from future health care\nJust pick up the phone call eight hundred seven for nine four

primarily because we made it up like keep listening anyway welcome back to the financial\nSymphony with mark Lloyd your financial maestro and marks number is eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight mark of course appreciate you're listening to the show every week and\nIf you like the reach out and leave a message\nMarks team will get back with you and you can set a time to come in and have a conversation about your situation again that number is eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nMark Lloyd of course has been doing this for close to three decades now it makes it seem like a long time twenty eight years of experience helping people plan for retirement and that's what this radio show is all about eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nMark was talking about irreversible decisions we talking about this all the time about how there are some important decisions that you need to make plenty of decisions that you'll make in their retirement planning process it can't really be done so you need to make sure you do it right the first time\nExplain why these decisions and I'm getting ready to throw out here are so important and you can't go back and change its number one when you decide when you start Social Security you got to make the right decision up front\nYeah so I occasionally I Will get you know our listeners who call in and come in for\nCompliment review and they'll say hey doesn't make sense when I turned sixty two to go ahead and turn on my Social Security\nAnd I'm like well all upfront you will get a twenty five percent reduction in your benefits\nSo I think what we need to do is we need to run a Social Security optimization report and let's take a look at what income me you have an I ask questions like there are health history because there is a break even point that if you live past a certain age that you will you know definitely would have been a bad decision to take it at sixty two\nSo we kind of look at their individual situation that's why I Love about what we do here is that\nEvery solution is customized based on their specific situation and by running different software and running Social Security optimization it tells me exactly\nWhen is the optimal time to turn on that Social Security benefit and if we're married does our spouse take Social Security off a bus or they take it off of their own Social Security you know and there's different ways of maximizing\nThat benefit as well so that we can elect the right types of options that are out there it is a big deal\nSome people it makes even since the even wait and take it a little bit longer maybe not at sixty six sixty seven but wait 'til Seventy pretty much after Seventy there's no benefit of waiting because you're not getting a bump up and your check but sometimes it makes sense to even wait longer because you're getting about eight percent higher check if you wait\nFrom sixty six to Seventy so it's all about crunching the numbers and that's why again receiving some help with this might make sense because we can look at it and say when is the best time for you to turn on Social Security and like you said earlier Ron if you turn it on the wrong time you can't change it so you're kinda stuck\nAnd this is all about at retirement where do I get the most income to support my retirement so I don't have to put as much stress on my portfolio that I'd have\nWe want to get more income at retirement so that my I have a better chance of my portfolio lasting my lifetime and lower the risk of running out of money down the road which is by far the biggest fear we hear each and every week here on financial Stephanie radio\nAll right here's another decision a very important decision that you know you can't go back and change it and once you make it and that as electing spousal benefits on your pension if you're lucky enough to have one or not taking their spouse or benefits tell us why that is so important mark\nWell if you don't take spousal benefits and you're married and you prematurely die your spouse gets no pension zero which means that the company won your family or your wife or your husband loses\nNow sometimes is still it is the best decision to take full pension and not have spousal benefits but you better have a solution in case you die earlier it might be a life insurance policy I've taken the difference between my full pension check\nAnd that's spousal check and I bought a really nice life insurance policy to fund my spouse and then that's even kind of better at my spouse died that my kids inherits something\nThat might make sense it also depends upon the company you retire from about the the difference between full pension and survivorship pension there's a gap there survivorship pension usually is less it's not always the last but usually it could be a lot less what is that gap\nAgain by sitting down with an income plant are like us a full holistic from that looks at different ways of maximizing your income we can crunch the numbers and say okay\nIt makes the most sense this choice right here based on your scenario based on what you save based on your expenses put in some inflation and hair based on current tax rates I mean there's a lot of different factors you know kind of\nKind of like around like putting pieces of the puzzle together and we have all the pieces of the puzzle and all the different software to allow us to be able to again help you make those good decisions before it's too late and make their own decision\nWhether another decision that people have to make is whether or not to get life insurance sometimes it's perfect for you other times it may not be right for you right\nMarch so I just used an example there with spousal benefits pensions sometimes the solution is we take full pension\nYou know assuming that we're going to live a normal lifetime a life expectancy and just in case we don't we have a life insurance on the sideline life insurance policy on the sideline to take care of our spouse and if we want to leave something to the kids that could be used for that you know sometimes that does make the best decision but the longer you wait\nTo make that decision more risk occurs risk being oh I just got diagnosed with you know high cholesterol or I've had a little heart attack\nOr I've had maybe a mini stroke or maybe there's some new medication I'm now forced to have to take and that solution now is out of the picture because it doesn't make sense to do that because of the medications that I'm either cause my life insurance\nIf I'm considering the buying some to be a lot more expensive or eliminate you from being able to use that as an option altogether\nOkay and uh the last one I wanted to talk about here is choosing the actual retirement date when you retire you kind of talked about this a little bit we're discussing Social Security from a few moments ago\nYeah the financial road map this is critical this is key\nLike I said earlier I plug in\nThe accounts of my clients and we know what those particular accounts historically have earned how much they've grown through the years and not backing down I play it a lot more conservative\nI don't anticipate a bull market I anticipate a flat market or lower market I anticipate of sluggish market I'm not trying to paint a picture that's not you know obtain a bowl or not realistic\nI look at the expenses and then I immediately at inflation to that that is a big deal if our budget is we're spending six thousand a month a thousand a month five thousand about whatever it is\nIt's not going to stay that way I factor in inflation and that and then one of my clients and people that listen to the radio program come in and they see those expenses continue to go\nUp up up up and up\nThey then see how much stress that's putting on their portfolio how are we going to need to put up income plan together so that we don't have the fear of running out of money\nHow do we maximize the income so that we can continue to have some of this money growing for longevity for down the road so we get we don't have to tap into all of our money at one time that's why it's important to have different buckets of money some money that's going to be long term growth some money that's going to have\nIncome that I Need immediately some money that might be future income and how do we factor in extra income in here\nTo help pay for health care cost\nYou know I put my book together on composing your own financial symphony and I put it in the book five concerns facing retirees today and for simple strategies to address them those five concerns\nIs inflation you know its potential higher taxes down the road taxes are on sale now how do we take advantage of lower taxes now you know assuming taxes are going to be higher down the road risk and volatility it's like putting a good recipe a chef putting a recipe together how much risk and volatility should we have", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Shannon Burke Show", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "14"}
