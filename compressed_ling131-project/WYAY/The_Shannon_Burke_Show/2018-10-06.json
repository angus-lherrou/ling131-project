I Am for the Jewish people I'm done satellite what I'm saying [laughter] well oh yeah it does sound like it because it hey\nI'm just saying that that that sets the bad press that for us up for our soldiers they do things where you make decisions in war war is not a game it's not something you play on the TV\nOn rain with a controller in your hand or how that is what those guys were doing and they didn't have any choice they were following orders like if you're\nGenerally say ... is our way to do so to exterminate\nA uh uh uh uh people uh for his agenda of all the genocide is not a war you understand that on the\nThe Jews are hiding Jews weren't fighting the Nazis they didn't do that today that they would have been trying to defend themselves they were trying to ... I understand\nThat but war is war and that's why ... that it and and I just think that that the bread threads that once the war is over if he was trying to kill Jews thin yeah\nA red team get him out of the ... or whatever but when wars over ... they are soldiers responsibility should be ended right there [laughter]\nThey lost the war and in\nOur do matter what no matter what happened with human warmth or no matter what types of crimes against humanity you were guilty of as a soldier\nWell well what about the the the ... soldiers that killed kids out of it just\nBy accident should they be ... well no it's war it's war in that\nWar is never can like Robert Louis whatever I'm ... of\nRobert Louis they that war is not gun war is and and I hate it I Love the Jewish people I'd give money to Israel but I Do but it was war and\nSo I'm not a five year old guy who lived his last otherwise faithfully once the war was over and just I mean he did what he had to do any of us face in the ...\nAt the end if you don't do it\nWhy would you do that that's why he was he was following orders\nAre enough I'm like my reminding I appreciate your opinion thank you very much there you go\nAnd it was just following orders and uh\nAnd I guess I guess what he's saying is I mean I\nDon't think ... chasing camps are war I predict the less\nWell there was no ... yeah the Germans weren't at war with the Jewish people they were trying to exterminate them all forever for get rid of him completely and the ... there was a war going on at the time\nBut the the these guys weren't fighting a war they were continuing their mission of of of genocide well other Nazis went out and bought the war [laughter] right\n[laughter] oh [noise]\nGet it if you're out in the uh if you fall on if you if you had nothing to look at their old Nazi soldiers who who fought in the in the in the war those guys aren't it's the\nWord ball to the genocide the people who are involved in a ... in the extermination of Jewish people\nThat work looking at a concentration yeah yes\nThose people those are the people\nHe thinks that the same as as a war\nIt was during the ...

I don't I Believe that you if you're yeah those are those are the the war criminals that they're out looking for\nThe kids the Nazi you can fighting in the in the you know\nLook at the foot soldier they're not directly involved a genocide now I don't think that's who you know the the trials are about ... which is Ninety five\nHe lived there in limbo I mean ...

eight for for for ... for ten sixty seven here's Jay on the new talk one of the success of the camera OJ thanks for calling on the radio\nTowers are very well Sara what's going on\nGood I'm hoping to make two comments about the uh the not too was deported\nThe last known Nazi collaborator living in American the blast when they know of Ninety five year old former camp guard played an indispensable role in the murders of thousands of views apparently six thousand killed in one day where he was and he's they've known about them for Twenty years and he finally got deported a welcome aboard when he want to say about the guy\nOkay the first thing was that I had the correct an error they made earlier in the day when they went to retrieve the Ninety five year old man they accidentally grab Bernie Sanders by mistake [laughter]\nAnd then it one other thing was when there were were removing the Nazi from his home yeah he had to be ... or ... not because he was resisting is because they are going to bring their disparate later\nOh hey Ninety five year old ... how to get off\n[laughter]\nHave acted Nuremberg a British and Ninety five year old guy but apparently it was an armed guard\nAt a that'd be ... labor camp and helped kill six thousand Jews in one day in Nineteen forty three up one day that\nIs what five called the polish camp camp yeah\nUh and by the way the if he was telling me the polish people are not very happy with it because every they're describing is at a at a polish death camp well it happened to be in Poland but it wasn't run by the pool is you're putting trust me it was on by the German polish had nothing to do that so I mean there's there just wasn't a polling stuff can happen to be there but\nAnyway so they're trying to make the point he had his citizenship revoked Fifteen Years ago he appealed and that was denied in two thousand five\nAnd a ... and find a way this guy maintain friendships with Nazi guards who also came to America under false pretenses back when he did in the late for like Nineteen forty nine and how about this for a a coincidence\nThe Nazi and his wife bought a home in Queens near La Guardia airport in Nineteen sixty six\nThey bought that home near La Guardia airport in Queens from a polish couple who were Jewish and survived the Holocaust all week and he bought their house\nThey didn't know anything about it but they do about it now and a great he's been deported six thousand and by the way\nA he was saying well I was a you know I was a German and during the war but he he denies that he was responsible for the thing and then you have the whole question again even even the German government is saying this was a troubling situation where they call it uh the U.S ambassador to Germany called it a difficult task\nDeporting this guy back to Germany and no one's going to do with them there I assume I\nDon't put them on trial he won't be dead you know ... before too long I Can't imagine so but I was going to happen to him now I don't know but this has been going on for almost Twenty years\nActually more than Twenty years from the family and his neighbors first realized that he was a belief was announced anyway they're going to and then people are saying hey wait a minute it was just following orders [laughter] you know and here's the other thing I actually did think about this I suppose you it was Nineteen\nForty one and you were drafted into the German army and given a gun and the helmet didn't stop a new study our guard this uh entrance to this camp here just said okay so you're gardening evidence to the camp that's all you did was ... to the camp you didn't shoot anybody just stood there and guard at the entrance for a couple of years when the war was over are you a Nazi war criminal\nYou know you didn't have to be a notch you to be in no way am I right\nYou know you just where you were war criminal not necessarily not to be but I mean if you'd anything that didn't stop the slaughter or whatever I mean I don't know I I don't have an answer to that but clearly of his biggest this last known one Ninety five years old\nI got you got you got you got to look at the week

put her in jail\nWhat happens when you were a snitch that's right things do you know you're\n... a slightly different story\nOr a for for for all four to six years of it you know I don't understand how Michael Cohen can be an all this trouble as Trump's lawyer when the only reason he's in trouble is because the FBI broke into his office and is a home and his condo apartment that he stays him and he's not home with the family\nAnd they stole all the stuff including all this tape recordings is a uh conversations with clients including the president United States all his lawyers notes\nAnd then they supposedly are saying well we only looked at the ones that are relevant to our charge uh-huh they took 'em all they took all of it\nIf it's not it's not rocket stop on time yes exactly what they did that's what they did and the same thing with Manafort wasn't a Manafort they broke into his house at three o'clock in the morning or something he would have showed up and then he went to they would have said hey come on down we're going to rescue Ninety okay I Will be there I mean but no they show up to you know break into the house Brad plaques and the doors and\nJust to show Donald Trump and by the way Manafort\nHis trial has nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing and Michael Cohen is a pleading guilty today has to do with his tax evasion and his bank fraud has nothing to do with Donald Trump's presidency or a campaign or the Russians\nSo so far Robert Mueller's investigation for millions of dollars over two years has resulted in two trials that have nothing to do with Donald Trump\n\nBetter and you know he's not going to get ... he is not going to ever clear Donald Trump Mohler we'll never clear Donald Trump he'll have a final report that will never said Donald Trump did nothing wrong he will never have report clearing them\nIs it just disgraceful and you know that my mother and call me are best friends they've invested with close friends best friends for Twenty years\nFor catching Keisha Lance bottom in your ... guy I don't know I'm not as it's set at ... here you know boy things were popping on this cat's Late Show this morning oh really is especially dangerous I mean [laughter] anything they can do about that you know maybe [laughter]\n\nBoy my dad I was getting blasted this man you're not going what's new about that no they met through the TV

microphone when spring [laughter] wow it that way second later right to give any you know a shout out to the competition but as soon he cares about this radio station\nAnd what the hell do you deal with it\nIt's like Mark Aaron canceled his late night truck a show you know the two in the morning rush to Alexandria, Virginia when I fly while he heard the Manafort Jerry might be hung\nWell I tell you\nThis week I was actually a great show sake you deal with the president's going to be funny when you're facing impeachment [laughter] like you is the president\nAnd by the way apparently the judge has declared a mistrial on ten pounds\nIn the fall Manafort trial [noise]\nGuilty on at least one count I guess are coming out with the right now um [noise] the two girls going on Michael\nAbout bone up pleading guilty Michael Cohen the Trump lawyer is pleading guilty to campaign finance and bank fraud and tax evasion charges which they didn't know about until they stole all the stuff out of his offices and as a law for eye and Paul Manafort is apparently guilty on one count\nAt least ten were thrown out by the judge\nAnd I don't know anybody that's all that's all I Know that it's coming out in the bits and pieces so apparently a Manafort guilty on eight counts jury undecided on ten\nOkay the verdict is reached on eight pounds but he's guilty on at least one we don't know how many they breached the verdict you could be innocent on the count on at least seven counts are seen guilty on one of the reporters no running out of the of the office to try to get through their phones to call it in\nYou are listening to the gym or show replay\nWhale die like this is ... and you're listening to a rape lie of the cameras show you know I Love the camera because he never minds it went up but

[noise]\nOr a hung jury is just so he was found guilty on eight pounds in his front trial so that's going to be some serious stuff [noise]\nAnd then he has another trial after this one\nTime and again it has nothing to do with Donald Trump's campaign or Donald Trump running for president or Donald Trump and the Russians were anything nothing [noise]\nA guy\nWho is this oh who's that that's what's
