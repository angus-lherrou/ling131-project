front door [noise]\nBoom [noise] what\nIs exactly what was that it's going to come to Atlanta it's what looks like OK straight for us uh-huh [noise] luckily I've been stocking up on your story ... ...\nWe said Cain T. M. roofing dot com how proud sponsor a new talk one oh six seven Atlanta comes to talk\n[noise]\nYeah I Know he's a girl's name but what are you going to tell him he's a shining Burke show on the new talk one oh six seven come right back to the doctors have real effects of fungal\nDave\nI'm here you're ready to uh to uh take some calls eager alright eager I Would think this is the first of all because well let me go and order because once been holding a lot longer than the first time I've ever had a a pot bellied pig or a call here is David David you're on the air but Dr de brutal go ahead\nSay how're you doing All right good good I'm I'm not in a pot bellied pig no no no but okay I\nHave a sixteen year old a lab mix that we rescued about twelve years ago from you know uh\nWe rescued but uh she's just chewing and chewing her backup were legs is everywhere all up and plucking her hair we I don't know I don't know what to do it we put coconut oil in her food and she's eighty and she I I just don't know what to do\nWell there is a lot of reasons why your dog will be chewing that that one certainly the external parasites please pick a certainly can cause a problem then we start getting into bacterial infections afterwards once they start chewing themself allergy\nCan certainly be a reason for it um but if your dog issue and you're chewing up that bad you probably need to get to that um you know just trying to treat him at home tends to slow down the process\nBut try ... de ... says always good\nThe ... ... ... ... yeah I think a lot has happened because we have a Seventeen year old lab and just passed away about three months ago to I don't know if she's going through the pressure to a kind of going to do it now\nNow when when Donald ... say they're depressed or they get anxious they're going to Lincoln warned spot or a couple of spots they won't take all the fur on their body that sounds more like an infection or allergies or some sort of parasite I Would be worried about\nHow bald is the dog to\nIt it is is bad but it's not that bad it's all\nAbout I mean she chews in one certain spot and the owner back in and I'll know Paul's\nYeah so and so they always do things like that you could hear the aloe shampoo out of work well with your dog smells maybe medicated shampoo guy to relieve things a little bit talk to your doctor maybe about some um some ... and then um you know certainly doesn't resolve you know she's sixteen years old get her and\nThen it came down for a doctor that could David gave his dog some human ... seat that I can get it is that something you do would you would you advise against that\nYes he a human Bennett girl is what I normally use as a first a first\nStrike to go after that I'll go back to your ... ... yeah you're right about those we just started doing that last week and missing a little piece of hand so she eats it\nAnd um so but we're seeing the climb in it but I appreciate your\nTime today and thank you that we should have a good life hopefully she's not allergic to have\nThe rap and that stuff and ah yeah I Would that be worried about yeah [laughter] you rent or medication that just makes me in fact\nI have I have a I have heard that many a time really you know get sick and they they give it to him in the in a lot of dogs are lactose intolerant a\nHere is Ted Ted banks are holding how's your pot bellied pig\nGood morning like yo um she's about two years old I Would say between a hundred and sixty\nHonoring Seventy pounds and use any of the big and we have hardwood into our foot down runner corporate runner for her to try it and you will notice in her\n... her ... are starting to spread out [noise] man like her told her what would we are just getting like a crescent shape to it [noise]\nI don't know that we need to have dreamed or women [noise] yes\nNow is he considered overweight and I mean maybe [noise] no service you know to avoid she's actually a about power for her I program now you'll you'll walk or aren't hard surfaces that oh a yes or no high up and down to like [noise]\nGo ahead I'm Sorry that they do\nThat he didn't go that she wants to be in and out so well when she's in the house like I say she don't she don't towel or ceramic ... but we we do have the runners\nDial yeah ... what I Would do it I Would go to um you know a groomer or younger vet whoever can do that is certainly show you how to take care of the whole it sounds like they're growing abnormally um that she's a spreading her her ... her feet because the that holds or two off a bright\nEven hard you'd take it on a on a sidewalk or something like that I got my dogs I have to turn their nails that we used to live downtown so I walked in the four times a day on the sidewalk now I live you know and they have a yard to run and their nails are going crazy because they haven't been on the ... service in a while\nWas he has full access to the garage that that's by ... and the drugs so I don't know good luck that next fan so\nWhen you go sounds like a case trimming here there\nIs two and a news story for the past it's OK so at least to go ahead you're on the horn with ... day rule\nHey thanks for taking my call I have a ten month old uh you know I just yeah either at his I don't know exactly what he is but he'd peas and his good ball when he's done eating\n[laughter] maybe maybe they fed him [laughter]\nI Know I Know that they're paying their food bowl\nThat is until like I take it up right after he had any eating so\nYou know so he doesn't have the target anymore and I thought that would also be a good way for what I put that might not see peace and including or whatever that heading day what do you make of that\nAll right do you have other pets I have one other dog yes okay are they getting along\nOh great okay I'm only got up here we've only had him like tonight\nOkay now I found it it sounds more it sounds like he is hey this is my possession you are not going to get it after I get done with it you know type of thing that he's urinating marking it out even neutered yet yes okay\nSo what do you want to do as far as you want to get is a urine test make sure that ... ... ... ... ... common in any other step is to looking to see if there is problems between the two dogs that are causing anxiety\nYou know um they're protective of their food the other dog's not letting them eat right um or maybe he's eating too fast because he's worried the other ... other dog is going to eat it you may have personally so um it sounds more like he's marking it to tell the other dog ... ... is is it yours don't do we just out of anxiety I Would think\nSo I thought to be one of the meal was terrible and I'm On the pill and with that I thought man\nI Am a Democrat [laughter] that would probably be doing it before ... ...
