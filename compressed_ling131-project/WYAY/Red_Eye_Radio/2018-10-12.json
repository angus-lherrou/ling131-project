I think I said this on the air one time you know I was in when he first found out was like oh come on in the nineties ... and then I uh\nI uh\nWas behind the music to the biography of his life ... and you see how hard he worked to get where he got ... that he had not right and you see how hard and I went oh you know I have a completely different opinion of him and it was just you know you're sort of prejudices ... kid rock\n... having a kid and stuff\nBut ah but ah\nFor um you know yesterday again this is now I'm I'm not going to spend five hours\nAre going over the economic and political philosophy of Kanye West\nThat hold on let me tell the staff had guys or cancel all that stuff that I wrote down for the next ...\nExactly uh but because because you don't need to go that far all you need to do is he likes Trump therefore to the left he's not a black he's not truly black ... while the other about me alive so not meal yeah\nYou know and and that's but that's the backward thinking that's that's that's right that's the bigotry\nAnd in tolerance on the left today it's the racist mindset\n\nTo the point where you know coming up with the analogy the Trump is the master and Tanya is the slave ... you're going to really try to convince America of that you're going to you're going to try to convince a millennials that you're right\nThey don't yet west in his mind used himself as a slave really now\nBut this is this is the what's\nGreat is that they're actually proving Kanye a write in there\nFrom their behavior this is Ben and it\nSo maybe we will spend some time talking about the accuracy of the ideology of God yeah he was fine I mean you know in the past talking about you know why can't someone just ah decide they you know or or for whatever reason a you know they why can't they think this way does it matter\nWho they are we've been saying that for no\nAges and it doesn't matter who they are we we talk about um Hollywood conservatives\nAnd you and I both know some that and I haven't seen where they've come out you know and you know on back in the day on Jay Leno or or whatever over the years um uh and and claimed to be a conservative some have\n[laughter]\nBut I I Know a a couple that that are have not\nUh as far as I Know and so I'm not going to\nYou know I'm I'm not going to talk about who they are in it that really doesn't mean anything or it's just the fact that they know James Woods has set it that's why he better just\nTo hang it up yet you hung out and and and\nRetire and go play some poker he's pretty good at that but um and and be able to issue his opinion than to have to walk on eggshells around people 'cause he wasn't going to get hired you know he knows that that more and more\nYou're not going to get hired um\nKelsey grammar talked about it openly on the Tonight Show one time just said look I mean you can't be a conservative in Hollywood and expect you're going to be treated\nThe same I'm paraphrasing but that that was his message on that night and it's true well why is that the side that preaches tolerance has none no\nAnd that's that's what you saw yesterday so we'll get to more back up your latest election polls uh Arnold apologizes for using the phrase girly man\nYeah listen I we're still talking about Caitlin 'cause I don't know where you're going with this I just want everyone to know the ...

J. play mhm and uh you know as as I've always said OJ was one of my boyhood heroes ... uh was um and uh I never saw anybody accelerate\nLike O. J. but\nI don't think I've ever seen anybody have the kind of moves that Barry Sanders had when he played for Detroit but\nHis his career was a a a limited Gail Sayers also was just a a superb running back there's been a ton of good running backs out there I don't think anybody had the power what what differentiated Jim Brown was\nHe just had the power to go back and watch some of the old films of Jim Brown ... I mean walking over ... over linebackers bigger than him mhm and and just having incredibly now any power but he had great balance\nDidn't have the speed I don't believe we're the acceleration of an OJ or berries Sanders and but he had the power nobody I don't think anybody ever came close to the power that he had bought\nThat being said Jim rounds old Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today\nA you ask the average uh a a thirty year old if they know who Jim Brown is they're down on your ... you're talking about that oh the the the old guy that you know they might remember the fact that you know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved

these things that are right it's these things that are wrong\nAnd he's able to articulate and ways that people who are not listening are going to pay attention to this these socialist who are on social media constantly are going to pay attention to this so uh the leftist just upset because Trump is wedding\nOr you know thanks so much I think you bring up some really great points yeah you're talking about a ... one of the things that is terrifying to the the Democrats and uh again you know there we've said this before\nThey believe that the people to both of them are stupid mhm that they

know it was on a drudge and Fox News and everything else but really the left\nLoves that kind of behavior when someone you know like a Taylor Swift comes out and tells people to vote Democrat but that's further proof that you need Taylor Swift to tell you how to vote and\nIf she had said Trump [noise]\nThey would have shredded her [noise] oh yeah and so that you know that's what this if if if

update on it we know that\nIn the first half of the year steel was forty percent mhm\nUh we know that the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA does not cover steel and aluminum and until there is a deal\nThe tariffs from what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ruins in some of those cases still remain\nWith Canada and Mexico so you know we stated that when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly\nKnown as NAFTA but the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference ah you you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA yeah he\nDid a little bit but he didn't do anything that he planned that he said he was going to do which was\nI'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit right that this that this isn't going to do it there were little winds here or there the problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem is\nAnd the president views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car therefore making it more expensive to buy a car\nAnd making it less likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas has just been flushed down the toilet because it's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here\nWhich is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right\nIt's the one thing they're well it's there a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I have no idea where the president stands on it as we know he has changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week they'll go from as he did one for me in a complete protection is\nJust sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands I Do know though that\nIn this in the the\nUh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA that he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America\nHe put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter] the original favors the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many farmers were\nLaughing at that comments off well because the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the\nThe the the the fuel producers don't don't want it they don't want the higher blend the it it may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell the Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit here comes the lawsuit um but\nIt will the but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend\nBut when there's no market for it then there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily my might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to eat Fifteen with out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt you can't get that done it too so but\nAppeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the ah on the tariffs\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said\nThat's a tiny number compared to\nWhat we're what we're losing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain in once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chain they're going to go somewhere else so it's not just by the tariffs hurt us until they were lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal you know or\nOr the the the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever to to uh to\nTo terrify you're not there I had a double anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious that President used the greatest victory\nAnd that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories and their trade victories are always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services right we don't know how that's\nA victory right we can figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question\nMhm\nYeah I mean as an when when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork whereas we call it Canadian Bacon and the when they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why did they go back to us for\n\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else are we said this\nDuring the you know the um during the primary tore him after the uh ... when when the Gulf spill happened\nThe BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies are producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we are going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us a permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right\nAnd so you're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy or you know on a ... at the staff of finger and and frankly\nThe ethanol thing has become you know the for the ethanol farmers\nThat's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to political you know support if they're hurt going into ... and this is what we haven't been able to gauge you go to Iowa I mean and\nFor those people that the New York times of listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is this state in the middle of the country\n\nWhen you go there it is all connected to farming just like Texas has oil directly or indirectly I mean that is\nThe driver there

a scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to change with the new NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table\nBut with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property concern\nMhm that's the real thing that the president has to address I mean the terrorist thing is going to have to be remedied but it's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be and it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that the\nPresident would be going to try

stock market is the least of your concerns\n... the reason it's adjusting as because things are becoming more expensive like you mentioned uh the fed with interest rates are the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices to to go up or\nThe Saudis have some play in that too yes and we'll see if they ramp up production and and and our enable and change that and it is an incentive\nUh uh again because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe\nI well it depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point\nA to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\n... really one of the most under reported stories\nOf the entire year ...\nIs that the United states\nIs now on it happened about three weeks ago

us how how's it going out they're fantastic how are you\nAll right yeah their direction to go and what I go to the ... where would I go to vote is gonna be the restoration of some show some some semblance of due process and the court of public opinion there's got to have to be arraigned in some [noise]\nAnd I think that's the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great history by now yeah\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and a quarter of a public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due process that's a very that's a you know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here\nIt's yeah I think it is and and people apply it uh\nIt based on their their own life you know our ... our audience\nA and a ... and new sounds and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it and we're always immersed in it but most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of voting\nThey look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't uh apply the ... believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings sleep that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote is a big deal\nAnd if they are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is one of those polls start to shape the way they do and that's why a likely voter gives you a better read but they look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by you know a slogan are driven by whatever imagery but we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they mean\nNot be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a ... and and Chuck Todd was saying well a lot of people get it wrong and and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house and Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying is that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right well\nWhat Chuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left\n... you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the caller there and and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the poll showed Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or I Do zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it

S. P. S. it has not publicly disclosed\nAmazon declined to comment on the price hikes and the postal service declined to answer questions\nAny potential impact on the company the increase was for partial select were steeper than in previous as a previous years us BS of the new rates are result of a regular review process and are set to take effect on January twenty seven subject to approval from the postal regulatory ...\nAll right\nA Trump has repeatedly allege that Amazon is to blame for the postal services financial woes\nAnd accuses the e commerce giant of ripping off the agency and treating it like a delivery boy the president created a special task force in April to examine\nThe postal services business model sparking speculation that he would use it to raise shipping rates on Amazon ... a Trump equates Amazon with the Washington Post which is owned by\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos and as a target of Trump's anger about media coverage\nSo there you go that far from this is from political talk just a [noise] then again they have a long term deal with them they're not affected by it right if that if that\nYou know the pricing deal is in place and and look at what these us has done not ah I mean just in general if you talk about his a supply chain his delivery a chain a from\nA to B agency I guess it was clear that that when he\nStarted making large purchases on his freight company that he was going to be doing more of his own delivery and so while he can't do it all or because you have I don't know\nI don't know what the even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it would be impossible for although ... has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming or I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more of the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy if in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the bands and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about\nCreating a ah basically\nThe the ability or more and more to control pricing to keep prices low on Amazon according to beef up those he the U.
