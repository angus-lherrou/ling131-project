uh I here's I David up on the top three and a new drug one of the six seven eight David what's up man\nYeah how's it Going Rogue very well Israel's coming back where you were to\nHit the ATM reading dot com studios why wind up being you\n\nKnow winter balance of power that we had friends who has the FBI is investigating a series of packages with explosives center several high profile Democrats in CNN Wednesday correspondent Karen king for reports\n... lotion devices were address to a high profile figures [noise] one of the package either ride through the mail room at the time Warner center building which housing CNN's New York bureau nearly as an error not packages addressed the former CIA director John Brennan he blamed the weekly political rhetoric [noise]\nThat both Obama and the powder harmless than they quoted a social one ... CNN\nYeah the one side to CNN yes the one that was sent to to CNN was um\n[noise] uh the powder was harmless and but when you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I are looking each other's said man you've got to parks everything these days yeah you've got to be very careful ... ... it says the powder the outer right will Souder along with the bomb right that was in it it was a ... there's ...\nThere's nowhere in the story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the or any stores says that the a suspicious package that was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device\nWas was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source\nRight at an early in the day the my pd had bad that the um uh but the uh the ... there was the the\nSuspected pipe bomb nan another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice would they suspected might be right center you know who knows ... um but it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both the bomb and the powder are harmless\nKill these people that would end so right you go from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was\nThey find out that none of the bombs were active that none of the bombs had any potential of going off\nThen you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things you if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature mhm it was meant just a couple of weeks before an election\nTo help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the the motivation here was to help\nDrive an election to a a certain side mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well it's if they did this to help Trump did to help Trump and then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's at like I said it has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN ... going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive comments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive\nThan accusing another side or a person blaming them for something where there is a complete lack of evidence as to the motivation\nOf the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm\nDown the ... jumping in China and assigning to something nothing could be nothing could be more divisive so as they sit there on their high horse screaming that your devices they had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil what's the other side that it's not possible she shut the door on that just days ago well look this\nThis is we're we we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after Steve skull east was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and\nNo no no and\nNone of it's going to all of this just to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made\nThat the most divisive you had these people sitting in their ivory towers immediate elite ivory towers claiming that they care about stability and they are anti divisive\nThat's what they're about and they hate the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack\nWould they complete lack of evidence to back up their claim there is no evidence of either way there's no limit and we may not have it for a long time\nAnd the fact is they don't see that no they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack\nUnderstands how obvious it is so not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there is a little there's a again\nA we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm\nNot much you can say the only thing we can report or the few facts that we do have a total ... seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI or they were sent to you know prominent members ah or or uh or backers of the Democrats and so\nThat's all we can say that's it that's all we know about it\nAnd as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story that we can talk\nAbout it\nBut right now that without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was\nWe can't assign it to anything we have no idea absolutely no idea no idea\nAnd\nSo that that's where we stand right when we find out more information we'll give you more information\nBut speculation on these things is useless but the thing is that's the kind of nation that we live in ... well sure it started right away you know and I was thinking too that you know the media getting on their high horse you know that ... that you know hey we don't ever cause any type of device of rice right in and all I have to say is ...\n... built on a lie mhm\nCompletely built an ally CNN and MSNBC all over that mhm enabling\nThe the uh\nUh as in in my opinion enabling the range that existed\nUh attacking law enforcement you and I remember which Jake Tapper writing and writing temper can you believe this police are there in ... has been riots for the last few days of course they're going to stage police in riot gear ...\nThey were they kept pushing the narrative that the you know that the police rotted control hands up don't shoot you remember it right they they they were part\nOf of pushing and amplifying the divisiveness that was based on a lie mhm so CNN don't set up there on your high horse\nServed in the Obama administration has added that to the FBI they're looking at in terms of\nWho might be behind this understanding why this is part of the mindset here\nThis fear and police harassment of women lean down the migrant caravan now making its way to the U.S border

[noise]\nThe middle of all of a jumble of guns on they regularly and get what you might be on the radio\nAnd he has earned humming I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety\nRun by a you know one of the reasons that you know you and I do the kind of show that we've always done is and and and talk about the issues the way that we talk about the issues and talk about the substance of the ideas is because we believe that we can explain them easy and the majority of Americans will agree with us\nWe have plenty of times we sort of fake name calling and you know and and the worst we ever call anybody is an idiot because we call ourselves idiots and and that's really about the the ... the worst that we um we do we get passionate\nAt times uh but that's one of the reasons we've always said for any Republican out there you don't need to use any type of of rhetoric\nThat the opposition can ever use against you in any way it's part of the discussion that we've had over the last couple of days for Republicans and\nAnd the president and general take the one and move on take that take the ... that's the goal the goal is to win the goal is not to get in a better rhetorical mean shot across the bow that gives you temporary satisfaction\nThe satisfaction for me is getting the political when moving the country in the direction that I Wish to move it getting temporary ... satisfaction out of calling Eric\nOr a as no bed ridiculous city it may be\nTrue in satisfying about every that they're jealous [laughter] may be true in satisfy me for a moment but it doesn't it doesn't really work I have an convinced anybody have I but my opinion is right over Arabs because I did that did I\nKnow everybody in the control room raised their hand [laughter] that's not the guy\nAnd and so that's the you know that's why we have to you you take the whole goal\nIs to is to make it that that you you ... when ... ... ... it's part of an and I I Will tell you this came from my dad and and you and I've talked about this uh the before just in\nYou know different negotiations that we've had in in the business together and that my dad always had a sane\nAnd it's in business be one hundred percent right one hundred percent of the time and the first time my dad told me that I just went when he ... that that you you can't be he said you know understand\nYou're not going to be right one hundred percent of the time\nSo keep your mouth shut in any meeting the ... ... unless you know that you're one hundred percent right all the time sure footing sure footing make sure that you when you said if you want to succeed make sure that you win\nEvery single debate at times that might mean you have to say look I'm not sure I'll get back to you on that one it's one of the reasons why we really we ask questions on many issues but we don't speculators fact\nNow we don't speculate to the point of conclusion right I'm On things that we don't have all the facts on 'em and and that's what it comes down to for me is that uh you know the\nFrustration I think right now is with me at least is the fact that for the first time in a long time the Republican Party is motivated by a president who on many economic things and national things can get things done mhm\nFocused on those but beyond that build the momentum forward\nAnd you know I've got a couple of emails from yesterday's show you know and they were talking about well you think the people who are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and blah blah blah blah blah blah you know these people

was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back I said look not talking about you arrive yeah this is going to change it I'm not talking about my ... I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who\nTold me who was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point\nThat it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message\nSo you can focus on on a new business if you're looking to make a move considered Mercer transportation rock solid owner operator driven for over forty years visit today at Mercer town dot com or\nOctober twenty six visual Texas Chicken fried steak restaurant is celebrating with a legendary chicken fried steak and eggs for chicken fried steak\nDinner for only five million I\nJust wanted to give him chicken flies to blow the smoke and whose country greatly it's just fun money to the twenty sixth just noted I celebrate Texas Chicken fried steak the participant hundreds gathered restaurants into somebody sitters October twenty six you know they\nDid you know the studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are off and unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses becomes severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fun dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nTo learn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on the sink Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help too that's truckers fun dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nThat land and there are infected leaders and organizations making a positive impact\nThe good work show with our effort that goodwill in North Georgia is a highlight the good\nThat make the Atlanta work every Saturday afternoon we'll bring you this story the leaders nonprofit\nAnd people making a difference if you know the area leader or organization you want to be on the shell emailing and didn't work at G.

there's a reason that you do that\nThere's ... and and the reason that you do that is because there is a segment of those undecided voters that you're going after that in your internal polling you have found out they believe and and I don't know why because\nI didn't do I I was in ... to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be a you know everything that has gone on it it'd be you know the the going into restaurants disturbing yeah Republicans whatever\nBut in order to use that term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party in a political ad means OK I'm Still safe from the base\nThe base Democrats or I don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independence and they're leaning Holly's way we believe and one of the reasons is they believe that the Democrat Party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress are crazy\nThat can be the only reason you don't do that in an ad I mean could you imagine\nRemembered this isn't even a you can't even say well this is just a house race in a particular area this is the state of Missouri and this is a Senate race mhm and so inside her campaign which means\nNot just in her campaign but other campaigns across the country this is something that Democrats which ... who wish to promote themselves\nAnd pretend to be moderate what they're facing is a significant portion of independence who believe that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party are crazy when I went in which shows that\nEverything that has happened in the cabinet thing in going into restaurants and is having an effect on independence otherwise they would run the ad\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know being ah the part of the I I guess group that was being polled\nMust have used those words specifically otherwise it's horrible writing because I think a an ad by a Claire McCaskill or could could or for Claire McCaskill could do the same again we're just talking the politics of it\nBy saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides\nIn right now at ... proud of some of the things that are going on in my ... with within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party ... I Want you to know that I Am not that person and I'm like right\nDoes it but that that's the point and that's the great point right there yeah it was specifically using that term crazy Democrats\nDon't want to have a we'll have used that in a Democrat [laughter] some\nSomeone had to have used that in some kind of feedback\nThat they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats\nNot extreme right I'm not part of the extreme of my partying because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal\nPolling because extreme means that you've gone full on one side and in one direction and and to a a further extent\nWell no that's not what's going on it it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone has given that feedback to you with those words\nThat's the only way that happens that's the only way those words end up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy must have appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times\n\nAnd they're in their internal plug in you know you're you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race ... which means they're doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get in front of you get down to this point here\nAnd you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception of crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there is a buildup\nThat word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ad strategically\nAt a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too it's a poor attempt I think\nAt recreating a conversation that people are\nYou know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and\nAnd portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going man those Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill\nThat the actual conversation so you have to have you have to counter it would this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt but that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against the attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the top things is it's it's tough for anybody ... and and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage\nTo really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in ... in Missouri race in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded that you\nAre in each and every day but you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that\nBut Holly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym ... during work hours which with\nThe heated rhetoric yeah and\nThe only thing that you can make up your\nYour own it that was that's what you use and put it in an ad of desperation well here's the thing is people are thinking oh wait a minute I Wonder if you could pick me up some wine next time he goes because people go to the gym during the day\nAll the time well what's what's people people run errands all the time just assume OK just to bring right that it's it's it's on company time and it's it's well the the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on to his time that's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five I'm guessing\nYou hours ... I'm assuming there's meetings there's features there's everything else that goes wind meetings are to me why are they going to be a part\nOf a job but but I I again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just went and and may that's but from an outsider you heard that you went that's pretty weak what part of out of desperation that's pretty weak ... ...\n...

overnight and then I'm Amazed that we haven't gotten an email sounded may rise we addressed it to start the\nThe the the Shoah off with but a National Review and it's being picked up by you know I'm a social media of of some different a conservative website said\nHave picked it up and this is where National Review or wrote the article that said the pipe bomb\nOr and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out a at nine nine PM from jak crow of National Review and the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right into a link to that rights they link to his right so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny 'cause during our priest you'll meet him when I read it I said oh it's saying it then I read in the second time I said well no it's not saying it\nBecause what it says is a law enforcement officials such tests have determined that a powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN\nAlong with a pipe bomb was harmless right\nRoute or out your harmless referring to the powder though that it that the indication as the it refers to the powder not the pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stayed to start to show off the FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw active lied bombs that could have gone off\n... we've seen what but the potentially quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean we have seen suspicious packages I'm looking at the last time I checked Fox News about twenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages\nUh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though are actually are calling them mail bombs but not having a quote you know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight\nBut these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linking him to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package sent a to CNN\nWas harmless we don't know whether it was or not\nWe don't know if the the uh the\nThe suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has reference for and their headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites are picking that up\nWe don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the\nSand yeah that's that's the point is that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not eating those ... from the Eighteen right\nYou know so it it's just because the problem is is with with\nIf you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise\nSo\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they don't sweat it was an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the associated\nPress story all I can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the ...\nWas the Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline had that the powder that was sent along with all the time you know a along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nIf you're a trucking industry

talked earlier will play it again here will play during a little bit again the radio ad from\nA [laughter] I'm\nClaire McCaskill Claire McCaskill I don't know why I had a blank on her last name Claire McCaskill from ... Missouri\nA rare where they had two guys talking and you know this was her campaign ads saying uh she's not like one of she's not like the crazy Democrats right and you know a a again that was the message that she wanted to put out there with her approval was in an outside group doing\nThe actual commercial for it and we said that's really interesting because that means that in their polling they realize and and as you said Eric to use\nThe word crazy not extreme but crazy right Claire McCaskill a mainstream Democrat found that in the last couple of weeks in an election where she's behind\nA still a toss up but she's still behind that she needs to use the term crazy\nDemocrats I'm not like one of those crazy Democrats and it was and and I just happened to come upon this article here and I was just doing some scanning here a few moments ago\nFrom A Douglas shown who is the uh the the former Democratic pollster who's on Fox News all the time right and just you know and and again since he's been a democratic pollster and he's identified\nA throughout his life as a as as a Democrat and he says the Democrats have a problem or a serious problem\nBut one that they have yet to acknowledge fully or frankly at all what's the problem here it is Democrats moved so far to the left the Republicans of attacks on them for being an extremist and too far in the clutches of they're tired out of touch leadership have\nBen work team and the Republican campaign is now simple just focus on how far left the Democrats are\nAnd how beholden its candidates particularly congressional candidates are to the unpopular democratic leadership in both the house and the Senate I've argued here and elsewhere the Democrats need new leadership\nI've also suggested that those candidates were rejected their leadership are likely to do better than those who remain quiet take the money and some of the political consequences\nBut right now as we head into the final two weeks of the election campaign it appears that both the Senate and potentially the house races are tightening and it appears that Donald Trump's attacks on the Democratic party for being out of touch with the electorate and too confrontational as well as led by two failed leaders of the past are working\nRest assured the Republicans have failed to take advantage of what has been their principal opportunity which is to run on the economy\nAnd get credit for something that voters themselves the is improving\nAnd beneficial you what I've said the exact same thing the Republicans still and even the administration\nFocus on things outside\nOf where they have clear victories that are clear to the American public and at times decide to get into the mud when there's no reason to get into the mud right as we said you do for the win\nEvery single time once you get that when you move on to the next when you don't weaken your when\nA exist that being said the care of them currently moving from ah the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration\nBecause they have not just about the attack that they are for open\nBorders bingo we've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week\nAs well they have to be positioned very clearly\nThe question has to be asked where do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's

explosive devices tend to Iraq Obama and Hillary Clinton\nExcuse me that sounds like a fire alarm here will keep you posted on that\nBut the bomb squad another emergency services units rushed to the time Warner set during eventually removed a pipe bomb from the mail room that was addressed to force a director John Brennan reacted to what happened here in Austin yesterday\nOr the a P story that they use as the source there at National Review um the line the effective line from that a ... story is a law enforcement official\nSays tests have determined that a powder found inside a non ... delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless\nThe powder was harmless now not the powder in the pipe bomb right right and so that's what they're that's what they're talking about again here in in that story but it's gone viral because the the National Review\nAgain unless National Review knows something that we don't but they don't state that understory they're sourcing\nStrictly here the peace story but the reason that it's important is because as you see something like this go why are all of that information is is incorrect or any information is incorrect\nAnd the discussions are surrounding this event clearly look there's the political aspect of this can't be ignored but the discussion is important because you can't discuss anything without knowing the complete facts you can't discuss much\nWithout knowing the complete facts we've discussed the reaction by the media by uh the the uh Democrats and and what that has been we know very little about this well\nIn ... and that's why we had said to a a mystery soccer over at the CNN or a whether it was close to your Schumer and their their comments\nOr you know going after and you know and in essence blaming the president's first provocative statements claiming that they're against divisiveness it's interesting that the people that claim that we need to stop divisiveness are the ones that have accused somebody of responsibility of an incident where nobody has any idea no one\nHas any idea who the person might be who would have done this we don't know whether the bombs were lie bombs and would have gone off or not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame that the ones who claim that they're against divisiveness are\nCommitting the the one of the biggest sins of divisive this\nAnd that is what blaming somebody\nWhen you don't have the facts behind you right\nRight\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions or as others have yesterday and and we we've asked a question that if it was it if they are life if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off a then you have to look at that in a different way that if\nClearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare or an attempt a possibility of an attempt\nTo uh you know look at major figures in the Democratic party that are not light well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the\nTried to send the message that they're out to get them ... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a big bomb it would be was it sent by somebody on the left to try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator\nBased on whether the bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\nYeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who are response right\nAnd that could be never so at the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of\nOf how males sorted or by the secret service uh in in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation um that I think you have to take into consideration\nWhat they already know about that you know patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing and and the resources are there probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral it's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference\nAnd we may learn that uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off\nBut that is not what you're seeing here in the a P report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight it has gone it has gone viral that see there was if we don't know that yet and rice Associated Press story does not state that and it's important that\nYou know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the a reporter for CNN and that looked at Martha ... who was interviewing\nOne of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right mhm you said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state that is trying to destroy the you know this trying to disrupt the election or\nAs you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm\nSo what the CNN reporter pulled out was only their response from this expert of that it was somebody on the left and left out when this experts said it can be somebody from the right\n... it can be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away when I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what did the CNN reporter to weed out just deport the report that apparently media matters poured out which is a left leaning a or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion\nYou know on the left as if that's who he blamed and Martha ... oh yeah absolutely yeah are fascinating and something like that and see ... responded they all believe in somebody for fake news will know the fake news is the actual fact checking of the news\nYou didn't include the entire statement right\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review and the difference between the story that they used as their stores it's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and have for a long long time but it's important that as you as you\nGot twelve days here before the election
