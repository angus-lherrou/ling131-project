G of Kanye West ... it's the fact that he's in a room with Trump complimenting\nThem and it ends there and so at that particular point and we said this for the longest time before a lot of other shows were saying it\nAnd that the\nUh the liberal elite and the liberal black leadership in this country\nA bully was in the bigoted and racist idea that all blacks must think alike and if you don't think alike you are not truly black\nYeah that's it yeah they don't have to go much further than that and that's what you were seen uh yesterday\nMhm look I'm [laughter]\nAnd the more attention you give a Kanye West ... he's he's always up for publicity he's making the headlines and it's not even about a tour or a song\nWhen does he not made headlines\nThe ... the whole point is is that's why he does kid rock was an afterthought\nMhm he was there yesterday apparently they asked him a question right yeah reporter did and didn't like the answer\nWell and at some point what where do you what age do you drop kid\n[laughter] I I'm just asking questions I like the guy\nBut you can't call them rock because we already have raw [laughter] see [laughter]\nIt started out I never thought about that when I was a kid [laughter] starts out well meaning and then how do I have a career at\nSixty yes exactly you know kid rock not so much anymore or so it it it it it it could be has a kid rock I'm not sure if he has ... ...

reveal why why Gainesville\nMilitary sales questioned recovery and rebuilding the coup that\nPresident Trump told reporters that the United states should not halt military sales to Saudi Arabia even if it is proven that Washington Post contributor your mouth to show he was killed inside the country's conflict in Turkey\nIn terms of a quarter of a hundred and ten million dollars think of that a hundred and ten million dollars while they're going to do is give it to other countries and I think that would be very foolish for our country but there are other things we can do that will be very severe\nThe interest alone will make it so we will have to cut back significantly on what the government is is able to what to do the other thing is as we've said I'm with the trade war and tariffs that's a tax increase\nTax increases are not good a ...\nRaising the cost of goods and services irrespective of the slogan to do it as irrespective of the slogan that is used to justify to do it ... economics doesn't care about his slogan\nNo ... and it's a ... you look at the dynamics of of that situation where you have producers here in the U.S\nOr that\nHave their cost there they're all materials costs going up a PG for example but then of course the sales that are lost in the exports are from the retaliatory tariffs from the other side\nAnd and then the dynamics of the pricing\nYou want the the product from wherever it is out\nBy the U.S and you pay your going to pay because of the tariff right and then the producer at the domestic producer of a similar product because part of it is protectionism\nThen they're going to raise their prices because you know they're being hurt so they're justified and raising their prime because they can and because they can and all they have to be as a penny cheaper than the foreign product\nTo be competitive tell me tell me why that's a positive\nAh we have stated that to all along and I do think that again the uncertainty because still today Congress completely silent ... ah on the uh trade deal formerly known as\nNAFTA mhm uh a steel tariffs aluminum tariffs which adds to the base cost of how many thousands tens of thousands of products out there\nWhich as we've seen in a and I don't know I haven't seen an update on it we know that in the first half of the year steel was forty percent mhm\nUh we know that the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA\nDoes not cover steel and aluminum and until there is a deal\nThe tears from what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ruins in some of those cases still remain with Canada and Mexico\nSo you know we stayed at when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA but the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference\nAh you you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA yeah he did a little bit\nBut he didn't do anything that he planned that he said he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit right that this ... this isn't going to do it there were little winds here or there\nThe problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem is\nAnd the president views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car therefore making it more expensive to buy a car\nAnd making it less likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas has just been flushed down the toilet because it's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas\nRight it's the one thing they're ... they're a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I've no idea where the president stands on it\nWe know he's changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week they'll go from as he did one for me in a complete protection is just sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands I Do know though that in this in the the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA\nThat he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America\nHe put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter] the original ... the original ... maybe says the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many\nFarmers were laughing at that comment though well because is it you know he talks about protecting the farmers in\nThe move on or ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the the the the\nThe fuel producers don't ... don't want it they don't want the higher blend the it it may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell the Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit um but it will the but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend\nBut when there's no market for it then there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily ... might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to eat Fifteen with out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt you can't get that done it too so but\nAppeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the ah on the terrorists\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said\nThat's a tiny number compared to what we're what we're\nLosing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chains are going to go somewhere else and so it's not just well the tariffs hurt us until they're lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal you know or or the\nThe fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever to to uh\nTo to terrify so you're not Diane double anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious that President used the greatest victory\nAnd that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories and their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services right we don't know how that's a victory\nRight we can figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question\nMhm\nYeah I mean as at when you when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork or as we call it Canadian Bacon and the\nWhen they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why did they go back to us for\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else but we said this during\nThe you know the um during the permit tore him after the ah when when the Gulf spill happened\nThe BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies are producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us our permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right\nAnd so you're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy\nUh you know on a ... at the staff of finger and and frankly the ethanol thing is to become you know they it for the ethanol farmers\nThat's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to political you know support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa\nI mean and for those people that the New York times of listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is this state in the middle of the country\n\nWhen you go there it is all connected to farming just like Texas has oil directly or indirectly\nI mean that is the driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt that's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically vote for Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the mid term this year\nAnd in twenty twenty for the president and his reelection because keep in mind they may support Republicans who are on board for Tara

S. continue for the most part even with the terrorists in place they say they're still moderately strong well\nIt doesn't change the the uh trade deficit\nRight a scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to change with the new NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table\nBut with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property consider mhm that's the real thing that the president has to address\nI mean the terror thing is going to have to be remedied but it's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be and it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that the president would be going to try to sit down with a she in China\nWell that's we need everybody at that table on our side of the table the rest of the world needs to be in China's face saying\nThis can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules\nThe\nBecause of the ... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place long term you're going to see\nYou're going to see an adjustment on the stock market the stock market is the least of your concerns\n... the reason it's adjusting as because things are becoming more expensive like you mentioned uh the fed with interest rates are the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices to to go up\nOr the Saudis have some play in that too yes and we'll see if they ramp up production and and and our enable and it has changed and it is an incentive a a again\nBecause it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were\nEventually going to get to that point I Believe I well it depends on\nWho's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we the ... really one of the most underreported stories\nOf the entire year ... is that the United states is now on it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil\nIn the world mhm yeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of a ... that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did by the way I think that's\nThe number one reason I continue supporting um uh the uh the the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the

response\n... Medicare for all ... well then you're going to destroy the system for old people oh sure yeah I went whoa I mean that was a ... that was a great political response do the ...\nOur product from the president I went whoa mhm my Medicare for all the new killed than than you are destroying Medicare for old people because we can't pay its are you going to be taken from them and it was set up for them\nOr not for not not for the rest of America it was set up specifically for them you do it you heard old people open war that was well and I thought that was a great political age I think\nIt's a great response remember when when they were talking about slowing the rate of growth this was Paul Ryan slowing the rate of growth of Medicare they were uh they depicted him and ads as wanting to kill old people\nBut which site is it that says oh people should go home and die\nWe're not gonna you know afford all the technology and medications were going to send you home so you can die that was Robert Reich ... almost verbatim what he told Berkeley years ago and the former president Brock Obama again saying the same thing\nThey don't care about the fact that\nElderly people will suffer if you if you give Medicare for all first of all you can't pay for it but I imagine you could pay for even part\nOr half of it again pure fantasy\nBut what would happen ultimately because you can't afford it it is going to affect the benefits of the old ...\nAnd\nThere's ... there's no way to debate that the question is does the left care about field\n\nWell Brock Obama and and Robert Reich ... one of his advisors a and a labor secretary for Clinton\nKnow old people should go home and die\nThat's the way they saw it so maybe they don't care I don't think they do but ah Schumer needs to say

getting through to the generations beyond this we know that the loudest of the left or the far left and the in your face left\nOr the um the protest or the go direct approach by the left\nWe know that they're you know not only buying the hype helping create the hype but I mean on on all these issues that the left has been trying to sell\nLike global warming the generation behind them\nOr do you see sometimes indications that they're greater critical thinkers\nAnecdotally mhm my my granddaughter's\nUm and and I I Try to step back and take my bias away you know and look at the facts you know in that situation as I assessed their generation the oldest of which is a is Thirteen\nAh and then there I have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you're very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I ask them questions about their friends you know it just about behavior\nOkay so you know I like social media is not it is very different for them Twitter and Facebook not even on the radar not even but\nAlso how things are presented to them you don't want one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was there they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd\nThey had put sad music to it\nAnd then she asked me that following week and when she was at the house but what do you think of that I said well I don't know she goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were using and I said yeah yeah yeah she said I said she goes I don't know why they did that

voting will be starting in places then yeah you know you and and by the way a our friend Rick Roberts will be here all week next week to uh have great conversations with you\nAnd then we'll be back a week from Monday but the\nThe polls if you start looking at the polls a and you know the numbers in the house I mean I'm I'm ... it's\nIt really really really really I mean you know going up over you know\nHundreds of polls there are some\nThat are you know going to be blue with no doubt a there are some that are going to be read the thirty two RCB has thirty to essentially\nA you know a ... that are in the middle undecided basically just yet it doesn't show the polls are neck and neck\nAnd does and did you see some of the amounts of the undecided you're talking ten eleven ... percent and that's a big deal it is and and the pollsters\nUm aren't\nAs active in the house seats as as they are for the Senate um they will start seeing that but we haven't seen any\nWe'll post Kavanaugh will we don't make predictions but if you if you if you look at the number of toss ups as they call them on on our cp that's thirty two uh\nThe the pole in those areas or you know it in those thirty two districts\nAre really going to start juggling things are showing something here probably by the time you and I get back a week from Monday or when\nWhen I start thinking about somebody who was undecided today and again in a congressional race who knows but all I'm thinking is that if you got ten to twelve percent that are undecided it means they're not driven by Trump's hatred or Trump love\nRight it's not either of that that's driving them so what is it that is what is it that is driving\nYou know that you know that independent in that particular district and we're never going to get the specific poll polling on that lets pull the independence this congressional district to find out\nWhy they are undecided and what would change their vote\nRight would it be in their local congressman came out and said everything is free but by this time they've already seen a ton of political commercials so what is it that would push them over the edge to build a certain way especially if they're likely voters\nWhich means in all likelihood they're going to vote but they're still undecided at this moment what is it it's got to be an issue that's huge right yep and watch the huge ... issue over the lead the biggest issue over the last couple of weeks we'll be Kavanaugh I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody Kanye West I [laughter] I'm Sorry just throw that out\nI I I just I don't know uh you know the the the president the president tweeting and the president coming out with outrageous comments to me doesn't drive anything anymore\nI don't I don't think it it I don't think it in flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to play in the same people and it's going to make the people that love when he'd ... when he does that still love him\nBut it's not going to change what's it think about it who can this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicator it's a small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty to hurry to yes\n\nBy would love to see which district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from

going to be the restoration of some show some some semblance of due process and the court of public opinion there's got to have to be arraigned in ... and I think that the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great history by now yeah\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and the court of public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due process that's a very that's a\nYou know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here it's yeah I I think it is and\nPeople apply it uh\nIt based on their their own life you know our ... our audience\nA and a ... in news hounds and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it and we're always immersed in it but most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of voting\nThey look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't\nUh apply the left believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings lead that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote was a big deal\nAnd if they are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is one of those polled start to shape up the way they do and that's why likely voter gives you a better read but they look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by you know a slogan are driven by whatever imagery but we can't forget the people that take it varies years they consider\nThe things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a with a bottle\nAnd and Chuck Todd was saying well why do people get it wrong in and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd is forgetting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term this is about you know the house and Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right well\nWhat Chuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left ...\nYou know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color of their ... and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the polls show Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or ... zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on TV ... battle solved [laughter]\n... up well I'll Try I'll drop Perry Mason I'll throw up Matt like I'll throw out\nAlmost Thirty years of law and order on the television and everybody understands the presumption of innocence everybody even a significant portion that we're trying to tell you that the allegation is enough\nIf you actually ask them off the record if they believe that they would tell you know why that is bad is just think about that in not just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our popular culture shots from the greater ... on ...\nAnd it's a great point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislation worked for no the three branches of government don't but in pop culture we got we got the sense yes they are simple

users of the postal service negotiates a special rate with the U.
