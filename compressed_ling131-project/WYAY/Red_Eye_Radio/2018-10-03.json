about the murder because a few months earlier in fact in July\nOf ... year Nineteen Seventy five his wife was arrested for shooting her husband in the chest after they had to fight\nIt didn't kill them and the charges were dismissed because uh the wife claims self defense Jackson had returned home to what police described as a botched robbery attempt and according to Jackson's wife an intruder made her answer the door then through her husband to the fore demanding money\nA Jackson was forced to life face down and they shot him in the back five times never caught the guy Booker T back

your calls but in case you didn't hear today Donald Trump but a great a news conference I'd actually trying to talk about trade but the subjects of all this stuff did come up\nAnd the president has said there are questions that haven't been answered like what year was that what they was where was it you know the location knew if people know need to know a lot of these questions\nAnd then he said uh I've heard the third one this girl sweat Nick I have no idea this was true very little credibility\nWhere she's the one who claim that uh mark judge and James ... and brick Kevin I were in a train of gang raping boys a drug in girls at parties over the course of two years [laughter] and gang raping the girls and no one's ever heard about that until now according to this one one witness\nAnd then Trump says was talking about they were talking about judge Kevin uh being a heavy drinker and Trump says quote now they talk about alcohol they talk about all the things that you hear frankly you take a look they're bringing up subjects we know about this over the twenty or Thirty years they're going\nBack and Katie I'm moving dot com studio why why Gainesville auction you're listening\nThe blame game suspicious on blow up I'm only a Francis Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for trying to slow down the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh but the Kenyan reports from Capitol Hill\nAnd FBI investigation is underway to look into sexual assault allegations against the nominee Democrats want the findings to be made public majority leader Mitch McConnell cost is just another attempt by the Democrats to stand in the years the goalposts keep getting moved the Senate's democratic leader Chuck Schumer cutting let that one down\nThe goal of the man to complain about a one week away for an FBI hearing when he held up a nominee for the Supreme Court and kept the seat vacant for ten months is that the FBI\nYou know these are people that are on the right these these aren't the\nFox News type saying that and then some MSNBC to for some reason they've been kept out of the discussion completely\nYeah yeah right right and and it's I think the you know what you're saying here really is that I mean it goes back to that buzzfeed um the the editor at bed at buzzfeed saying this is how we see are you know are journalists now\nAh and for the foreseeable\nFuture basically as activists is this what he was saying that was the message and that's exactly what you're seeing right now\nSaying well we got a ton of things to ah to talk about the background check could be completed today was interesting the story that said you never discussed this in our personal meaning or where the lawyers for Dr Ford are are\nAre saying look she hasn't been you know you haven't interviewed her yet yeah right and I saw store yesterday saying the FBI may not interviewer because she's already been interviewed right what we keep ... and we even because again because when you're talking about the FBI everybody thinks about and invest\nThis is not an investigation right so all they are looking for\nIs more witnesses and any new information what other witnesses are there are a you know are out there what were the allegations that were made right ... what were the allegations that were made again here\nOr in you know that that uh you know in the hearing\nThat caused because it was after the hearing okay we need to add the FBI do for their background check okay what's the new news out there\nAnd I started thinking I said why wouldn't they interview and I'm like oh it's not an investigation it's a background check they already know what you said none of them now I don't know I mean they may interviewer but I I was thinking well why wouldn't they and I went oh she's already been interviewed\nAnd then as you interviewed by the Judiciary Committee and so what they're looking at is okay what other information out is is out there what other witnesses are out there what did she say at this hearing right\nAnd we will go talk to those people because she's the one making the allegations she's the one that testified under oath we don't need the interviewer\nWell she made her statement in fact she made it that I Wish right to the Senate\nIf there were any thing uh that she anything else you wanted to introduce introduced\nTo this scenario to this a process chicken actually she can do right now she could what she could still do it right and uh she and she had the opportunity to do it last Thursday but the great point you just made she still has the opportunity is still open right\nAnd so what they don't have is they didn't have we didn't have witnesses making statements\nSo she's the one making the allegations so they're checking out her story mhm and if she doesn't updated with the Judiciary Committee the FBI maybe looking at the same welders ... look to see the allegations you may hear some people she mentioned we talk to those people we give you a report\nWell because here's what the people said we don't need to interview her her statement is on record we need to interview all the other people that she made the allegations against or claimed that they were witnesses she has made her statement right we have that and if she wishes to change it she can go back to the she can write a letter to to the Judiciary Committee\nStating a here's more information and then the FBI can go check that but they're not doing a here's the point\nThey're not doing a background check on Dr for no they are not there doing the background check or on the allegations that she made against cabinet\nThat we've talked in recent days about the the possibility of her perjuring herself\nBy telling a different story to the FBI but really when you think about it and you back away from the whole thing and you look at the\nThe entire forest and not just the the you know the trees here than you or ... you very quickly come to the conclusion that there's likely zero political will to go after her for perjury unless she came out and said everything I said was false and my testimony\nRight and I I admit that I was lying about that they ... they would\nThen but but any kind of you know variants in a story to the FBI likely is not going to be pursued a by the chairman a Grassley or by\nAnyone in the house but I Know and I you you see Grassley saying they want to investigate the fact that her boyfriend says something ... something else because she was asked the specific question have you ever helped anybody a you know two calls from them about you know how to take a polygraph tests and she said no and her boyfriend is said yes but I view that\nAs putting pressure on her credibility politically in order to get the votes look once\nThe votes on ... boat has made if he is if he is confirmed it's done it's over ... writes that this is this won't even be a topic next week we'll be back on we'll be back on the Russian collusion yeah\nYeah yeah it is not a ... and and I guess this is it is it\nThe whole I on the ball thing this has to be the process is is really to determine you know uh whether the those handful of senators actually uh believe he should be seated\nOr not and that that's it that's actually the only question here the media and the and the left in the media and social media want you to believe it's about Kavanaugh\nAnd you know and and you must\nThink that he is you know a rapist or whatever they want to label him as now that's how you build political pressure but actually\nJust what a five weeks out from the mid term election\nIt's it is it's different because they're going to look at the polls it's the polls that build that pressure and I mean the polls on the candidates themselves not whether they believe that you brought us to pull the other night of ... when you introduced the facts\nTo the case more people believe in fact it was a majority yeah ... you see that\nYou have to fifty seven percent than a change what they think and then when as well if the FBI comes back with a report and it was once ... once they were told that the three witnesses the cooperating witnesses that she named\nDidn't cooperated they said oh OK you than he should be confirmed and then write the sixty seven percent then they said well if the FBI does the background check and finds out no new information was sixty percent of Americans believe that he should be confirmed\nA at a you know at that point of course you're going to forty percent of America as we said you know roughly it's forty percent Republican forty percent Democrats and the rest of her into the other twenty percent is roughly independence and that's who you're trying to\nUh you know that that's who you're trying to convince those in the middle which is All right those are the senators were looking at it as well right and so uh that will that that you know who knows that that poll probably was looked at by a lot of those are a lot of those or a senator so I'm\nA you know I I think the whole thing of the doctor for commit the you know about perjury ... on that will remain a you know will remain an issue I don't know whether they would\nI doubt I'd be surprised if they if they confirmed him this weekend mhm I think it's all done yet either go to another and then they and they will do anything they they move on\nThey move on to the uh the the the next thing they move on to promoting the fact\nUh if I was the Republicans I Would promote the fact that\nYou know we you know the ... the we you know the Supreme Court you know we've got we've got the Supreme Court going up to the ... election\nAnd it'd be promoting math to irks me NAFTA or whatever it is now us MCA [laughter] yeah I'd I'd be promoting the the the the trade deal and Republicans you know do you know uh you know we're going to be voting on a that before the term\nI'd be talking about all the positives and that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy spouses and you would reflect on what has happened you know in the campaign\nAnd I think that's what they would focus on at that point uh I just don't think that they would look backwards who knows I mean whether they could have a a a separate committee of you know continuing investigation as to whether she did commit perjury and and and not make it high profile because there would be no hearings it would just be an investigation and down the road\nA as a warning shot to anybody who might do it to a a you know a future\nNominee with you know ... come in and and commit perjury if they could prove it was perjury right you know they might they might do that as long as it was low key yet I don't you're not going to hearings on that or a big to do on that because once they confirmed him\nThe battle is over we must colors to well they shouldn't go after every Democrat no ... is you can you get him\nA on the Supreme Court yep after that that's the victory that's the super bowl\nYeah that's it uh and and I think Republicans to uh you you also campaign on look ah\nThis this this kind of battle may not be behind us necessarily while it is specifically with Kavanaugh there's a real possibility\nThat this president whether in this term or maybe in his\nSecond term would not would have the opportunity to see another\nAs set forth in the complaint prior to the events in Charlottesville these individuals also engaged in acts of violence in brutality at political rallies in Huntington Beach California

you Senator Graham for listening ... exactly\nUh and that's simply that if you don't have one or two votes you make it an election issue yes\nAnd then when you when the Senate again if you have more you bring it up again yup you re nominate Brett Kavanaugh you re nominate Brett Kavanaugh again and you go through the whole process you go through the cycle again and you use it as and we've talked

all written audio visual or um\nAny information given to a reporter or anybody else at a media organization\nA\nAnd has said that some of the material has been passed on to and actually circulated newspaper or not provided to the Senate and he proposes a a proposes to suggest a ... a lack of candor\nAdjacent to those requests just curious paragraph this from National Review the full details of Dr Ford polygraph or secular early important because the Senate Judiciary committee has received a sworn statement from a long time boyfriend of Dr forge a sworn statement he's been under oath now\n...\nStadium that he personally witness Dr Ford coaching a friend on polygraph examinations when asked under oath in the hearing what\nShe'd ever given any tips for advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph Dr Ford replied never the statement races specific concerns about the reliability\nOf her polygraph examination results he continued the Senate therefore needs this

or make any other choice in terms of the vote because I think this is clearly by the chairman yeah I think this is well it works in an on both levels they handed over a new review it or they don't hand it over and\nYou essentially look at the you you send it on to the Senate majority leader and say well we've done our due diligence\nBecause if you're looking for and looking at evidence and and you can't get any other witnesses to back up what she's saying then what you want to see is All right what was the process especially with\nThe uh any video or audio that was recorded during the polygraph ... you know they they ask for that before the hearing they asked for that ah\nThe weekend before\nThe ... the hearing a couple of weekends ago and her attorney basically said no it's not relevant of course that's relevant because you say that she took and passed a polygraph test well we need to see the methodology and the polygraph test\nTo see that you know what questions were asked\nUm and and again how the how the process on that level work I think that's fair\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate yup you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't and and nobody is above it I'm sure somebody has brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you used and said these are the witnesses these people witnessed it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else take a polygraph test you know in in you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say no I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating\nNope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes because she is using the she is using the polygraph\nAs cooperation that there is credibility to our accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify\nThat the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again\nPart of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as a legitimate\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nDo you feel helpless and

I mean I I Want to credit this I was thinking this but I met you know any of the possible perjury trap she could have her lawyer write a letter back to them under old St look\nHere's what I meant but this is an orange statements yes an another sworn statement or she could add anything to the Senate Judiciary committee under oath any a witness just what whatever else you wanted to do she could do under oath to them yes\nAnd she can ... and the FBI if\nThey've given information about witnesses or whatever for the FBI and they've done their due diligence I'm Talking about Ford's attorney and the

a couple of things quickly here that that I respectfully disagree with him a on when he the one of the first thing she said was that the\nThe these these Democrats are saying all this you know they're not only democratic as they're not on the credit white and rhinos or ... well he ... he said conservative or they should yeah he's a conservative okay well then you're talking about something different but but the these are mainstream Democrats\nOr that they these are the Democrats up today they may not be a my grandfather who was who was a ... by my grandfather and my dad's side today who was a Democrat he helped form the Democrat Party in the town that I grew up in in New York because it was\nA Republican town or early early part of the twentieth century\nAnd when he came there he he immigrated from Canada and he ... to because of the\nBut the prejudiced against a Irish Catholics in Ontario ... his family came to you and so when he came salt was the one party Johnny said I Want to ... among other party my grandfather today would be considered an absolute right wing conservative ... of uh so uh\nKnow to to sit there and but but when you look at the Democratic party today which are seen as the mainstream meantime find signs of mainstream of the Democrats mhm are you this is the Senate Judiciary committee that you're talking about right this is mainstream Democrat as you can get\nAnd so I Would disagree with you when you say the there are that what's going on to that now today's Democrats today's Democrat right ah ah rhinos aren't conservative but rhinos uh our Republican\nThere the there is a bright if you look at at at how many are right now on Capitol Hill the Republicans have you do the headcount and and and do the put the real test in terms of being a real conservative well that many of them are in fact most of them\nFailed that test what we forget were rhinos came from because everything by the way the swamp as involved as about everything about from what the original meaning was and rhinos used to be those Republicans who would spend like Democrats ... well that's all almost all the Republicans today including the president ...\n... they're not talking about the debt right nobody is talking about the debt anymore one of the reasons Trump got elected\nWas because when Paul Ryan was well you know after John Bain or exit stage slapped and Paul Ryan came aboard\nAnd Republicans were furious that were screaming but Trump Trump was talking about it\nAbout how you know if they could they came in and he said nope the budget that rubber Ryan came in the budget it's been done has done and we're going to move on and people were furious and Paul Ryan became the rhino they they they've got to care about spending that help motivate Trump\nMhm\nYou know to where he became you know a Trump than we need to get this budget down we need to you know do these things now the Republican Party they don't care about spending\nNo so yeah rhino rhinos may not be conservative but rhinos are the mainstream of the Republican Party right today they are and even the administration\nMhm it would not have been acceptable it would not have been acceptable\nFrom any previous Republican administration before this one as we talked about yesterday we talked about the trade deal to do the trade deal with Canada and Mexico and had the stipulation on the automobile companies like we had that would have been absolutely unacceptable and and and the debt and then what the projected deficit yes it's somewhere\nAround a trillion or ... or more you know when we look at that are over the is it over the next year I think in the next fiscal year um that wouldn't have been acceptable in fact I remember\nWhen Obama came in to to power came into the presidency he was talking about well I inherited\nThat huge deficit remember that mhm which by the way we had to point out well you were actually a part of it 'cause you voted for that seven hundred billion dollar package so you were part of that you didn't inherited you helped to make it happen it wouldn't have happened\nOr without the Democrats voting for it as well including him but the point being is that\nBack in two thousand this would have been you know early two thousand nine but two thousand nine they were talking about it even the Democrats were talking about it or the you know that now they were talking about it because they wanted to put that\nOn on George W. Bush\nAnd they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember\nBut Robert Reich rhinos rentals started before that but then you either rhinos

get the text\nOr an ... and the funny thing is people have been thinking because of the way it's been promoted we're getting to touch from the president will look terrible you can control our phones no no all part of the emergency alert system that's all it is right but I noticed that the way they've been covering it is you know because it's called the presidential alert system\nUm you know that it's going to be Trump mhm\nIt couldn't let that one do the goal of the man to complain about a one week away for an FBI hearing when he held up a nominee for the Supreme Court and kept the seat vacant for ten months that the FBI\nPlaintiffs compare the alert system too high jacking private property for the purpose of planting a government controlled loud speaker in the home and on the person of every American nope every cell phone on her well\nThe the the problem is a depressant it's already been set\n... you'd have to abolish essentially the d._a. yes yes\nBecause people have their radios and apple had their TVs and that would be and that's a common\nDaring if there is a storm if there is a warning right that's basically common during your device and the government doesn't get to do that\n\nOr if it isn't necessarily common during your advice or if your devices on as I turned off or be a you're watching something on online you're watching uh you're\nYou're on Netflix you're on a hula\nSo it has been broadcast mode talking about television radio and by the way the FCC regulates\nThey regulate a the broadcast regulate the the cell phones so they were they regulate the the the cell towers so the the government has already has the authority you know they've got over the road our right so this in terms of ... lawsuits not going to going nuts\nUm again though you can make the thing that Trump trying to control the cell phones and that way you'll get support for it well he's already listening to you on the cell phones\nDid I say that out loud was that my ... the thing is the guy you know somebody is we're constantly monitored here on the show yeah we're every every up government officials listening to every word were saying on this program and and ram now

eye looking at the latest\nPoll the let me see the uh Harris Poll on Kavanaugh nomination and or other things\n... and this is post testimony yeah ah after the testimony and murdered majority of voters eighty nine percent has watch\nOr heard about the Kavanaugh hearings washed her her while right up right those two groups though\nA the\nA majority of voters agreed with the set of decision to lay the vote by a week and involved the FBI just search for cooperating evidence\nYet the FBI review finds no cooperating evidence sixty percent of voters support the combination of cabinet ...\nUh when it came to uh\nThe the\n... uh Dianne Feinstein here was Seventy five percent of Americans ... disagreed with the fact that she kept the letter yeah right she should have given it to the so they she's not winning that\nOne at all no not at all and you know because for Democrats are liberals they would see that as look you could have done something early on about this and it would have been a bigger story\nA potentially if you would have done something about that and then I'm for ah the conservatives or Republicans and maybe even people in the middle she violated she violated essentially the process and the rules\n\nAnd and I think you you know then usually you can move on to the who leaked it about Ford because the Democrats claiming you know they wanted to help protect her but yet it's clear now that they're the ones who leaked it to the media in order to out her\nIn order to make the story public or does Seventy five percent of voters believe that Senator Dianne Feinstein should have immediately\nTurned over the letter a from Christian\nForward to the Senate Judiciary committee in July ... when she received it which means Republicans have made their point there yep\nOn other issues are ... a Russian investigation ...\nAmericans want transparency when it comes to how and why the investigation was launched yeah sixty five percent of Americans this poll just done by the way\nSixty five percent of Americans say it's important to turnover evidence from the FBI and the Justice Department to clear\nThe air in how the investigation was started\nTwo thirds of American voters want an investigation into potential abuses at the FBI although voters\nAre split and on whether or not biased played a role in launching the investigation fifty two percent said buys played a role forty eight percent said biased didn't play a role but two thirds of Americans believe and I would say that if you say forty eight percent said there was no bias\nOr in the role in fifty two percent said there is by is\nThe fact that you have sixty six percent\nOf American voters favor an investigation that means many that believe biased didn't play a role believe it should be investigated anyway you're talking about again the independence there goes your independence and her saying okay I'm not sure maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done\nRight\nSo that sixty five percent of American of voters favor or that an investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it's late uh [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency\nThe first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n[laughter]\nUh you know it's interesting that seems like a after a two years Americans are paying attention to probably do the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started mhm uh is uh is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said they believed that Trump committed collusion", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye
