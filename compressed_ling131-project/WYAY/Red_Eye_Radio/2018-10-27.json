you've been told in the middle of the twentieth century where lotteries first started in the United states there were soldiers states as a way to benefit the American public by providing additional funding for education\nThat means as a jackpots get bigger and people spend more money on lotteries two hundred and twenty three dollars per year by the average American in fact there would be more money and state budgets to spend on education but that isn't happening\nMost state legislatures haven't been using lottery money for additional education funding instead they're using it to fund the basic education budget and using the money that would normally on education\nOn other things altogether watch that many states are misusing funds well no they're not\n[laughter] are you kidding may know the the lottery isn't adding to the education uh you know a much it they're taking money it's it's going into the education budget but then they're taking money that used to go to the education budget and shifting ... yes they're missing writing funds yes mhm well they're not misusing because not breaking in law they're just\nThey're usually the original they're replacing funds that they're ... misusing\n[laughter] their mission actually [laughter]\nWhich is why that money's going into the Education Fund it doesn't mean more education money because the other education money is being taken somewhere else isn't that what you just said I I mean that's what I read earlier\nThat there are misusing dwell on is that they have now and this this money is going into an education fund but it's not actually increasing the amount that they're spending on education right\nWhat they used to ... they're well they're moving money around it doesn't mean you're using money misusing money to me means that you are using it for inappropriate purposes well I Know that might be ... well I Know know how I ...\nIt's it's it's money that's not appropriate for that that to me it's a misuse if it's not appropriate it and they take it from one cough or to the other that's to me that I'm a ... but that's like saying if\nYou have if you open up a new tax ... and you say okay this tax money is going to fund education and this tax money that used to fund education is going to go elsewhere that isn't technically misusing anything\n\nYou're not what you ... well you may be in line yeah you may you may have it may not be the original intent of what you told people you were going to do those politicians back then\nSold you one thing and politicians today by the way we had said this way back when that eventually they're going to move the money around we talk show host\nBack then said this was going to happen in a ... and ... and it did happen so you can say is the did the system\nOverall are not tell you the truth over that period of time you would be correct sir yeah could you pick one individual Who Lied to by to Ronald Lee not\nYeah well in my opinion that's the misuse of funds or I'll give that actually because it's allocated for this and that's what you some of them that's that's you you bring something to the people and you tell them we want to introduce this way of raising funds for this purpose\nLow income because remember they'll still tell you what's going to education\nBut they haven't they plug it is it's not adding ...\nRight but as it was originally sold it would add to the educated without any agree she would make it so we would solve the problems did you also see what was that did you see the attorney\nGeneral of the of the Colorado saying that ah you know that overall state coffers aren't benefiting from the marijuana sales right because it's recreational things that people would spend on ... on other things\nYou well it's funny because you and I've talked about this about sports venues or something and they they sell you you know okay we're going to build his new sports venue and it will bring a lot of money to this area well it might bring money to that block that the vicinity [laughter] that um that neighborhood\nBut it's actually shifting it from somewhere else in that area in other words people were making that because there's only so much money they have to spend on entertainment right um you know unless unless with the exception of the Dallas Cowboys where you have people mortgaging\nOr [laughter] in front of city lights and force\nThe seat license and typically they wouldn't do that before so there is that but ah yeah it's just you're just taking entertainment money I don't know if you know what would be a great study now you've got me curious\nPeople who are spending money on legal marijuana and I guess we could only include the the people who\nI don't know who are smoking more marijuana or just started smoking marijuana because it's legal what did they change about their budget what did they give up in order to afford the marijuana I Would I Would love to see that poll I'm just curious just curious\nIf not Netflix or\nCome up with any of them but if if you're a heavy pot smoker you really worried about a budget\nWell the money has gotten some [laughter] right [laughter] okay what is it that you're talking now what's in the pawn shop now not\n... not you're you're not cutting back on Monday [laughter]\nWell and see 'cause that's that's adding to the budget so you're Cheetos slash pot budget where where's that coming from\nBut the judge just seeing a little bit about the lottery there we thought we'd start the show out with that in speaking of ... coming up with a little bit we'll talk about Mr pot ... John ... or did you ever think you'd call him Mr Potter\nYeah here's a guy who didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco\n[laughter]\nWell you remember he was completely against legalization of pot where would you not now he makes his money up\nWell it's you know what's interesting is this started a while back I mean this this is the company that that is with right I mean he I remember when it first broke that this was I don't know either earlier this year last year\nWhere they were saying you know he's evolving grappling whatever that was that they you know with with the Obama on gay marriage um he's grappling these evolving but he's changing\nOn his opinion on [noise] well yeah he's in the private sector working for a company who's going to benefit from it is going to get a paycheck from it so now he's for it\nWell you know the ... remember he he was one of the reasons that the term the swamp was calling swamp that he's currently in yeah if the DEA flies over adult and\nHey a swamp that that would be a good environment right lots of natural water\n[laughter] well no I'm I'm thinking about where I live and I don't think they found any big pot farms around there now but it's quite it's quite a swamp the area oh and so there's a lot of there used to be a lot of grow areas you know within like a ten mile radius illegal grow area illegally are not legal in ours to yes illegal grow area\nI haven't seen one in a few years so I'm probably five or six years I haven't seen right where where they have I don't know if that technology has got better but I mean they were quite sophisticated in a row in some of these huge\nThat boggles the mind that they they just have these huge in the middle of a you know metroplex not middle but I mean how to deal but but still you would think somebody would discover it before\nIt induced to helping right in the middle of extremely large suburb where there might be a lot of wild area right right yeah you know mhm\n'cause uh 'cause Dallas Fort Worth is quite spread out but I haven't seen that in a while but I remember they have like two or three ...

coming up very McNamara eight six six Ninety of red eyes [noise] ah you know I just I saw this article I I I I thought it was worth bringing up 'cause we talked about the midterms and the the tax cuts and everything else from the president promising more tax cuts are coming up\nFollowing a you know the the the election even in the lame duck session\nBut the the he'll dot com or talked about\nThe latest poll the American barometer surveying before you say look that's a big pool because everybody loves the tax cuts\nEven if they don't admit let me first of all through the numbers a majority of Americans want President Trump's tax cut to be made permanent or let alone ... and allowed to expire according to a new American barometer survey\nThe poll a joint project of he'll TV and Harris exit polling company found that twenty seven percent of respondents want the plan to remain permanent\nTwenty nine percent should be left alone and allowed to expire forty four percent of the respondents said the plan should be rolled back and you're saying wait a minute forty four percent that seems pretty high doesn't it right want the tax cuts rolled\nBack right when you have close to fifty percent of people that pay no income tax why would that be surprising right they saw no benefit out of the tax gotten they're not paying mhm so that isn't surprising at all\nAs to other folks are there and and again we we always asked this question um\nAnd this is on on the tax cuts in certain districts and we if you listen to the show for a while you know we said this the danger this could cause\nEspecially in house races that are read in high property tax income tax areas\nAnd this is the fact that I Know and and again I live in a I don't live in any extravagant mansion the my house is twenty three hundred and forty square feet not\nOh so I grew up in ... was you know with my parents for the first house which was probably I don't know how some square feet eleven hundred square feet ... was tiny a but still I live in a you know middle class or middle class section I Am with property taxes and sales tax I'm butter sheen off right against that ten thousand dollar limit\nRight and\nMy property taxes maybe a little higher but we have no income tax\nHere whether there is no state income tax and uh in in Texas but\nWe have always worried about the Republican tax plan not because Eric and I not for that reason but for other deductions at you and I can't take because of business interests we're in now because you and I have to pay higher taxes because that's the even though you and I have to pay higher taxes that's not going to change the way that were voting\nRights not going to change the way that we plan on voting at all we're not talking about us we're talking about a significant portion of people out there that are having to pay higher taxes in that plan because they live in a high tax state and they may live in a Republican district\nBut if you see some of these districts in these in these blue states but even in in some even in Texas there are a ton of people that may be hit oh yeah because you because you have that cap on it mhm you'd\nThink of the tax rates very\nUm you know ... from ... you you can go just a from where I live to just ah you know several miles north and the tax rate\nVaries greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah\nThat influences the model now that I bought my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more\nThan ... where's your your taxes are higher\nAnd and with a lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that edge\nA aren't age we're not talking the super rich were I thought about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and\nWhat's their only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump but what's their recourse to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote it has the potential of changing\nThere's no doubt increasing productivity and officials to give them more than you and

still on a two to me I mean this is only my opinion the Republicans still with what we brought up as the negatives that they go in a to this uh mid term with still the positives overweight the negatives and\nI have not seen a party go in as strongly on the ... the number of of issues of concerns to Americans that are dominating\nTheir their mindset as the Republicans are right now I still think the Republicans going stronger ... mid term when a party that has you know the the both branches of the legislature and the executive branch\nUsually lose quite a few seats they use like lose

still a ton of toss up what's two oh five two hundred and thirty toss up still two oh five for the Democrat right now the up and thirty toss ups in in the house and and then uh it's a it's the the

Trump can be the exception to the rule we will find out in in a couple of years\nA but it's when you have the wind don't bike I remember that you know why I bet that sat in my mind because mighty ducks was on the other day in the beginning of muddy ducks\nWere uh he told Emilio as good as as a lawyer win but don't bike and that was the terminology that she used to me about the horse face she said he wanted\nHe had to win ...\nThat the lawsuit was thrown out and she's got to pay Trump it done with it you wanted\nMove onto the next when mhm don't don't even don't even\nSit there and you don't do it if you're going to do was go after ... say see this is typically that this was a kind of lawyer this kind of soup that he files this is a kind of thing that he did with Kavanaugh and this is why the Democrats are dangerous\nBut she just was in and she really has been President Trump is set in the past that was the thing that finally hit her she said why does he insists on going back and doing something\nLike that when you have the wind and you and I talked about this before in politics you get to win and you move on you take you promote the strengths of that when but you take nothing you promote nothing that can be perceived as negative out of that when everything\nIs positive and then you move to the next win and that's one of the criticisms we have had a of a of the president he gets a win\nAnd then makes it not as big of a win because of the things that he says afterwards when there's no reason to say it\nNow she it's not going to change her vote she's still going to vote the exact same way it's not going to change it my concern is when I look at this election is when it comes to Trump exhaustion or somebody like her\nWho again was wary of Trump and then came right aboard and things he's done as we do has done so many wonderful things with by the way the business tax cuts going to help her tremendously in her small business it's going to help her tremendously so extremely\nPleased she's angry at Trump not because she hates tromp she wants him to win and so again she's still\nGoing to vote I just wonder how many ... up how many people that will affect women and men who are on that border and when you have an election when you had this election in in twenty sixteen that was so close how many people does it affect and that gets back to the again the the\nOld the I I think political philosophy is once you get the wind move on well and then they don't do anything that changed the where there's one thing with being a sore loser don't be us or winners don't be evil remember we said that remember at an in twenty twelve yeah\nWhen we had Democrats calling up and we said you you know you said you guys were sore losers with the hour we haven't said anything that would make a sore losers in fact it sounds like you're a store winner mhm this was an Obama supporter when he won and twenty twelve I'll never forget that now because we called him pretty you know fairly angry I wouldn't say\nYou know it just you know all way angry but ... but the only thing why he wasn't gloating and he wasn't even it wasn't like he was ... he was still any reason was ill\nAngry and we weren't angry I guess that that was the problem is that we didn't we weren't angry enough for him\nWell yeah that's what it was right now and that apparently angered him and his guy want but you know [laughter]\nThere are certain things that are are are are I guess you know built in when you try and um\nMhm compartmentalize this current president um\nWhat's not built in as well as the unexpected is the is the language that is used in and everything else\nI don't think they're a distraction the ... the problem for anybody who's going to be on board one way or the other neither do I do except the problem is elections are one by people who aren't on board yet in every case\nThat's where your over the top that's where the you know whoever that is or the people that are in that group\nAre going to put you over the top\nOr to either win or lose and and that's what you can't ah so you know for us are doing this for a living of course but having followed all of this you know daily um and and and very involved\nThat was something that you know all the language is a given it's it's it's built in for anyone who's on board it's a built in it's not going to change your vote that's not the case that I mean that's not the point the point is is that you've got to worry about those in the middle that are going to get you there and that includes right now\nIn the in the house everything needs to be focused on the campaign trail the the president's building huge numbers massive numbers\nIn these campaign stops these rallies are really doing well\nAh so someone someone posted\nA on a on social media\nOr Ted ... it was so crowded Ted Cruz even Ted Cruz had nose bleed seats [laughter]\nSo you know the the Houston rally ... but it it's going well and it's ... that momentum is going for you\nWhat you're trying to do is you're trying to bring in New business basically if you're going to talk to this president trying to expand the ... you need to talk to people who don't you're talking to people who don't know you or don't know what to expect W a who aren't decided\nWho aren't in your corner just yet that's who you're trying to lure in and those distractions are just that\nWell it's and and that one led me to also think about the whole thing that you and I joke to uh uh uh about when remember when uh the new NAFTA was passed and he said\nHe called the people that disagreed with his tariffs turf babies ... and we laugh because we said we were the original theory argue over their head and and we we left but we laughed about it but then we thought about it and we said what about a farmer who's losing his business because of it\nAnd the president says something like that to me and again I don't believe the president was talking to the farmers right right right but if you're a farmer he is talking to you I thought he was talking to you know the political pundits out there and maybe even us to see the terrorists work we disagree with it because\nThe only victory he claimed was the automobile victory that's the big victory that he claimed which\nCars going to be more expensive so if you\nPut tariffs on that hurt American business to raise the cost of automobiles to tell me how that's a positive he never explained that and so we went through that at the time but we laughed at the whole thing and did don't take anything personally we we do this for a business so [noise]\nAnd he does have an effect our business right does it affect I if\nBut if you're if you're a farmer heater in mind right if it affects your business it's quite possible that your family your spouse your your adult children and everyone it's it's your entire families livelihood\nAnd then you think of the region and all the small businesses that support that industry as is always the case and what it means when we're town and community and everything else it's a big\nDeal and maybe a number of farmers yes that and and people that weren't a you know it'd be initially you know would not vote Republican ended because of you right right and then you\nAnd and again that's what I 'cause I was one of those state right and I don't know I don't know what kind of an effect will have only knows it's not a positive effect when those things happen right you don't need to my I guess my point is you don't need it seems that this president at times\nThings that the only people he has to satisfy is his base\n... in his rhetoric mhm\nHe's satisfied I Believe his base for the most part\nUh and and I think the the base has has his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing what's your base isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere they're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him that it's so much in those people who are\nOkay there's some good things and bad things where am I going where you know what am I think and then boom\nAnd and so I just thought I bring up what the the the one loyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again and vote probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I'm guessing I'm not sure mhm but probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit the horse race was the limit it was because\nYou had the when you had the when it was a slam dunk win and then you made it less civil went right\nWhy why\nThat why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base right\nAnd so there you go but uh what is your calls and comments coming up your life you know we do have

I don't believe they left\nI Believe that they are motivated to vote based on what based on\nAny allergy and constitutional issues that are really really dear to them I'm Talking about the conservatives in a band in Trump\nBack in twenty sixteen the never Trump voters the\nPeople that might have voted for him but we're still a little bit wishy washy might not have been as motivated to go out in the midterms\nKevin change that completely I look at Democrats and it's the hatred for Trump remember\n... you know I we talked earlier about uh about Trump's exhaustion let's talk about Democrat exhaustion how many allegations that they made against Trump that have gone away\nIncluding rushing collusion that whoever thought that Russian collusion just six months ago would not even be a talking point at all from the Democrats going into\nThe mid term well you think about it we're about to go I I mean we're less than two weeks away from election day and they're not talking about\nCorruption in an election no and it was almost a sure thing given fat as as they presented it and\nHave been for the better part of two years\nAnd so the the Democrat exhaustion that's been portrayed Trump is Hitler Trump's Hitler trumped as Hitler Trump is an authoritarian Trump is this Trump is well it's like the other day when Trump came out and and and I think that the the ... what oh there is okay he says he's a nationalized\nYou got to understand what Trump's definition of nationalist is\nYeah right that's the risk of changing the definition of words because you're talking about somebody a president of the United states who would like to put the United states first that's his definition their definition has to do with hate groups\nRight has to do it or hate groups and and Hitler yes and so if you use the same term even if your definition is different it doesn't matter the the the label sticks but even that fading away because people have experienced them and the thing is remember ...\nWe weren't going to be around in two years because of Trump ... the whole world was going to be a huge mushroom cloud\nAnd when you throw up that incredibly heated rhetoric day in and day out and day in and day out there is also an exhaustion that you put\nOn your own party that every allegation that you throw out never goes anywhere right and you find out\nThat I and I think what may get Democrats more angry right now than anything is Trump has become normalized we're used to it\nNow well that that's the other that's the other side of it uh in in the political realm it is not really ... right now it it nothing has changed in well gosh since January twenty sixteen the least\nI went back and I was I was looking at some old the videos or clips or news clips and the different videos on YouTube and coverage of Trump before he officially started you know ... or ... announced that he was going to run a twenty sixteen\nI'm going back to the a fight with Rosie back and forth there right\nAnd they certainly people pick sides but it wasn't really anything serious\nThe left really kind of in many ways adored him they may not have stood by aside during that back and forth with Rosie but they really didn't they weren't coming out you know and and it wasn't that kind of hatred until he became the threat and that's when he decided to run for president\nAnd if you think about it I Do wonder\nIn terms of the things that he promoted at at the core lower taxes fewer regulations are these pro business thinks\nI Wonder if they knew that threat was real and and the way to engage him and this is you know are certainly would be a strategy from the left\nKnowing that he's probably got the the skills in terms of negotiating if he's got the the uh the makeup on on the numbers on Capitol Hill he can get those things done to do away with Obamacare thinks he was promising and twenty sixteen\nAnd even before a lower regulation lower taxes the thing's all of these things that the left hey\nHe became the real threat because they knew he was going to be effective in those things and rolling back essentially the entire Obama agenda\nThat's the real threat so how do you start to unravel that threat you engage him and other things knowing that because of the history of going back and forth on social media with with Rosie O'Donnell or whoever it is knowing he's going to engage\nIn that way that that would hopefully derailed his campaign\nThe fact that it didn't\nAnd look at all of the things that were said during that twenty sixteen campaign\nIs staggering it really is it's it's totally unprecedented and it tells you where we were as a nation\nThis is why I think we can't underestimate\nYou know the the silent majority or whatever you want to call I don't think you can call this race and say\nYou know a oh was that the house was definitely go to will go to the Democrats I don't make predictions but there's this is this is anything but a normal election year because twenty sixteen wasn't and we've ramped it up well ... ... and and the thing is as I mentioned earlier\nDanger of Trump exhaustion was that blown out of the water because of capital right\nRight and is it is as it is it's about ... fire right on that I like how energize yeah is there are the Republicans yeah because I never\nIn in that time period that that happened I don't have a read right now because everything's basically gone silent we'll find out in two weeks but I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United and I really can't you know\nGoing back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much ... ah back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so uh\nYou know I I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time I Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the

and you do that by doing exactly what we had said\nMake\nAccusation that all they care about is open border\nThey don't want comprehensive immigration reform they want open borders then when they come back you and say you're just exaggerating it then you say fine tell me what you would do\nInstead of comprehensive immigration reform tell me specifically what you want everything from what we do with illegal immigrants that around the country right now\nTo when we decide what to do with them whether it's your plan to give them amnesty whether it'd be citizenship\nOr just legal status in the country without citizenship\nAt\nOnce you've decided you know to Mr Ramos whatever if that's what an or anybody in the last ... which you you would want than what would you do\nAt that point when more

a troubled loner who showed little interest in politics before the rise of Trump fifty six year old Caesar say a lot of I've been to Florida\nAnd and I would say that it is on like because\nHad been uh the people that object to the fact that when you have a toll tag than in essence the you know the the do you do these were suitable government organizations that may\nShare or their information would be available to law enforcement where law enforcement can follow you wherever you go mhm All right so they they can they can track of a pattern but a warrant\nIs needed for that but the difference is on that is the fact that you have proactively said I'm going to you don't have to get a ... right if you don't have these\nAdults now you know you don't you don't have to use the toll road ... or the toll tags now even if you didn't use the toll tags that would pick up your license plate and send you a letter so they could still you know track you but you don't use or you can use an alternate route but when it rang some cases in in some cases right\nAh but you ... it'd be interesting to see how the Supreme Court looks that just says you know and it may be look you're on a public road anybody can scan you well\nBecause you you ask yourself ... imagine you had an officer [laughter] or a group of officers writing down license plate numbers of um you know if they could uh if it was humanly possible for them to write down license plate numbers um uh and sit on the corner all day and do that\nOr or just sit in a a a vehicle\nUh you know and do that I mean they actually have a some of the departments are getting these these ah scanners in in their in their squad cars or will be soon so that it helps them identify that that ah those license plates uh sooner but if you're talking about being able to to set up\nA in a stationary a situation where municipalities are authorities and you know any given\nA governing entity can monitor you and and that's what they're doing I mean if you think about that\nSo all that data is stored writing goes directly into a database and you're you can you can from that create programs that we'll extract a you can type and number was this was this license plate scene here on this date or in this date range right um\nThat becomes a little bit different and is it like the whole in a safe thing where the government is just storing data on cell phones or your your medical data on cell phones and people say well they're not listening to calls so it's not invasive but they can't track behavior\nYou know knowing what types of calls you've made they can from that determine\nWhat your behavior was to to a great extent uh this is interesting because it's tracking the vehicle but which in turn tracks the vehicles\nOwner or at least pairs it down to a household a and and then again uh you can determine the behavior they're so it'll be an interesting case because I think it's going to go all the way to go to\nWell you know I I from ... in my life I cannot live a life of crime mhm because\nNumber one I have you know I've I've got the the whole uh what location stuff in in in my vehicle and and all that which again the authorities don't look at but if they want to do they can get a warrant look at it mhm\nUh then I realized that when I take my bike rides or hikes mhm you don't have the app that you know ... and after you're done you can see exactly where you've gone well that's what I heard somewhere that the police could also use may get a warrant for that and I realized mine almost my entire life and I have a told bag\n[laughter] [laughter] ah so I have a I I have a toll tag I ah I'm\nTrying to think what else is is there any place that\nNo because everywhere I go even if I go shopping they've got cameras that they got cameras monitoring demands on you and I and many people now have cameras it's very common to have cameras in your home oh you do see about just walking down the street going for a walk every day oh yeah there's there's there's a there's cameras in the ...\nAnd then what is my job everybody can monitor every word I send my job they can monitor or I guess I'm Talking into this microphone well I have zero privacy now [laughter] I'm not sure that as proactive in that we engage in that yeah you know we rented that voluntarily\nUm you could uh I'm I'm sure the hearing in the hearings or the back and forth and and the debate on this whole thing with the license plates scanners in Florida a on this case will be okay but you also that's kind of a voluntary uh you know process\nUh you can choose to not be in a vehicle or you know you could take public transit ah depending I guess on the availability of that well if that were riding or using a bicycle or walking or whatever\nAnd I guess you started this particular point many police officer if you're in front of them for any reason to run your life's mhm yeah they don't write right but they could run your license and make a judgment on you right at that point ... just based on the information that they have that you have unpaid marketing\nAnd the question becoming a is your you've got a warrant out yeah you know what on that and what the what the complaint is is that\nBecause this is where it gets interesting is that you're developing a pattern to it would be like the police following you as opposed to a police officer just by happen happenstance you know a ... patrol right you know I'm you know pulling that up\nNow an officer can also follow you I mean if they if they suspect something now they're not going to follow you for days and store all that information for three years outside of an investigation but they legally could they would not need or hang war it's a four or most of of you know for just following you in a vehicle\nSo I guess what is the difference between that and do you why road blocks where they stop everybody who goes through if the if if their claim is if their argument is by the way folks were just having a discussion here [laughter]\nI realize we're on the radio right right [laughter] it was like oh we're on the radio here [laughter] but well I think it's an interesting race just based on right technology in the world to acknowledge that I just you know you\nGot a DUI now some states like Texas in Oregon ... as far as I Know I don't know about Oregon anymore but when I was there no robots aren't allowed they find that unconstitutional by the state constitution right so we don't have road blocks or with ... so you can have more rights in a particular state you just can't have fewer rights and\nUh but across the country do you I road blocks are are fine ... so\nWith the with the same a premise behind\nA or that or\nCould they would that I I'm assuming that somebody would try to use it that look worse scanning every body it's not that we're picking out one individual worst scanning everybody if we will not one individual by race or one individual by you know I I think\nThe the difference comes with with the the data the sale and its story you don't and what it can be used for beyond any given day or moment right so in the moment of a a DUI road block or like a ... when they set up a we call them speed traps\nAre our apologies to officers but that's what they call them speed traps [laughter] radar gun well that's what they call them that you get your ... [laughter] yeah right [laughter] I you know the the whole yeah I'm you know what are we send that apology apologize to you know I had my break you know I had my breaks but ... but you know when they so when they do that it's\nKinda the same thing right it's just at random they are going to be in a particular spot whoever passes that spot is going to be subject to that uh action or level of enforcement by that particular uh an enforcement agency well\nNow what's different is you're getting a you're you're taking this data and the ... what what that data base now becomes right if it were just scanning and let's say they kept it for\nForty eight hours Seventy two hours uh thirty days but didn't keep it for three years because three years would be a pattern or you know I mean thirty days could be questionable I mean you could have the same argument but it's but the DUI data\nNecessarily stored on any given a I mean the deal I wrote stop right a isn't necessarily stored on any given individual I mean unless there is a pattern of behavior just by happenstance but but\nBecause of a person engages in certain and we all do we all have our certain areas and we go to shop at the same store we'd go to the same places maybe\n[noise] next month the hippie winning home or as the Dodgers beat the red Sox three to to an Eighteen innings in the longest World Series game ever\nNext Monday rates may apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to grade this and it's easier than ever with aids lists male Macs\nA patent pending formula within a greeting if that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases a muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym\nAnd been a bedroom take your manhood to the max by try your first dirty diaper bottle free shipping and handling not ten days not Fifteen days for the full\nThirty days supply free when you text the word fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not finally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with age ... to invest please decrease use for your free bottle techs fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine\nText F.

I mean a lot of money to deal with we read that Fox News or a a story earlier that said hey remember how it was supposed to supplement education it does it have been talking about the states where it doesn't even go to education\nAh anymore that hey taxpayer you were sold sold a bill of goods and also since twenty Seventeen they've made it harder to win the big prize yeah so uh purposely that the they said now the cost has doubled over a period of time and the chance of winning the big money now has gone up even higher\nIn and they talked about how they originally you could pick a number I I've never played it but it was like between one Seventy five now it's one in\nMy ... what it was\nThe one in Seventy now he's wanted somebody odds are are they are much slimmer and and it's more expensive\nRight you could still when some of the smaller price has made it very hard\nThey made it harder to win the real big prize right and and it really just to go to supplement education anymore because the state's even that use it for education I've taken other education money that was targeted for education from the general fund and move that elsewhere and so it wasn't this great you know huge\nEdition or to what schools or were you know we're we're getting to fund them\nAnd the other thing is it's mostly poor people to play the lottery ...\nThe poorest people spend the most money on it\nYeah uh over what they say the average American spends on average Americans spend two hundred and I think two hundred and fifty something dollars but the average per person spends\nOver four hundred dollars a year on lottery tickets now that the average that's taking everybody into consideration if you just take the people to play it it's probably higher\nYeah I just you know for me I just I'm an odds kind\nI don't fear of flying because I Know the odds are\nOne in ten million of dying and those are extremely high odds I understand the odds I understand the odds of winning the lottery or what ah twenty times greater ... thousand times greater than me dining in an airplane crash mhm [noise] so yeah you don't get ... entertainment\nThat has anything I think for people that they they buy what they buy a ticket for what the dream yeah yeah ah for your for I don't know what's the cost of a mega millions\nAt two bucks I sitting on how and what what do they say if you you can't win it if you don't play it and I always say well I don't lose if I don't play\nI I didn't know someone who won I say I did because they did the right thing\nWhile they were forced to do the right thing this is in the early nineties\nOr what our state first got the uh the lottery um and it was I think it was either I was six or seven million dollars and they want and but the they didn't keep quiet about it in the phone started ringing before cell phones are off the wall\nAnd they disconnected their phone the next day and left\nAnd\nYou know because it it I'm sure it became crazy with relatives you didn't know you had in the whole thing\nUm and and\nThat's the real you know that's the real risk of it because that's like we said the psychology is different because people look at it as well you didn't earn that\nMoney and it's a jealousy thing and they were trying to win the money and their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and you're there

of that away if you fulfilled every request\nThere would've been much more time and when I was younger me winning the lottery and these days would be like\nWhat a hassle [laughter] well I Would say it'll it'll take a lot of thought about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money because after taxes uh it's\nGoing to be somewhere around what five if you want the one

highlight a couple of your favorites\nYeah for sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD a biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function and\nSell you the performance in the body he says after that that is simply superb at negating this\nAs evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine\nAnd science in sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams about this at the daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output than those who did not take it for the fights that\nMay remember this after that that is one of the few that sizable antioxidants that can actually neutralize free radicals

skeptic here how can this one simple nutrients magically do all of this disaster ... give us so many benefits I mean really\nYeah I Know it it sounds amazing to get to be true but it really is true\nMany studies that I'm referencing here they're available on top med these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back the benefits of ... than than by the way muscle I put it that are with us does that too and this comes from after that the research published in the international\nJournal sports nutrition November two thousand eleven\nThis was another study done with cyclists they took four Nelly ... than than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists\nImproved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race I mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also burn fat more efficiently which makes sense\nBased on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output\nIn your muscles I mean I tell people asked FX in strength and power out its transformative if you like energy and this is found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nSo much great information you're just tuning here we're talking with pharmacist an author Sherry Turkle here I'm your host mark Larson on this hand ribs study the you mentioned I understand there this involves one of twelve milligram dose\nAnd they saw in Ninety three percent boost in hamstrings and people who struggled with well a tennis elbow now that's a big deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis ... what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this uh Ninety

better or use the computer more comfortably I'm a ... come on how does this help but\nIt does sound funny but I step back may actually help in these areas to an end here's why one of the interesting

free bottle offer for purity products talking about asked the FX\nSo much ground to cover Sherry I Want to get back to the skin benefits in this issue of wrinkle reduction or not I repeat not as a cream or as a lotion but as a cap so\nYou take it orally this patent also covers this or you say this ingredient is proven to reduce wrinkles and not just my little we're talking a dramatic amount what's going on with this\nI Know it's it's fascinating a huge benefit people want to look younger I Know I Do and and I've noticed significant benefit since I've started taking it but it's a science here that really shy and the whole concept of taking\nOral supplements to improve skin health relatively new concept here in North America but in Japan this is mainstream after that that has already won\nUm if not the most successful ingredients in a new class of\nProducts called cosmic suit of clothes or supplements that you take or early to enhance the cosmetic parents\nAnyone that's

always work as I say\n... years to John Miller shot in Arkansas and\nThe ... program and just not necessarily represent abuse or opinions of talk when I'm sick sibling or cumulus media\nThe following a paint advertisement by purity products these statements have not been evaluated by the MTA this product to not intended to diagnose and treat your will prevent any disease\nOnce again to help line I'm your host pat Campbell and boy we've got a truly fascinating report for you today in fact it's not an overstatement to say that high doses of an overlooked vitamin or in the process of revolutionizing western medicine as we know what in fact it promises to promote our health\nMore than anyone ever imagine support our immune system like nothing else can turn up our heart muscles in like muscles make bones stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D well our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor in a sorority on vitamin D he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council\nAuthor of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy of this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor canal has never endorsed to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only door says ... advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it and joining us live from California doctor canal welcome back to the program thanks mapped out just now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the past\nYear or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it'll give some information about how this evolved\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we followed our doctor's advice and our government's advice and we've started putting on the sun block and staying out of the fun it had\nEffect on the vitamin D levels in our blood so I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to guide them in K One but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it need think and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation can learn about it and that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't pocket on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nYou know let me ask you a question here 'cause I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case might have been ... can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D yeah\nThat's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just going to read off a list of headlines when you think about it is truly amazing\nAnd they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek\nOr Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D\nTime neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk I Am a news that's American Medical association or listen to this that vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association the you know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure health immune health all these different things as because vitamin D pat it's not a vitamin it\nIs truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ... it's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and what eventually made as they they're worried hormone no steroid hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid on and the way they work at is the key\nThere are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene\nThat is it on line two thousand gene\nIs the key that two thousand one tenth of your genome by the when one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it\nAnd the only thing that can unlock it is vitamin D that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it neat it just needs the key on lock the right gene\nNow Dr you say we need five thousand I use pretty now here's here's the problem I went through the the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nAnd it was a supplement itself most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity has offered here I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I can either go out in the the new time sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know the the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way was purity products why the importance of this five thousand number why is that the magic bullet\nYeah because of the single fact and this that changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit\nAnd go outside in the summertime and Sunday for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now that's incredible\nI thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's the natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to the ideal your blood level to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefit\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right right\nThere is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering the test the problem with getting a blood test the first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right then you have to go and have the blood tests done\nAnd then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way that Dr order the right test\nThere is there an easier way or the symptoms I could look for they wouldn't tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer ... probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but under symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only and another is your muscular skeletal system out kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic feel will talk about that later then I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance how sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain how those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient\nWon't have any way of knowing it because they've been to fishing for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think and then when you move is normal yeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S", "year": "2018", "show_name":
