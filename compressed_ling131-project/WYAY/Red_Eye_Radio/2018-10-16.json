old fashioned on it was a hundred years old anyway and the club champion Europe here was Bobby Jones his son\nBobby Jones his son who was an insurance guy and he was the club champion for year after year after year when I was growing up as a kid and he hated shall we were scared to death of them which wasn't a lot for us like ten or twelve or would\nYou do it again I I don't know around\nHere is a man but men he could play golf he was a great golfer or for Thirteen\nThis was a day that John Denver was killed when this experimental plane crash in Monterey Bay Nineteen Ninety seven was fifty three and it was because he couldn't reach the gas tank delivery behind a shoulder the plane ran out of gas you try to hit the reserve tank and he couldn't get the level there will ever behind your shoulder\nAnd crashed into and by the way he had his friends you just played golf at at the Cyprus point\nThat his buddy said hey let's go play another Eighteen he said not to go take the plane up\nIf you play golf it'd be alive but I thought that was Ninety seven\nFor thought for fourteen or the new talk what six seven how quickly to China's speaking of Newsweek line Hello John you're on the radio how's it going\nGood how are you very well Sara what's right\nAnd I love your show I listen to it all the time and that due to the call in and said that a ... one funny\nYeah I never ... never laughed

genius uh half nuts like most geniuses but that's what brings us together so anyway well thank you for your kind words for Fifteen\nThey've got a review oh Arthur ray they play out our eyes her Ryan says that moment on a friday afternoon that you realize that you're ... just kept you in the office just long enough to miss the rainy day theater yeah it was worth it well thank you how quickly the sand\nOr they don't talk one of those six seven hello Sam happy literate friday was up\nIn a jam or just said John and just do what I was gonna say they're mad I just I feel bad for the guy that he couldn't laugh at the new Israeli guys to Larry is\nOn the plane he must go by funeral homes just as you know do admire their decor and or something you know what I mean God [laughter]\nI ordered\nThe Haiti and reading dot com studios why why do you\nTo see\nJust by interrogation piecing probably an energized family of friends who was the Saudi Government is preparing a report that admits officials were responsible for the accidental deaths of journalists ... correspondent Elise ... report\nUnderstanding now is that the Saudis are going to say listen he this was a ... a kind of kidnapping attempted to call in Iran doesn't\nWhen somebody is extra territorially adopted and take him to another question for investigation you know the U.S has a long history of that with black sites on during the Bush administration um we've us is ending that practice but it's still practice in many countries around the world and in particular Saudi Arabia\nI at one says Bruce ... and for those who don't know who he is he ran for the Senate against Barbara Boxer her first time she ran and it and then I became is that I think they told me is chief surrogate spokesman I Would speak for him when he could make an event and he ... he was poised to win it was fifty fifty I think the weekend before\nAnd then I'm just thinking about allowed the Democrats are always there's been in their play book I said that last night they saved this thing against him that he'd gone to some kinda ... you say if you knew Bruce ... such an innocent guy\nHe didn't go there for for anything to do with sex or anything like that it was just a place they were going up in fact he was going all I can say this because it came out with one of the hosts said at KBC where I used to be a host\nAnd a seven Ninety KBC and it was just like I said oh you want to go here Bruce and he said yes and the EU is meant to spring it on him the last weekend sound familiar with Diane Feinstein or to try to show conservative voters oh look what he was willing to do to go to a unseemly nightclub put it that way\nSo yeah I just thought of that they've always at the sooner playbook nothing's new\nBut anyway uh he lost that we can and one of the reasons people said he lost his because if you remember a George a a H Bush had pulled out of California I think in that election that he lost um to Clinton and he pulled out all those funds and then they use\nThat to make sure box one but it's fifty fifty before that we can and they pull those dirty tricks\nBut he's a brilliant man and I wanted to ask for surgeons in by the way he worked for Richard Nixon and I I think he said this on the air so I can say he was one of the few that said don't don't do resigned don't give this thing up\nYou you you remember some people think Nixon was impeached wasn't impeach the he withdrew for the sake of the country even though a lot of people thought Richard Nixon was was pretty bad but Bruce that I went with him there and I I tried to convince them not to resign but he said no we're going to do for the sake of the country anyway I asked Bruce once homeless be Barbara Boxer\nFor the U.S Senate from California if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country\nBruce always taught me something whenever he was on and he answered of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd what was it also Providence I Would ask myself that we got George Washington when we needed them so badly remember they wanted to make them king if you know your history and he turned it down and you know set up I'm going to retire or president says okay that's enough and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nYou wouldn't get any argument for me about gods involvement\nAnd now I think you're going to take so you can figure I'm Crazy we got Donald Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most as long ago was saying you know Providence I don't know but I wouldn't you wouldn't get any article from me\nYesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't say much either considering\nWho he was running against right and I remember many of us thought we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges that that was enough especially if the Supreme Court will where a lot of people I knew thought hey that would work for me that's that's enough right there and I think a lot of people across the country and felt that way\nSo I thought we were way ahead of the game when he appointed a Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but it didn't stop there and I'll just mention some of them are things he's done and I mentioned a much bigger list last night ending the bomb a care mandate\nOpening up the Keystone Pipeline remember Obama wouldn't do it and I n war reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy and the proof is how well the economy is doing\nA significant tax cuts lowering our taxes in simplifying the tax forms by the way it was ... and the same one I mentioned who years before his time say we should be able to fill out or a tax returns on a postcard and then everybody copied them years later and ah that that is eventually the where they want to go with us\nMoving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal I didn't talk much about that last night can imagine we paid them hundreds of billions of dollars under fifty billion under Obama gave them secret cash on a plane which he denied\nPay them off for what they're our biggest enemy ... you know what do you feel like I Do that you live that I live on a different planet I mean don't you always of our biggest enemies or at least the ones killing our soldiers right now we give them money to eat them to\nHurt us and hurt our people that alone I mean is incredible eight six six nine to read and I want to know what you think about the Iranian deal is incredible\nEight six six same number nine o seven thirty three thirty nine meeting with Kim all young to possibly reduce the denuclearization of the ... and then Sheila getting American remains returned from North Korea making sure our borders means something I admit that hasn't been solved yet\nWe're gonna talk we didn't last night about the the Marshall people from Honduras opt to request asylum that's going to be a winning a\nFor him to deal with and I'm saying that obviously sarcastically\nAppointing countless conservative justice it's lower court's not\nRight you watch federal judges and ah you know the ninth district which is a crazy district gets overturned the most saying things like a you know he was from getting the president can't do is they can't do that it's a Muslim ban and all this kind of stuff and they've taken power and their own hands well some porn that he points these lower court judge a federal judges to\nAnd of course the naming now of a second Supreme Court choice another conservative Brett Kavanaugh the list goes on and on\nAnd the American people love that he's not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who spin and spin and spin and are afraid to see what they're really thank you so maybe he does too much but at least you you get people love is honesty or at least he says what he means you can never say\nThat about President Trump that he doesn't say what it means he may say to watch but he never says two little I came up with that one he's one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he's done a great job and most the American people get it\nBut it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left the Democrats and liberal listeners will call me let me know what you think and I said last night I bet it's said softly\nIf the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nAnd I don't know if you feel the same way I think each day's becoming more and more presidential he's growing into the job if you remember Harry Truman to replace the FDR and people set off thing I teach government history too so I Know some of the stuff and they said oh he's going to be awful terrible but they said she grew into the job also\nYou're dreaming by the way if you think he's going to be defeated I just want to tell you ... out there on the other side you will fail to get rid of him but not from lack of trying you start in the day he won that it's so obvious now\nActually we know they started the resistance against them much before election day but it was election day came they couldn't believe that this ... so called bumbling fools had one\nAll right he was so bumbling but he's still one right no matter what the upper lead or of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed right where we've seen the text between page and struck and all that stuff he won\nI don't know about you but I was teaching at that time at night and I was almost in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania which was always seems to me like Republicans ... goal you know we're going to wait at this time going to win Pennsylvania we got it down\nAnd not only did he win but despite their best efforts he won he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Mahler persecution a okay\nProsecutors so persecution to me no matter the hostile media media no matter the never Trump hers which I can never understand them no matter all the elites in the swamp President Trump is still here\nWhich never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed\nI fault attorney general sessions for that I'm going to talk about that more later he should never have recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nPoliticians typically talked our adversaries that's not a big deal you know we talk than\nMany of talk to the Russians including Obama to remember Obama promising off Mike the things would be better when he got re elected not to get you know make more stuff happened I've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general\nAnd disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSessions should've made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened in grad school staffers did you hear that he threatened them as they help their bosses conduct oversight\nAnd justice disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption in his agency that amazes me this is all gotten way out of hand and it is clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest ... or our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles and this is my prediction if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see\nWe're we're never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win right her champagne in her celebration there was a big boats the celebrations most happen in New York City there were waiting for her match the only ...\nThe thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that and all that would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistance started if not sooner\nI've directed FBI da ... down the department's criminal division do identify top transnational criminal

such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lack the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment in the early stages of disease minor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work\nThis creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers one dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone

Claremont, California I liked the topic to mark you Ronald ...\nBut first of all before my topic I just wonder briefly say emission Providence I have personally grateful to Providence that we have a man with the spine who can talk back in the media because I knew the weak sister Jeb Bush\nWould never have done so it didn't have it you didn't have the guts\nAnd torture case itch would never have done so either is is too many tics and he was a strange\nCat and ... if\nThey if the American public even what Clinton the damage she would have done\nWhich was been era terrible we would never have a chance to recovery so I think the American people would do as we speak have no clue how lucky we are to have Mr Trump is president\nNow very briefly I just want to say the Trump should use this debt over a hundred and fifty billion dollars we gave to Iran\nTrump ... go on the bandstand and say we could have built Detroit we could have put millions of black Americans back to work and train them with that hundred and fifty billion dollars I think you should say that over and over and over again\nTo let the American people do at the bottom industry should just fritter that money away and why they gave it to them I don't have a clue\nWell I I have a clue you know he didn't feel the way we do about a who your enemies are and who your friends are writing was mean to our friends in in ... a really nice to some of our enemies I'd like your idea I think it's a great idea magic\nWent around and you say in the country and the campaign stump saying he cause people kind of feel it\nAnd you know they hear a hundred and fifty billion or whatever you know and it doesn't they don't relate to but I'm saying hey we could rebuild Detroit we had rebuilt or you know she she caught with the the violence when we could have done here and then there are people can relate to that but they they gave them money away to our enemy\nYou're right I I like your idea very much mark\nThank you thank you\nThank you and now let's go to a piece in Hebron New Hampshire if I said that correctly teacher on with mark\nYeah Hi Mark a ... yeah yeah that's a that's\nHere in New Hampshire but that's why you know I I haven't called the red eye in several months now but anyways is a great program and I try to stay up to catch it\nHere in a New Hampshire or ... the thing that I I Wonder is that you know you see people like Hillary Clinton of all people are ... come on television talk about civility and you add briefly touched on civility I Believe yes yesterday's progress\n... was so amazing and these people by now you have to be ... ... they think that we're nothing but a bunch of blind mice we deplorable\n... when the truth of the matter is if there's nothing to that at all that could be further from the truth\nThe truth of the matter is and and I wonder why people like Hillary Clinton and and that all the so called the a K bad actors that they refer to know why they haven't been handed out subpoenas and why haven't they got to the judicial process the justice system\nAnd I have to wonder that\nWell the way you talk about later probably well I'm very disappointed in Jeff Sessions he showed no guts no no I'm a ... for us I mean what am I thinking of you know he's been so weak in in his position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who would give their life up for them or she is and care what what you did the\nYeah and then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth these people they they're beyond the word

I think that when when slavery everything was put in place they didn't they didn't they didn't have applied\nFor what it was supposed to come out of slavery and I think that's why that's why there's such the level the playing field or solar level in the U.S ...\nBecause you have I Would take you there is a very intelligent conversation but there are a lot of issues like not having two parent families and not going to school and and write that cultures perpetuated as you were in an hinting at look you recall I just have a full bore to Dave\nI'm working my room I Want to the theater\nI like talking to you I just wanted to tell you one more thing where\nYou're kind of somebody's legs and then criticize them about the way they walk\nAround I personally I like Donald Trump Columbus on some business now Donald Trump knows how to how to make money here the ... of course you to visit but I don't know how good of a president is because he was like you said he tweets too much et cetera but I don't think I I think\nYou know here's a here's the worst of two evils which either him or Hillary and Hillary's do better you're right about that\nBut I'm just saying it's\nIn America you guys have to look at the big picture\nAnd you kept cut off somebody's legs and then criticize him above the way they walk\nNow I I'm not sure I got that in reference to President Trump Davidson recall and and you know ... very articulate in uh I I Wish you the best then I'll have to come out the ... and visit your ... but I don't want medical care there they said they wait\nI'm but in any case a\n... is President Trump in my opinion is not a great job so when he says that ah there's not much difference he may be Trump's a little better no I think he's been terrific I think he's done a great job I don't think it's close\nBut as I said he he was pretty good and expressing his point of view let's go to Kevin in New York City Kevin you're on with mark\nAnd mark ... like Michael Oh sure I'm a retired naturally police officer and I I worked in the ... mission office ... years ago I was a place ... and I actually met Donald Trump or on Fifth Avenue\nAt that time I was in the fall and we were

used to speak their media\nYou have to be polished\nBut the media so vile right now against him that uh he's trying to even the playing field and he's baiting that he's actually dating him there all day and that that's creating the outbreaks I made a a\nI'm a veteran of many demonstrations in Manhattan south and uh I can attest that uh what I've seen now my eyes since I started ... years ago it's where we're at a crossroads big time with the the less the left has got a water\nThey are total anarchists they're outright criminals fascists ah and ah I think I'm doing a fantastic job just like you

advantage of this opportunity that we have I mean I I hear people tripping over the fact that Trump is saying things on Twitter that's not appropriate or this or that or the other to me is ...\nCan you have somebody that uh has lived his life financially making good decisions\nAnd uh\nHe doesn't need this job he could be doing anything else with his time and he is trying to send it to this country and taken on the responsibility of trying to ah write this ship\nAnd uh\nYou know ... ... what we need to realize is he he could be a this is what you can do when you can send to the presidency and you're not in the back pocket of multiple corporations or or\nWhoever people say he's an outsider correct but he's not beholden to anybody so he can do these things and he can\nBypass the press and talk to us on Twitter and speak his mind directly to us and be a transparent president something that Obama promised to do and couldn't deliver and turns out was just more of the same\nA\nDemocratic crap that we've we've had for for years and years\n\nYou know I hear I hear the emotion in your voice and I appreciate your call very much you're right he's he's beholden to no end to no one and uh\nHe says what do you think you may have heard me say this you get the whole package is he a sophisticated as the elite would like of course not it's one of the reasons they dislike him so much money he's getting things done and as I said and you seem to share those sentiments\nHe he's doing a great job I I've been more than impressed with him and I'm thankful for every day is there and I don't know if you felt the way I did when he won and I watched his family are kind of come down celebrated victory from day one\nI was worried that someone would go after him in some way and I think God every day that he's not he's around I I just don't trust the other side especially in one I'm telling you now is it looks like a civil war I said yesterday we talked about it\nSo I appreciate your call very much and certainly your emotions let's go to there was somebody else a a has a bumper sticker idea I got to hear this jak in Branson, Missouri you haven't had one per sticker

it but this call's appropriate I Love people who disagree and I wish many more of you would call do disagree with me and I think Christine in my old neighbor of Redondo Beach California where I started teaching California is on the line like Christine\nHi how are you hearing her\nThat um I just wanted to say I know you're ... where I can only go on vacation and Fox News say [laughter] and I just want to get the a perspective of what's going on on the other side and it's it's just crazy it's crazy to me that\nYou they say that\nUm we don't believe that Democrats are people on the left that we aren't believing in America will do very much believe in America um I think one misconception that Republican or far right is that\nWe want to open up all border wall we watch it just I mean it just apply there are things that we want to do that's not true and I think that\nTrump I Can't wrap my head around and and this is what I Want to ask you I Can't wrap my head on why people like him I get it you're going to stick to your Republican he's a Republican representative he's our president he's for that party\nWell everything that this man does is not right it's not correct and I in my opinion and I'm just wondering how\nSo many people um and well you know those people who back him up at any cost at any\nNew now at any cost ... go ahead no no\nI'm Sorry a first of all I I didn't say Democrats don't believe in America I'm very clear about seeing the left I don't believe believes in America so obviously I Know Democrats love America ... there's no issue about that at all\nWhat you said we we backed Trump in in what things don't you like the the you know we'll least clarified differences I'm not going to argue with you but what you think he believes in or has done that you don't like so much\nNobody everything I mean I I really I Can't even believe how are you still are not because\nOf the ... name name I Know NO NAME on it at all but okay\nLet me let me let me just tell you that's our topic\nUm I I don't get and maybe you can answer me I don't know um\nIf he had if he did something we're not going to find any proof direct proof that he had anything to do with the election like Trump himself um but there was um I mean voter fraud everything going on why would Hillary be our president ... that was the case\nWay to say I'm just wondering like there's some you know your your last me do I want to answer your question is often been voter fraud that that you you can't blame that on President Trump ordered the collusion with Russia has been zero evidence that there's something has been going on two years so there's been no zero evidence of that\nIs that what you're saying about that they're having to go for the\n... yeah so how how is it that every person\nAnd Paul ... and is going to jail or\nGoing to hurt during ... so how are you where the ...\nYeah so it would no that wasn't the all the people that have gone to the gym a lot of them are Russians when they mentioned this thirty six thirty nine some of these people Russians having nothing to do with President Trump but Michael Flynn a pleaded not not because he had anything to do with the Russians Paul Manafort they with some\nYou know business dealings he didn't report when your brain and so and none of these things out and if you do with President Trump\nOr Syria saying why all the people everybody knows first of all it's not everybody is just we're talking about some people but none of it was with President Trump colluding with Russia you\nLet me ask you questions we really believe that he polluted with putting I mean we've had zero evidence of that yes\nAbsolutely I absolutely knew and I believe I Believe they'll have proof of that and if they don't it's like with a cap and I mean and then going back to that I Want to go back to that but with Kevin ... it was it was a disgrace to say oh we we we believe Kevin a hundred percent but Ford\nOh we believe her cute but but

I'm just happy to instill some common sense of the show uh I I think Trump is absolutely\nAbhorrent uh I got a laundry list I won't go through 'em all but the the barbaric handling of immigrant children disgusting\nUm there's at Youtube video I've seen and believe me believe you don't believe me it's been taken out for you to have a talk show years ago I Believe it was a David Letterman where he said his slog arrogant way I'm very very intelligent so of course I'm an atheist or he's got a Christian\nOr can we use encroaching on\nHold hold on I Want to just I'll give you a chance what you said something that hit me right away so the barbaric treatment of immigrant children first of all they're not immigrant children they're illegal immigrant children\nOr let's call them the way it is and I don't know what's ... why it's barbaric to say that you have certain rules and laws and ways of getting in a country and if you don't come in that way\nThan we can't accept you what's barbaric maybe is the parents bringing the children here they're responsible for the families being separated broken up so I don't think he's being barbaric you would probably call me barbaric\nJust 'cause I Want some rules and I want some uh procedures in terms of sovereignty why is that barbaric\nI don't care who the children belong to the handling was barbaric\nAnd if it was your child you'd be singing a different to you\nWhat you are no no no no you don't get to go on you don't run around you know you don't get to go on if you don't give me a chance when you say something so absurd if it was my first I Want to bring my child's up here if I knew they could be separated from me\nI Would do in the first place so don't tell me what I Would do I'll give you your chance\nBut don't try to read my motivation on my mind these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules in our procedures and it's not barbaric to say if you do that when we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go your return\nTo explain our federal judge a put a stop to it it is barbaric whether you want to say it is or not\nThe way they handled it not necessarily joining it in the first place shepherding the show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation will be warranted it's the way they they ... they say half bought\nHandled it let's just say for instance I'll be real quick I took my kid Chuck E. cheese recently I had a bracelet that said one two three for example that my child at a price said once you three\nThat way when I was able to leave their verified the bracelets without it will go on my way they could have done something similar but they didn't do anything she's got children\nOr elderly or

your last caller and the young lady before a earlier than I\nAre typically people who amongst my peers I noticed that\nThey hate Trump's so much that they're incoherent they can't really articulate why but there are reasons they give some time proving other people's point like mine where he was talking about the immigration or maybe they're not immigrants because\nThe next to sue to say that right he's an immigrant because he came here legally why survivor I married my wife overseas I got married when I see people coming over here\nAfter I have to pay all that money and go to hope to get her over here and help people jump in front of line because they came here would be covered geographical location I mean people get a real live America is a country of laws\nAnd this man is trying to

now I Believe in what the president's doing that's why I voted for I don't think he's a racist at all as a matter of fact as a black man uh I remember it was about maybe like Fifteen sixteen years ago in double ACP gave him an award\nHow come they you hear all these other people call him a racist but how come you don't hear them speaking up than he is but they won't even defend them either because if it's convenient\nI think for people to just put a label on people without any\nThat's right you know ... if\nIt's just it's just ridiculous and uh he has done more for this country the last president in in in eight years and I'm the I'm going to tell you right straight out Obama was the worst president ever\nAnd you'll be surprised may not wanting ... you may be surprised\nTo know you haven't heard me because I've been on a number of years but until recently not back on this network\nA I feel the same way I think President Obama is the worst presidents we've had in our history certainly in my lifetime he did more damage and he started by apologizing for the greatest country in the history of the world he was the ... going on our apology tour uh I I agree are examining who\nI Am about one before Saudi king and which is ridiculous but I I like what Trump you a little bit to his speech a couple of weeks ago a and the un I well I got out of this speech was one of the things they in fact we say it but what I took from it\nWhen you say it's going to make America great again he was letting people know why don't you make your country great again and make it a place that people wouldn't want to leave\nYou know about that\nWhat we've done that works so well right free enterprise little regulation limited government why don't you try that for a while the guys and see how it works in your country\nExactly and ... and ... again going back to the immigration boy that guy said the uh the kids were treated the old policy was put in place long before Trump became president\nThat's right and as a matter of fact\nA lot of those are the levels kids coming across\nThere there may may not even be those kids are a so called adult children it's quite up somebody a walk across we saw it on the videos what what are some of the uh\nPeople from Syria which just picking kids up walking across the border demand and get into some of these places and I didn't belong to them so you don't know who these people are\nAnd in Mexico as a matter of fact treats the people that come across the board is illegal me from Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua Guatemala they treat them
