Grassley Sunday a letter to the lawyers of a doctor for it and it said I'm a I'm writing in response to your letter dated October second you said Dr Ford is was yesterday said you said Dr Ford is going to turn over her documents\nTo the FBI but my request to view was not for the documents to be turned over to the FBI issue to provide the documents the Senate Judiciary committee response on behalf of the client is a non secular the constitution charges the Senate with the ... and the president and his nomination\nSenators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the president's nominees are obligation as unrelated to anything be FBI does\nThat's why we just don't vote on nominees after the president loans us or the FBI background investigation we have to make our own assessment the U.S Senate does not control the FBI if you have an objection of how the FBI conduct its investigations take it up with director rate\nBut don't raise that objection is a reason not to respond to this committee's demand for relevant evidence the FBI's investigative decisions aren't our concern\nEven if the FBI never interviewed Dr ... interviews or ten times this committee as a constitutional obligation to investigate Dr Ford's allegations and that's what we've been doing since we became aware of or allegations\nIt's not even clear to me what purpose turning over the over those materials to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that over ... over\nTo us as we just said that we we stopped\nThat's the only purpose the FBI search that's always that's always stop the last caller says well they're well they're they're political what does nothing investigation despite political it the the ... the\nThe FBI only facilitates the interviews they conducted interviews because they have the resources and the training that it's that simple right and and so it doesn't make it again this this is where her lawyers are bringing up something that isn't even relevant to the investigation to begin with because\nFor the million times there is\nKnow FBI investigation the only investigation that's been going on is the Senate Judiciary investigation well because it it just shows you how\nAre the\nThe lawyers for Dr Ford or either completely clueless or they didn't want those notes to come out because had they been given to the FBI again assume the FBI decided to respond to them\nAnd take those notes those therapists notes they would have been part of the report\nThey wouldn't they wouldn't have seen the light of day beyond the eyes of a hundred people\nA it's not even and by the way emerges from my phone so I just happened to go into it or industry that Mollie Hemingway was on it it's not even clear what purpose turning those materials over to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that evidence over to the Senate\nAnd that is precisely the outcome but I think with this request is to get the information right you have claimed repeatedly that the evidence I requested supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nShe even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second here as I have to go to a a to a national media indeed if the evidence\nOr supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will claimed ooh that's a challenge is not\nRight I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the ah with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting here 'cause that was the key of\nLook at the last sentence\nWith recently uncovered the mission please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein in Hirono other than a year communications with me and my staff member my step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing\nThe alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford leaving them Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and a WBUR mirrors Julie sweat Nick or their

I guess you could say sort of breaking news uh center Steve Gaines of Montana told Fox News exclusively on Thursday night that although he will\nWalk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding Saturday his plans will not affect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote\nScheduled for the same day ... speaking to Shannon brain which means just had to be late last night right uh and Fox News ... said he personally called cabin up Thursday evening and told him I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed so that isn't going to delay anything it was funny because you said\nWell you know it wears his daughter getting married in Montana that and I looked at you and said I don't think he wants to anybody you know probably\nDoesn't want anyone to know and\nBecause and that really spells out how crazy this thing is\nEr and has become the left believes going direct especially after confronting a Jeff Flake that it's working that they're you know the the the tactic is not only working but acceptable\nAnd we'll shame you out of a restaurant will uh will confront you on the elevator will anywhere and everywhere as directed or I guess they encourage further encouraged by Maxine Waters anywhere and everywhere it doesn't matter where you are\nGetting their face well that becomes dangerous because it's impossible for somebody to be able to assess a threat just imagine in your\nEveryday life and you're not a lawmaker or unless we have lawmakers listening which we often do and we thank you for that but you're not included you're\nYou're just walking around grocery store [laughter] thank you or the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for listening and and also Senator Lindsey Graham for yeah I guess and probably ramble although [noise]\nHe's screaming know all the time um but [laughter]\nWe act we love ramble but if you're walking around you know in public\nThe average person and someone just ran up to you and started screaming your face\nYou wouldn't know what they're doing you know you don't you don't know what the threat level is and and and certainly it's it's different when you were just like when you're confronted and the way he was in you you you know why they're in your face but you can't assess the threat level in public you can you just cannot\nYou don't know what the person is capable of doing if they're good you know they're physically harm you\nUm it's it's impossible to assess that so that such security has been ramped up\nA tremendous uh the restaurant in fact that's where Ted Cruz was shamed out of the restaurant a first of all kudos to the restaurants saying you know because you can hear a person in the background on that video saying\nLook you can't you know telling the protesters look you can't be in here this is a private you know business so you saw the letter writer or that Rand Paul's wife wrote to CNN ...\nAnd and challenge Cory Booker and everybody else saying look you people are you you're you are enabling yes these threats you have to own it now 'cause rather Maxine Waters especially but and yeah and you need you need to stop and she directly when after Cory Booker right\nYou know that's

islands where the USS Decatur was conducting a freedom of navigation patrol and was confronted by a Chinese warship which came within forty five yards of the American vessel\nThat is reckless harassment according to vice president saying that the U.S will not be intimidated in the south China Sea or anywhere\nSo it comes down to those ... we'll call them the final four but those were the before the meeting a after the hearing a week ago yesterday right a hearings so after the hearings four of them just like\nA Susan Collins a Murkowski and mansion went into a room and had a meeting\nWe don't know what was discussed but\nIt appears that it's really coming down to those now because you have essentially Heitkamp is said she's no so essentially right now the only Democrat it looks like you might be able to count on is Joe match\n\nSo if you've got every Republican on board assuming that a Jeff Flake is yes then that gets you to fifty two\nIf Jeff Flake is a no you're still on the soft headcount you're still it's if you want with mansion with match if for some reason Manchin pools out or Murkowski\nOr they it doesn't appear that Collins will if Collins had a concern she would have issued that concerned about the report saying I'm not sure we got everything\nAt the very least she would've question something praising the report tells me you can count on that vote so right now you're looking at I mean I think at the very least fifty with the vice president bingo cyber\nAt fifty one uh the word from and and there was another story in the in the wall Street Journal that the you know the GOP right now is a is really upbeat about the confirmation process they you know they\nThat's a if you look at it that the the talk right now is that they're confident\nOr so you get through a a culture which will happen sometime during the day on friday as you mentioned Gary the process will start mid morning um but then the actual vote may not happen until later in the afternoon\nWhen by the time they get to the procedure one with the actual both take place and then there were the third in the ... hour loop o'clock stop starts at that point yet up\nAnd they can take up to thirty hours it may not take thirty hours they could end the debate before thirty hours but assuming they'll use the entire thirty hours and they might ah especially on a Saturday the media might give them the the news media cable news might give them you know all the time of the world\nAh so do you look at the the so called hopefuls for twenty twenty your usual suspects\nOr a warrant and all of them looking to get cameras time or the debate might you know go on the full thirty just assume that it will they'll that's that's why you've got the rule assume that it will so that puts it late into Saturday Night as you mentioned earlier Gary\nDepending on where they landed on the uh the the clock lands on the cultural wrote maybe into early Sunday Morning\nBut that gives them there's the I guess the wiggle room or the enough room for senator Danes to get you know home from the wedding I guess or or back to work for the wedding\nAnd ah as daughter's wedding and we wish your daughter and her soon to be husband all the best uh but they'll he'll give back he's saying he'll get back in time to devote so that tells us is probably going to be a late Saturday Night but\nYou know I I I think about all the and I'm just sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the\nAll the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain things you know that when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on and if you look over the last eight\nYears and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street you\nKnow all all that that that uh that went on all the the\nThe occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that you have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be\nQuite intimidating but here's the question is it effective for them right has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration\nI mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh the Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas nothing like that mhm so you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing\nAnd you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened when the police tried to push them off\nBut at this is almost the exclusive domain of the left and there for the Democrats sure yeah and you think about the run that they have had since all of this you know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street\nAs just the beginning of of this portion of it has it been effective for them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation\nTactics will actually work and change for example they're not you know you you you could see if they might be a you know threatening\nA just a a you know the the senators that are on you know ... you know I'm On the edge right now right okay on the margins but they're not they're going after everybody ... here whether it's crass he doesn't care what their McConnell what do they really think that that's affected\nOr is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage because that's what it is\nIt's just insane rage that they're filled with right yeah just anger and and and rage\nIs it just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that is affected by just I I really wonder and [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this I'd love to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible [laughter]\nSo I'm never going to find out because I'm never going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is\nThat right well I I I think after the like a thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective to some extent\nBut I think it's probably a ... a lot of I was gonna say little of both I think it's a lot of both actually that they believe after confronting mansion and after you know the behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that Gary\nThat youre not protesters in a restaurant you work there it's your job and you refuse in one case to do it for because Sarah Huckabee Sanders is\nEating the food you're going to prepare and serve\nCan you

A. Y. Gainesville offshore Mueller station\nFans are fed nomination protest I'm actually a princess and the wall Street Journal op ed published Thursday's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh writes that he quote might have been too emotional at times during his Senate testimony last week corresponded Caitlin cones reports\nAll my sources inside the White House knew this was his idea he wanted to come out and apologized for his demeanor last Thursday during that year and they've gotten very tense at times but if you look at it he apologizes for being too emotional\nThe opposite excuse for that he says it's the nature of the allegation made against him and he says it's because his family his daughters is why his parents were seated in that rent growing\nThey can say this judge can't have a hearing the Senate can't say well there's judge can't have a hearing the executive branch this judge can't have a hearing\nKnow while they they get the process and then after the process the result of that process is what you're going to challenge in court there is no standing here well there there's no standing\nBecause because the Senate is moving ahead\nBy the will of the Senate because the majority rules now in the Senate and what I'm saying is\nNo the president has given us all the information will know the majority in the Senate which call the shots mhm believe that the executive branch has fulfilled all of their request ... they have stated that publicly that's why there's going to be a vote there is no fight\nAnd there is nothing that the executive branch\nIs doing to hinder what the legislative branch is doing everything going on and the legislative branch which is the Senate is being controlled by the majority in the Senate which is how the constitution has dictated it right I mean there's just so sick\nOf it does not set the vote or the timeline of the vote now he does not a set the uh the the the\nSenate majority leader schedule for when when McConnell on Wednesday or gave notice for cloture that the president doesn't have anything to do\nWith what's this federal just going to do an injunction and they go yeah right [laughter] and and then and then they go ahead with the vote right she gonna take McConnell and put him in put him in contempt of court yeah and they had somebody come on an arrest McConnell\nYeah because uh uh uh from what I understand the story Merkley had had gone to the courts before this and what do you hope would have been trying to do is get that that's why they've scheduled a hearing on Wednesday\nBuddy that was I think a move where they filed either last week or early earlier this week\nAnd then when it looked inevitable and it did of course it was inevitable or as a Wednesday afternoon a that there was going to be a vote ah this weekend that's when Merkley said well no no no no no because we haven't had you know our our day in court with the Trump Administration the Trump\nAdministration the executive branch does not set when the Senate is going to vote\nThis is really weak I mean is this is the Hail Mary I mean that this is well just like that but here's the thing\nYou're not gonna wanna miss work tomorrow [laughter]\nWell well I mean unless you put it this way it's friday you might want to miss a little sleep during the day or at least when you get up turn every device that you own on and make sure it's connected because\nIt's only going to ramp up between now and the final vote on Saturday or early Sunday when whenever it happens\nThis is ... because you're right a couple of things here again the legislative branch doesn't have the power to stop I I'm Sorry the judicial branch doesn't have the power to stop the legislative branch process right\nThey don't get to say you know what their schedule is now if they go through and again enact a law signed a law a bill into a a ... the president signs it into law they can come in and then challenged the effect of the process\nBut then outside of that as you point out Gary it's two separate branches that are working here you're suit your lawsuit should be against the Senate it's not it's against the executive branch who has no states over the timeline of the vote on the Senate\nWell I bought buddies job but he wouldn't have there he knows there's no chance that he could go to the court and said let's stop the process because I disagree with the majority right because that that's not going to go anywhere so what he's trying to make is that there's a debate going on between the executive branch\nAnd the Senate ... ... because in the executive branch's interfering with the Senate where you can't make that point because the Senate which is the leadership of the Senate which is the Republicans have said we've got everything we want from the executive branch and the FBI we're moving forward and he's trying to say that the executive branch\nIs holding things up and not giving them the information well you don't get to make that call is the minority member you don't get to go to the court to try to override the majority in the Senate\nI you know this is like is like if it's like I decided to get in the ring with a an event or Holyfield right\nAnd realize quickly that I'm greatly overpowered so I called in Mike Tyson to do my fight for me I mean this is the uh this this is like because it's basically you have a Democrat who's not getting his way\nAnd his only claim is that they're not getting documents the Senate's not getting the documents the Judiciary Committee chairman\nIs the one who rules that part of it in any vetting process and you know that this is the process but since you are not getting your way\nYou're trying to call mommy and daddy and to stop me no Trump or the amino Republicans because you disagree with it it's not going to change your vote it's going to delay the process but it\nIt won't even do that now as well because it's it's it's not going to happen yeah uh but but I ... in a first thought I had was anybody who wonder stands separation of power\nOh wait a minute that's very few people are very few people understand the separation of powers yeah\nNever mind yeah or if you want to get in we do have a line up and we'd love to hear for you or from you the cloture vote scheduled a sometime after ten thirty than a thirty hours of debate and the vote sometime Saturday

who\nWas there tell us who was there right\nWhat are your witnesses to the actual interview here say doesn't matter here we are to do an investigation uh you know here say doesn't matter who are the
