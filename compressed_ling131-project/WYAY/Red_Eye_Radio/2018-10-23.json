I don't really care whether we get you know Obama's endorsement and I really don't need Obama's endorsement as if look you're the old news and then a case of protest coming out in St Bernie Sanders nine door summit twenty sixteen we'll wait to see what happens\nYou know come or twenty twenty wow yeah\nAnd and do you look at it and you say who will be the uh\nYou know who will be the person who will be the ah you know the nominee for the Democrats are in twenty twenty we got a great show ahead coming up or early voting I started yesterday in Texas has already been done in other states even before taxes that NBC story out there saying that the GOP is out doing the Democrats\nIn the early voting in a bunch of different states will get to uh that\nUh the um ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n... what else or there was something else I had\n\nWhile you have to oh yeah yeah because I mentioned uh uh twenty twenty and the Democrats are we\nTold you so Cory bookers plan to give out more cash mhm we talked about this yesterday that what you're going to see from the Democrats is free everything for twenty twenty ... free everything but we don't believe in the constitution and we hate America that's\nThe new that is the new narrative we don't believe in the constitution we don't believe in due process we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the the the second amendment we don't believe that there should be a Senate we don't believe that there should be a a a a a\nOf electoral college we don't believe in the constitution of the United states but we wish to give you everything they got up to six thousand dollars Camilla Harris now Cory Booker talking about fifty thousand dollars\n\nThat can be used or by the young poor in this country to buy a house or to get a college education so now they're up to fifty thousand dollars remember back in twenty sixteen to show you that Eric and I are on the cutting edge of where the left is going\nOh we dated look why don't you just come out we need somebody to come out to be the first\nOne to say what is going to give everybody a hundred thousand dollars well they're not up to a hundred thousand yet but two years after we said that and it was two years right about now mhm 'cause we told Hillary luck if you want to get if if you're looking for that last\nYou know to wait push hundred thousand everybody does it just go all the way yeah\nCory Booker now up to fifty thousand dollars ...\nThat's the other problem we discussed yesterday was Hillary you know with a with everything you know the the big free and and and all the money you don't forget the free will also pay you were going to pay you know the government's going to pay you so you get everything for free and we're going to give you money\nWell if you're Hillary there's no way you can't be a moderate in your approach no if she's thinking of running you better take some numbers down they're gonna have to be bigger than what's out there now\nWhen you well you know the the six thousand really just got blown out of the water\nYeah I think just out and ... ... ... men that in a couple of days now we're up to fifty thousand right and that's not enough you can't buy a house for fifty grand bunkers got fifty thousand who's got marking on I got a hundred thousand a hundred thousand ... hundred thousand\nWhy don't we just force the home builders to build somebody there ... everybody their dream home\nAh the grocery stores they can charge you anymore\nLike health care is the right food must be a writer yeah free food as long as it made by the way why isn't anybody come up with a bad thing about that for years long shouldn't that be before cash yeah why isn't somebody come out and said look where are you paying for everybody should have been before health care\nYou know go to the doctor every day but most people most people except for supermodels eat everyday\nFood\nBy the way we don't condone just walking into a grocery store and leaving without paying\n[laughter] hasn't happened yet [laughter] wait\nWait for it but that's this is this is what you're going to have to do [laughter] it will be an auction they'll have an option here during the the primary for the left it'll just every every instead of debate it'll just be an option\nOf what a promise his campaign promise auction you've caught\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nYou've got Democrats out there saying you know with this one point six billion dollar lottery yeah we've got to start up and the money that we're going to give people be looking at one point six billion\nHow about if we have a let's call it the lottery that everybody when that's right yes how about that is the right hand picked by the way somebody should be paying for these ideas you know we we told the Democrats back in ah\nIn twenty sixteen you ... you know just start offering more money right we set a hundred thousand right where he bunkers up the fifties he's up to fifty\nWhat that story coming up about the the the fifty ... because it wouldn't go to everybody but they're up to fifty though that's a point it's up to fifty now because it will continue to expand but that's what I'd run on ... ... if I'm a Democrat but we wish to have is a lottery for everybody where everybody wins well it's\nFunny because you know they focus on in this case young poor people um that includes most young people\nMost young people are poor because ... and here's the flaw as we pointed out yesterday too you start promising things and and people realize well ... you're not going to be able to afford that for everybody and and ... they will draw a line it will be for some\nSo in a rising economy and people start making a little more money they're thinking of themselves so wait a minute\nI might not get that that's going to go that free stuff's going to go to somebody else but not me\nSee that's the world we live in ... by the way that's the world but the Democrats sounds to create ages ago this is where we are forget about you I'm Out for me\nI'm Out from mine\nIt's all about me so my neighbors gonna get fifty grand I'm not going to get fifty grand\nMeanwhile Eric in Gary have to pay for\nWe have to pay for it and ... you're you're you're building a welfare wall and making us pay for it\nAnd if you're a first my listeners because

purple I'm reading from the story Republican affiliated voters about pace democratic affiliated voters in her early voting in southern closely watched states according to data provided by targets smart and independently analyzed\nBy NBC News data analytics lab\nGOP affiliated voters hubs surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona\nFlorida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and Texas\nKnow you you and I have closely watched the um\nThe Bob Montana or a Senate race where you have a Jon Tester going up against a Matt Rosendale mhm and when we you know we've noticed that you know the our CPA average on that the real clear politics average by the way it's a great website to go to for anybody out there if you've never gone to what to look at you know all the latest polls across the board\nA and but you and I looked at that and Jon Tester the Democrat you know you've you've seen consistently over the last month is up by three well the latest poll that was done there was\nWas September twenty second a dead end tester was up by four at that particular point in the margin of error was three point seven uh and you and I said you know how can you make a ... how can you look at that now are cp has it as a toss up\nRight they they they've got it as a as a toss up but when you see that you know because we've talked about what is what does the voter excitement level so you you when you see Montana in there that makes us look and wonder what would the latest poll say I'm the tester Rosendale race in Montana and\nSpend because there's a number of motivators but the ... the entire ah Kavanaugh's confirmation process\nAnd the hearings and then the ultimate confirmation a vote\nIs there anything in that particular race that was that was motivating for one side of the other\nAnd what what are the polls saying it's frustrating for me because I I actually asked you during the break or they did they just go on vacation when early voting started the pollsters\nThey don't no no but polls are still going even if well the problem is is a major races you haven't had some in recent days you had some up until I got to go back to the Ted Cruz a O'Rourke thing but it's at least two week oh\nWell that's why the Montana's ... over a month all well fit is selling I brought up about ... thirty two and some of the day all day right a Texas thirty two is now what twenty nine days old in terms of that poll\nWhich is something it's a house seat but it's it's one that's been held by Pete Sessions for a long time and Pete Sessions is up by one but that was a month ago\nSo I I have no idea I don't know why the pollsters are not more active especially in this particular uh uh uh election season as as I I thought I guess I thought\nThey would be for any first term of a president their first midterm is crucial\nAre so GOP affiliated voter sub surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee

six of\nNorth verdict uptown primarily a friend says upwards of seven thousand Central American migrants have resumed an arduous trek towards the U.S border\nAfter arriving in southern Mexico Monday many are still more than a thousand miles from the ... border crossing at McAllen, Texas meanwhile President Trump is threatening to cut off aid to countries such as Guatemala Honduras El Salvador responded Patrick often as with the group\nEvery day like a marathon for the Central American migrants as they can we go over reaching the U.S Mexico border they're reporting from one small town to another and it is\nNine percent of the NFL players some are not kneeling right and I still think it's what we thought\nThat it's going to be don't ask don't tell ... and the fact is neither side is that neither the players association of the NFL is moving on this because remember how long have they been meeting for you know remember we're going to me\nTo try to come to some resolution you've been meeting perform on yeah it's Naylor don't Neal I mean they still have the policy but there won't be fine there won't be any kind of penalty\nIt's don't ask don't it's don't ask don't tell what they're hoping what they're hoping is is that the players association because every it's tick tick tick tick tick\nAnd the contract negotiations dot what two and a half years away mhm well but the negotiations can be starting yeah they could be going on right now right right wow you know a lot of ...\nOkay hold on a second because we talked about you know how uh the the uh\nPlayers association\nCould be saying look we got to go ... coming up say it could have been hey guys were starting talks right now or at least getting into the early stages of these talks and this is affecting it\nRight we can we cannot have ... down TV ratings right or you know in another year and a half everybody has to be\nEverybody has to be on board do protest wherever you want right of course because all of a sudden these players are saying this could affect my next contract ... oh well then hey protests wherever you want a look we made a deal\nOr the NFL's giving to our particular causes so we won that but no like air a greeter Colin Kaepernick it doesn't matter what the deal is struck they just they they view the deal being struck\nAs a you know and and remember the air agreed to use the deal being struck to not Neal and to keep ... out of the\nYou know out of the players association that was going to decide where all that money goes to basically say no capital you're not a part of in a air agreed wants to continue kneeling there's the there's the group or the the there's the one or two\nAre out there that wish to continue kneeling no matter what\nAnd there's the other groups saying well we got our cash shut up [laughter] and yeah and so now there's a ... so the NFL the owners probably said look don't ask don't tell and it's a liberal it's liberal fighting liberals and it'll eventually blow up in their faces yeah I'm Glad that we and then we can move on\nYeah I mean I I think you're I think you're probably right on it's probably you know unofficially don't ask don't tell for me it's a don't watch don't care\n[laughter] [laughter] well maybe that's the thing if there is no reason to watch my team anyway because they're not colonizing\nWell yeah I mean you know my my team attempting to I I just saw the headline attempted to come back you know over the uh the Redskins this past weekend and then you know couldn't get it done\nBut I I I I think\nOf again the bigger picture of the fact that it's not just the protests driving the people what you you you've got two big things to overcome right\nYou got to bring back the people who left because of the protest but you got to bring people back who left because they they're watching other things because they're doing other things I mean that's where I think a lot of the erosion is you've got to create new excitement in the NFL\nNot just in the whole protest thing you've got to create new excitement in the broadcast presentation of the game\nAnd\nThey haven't even started on that I mean\nUh you know the used in a lot of the movement to digital and and we knew that comic there's got to be more of that in the in the in the coming years\nNo doubt but that's about reaching the audience where they are but you know you put a store where the traffic is right so do you put your game your presentation is going to be where the traffic is if it's on digital if a if it's on line and that's where you're\nGoing to find that audience but you've also got to change and I think that will help change the presentation of the game\nBut that's something nobody focusing on right now because they can't get through you know\nThis is even if it's just a handful players if it's making the news it's like you know come on guys it's time to get back to football\nBut you can't get there\nBecause these stories still make the news\nThat's you know it's it's like the left\nYou look at a uh a war and and oh Casio Cortez they don't represent the majority of the uh the the rank and file Democrat out there but they're leading the party\nIf they're making the news and they're driving motivation on the other side as a result of it\nIs a ... ... was a Tim Ryan\nYou know challenge Nancy Pelosi for your seat and and you know we got to get away from the identity politics and and everything else and who else said that a couple of others have said that\nUm but they can't\nBecause it's not making the noise I mean the the I guess being a more moderate Democrat if you could they would still be far left but getting away from you know the identity politics or whatever it is that's driving the far far left\nWell\nWhere where do you moderate where do you because that's not making the news that's not making the social media or that's not where the interest is by the mainstream\nMedia it's boring so\nIt's you know this this this this was all you know part of well and I'm In a really scrambled ... and\nWhat you see here is what you see happening in the ... in in the Democratic party where you have victims in the oppressors and ... and as we've said this that the identity politics you continue to cut the pie of victims becomes greater but then when the number of victims becomes greater than the number of oppressors\nA must you know must become a a greater\nOr you know we've seen it a ... look ... last week you saw the most of the cycling though the women's cycling a champion you know the the the mail one the biological mail one and the female came out and said the the two females that are are one of the females that came in\nLike third place she goes this is ridiculous this was a male right\nAnd he has gone crazy stating the bigotry and the intolerance and right and and and and and all that 'cause I Know you're a you know you're a man you're not a woman so that's the debate that goes on and so as we said\nThe feminist up today the ... the old time feminine which to protest is the new time that the new feminist do not want to protest is\nBut you destroy feminism as we said all along the feminists have now become the oppressors thinking about this did you ever think that the feminist would become the oppressors of liberals right now the feminist\nThe feminist movement this is how insane it is and what you have here is in the in the NFL you of Eric read\nYou know a ... you know Malcolm Jenkins was part of the group that agreed that okay ah the owners are going to give a hundred you know a hundred million dollars for the for the organizations that we wish to give money to\nTo help make racism less mhm okay fine All right we will we agree that we're not going to Neal anymore mhm well now\nHe is viewed by air agreed and Capra Nick as\nThe oppressor he is a Neal colonialist right he's a sellout right because the whole the the real thing is with the ... or a read\nThey don't want a deal no they want to be able to scream oppression so so the victims some of the victims now that we're perceived as the victims here in the NFL or those in the NFL standing up for who they perceive the victims war\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top ... because they have decided that they will negotiate to try to make things better\nAnd the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant and they want it's\nThis constant the debate out there they want to be able to cry racism day in and day out and the fact that it's never going to be solved because it can't be solved once it's solved or once you get to where most people believe society is today we're racism is not a factor like it was\nFifty years ago or sixty years ago or a hundred years ago or a hundred and fifty years ago\nThey have to win says that it's actually worse than it's ever ban or they lose their purpose or purpose has gone they can't say that things are getting better and so boom it's going to blow up\nAnd a significant portion of the NFL of blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said okay\nWe made the protests we've made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes we believe are good causes now they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors is what happens right what's happening with the Democrats everyday it's happening now in the NFL we've\nBeen saying for years here not unexpected no because it doesn't matter who you are the person standing with you nearly with you as the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow and that's what's happening\nA lot better wearing the white uniforms [noise] ah this this

interdiction\nCutting those programs indiscriminately um those benefit us as well former\nWhat part of my problem with the way it's not that the thing find we all ... and ... ranked obviously\nYes sir proper legal channeled my problem right now going forward I think a lot of time in town halls across the country and let me tell you even going back to that have there was this rumor on the Internet on an international\nSuperhighway and immigrants that we're going to come through America up through ah I'm from Canada and that was something literally my father had to say that's not happening it's not happening when you see these images maybe a conservative paper train and I guess and they turn elections because this is exactly what I think people\nI'm a last what had happened in the country I'm not saying I think refugees are not paying out a couple of legal immigration what what a lot of people on a lot to say no one on the table and they weren't open water and no consequences\nAll I Would I Do wish I wish that the then the people on the right what tell the truth about what's really happening and immigration because the largest number of undocumented yes I Am not telling you know the people in the right around here on the right but I'm not talking about your first and I have a friend of mine and I don't\nThink I Am more extreme on that issue then I think than I think people realize I come from a border faith and I think when you hear stories like that to happen and finally I was shot and killed by an immigrant who is in a a a a in San Francisco which is one of the sad thing for you can go there now\nThat I said at the same way and killed sanctuary if I let me just say that something you have a cat [noise]\nForty one percent of undocumented immigrants are from Asia from Asia a large majority of the link to undocumented immigrants from Sweden from Canada they aren't caravan and I we label on the right point that out of that always about brown and black [laughter]\nProblem is by the way I don't I don't want to make this clear it's the left that keeps focusing on the brown\nThe color of the skin or the fact that it would be Central American refugees and it's the left the dust it the right doesn't know\nKnow the right looks at it and the right to know either you're here legally or you're here\nIllegally that's how the majority of people look at it but they have to use it\nThey have to you that that's more Raj of an opinion comes from the left well the right doesn't want illegal immigrants in the Asians or your you don't care about the Asians you're only care about no I don't know any I've never met one conservative\nWhen it comes to a legal immigration that same will know let's let all the all the Asians in here illegally but not the people from Central America probably overheard that no\nMy biggest concern is Canadian\n[laughter]\nWell I mean it's it's not it but you only the only argument that they have is race so that's the only argument that they can use that can't defend it rank and McCain got into sanctuary cities you see how quiet they got mhm they got quite because they understand what the the one thing that I think even though the\nThat people in the media understand is that\nThose in power in the Democratic party actually do believe in open borders that's what they want and they want open they won't reject open borders ...\nAnd so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign when it should be whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I asked well what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive immigration reform to anybody out there\nWould be okay what we have to do is we get it would be to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants that are here in this country that have been here for a significant period of time right and you and I both often said\nShe if you make the offer just see what the response would be from the left if you said okay\nLet's give legal ... let's give ... permanent legal status but not citizens ship or voting rights to every illegal immigrant that has been in this country since\nYesterday yeah right\nAnd from now on anybody who comes into the country illegally\n\nA must be sent back ... that we will give you everybody who was in this country as of yesterday gets permanent legal status and what do you think the response from the Democrats would be\nWell there's they're not they can't accept that the reason they can't accept that as because\nNow they're at the point of wanting open borders\nIt is not about it because even they realized\nThat the argument doesn't change Twenty years from now assume that we did get politically on Capitol Hill an agreement for that\nAnd the and then\nStrong enforcement or the borders will Twenty years from now ten years from now five years from now we're still be people coming here illegally that will be here that will that will get here and stay here for five years ten years whatever it is and the argument doesn't change so they know\nWell forget about that we just want the open borders we just don't want to have the borders at all come in and stay as long as you want [noise] I\nI have a challenge to the Democratic party\nGet together with the coalition of Democrats and put forth a comprehensive immigration plan we always hear them say that ... but they never explain what it would be ... and they're still playing it\nI'd I'd forgot who just set a recently but I I I burst out laughing but we need is comprehensive immigration reform that would include why tell me what it would include and\nBe very severely obese but be specific and tell me or at least there by the state just the major stages of it that it would be effective the major effect of stages\nOf your reform plan what would they be\nI think that you probably could go to the Republicans and you could get a comprehensive immigration plan that you could go to specific\nA congressman and uh and and senators and state to them say what would what would you want in your comprehensive immigration plan and they couldn't tell you they just wouldn't say comprehensive immigration plan\nSo we asked a question to the left why can't you tell us what your comprehensive immigration plan would be is that a fair question right is that an outrageous question for someone\nFor for for the two idiots overnight to ask right of any politician in Washington DC you keep saying comprehensive immigration reform tell us specifically what it would be give us the specifics and they won't do well why not\n\nBecause the leadership of the Democrat Party wants open borders you prove us wrong\nProve us wrong come up with a comprehensive immigration plan show it to us and prove that we are wrong I Will be the first person to say okay I was wrong I Know I won't be wrong but [laughter] I'm wrong because there is your plan

I'm Sorry I forgot but yeah it's a right sorry I I Apologize Eric well because I because\nHere's the thing that you look at the average cost of a home over the next let's say we start this in twenty or let's say we get it done and a twenty Twenty one in March or twenty Twenty one\nCory Booker wins\nOr in in twenty twenty and she is inaugurated a and twenty Twenty one right so he starts his first term as president and they get this done in March and it takes effect that starts funding and twenty twenty two at Eighteen years\nYou're down to twenty forty what is the anticipated cost of the average new home in twenty forty it's gonna be a lot more than fifty K. C. you didn't go big enough Mr Booker\n\nBecause of its education will no no no no no no no no no your party is already offering you know the free college so they won't need it for that so what else retirement well we've already got Social Security\nSo and well they're not going to retire at Eighteen they won't be eligible you know they won't get that money until they're old for the retirement things not an appeal no it has to be to to buy a home not to put down on a home to buy a home he didn't go big enough\nAnd somewhere in there are some Democrats got to come across as we talked about earlier in the show and say\nWhat about brain oh right because\nThe college thing is it the Democrats are saying to him well no no no well first of all you know college fifty thousand it just depends on which college you go to fifty thousand isn't going to get you there if you're talking about a four year degree at some of those major colleges fifty thousand is not going to pay for that right\nIt's not going to pay for the whole home well that's because what I Do it you can go big enough you have a college has already paid for a member that's the other that that's that that's my point your your colleague Mr Booker already doing the whole free college right so she she got fifty thousand dollars close to fifty thousand is what forty six thousand next for the poorest of kids\nSo it will be up to forty six thousand when they're Eighteen\nRight kids from poor families well they're already get free college so they can't use it for that ah it's not gonna buy out\nSo now they could put it down on home and living home until they you know ah you know I guess the falls I mean but they're still going to have they're gonna have payments that's not helping me I'm going to have payments\nSo then the ten thousand dollars six to ten thousand dollars and guaranteed income won't be enough to pay for all no no no no you need you don't need another program in order to pay\nIt or not to say ten thousand dollars a month if not a week\n[laughter] and I said they're not going to see and it and plus I think by the time we get to that point we're not going to be able to enjoy that his talk shows I Know unfortunately will be dead well not by the time we get maybe not maybe not by the time you get on twenty twenty the far left then and\nTwenty twenty all by Cory Cory Booker is going to be a conservative because he didn't go big ... she's going to video or audio going to be in a car loan\nThe whole O'Neal [laughter] alright eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre prep inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time\nTo react to any problems that were identified during her next pre or post trip inspection check to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached and free of any excessive were\nThe train or a king pin must be lashed properly and the jobs of the fifth wheel also check to make sure your safety chains are attached properly\nTh truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our experts technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the service of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up\nA lot better wearing the uniform [laughter] because it wasn't an easy place to play on on you know as a visitor ...

review\nAnd he is there are currently and I'm Mary McNamara eight six six Ninety red eye of welcome and\nA good morning as we end of the mid term in the midterms over we're just we're just project you know what will happen for the the twenty twenty election and what's already happening with Cory Booker coming out now with his new opportunity\nA bonds which is the fact that the you know giving a uh every baby born in America a thousand dollars and then\nTo the pores two thousand dollars a year up to age Eighteen and then the poorest and the country would get up to fifty thousand dollars and then depending on your on your a level of your family level of of income anywhere between\nAh just that one thousand dollars you know initially there will be sixteen hundred dollars all the way up to fifty thousand dollars a that along with ... and her guaranteed income for people that would be at least a I think a six thousand dollars would be\nThe maximum aboard that level is to add along with Medicare for all which would which would be all of your medical bills paid for for every body for everything no deductible and also free college and so that's where the Democrats\nAre are are are going\nWithout question for twenty twenty and we're still a long way out because now one's going to have to leap frog over another to say no we're going to get more and we're going to get more and we're still two years out who knows what to look ... look like I didn't think we'd be this far I'd yeah I'd like to\nI Want to each one of these these winds will probably grew up in terms of the political promise behind them but they are\nOffering these planes you'd be viewed as a right wing conservative but yet seen much\nWell because I mean think about it um you do have to offer more and more as we go along right I mean that that has to be in terms of the political promise the the free stuff has to be you know more and more\nAre we broke it down earlier on the you know before on the nearly fifty K.\nA that's a that that the poorest of children by the time they're Eighteen would have in this account and the and the treasury well the problem with that is that you know you're talking about a political promise right you're talking about something that's going to happen in the future so by the time that it actually\nStarted began you know twenty twenty two if Corey\nOr to a ... was to become president right I'm not only with the you know the breakdown of you know they won't be enough but\nThe timeline will be wrong because well wait a minute I just I just my my child's already born my child's Thirteen as my child going to get something my child just started\nCollege and I just spent a lot of money raising my child be my child going to get C B pro rated right wow because you can talk about paying off the college loan right years later I mean even the Obamas had college loans when they went into the White House or do but if\nIf because that's something you
