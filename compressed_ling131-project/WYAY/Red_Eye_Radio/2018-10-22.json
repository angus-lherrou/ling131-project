this but what I Do condone is stocking up on items okay\nYou're here's what you need you need to write you so you know by some of the dry rice we're doomed it's gonna happen it's not going to be the zombie apocalypse it's going to be the stupid apocalypse that's how it's going to end people won't know how to do things [laughter]\nWe always say\nTheir their you know the weather guy or you know the on your local TV you know and make sure you wear a big\nJacket today but nobody says hey make sure you wear\nPants today they should say that every day or you know we we laugh at that and now we're getting into that time of the you know it it gave me for the kids leave the house today make sure you put on their winter jacket yeah most of us say stop it right just stop and ...\nAnd now we have to realize no those are valuable instructions for many people that exist today I don't know that when it gets cold you need to put a jacket\nWe gotta we gotta apologized to all of our friends who who work at these TV stations who are way ahead of the stupid curve and I do mean stupid curve because there was a stupid career look\nWe know our audience the critical thinkers we ... we ... but we're all gonna have to like I don't know build a Fort let's just call it Texas and we're going to have to guard against\nThis kind of stupidity but I don't know how you do that you know or who was it a Ron White you can't fix stupid but I I don't know how do you repair that\nI don't know how you doing that back that's not even funny anymore no no that's ... [laughter] that that I ... I Know that's an comment like if he if Ron White just you know had his own show on Fox News or something\nThat would be just as serious comment you know you can fix stupid 'cause you can't\nI don't know how we do that so what you need to do your stock up on you know Dr rice and and dried beans and the whole thing that you're going to need because the stupid apocalypse is on its way\nIt's it's not far off not far off we don't know if if we have a significant number of people forty eight percent who aren't sure we're chocolate milk comes from we're not going to need a purge\nNo no no no no no you know just sort of no see that's the thing that sort of just running around in circles that's just sort of fade away because yeah like they can't they can't survive it reminds me of the the old magnetic football thing again just turn it on the just all go in circles ...\nThat's ... I had no idea that when I got frustrated that a game as a kid come on kids you guys wrong\n[laughter] they're just wandering around in circles\nLittle felt football the one guy was hold on one remember they had the little kicker and you tried to get that it didn't seem like never it never wear it never got past the center [laughter]\nAnd that over and the kicker kicks up all the way to their own already had again and that and that's why we all instead of playing the the you know the electorate football we all took the penny and remember you put the penny underneath a finger and they took your\nThought on your finger on the afflicted yeah up in the air and the other one held the gold price right and you're like this is more satisfying that a lot of football right exactly I've no idea how we got to electric football from turning out when Elizabeth Warren in one when we come thousand twenty well what does all of the stupid people are running around like the little electric football players these days\nIt's what they look they're just running around in circles so getting back originally and I don't know why this is going to be most of the show [laughter] us her hair and the first segment yeah by the way I've a question another question we have a lot of questions from vacation is it a caravan or a mob\n[noise]\nI Will say this ... I think putting on our\n... and we're going to be like we always do we put on our our substance had which is looking at the issues and basing it on the substance in our\nPolitical had put it on my political had I thought that what came out of the the the campaign from the Republicans and Democrats I thought the best campaign slogan actually came from Trump that was jobs not mobs very a very easy to understand\nAnd very quickly on the the caravan here because we have lots of talk about today and uh it it's funny sometimes I just wonder how do people think and this is comes from from the uh\nPeople to support Trump but this was about Trump it's about to get to Trump but I'm thinking to myself and you are the same thought\nThink people was it was for him\nThis works for him we're moving towards election day\nAnd the closer the caravan comes to the U.S border is going to help Republicans and help Trump but I'll tell you that was gonna say it's a ... because this is because that's all I heard this is a conspiracy sources behind it and and they're doing this in order to win the election\nWell then try and spend more money to win the election in a more caravans command if they believe that that's an effective way to win an election because it's not\nIt's not it it the we sat at the end it was the time and everything going on in twenty sixteen but Trump own immigration illegal immigration if you want if he if he is to get back\nOn track to get funding for the wall this will be part of it\nIs five on you and I were talking about if there's a conspiracy yeah it would be the Trump behind on little high [laughter] than a billion\nDollars to make it happen because it's working for him right there is any conspiracy politically that would be called brilliant or affective in terms of a positive for one side of the other they would be him behind the conspiracy because\nThis works for the president and Republicans if you've got five ... this is what we saw a few years ago years back or when you had an influx not quite\nLike the care of him mob or whatever you want to call it\nUm but but pretty much the same effect right there are about to reach the border and you had people you had Democrats who had rank and file Democrats saying no no no no no no we're spending people on those ... spending money government money on people who aren't citizens\nAnd we're not spending enough and in the cities in in our town them on our kids\nAnd that's the way that went and uh that was before Trump was president ah if you think this is a conspiracy let them try it it does not work for the left\nComing up on the show first the one over one thousand\nAnd twenty four we will we will get to because still I was ... you and I both on vacation very rainy vacation whether I was in New York or whether I was here it didn't matter ... it just it rained it was a complete the ... wash out and in fact the most the the biggest thing that I accomplished was I got three room steam cleaned in my house\nAre brought up the steam cleaner and did a three rooms and have formed more to go\nOr so that was really what I did over ... ... you know\nVacation oh by the way very quickly happy sixty seven wedding anniversary to my parents as some Saturday and I will have the ... yeah ... anniversary\nA ... a but we'll we'll get to that coming up because I just when I saw that I went when I first saw that I said she\nIs she dumber what how dumb is she ... you know for doing that and she came out yesterday and said that she did it because\nThe world needs transparency and she was attempting to be transparent to a high a also coming up on the show Hillary is just like Mike Myers from Halloween she just won't go away or I should say Michael Meyers\nYeah Michael Meyers Michael Meyers is pretty funny right All right ... you know uh the uh the the jobs not mobs political slogan that came out while we were on vacation and the Democrats platform is what we thought it was going to be which is part of acts on Kavanaugh\nTo those Democrats upset about the ... or ... death where were you on Benghazi right\nWhere were you on ... because the criticism\nOf the administration luck none of us know everybody becomes an expert on these things oh here's what happened you have no clue what happened and maybe somebody in the CIA knows what happened maybe Trump knows what happens maybe somebody some of them in the\nHouse and and uh the house intelligence committee and and the Senate intelligence committee maybe they know none of us know what really happened over there but one thing we do know is the hypocrisy of the Democrats\nThat in essence said when we found out that Hillary Clinton in the state department lied about Americans being killed in a terrorist attack and lied to the American people about it what did the press have to say this was her best day yes\nBest weak government of Hillary right\nOr Peter says a cow's milk as a symbol of white supremacists ... car crashes rise in states with that have legalized recreational marijuana and the illegal immigrant caravan Elizabeth Warren and that the study that finds that a number of Americans think the chocolate milk comes from brown cops\nWill have to repeat that I think once in a ... yeah probably that's why we are doomed update plus your calls and comments we got a great show

yet so I'm their whole just we we had a comment on the Elizabeth Warren thing because we were on vacation or a ... last week but first off you've got cultural appropriation ... right now right sure I'll drill appropriation she's\nShe's a appropriating a culture and the thing I liked his when he even came up with a one sixty fourth while she could be one sixty fourth or it could be won over five hundred and twenty or one over one thousand two hundred and twenty four\nAnd it was like yeah but the one or even if it's the one over sixty four and I don't even know whether this is true or not but somebody pointed out they said when all the average American is one point eight percent Native Americans who doesn't even meet what the average American\nIs that that particular point so without question this is ... ... you know cultural appropriation right the the the second thing was\nYou want white privilege white privilege as a white person claiming that they can be whatever they wish to be whatever minority they wish to be that they can be whatever minority they wish to being the other thing was the median jumping on this is it as if this legitimize\n[laughter] yeah that would be like Rob no doubt that we did was yeah that that ... that was it ...\nBecause there was some here's what was I think great about the whole scenario I don't know that was planned on the part of the president I don't think it was it was just basic basically it was his rhetoric on his side right\nBut remember back in twenty sixteen we were saying okay when you're on a stage with Hillary and you're you're debating just throw the facts out or you know she lied about being ... she you know uh the she broke the law but it came to her email server all these things just throw the facts out and have them back check\nWell they ended up back checking Elizabeth and Elizabeth Warren's people basically doing that and then they come back as if it's legitimate right but then they remember they kept\nChanging it that well the ... was the Boston Globe yeah yeah we made us take care of and we made a mistake again\nIt just got to the point of being the most bizarre thing yeah right and I'm thinking to myself\nWow how bad are in seriously now you when I Need to reconsider ... we need to get out of this radio thing and get into political consulting oh yeah we're totally do that and just say you idiot ...\nYeah well I mean I Know that I think definitely going to work [laughter]\nLook if you're going to waste your money waste your money on us give us a million dollars and we can be a lot better political consultants for whoever you're using right because remember this means that Elizabeth Warren got together with all of her aides and they sat in a room and said okay here's our plan to counter Trump mhm yeah and everybody shook their heads going\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\nHa ha that's around go is that going with that you think there was one guy or gal in the room that said no no [laughter] they all they all there was an overriding vote at sorry we all voted you were deciding to go with it because [laughter]\nWe're just a tactic become a good idea and and but this is not this is the mainstream remember when you have the Kavanaugh hearings the first Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd it was the first day and remember that whole\nWeekend the Democrats on the committee had decided whether or not they were going to do a full on walk out or yes do the ... thing right and they thought that it struck disruptive thing I you know with Grassley a basically would be the tactic they would use that's what they went with\nAn ex like they had that meaning they met all weekend about it okay we can get up and walk out [laughter] which ultimately they did\nA during the a committee vote on on on Capitol you know that you had Kamala Harris going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protest after that they are they still voted yet and they still voted\nSo there wasn't affected really anything you know it it will show but but they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meeting\nWill just get up and walk out\nThis is this ... this is a mainstream Democrats today this this is not the protesters and we've talked about how the protesters ...\nLead the party they lead the party they lead the call for the\nParty but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's crazy\nAnd then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter quite right does this does this destroyed transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters\nBecause remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing than the left just starting to embrace ... remember\nYou're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons [noise] you know socialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior winds and regulations ... number one you were saying the DNA matters\nReserve unit royal drunk tires and dot com today\nDid you know that studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems

go through the Thirteen testing completed February to doesn't maintain a\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the records America's most red recognizes that [noise]\nNow every week and watch me and my co host Jessica Rose as we bring you the only weekly news show readjustment joined us brawl the breaking news affecting\nThe trucking industry along with are awesome regularly profile than trucker dot com is the one front not you're not going to want to have them busy travel down the highway so tune in every week and watch the trucker nice gentle by going to the record dot com\nYeah from the ATM reading dot com ... why why\nTo see\nA threat Florida debate I'm actually a princess the fiance are drunk or shrimp she has been given twenty four hour police protection that decision made by the assembled governor's office Sunday meanwhile Arab News reports ... she was never the enemy of the state responded Sam currently require\nDeterrence shave Pfizer pots writes a very powerful fed\nTribute to him in which he were importantly says he repeatedly declared his love for the kingdom and these people even though he disagreed with some of the practices of the current Saudi leadership\nI don't know of a mid term election where a political party that has been in power that wouldn't normally lose seats that has been so well prepared\nWith the not only the issues by their side but the motion by their side because\nThe emotion of the Republicans is extremely recent it's not the hatred of Trump that's simmered for the last two and a half years and that's been there for two and a half years this is stuff that is fresh\nIn people's minds I don't know what's going to happen in the election it looks like right now that they're going to uh keep hold of the Senate mhm or the house I just I just don't know and uh I don't think when you look back at Ninety four and Ninety four nobody really got a good read it that nobody saw that wave coming in the house\nNobody saw it coming right and and so I don't know about the house is it a ...\nRepublicans could hold onto it yeah uh I don't know how in the mid term like this you can determine\nOr a\nExtrapolate what the turnout is going to be all I can tell you is I understand that in a in a midterm election\nThe party not empower normally gain seats and the excitement level is normally with them not saying that there's an didn't excite voted voter excitement level and the Democrats I just see an unprecedented in\nA mid term at least in recent times where there has been so much motivation from the party in power which is the Republicans not to lose it I saw the interview that was that was done with\nA a a bait or work Robert Francis ... over the weekend to you you truly are a rock star and I looked at you and I said I heard that over the weekend and I thought well no and you and I hate that term to begin with for politicians and what is the main way we don't like to practice in political I dollar tree but since that has been made I looked through and I said\nLook look at what Trump is doing some still out there filling huge arenas two years later and he's doing stopped now bomb it into the same thing I don't think Obama could have done that two years later\n... well and and now it's not at the same excitement well because ... and we warned in fact and if you look at what happened in two thousand eight a than your for you that was there after that ah the inauguration and two thousand nine and then you saw what\nThe Tea Party the birth of the the modern day Tea Party or or the game I guess in terms of the the momentum of that Tea Party and ... and early about two thousand nine and ... and it kind of carried over\nBut ultimately the rock star thing was over and we warned between election day two thousand eight and a ... day two thousand nine for Obama we said okay for people that wanted the rock star keep in mind he's going to have to do things that are presidential\nAnd those things are not going to work for you by the way that\n[noise] so [noise] so and years ago [laughter] because [laughter] come ... leave off\nThe charts now ah to the fact that you know to the point that in fact or Beethoven does not need the former presidents of campaigning in Texas um but but\nThe that that didn't carry over the ...\nThe Trump momentum is built on a number of things and real things it's not rock stardom but if you want to talk about a political rockstar and that would be somebody in my opinion that that that performs gets things done on his agenda\nNot not that Obama didn't get things done on his agenda they got Obama carried through you know they have to lie about it but they got it through\nA this president got affective things done on the economy this president got in and created\nMore jobs is president got in and work with Republicans to bring taxes down and I don't think we've had this conversation we don't think he could have that anyone else could have done that Republicans are alone could have gotten it down on the corporate rate to Twenty one percent\nBut you look at those accomplishments that's where the following that's where the ... it's that's where it's built and then as you mentioned the cabin offering something new to and wanted to do\nIt woke up conservatives it woke up the\nMaybe some of the rhinos who had a band in too many conservative principles\nAnd had them read look I guess we examine the threat to democracy the constitution and everything our entire system and process\nIn place during that Kavanaugh debacle that whole thing so that threat became real this is not some kind of rock stardom\nOh we think looks great or we think he's cool or we like the way he tweets\nIt's based on real things there's a big difference\nBetween skateboarding Rwanda burger parking lot and getting the corporate tax\nRate down to Twenty one percent\nWhile you know ... you and I were talking about this said that if there is a ... if they're ... and we had mentioned you know a bit of work here in uh in in Texas that that is viewed as the rock\nStar ... well a Bud Kennedy of the star telegram and waited out the other day and I just read the article that he wrote based on the tweet yeah he was a place called the originally theater molds like three to five hundred people that's it couldn't fill it couldn't fill\nUp\nThat that it was three quarters according to Bud Kennedy was three ... you know three quarters full and did an article is ... burn out already here so when you talk about it ever existed I ordered the hype ever really right did did it ever really exist or was it hype just what was it was it hype and the rank and file or high death in the media right right right\nIs you know is it is the point so if you look at the excitement factor a and again I don't look at crowds just going to visit a candidate a you know she a candidate\nAs the the be all end all as as to whether people will go out and vote or not all I Know is this that on the issues right now on the economy it's a plus for the Republicans\nOn on\nExposing what the Democrats really really want and and what they really believe when it comes to this country\nThat do they even believe in the constitutions that they believe in free speech that they believe in Second Amendment do they believe in due process under the law and we're finding out no they don't actually don't believe in the tenets of this country right right and those are pretty simple things to understand\nMaybe the separation of powers you don't understand maybe exactly what the role of Supreme Court you don't understand but you do understand due process\nYeah you did and you do understand the second amendment\nAnd most people do understand free speech and maybe not everything that's in the first amendment\nBut they do understand the free speech everything that the Democrats now do not believe in and are bragging that they don't believe in in those particular things and then you have a caravan of illegal immigrants\nThat are promoting it and the media is giving them as much publicity as possible they are going to show up Trump's they're coming to the border to crash the border has the mid term elections\nAre just Fifteen days away\nAnd it would take them I read one thing that to go what is it the eight hundred miles right I've or if you would take them five hundred and forty seven hours which means okay so should they should be closing in on the border come election day mhm probably not something the Democrats want to be promoting as much as are promoting it right or the media is promoting as much as they are going to promote it\nBecause until I think Kavanaugh illegal immigration would still the number one issue of concern for Americans and as you said\nIf there's a conspiracy out there and our priest show meeting from it in order to get to build the wall right Trump is funded this whole thing because the fact that a lot of conspiracy theory that did because boom\nThey worked for him if there's if there's anything that that could get get it back on track in terms of the funding for for the wall that he wants\nThe motivation right now go ahead keep promoting the care of and right up to election day do it and let's see what happens let's see what happens on election day because\nEven if the Republicans took\nThe house what kind of solid victory is that I mean long lines ... I I mean Democrats took the house and you know by by just you know what ten Fifteen\nMargin right two or three margin yes ability so even if they did that what kind of long lasting ...\nIf if you think about the promise of what they've got to deliver\nWhat is it\nFree stuff well they'll the house had all the bond it while they were they would still have to be ... again you would you would you would still have to be the resistance how can you be the resistance and govern\nThere's ... there's no way you can't it's all about obstruction nothing else\nUnable to call local election officials

not a senator and and won't be but you're a rush [laughter]\nThat would have been a burn well\nThank you very much I mean you're not going to be a senator but you're a rock star\nOh my gosh we were just looking at the polls I'd I\nWe haven't seen one from last week a\nWhich is interesting in that in that Senate race between Ted Cruz and a Robert Francis O'Rourke in Texas but in those latest a couple of polls are Ted Cruz's about fifty and has a pretty good leader so\nReady to call it just yeah that was interesting because he said over the weekend [noise] apparently that is not going to run for the presidency and twenty twenty mhm yeah I was interesting about Wall Street journal wrote who I'd love to read from last week we are all Native American mhm a gal who were on the American style but that said\nThat they believed that killed any chance she has a running for the presidency ... because she would just be she will be over there\nOr Warren general ... she will be ... ever a marked for that so right when you hear the fact that people talking about by and I thought about this to some time over vacation\nBecause you know you're you know wow by two old he still says you won't ... probably if you look at the polling still Democrats won by more than anybody\nMhm mhm well then Hillary naturally would think well why not me again right and that thought from whatever aid talking about that she's you know hasn't ruled it out yet\nI mean that just send the social media severe\nUh yeah it just exploded and right now we're all thinking oh the dramatic comet please [laughter] yes please make that happen please happen again and it's just I just want while she just won't disappear and now you know her and bill\n... weeks you know ... you know before the midterms going out and yeah you know they want to get their ... and ... you know they're going to be out there and and sharing the Democrats on me while the Democrats are going\nWell I mean what did you have there just fresh out of the whole\nA cabinet thing right we're just a couple of weeks out of that and remember what you had you had some of the hash tag me too movement a leaders and celebrities coming out saying no we should've repeating we should have called bill out then\nOf course they only say that because she didn't win if she were president now they wouldn't say that Twenty years later than humans ... ... exactly Twenty years that we should get in a time machine and then go back and then remove him from office\nBut here's my question they go out on you know what they're what they're doing they're testing the waters right how much influence does she have well she can't go out with how bill\nSo what are you going to do and even if she did she can't go out without a million questions about bill from her own party not from Republicans we've been asking the questions for decades\nSo what do you do please jump\nIn the water's fine Hillary twenty twenty let's see a rematch good luck because here's the first thing well she's not going to be the only one\nRight\nSo now we know the DNC will be working to make sure that of course she's ushered in you know make it seem like Bernie is really catching fire but not really [laughter]\nLike we learn to twenty sixteen\nSo as she's in well don't count Bernie out well then Joe's thinking the same thing in the opposite you know well wait a minute if she's in well maybe I Am in so then you've got your Kamala Harris you've got are probably not Elizabeth Warren [noise]\nNow but you've got you're going to have a field that is going to be greater than it was what did they have three three and a half candidates going\nAgainst Trump no but if you in their primary or a [laughter] ... well build me a heck of a lot more I I I well I don't know I I I'm not gonna\nYou know you you have to and you said this earlier it's going to be\nEither who hates Trump more than a combination of who hates Trump more and we're going to give

Ninety right either go to Rick in Virginia Rick Hi you're on Radio Welcome to the show I wrecked by how you doing I'm\nI was just thinking this is not totally relevant to the topic but I was thinking that all things being the same except let's say that Brett Kavanaugh was a liberal a\nAnd he was appointed by a liberal or president um do you think that those in the media who are on the left and those in the media on the white and the\nThe liberal and conservative politicians would have taken the exact same position had everything been reversed except but everything else is to say just wondering what\nWill I I I I Know this that Republicans I mean you had you had people like us that criticized soda my your ... and and criticized Elena Kagan but it was on the specifics of how she would rule as a judge\nBut they got Republican votes they weren't demonized the way the cabinet was demonized\nRight it did I mean so how I Would say no it it would not be it would not be exactly the same based on the history of what happened to them they were criticized and they were severely criticized by\nConstruction is like us to believe that you should follow the rule of law we went back and looked at soda my your just sort of Meyer Yahoo who talked about uh the fact that uh oh sorry\nMuscles to really talk about the fact that we legislate from the band right right uh we had to lay in a cake and when she couldn't answer the question\nAbout a ... but she was asked by a senator or whether the government should be able to tell you what food you know you have to you have to buy and she didn't answer the question because it got down to what she believes the Supreme Court is actually you know a a a a buyout how you're supposed to rule as a judge\nBut no I I don't think it would have been people would have been a number one it wouldn't have happened you're not going to have a liberal\nJustice uh then again with Trump you never know but you're good at you could have early voting\nBut I guess in that point from the color if it was a a liberal president who appointed a liberal justice and there was an accused or like a you had a doctor for it but if you but then will fully reverse it be it being Dr Ford had a right leaning\nAffiliation as opposed to left leaning affiliations I'm no that wouldn't have\nThat it wouldn't have played out the same way because the media wouldn't have done the same thing that they did here I mean the behavior would be different yeah I mean it would be quite the opposite\nOr use you see it all you you see it already whether it's you know senator brown of Ohio mhm they're not pounding him per stating that the unfounded allegation against a ... him is a political hit job or not covering him not covering up the same way like\nWell no no no no no no I don't believe it would be the same no color\nAnd and I think we've seen is like you said we've seen that demonstrated I don't know how many times now\nAlong the way um\nI don't know that that I don't know that anybody would expect it to be the same any especially any critical thinkers that's watching the entire process play out and then you give them scenario would expect that to be the same but now if that was ... all of those items were reverse\nWhat you saw from Kavanaugh was the first there's nothing to cry or that\nYou know that's right that's right great point there's no there's no way to you know that was a precedent that was set by the left and by the way that's the new normal for them this is kind of behavior [noise]\n\n\nAs soon as ... radio on Westwood

Believe what Tim Ryan ran against Nancy Pelosi of Ohio set ... you've got to stop talking about identity politics and you've got to get in the real world\nYou got to talk about the real things and I saw this game yesterday somebody who's making an analysis of Trump they should look Trump's popularity still there because Trump's popularity is still with the average person right that he's you know he's with he's with the average person\nWho looks at the elite and they don't look at him as as part of the ... you know the elite in Washington\nBut they look at the elite they look at the I'm a ... of ...\nWhat do they call it the um oh\nWhat we found out what we now call when we called deep state\n... the establishment what do they call it the swamp this one has a lot of yeah when when we when we look at the the the great and they view that the Trump that Trump ... and his opinions are the the opinions of the average man there is a relation of the average person\nTo Donald Trump right part of it was well he's also anti elite intellectual\nAnd I've thought about that I go well I'm not anti intellectual I mean that's not what attracts me to Trump would would attract me to Trump is the part of his intellect where he actually has the right answers ... so yeah I I don't know who actually wrote that whether it came from somebody who is more\nA liberal to say you know anti intellectual or whether it is that mindset that exist with the populace that were against anybody that we use themselves as an intellectual because intellectuals are always wrong ... ah I'm not sure where that was but the fact is she relates to the average person out there and he speaks like the average person do mhm\nUh but the fact is he actually has intellect\nThat solves a heck of a lot of problems and a blood and this of the reality of things that we actually face\nOr in the world would still a willingness to negotiate you can look at North Korea again that's still on you know that's still a great unknown as to what's gonna happen there you can look at the Saudi or you know Saudi Arabia you can look at\nUm a a China and what's going on with the with China right now we think the president has said great successes we also think that he's made some some errors especially in dealing with Canada and Mexico for example in trade we don't believe that we ...\nI ... if you're a Trump supporter on trade when he was talking about when he ran for office and what he actually got were two totally different ballgames completely yeah and what he was talking about on the campaign compared to what he was what he actually got and promoted the good at what he got was completely different\nThan when he was running for his campaign and as we've said if his most loyal if the always Trump voters want to support it and go with that we're fine with that because all we care about is the actual substance what did you actually get and does it promote more free trade to promote\nA more more good things but the ultimate thing that he promoted was actually a negative it raises the cost of cars in the United states Canada and Mexico and that's a bad thing mhm and now\nI think the average person who understands economics who was caught up in the political I dollar tree will admit that's a bad part of the deal the always Trump or just ignore it ignored as if it doesn't exist were not just going to go there\nHe got the deal he said he was going to redo NAFTA he did after what was in NAFTA I don't care don't want to know and that's fine that's part of a demographic that's going to vote for every president that exists sure but that's not the only demographic that voted for Trump we broke it down to eight different demographics\nAbout six months after the election and there's a ton of people that in that age demographics is more now more United and you can even add an nine than there which are the never Trump ers which have now come aboard mhm so Trump\nFor all of the good and the bad has United with the help of Kavanaugh and the help of the Democrats and then speaking bluntly about what they want this country to become\nA have United around Trump and they do look at Trump he is that I think your head that isn't\nThem right and and I think\nYou look at the end and you said this earlier if you want to look at the ... the the real rock star look at the terms in terms of performance in terms of getting things about Trump over ... come on and I'm close because\nThe one thing that that is going to always resonate with American people is a good economy\nIt's going to be a man I'm doing okay everybody in my family seems to be doing okay a job status doing OK and or getting better\nYou look at the unemployment numbers in and it's getting to where the liberal media can't argue any of those points anymore they can't break it down because you you just simply can't those numbers now they can be manipulated but in breaking them down in terms of the performance\nAs as long as we've used the same standard standard with the same standard of approach basically on those numbers\nYou cannot have a debate about\nThe unemployment or the GDP or anything else because the last president was judged by the same exact standards all of this basically wraps up into one thing\nWhat is it that the other side wants to do and is that a threat to this\nExisting ... you know economy right now in other words a you know I'm really I'm I Am doing a little bit better you know my job is doing better or making a little more whatever it might be I'm I'm checking home a little more taxes are lower [noise]\nNot only that but I remember you know we said this and I don't know if anybody's ever used the exact same words that we used and I think we used to probably uh I think this was early in the primaries and we continue to say it all the way through the election\nAnd we and and the media has completely missed this totally ... but it's not just that ... the analysis that I was telling you that I read yesterday the Trump is the average ... an average person the average person looks at them as the average person what does that entail the average person if you cause that to me doesn't describe\nThe the the substance at just that's labeling people I have an average person therefore he likes Trump's\nBecause Trump relates to the average person because they believe he's like the average person what does that mean\nAnd you and I actually use the L Word back way back in the in in the campaign I Believe that\nAnd and I believe this too\nBut I Believe\nThe Trump loves America mhm\nAnd I believe he loves Americans and he loves Americans first\nUm\nBut he loves Americans and I think the people that support him I think part of the political I dollar tree which is different than Obama's political I dollar tree right is it they look at him and they say here's a guy that truly loves America\nAnd he loves to me he cares about me yeah he's rude and yeah he's crude but when it gets down to with a law that comes from the anger that we believe that he shares with us that these other people don't love America\n... and we love America and how do we ... and now the luckily me it would get insulted we love America no you don't you don't believe in due process\nYeah both Cuomo America's never been great right but ... exactly mhm you you really you really don't you don't really believe in the first amendment you don't really believe in the second amendment you don't know believe in due process you don't believe in a presumption of innocence what you really love about America you and I had brought this up\nFor over ten years when we've gone through certain issues and said women if you don't care about this and you don't care about the constitution because what makes us Americans do we live in the same geographical place oh no\nIt's we share\nAn idea and what is that idea the ideas the constitution and the United state us and when you have a group of people are political party were\nChecked that this isn't Baba thought\n'cause that's what the Democrats were tried oh just a bunch of bubbles out there oh Trump loves America we love America or\nWhat I mean I Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you made a lot of the concept of what you as a group all think America should be\nBut you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have you and I talked about it when you talk about the fact now that they're talking about well the president needs to remember the president's see is no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go\nAnd it needs to go ... well what they don't understand that those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are is to protect the rights of the minority this to protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claimed that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I I've always got response though that's above the thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting mhm what we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution well yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest

whatever and You're welcome to the show Hi Dave\nOnly has a very good show thanks Glenn show tonight I'm just there's got to touch on something in the last caller mentioned about ... you know\nHe was trying to get you guys' opinion on it older than ... completely different ... in this narrow it Kevin on that show just came up to my attention okay and then let's say was completely different show\nWhat group of conservatives or Republicans would be like ... like ... ... ... ... ... like\nI didn't understand who who who on our side will be games all ... states orderly\nBut nobody knows who served as you're if you're talking\nAbout the behavior of the the uh the uh interrupt do so disruptive kind of and we're getting some interference on your culture will let you go um if you're talking about the disruptive type of behavior or the after the the committee vote\nOn Kavanaugh Kamala Harris and uh and others walking out that kind of behavior who on the right would do that I don't know of anybody that would do that\nThe point was that it would have been a different scenario based on the media treatment of\nA set individual had everything but that's really more about the media treat 'em and what we do and we did go back and and talked about the working down of the um\nUh you know what how they have acted or behaved a as a judge during the confirmation process for Sotomayor or for land a Kagan and what they might do in a in a certain scenario but that was based on their behavior as a judge\nYou still had Republicans vote for them you still had and that was their treatment of them was based on again how they would be have as a judge that was part of a what Lindsey Graham and say\nYou know he voted for Alina Kagan and sort of my ... and so ... what the behavior be\nYou know I'm a a a ... well a Lindsey Graham getting up and walking out likely not no because I think what you saw and Lindsey Graham and uh his uh emotional or the\nYou know statement that day\nDuring that hearing when Kavanaugh was there was based on the ... the behavior of those on the left and how they were treating this and essentially a shredding the process\nAnd and I think that's what that's what that was if it had\nYou know a liberal president and it was a a liberal justice or liberal judge a that'd been appointed and during this process there was a conservative leaning or a you know a woman that using him of doing something with the behavior be different by the media would have been treated the same\nLikely not no but it was kind of a you know with all due respect to well the answer I think we all know that any critical thinkers\nI don't expect they Lindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what come out with Harris did you know after the committee vote get up and storm out\nThat was ... you know but all\nWay way but then again you can't make the case that he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was on President what happened right mhm and you either like a Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then right but then but then he was he was you know confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe that was a\nDemocrat said it at the time ... yeah ah so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented nothing nothing we have ever seen\nA ... in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up is that that didn't happen with so tomorrow and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people who disagreed with that because we we believe\nThat sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the\nCell tower right the cell tower case of the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in their writings they used um\nIt out of it I mean he's talking about state issues which shows the ignorance you know what I mean the Democratic party place she\nYou know to the ignorance of the bail even teach ... down here anymore and in this age I'm sixty five years so I I was a Democrat like everybody was in Texas until probably the mid eighties\nUh we're always you know conservative or moderate rich but he's taking it helped pass show I mean it's you know just to back it\n[laughter] I don't know it just amazes me it's like I wasted thirty three years in the air [laughter] been treated and even you know that the constitution radio right it does get\nA ... yeah I understand yeah I understand there's always been the ad on yeah there's always been thank you for your service\nUh there there's always been the ... have been flows I mean if you\nIf you were walking around the Nineteen thirties as an adult in this country you would have seen\nOr you know the socialist mindset that really really really really existed at times or the anarchist movement that uh in in the first part of the twentieth century\nUh that that existed or in this country could get a just as wild at at times one of the things is the the fact is do do as many people still hold as radical views\nAs you see maybe a little more right now I don't know how many\nDemocrats rank and file actually hold the views of not believing in due process as the mainstream of the Democrat leadership now does write one of the brave I seem to see is there a big just right now now\nWe we know that on many of the issues the ... if you if you actually polled Democrats on all the major issues out there as to what they would want you would see as we saw back in and we noted back in a a twenty twelve especially when on the issues the majority of the public agreed with\nA Romney yeah ... yeah on the issues they aren't read with ... and if you take a ton of the issues that rank and file Democrats believe\nThey disagree with what the people they vote for a does and I think to a much greater extent than any Republican voting for a Republican president ... yeah yeah because you think about this if you think about the conservative never Trump spurs\nThe vast majority of the issues that they disagree with Trump on is his tone yes\nIs it similar to what they are a lot of the left criticizes him for his words in his town\nAnd it's not so much the job that he's done\nYou know they may pick apart you know whatever it is the tariff babies [laughter] by the way we're the original ... babies um but but but they may pick a part these things or this or that but ultimately if you got down and you were to ask the never Trump or is it conservative never Trump has\nA well okay the corporate tax rate Twenty one percent did you think that was going to happen or do you apply that do agree with that um the unemployment rate the GDP where we are right now uh do you think we're moving in uh\nThe direction and the president's done a good job on a number of items I don't know how you would do that even as a never trying and ... I\nI Believe the president should fight more when it comes to the debt he's taking little victories which I'm cutting the federal government this much but it's doing nothing to solve the budget problem that's right yeah he throws those he throws that out but\nThe fact is he knows he's not the legislative branch and yes he knows you know what ... ... this isn't this isn't the president alone\nThat has you know created this deficit spending\nThese other Republicans in Congress including a significant portion of conservative or formerly conservative [laughter] drink right although who wants to identify conservative Republican congressional members that are also wanting to spend my eight eight a ton of money\nWell well how did they get tax has done Roy Moore last yeah and they realized oh my gosh we got to get things done or because we may lose the Senate at some point we've got this slim you know victory here are slim margin now and it they didn't ... the Republicans in the Senate\nDidn't get it done until after that lost the president had been working toward that but again this answer tight if they're not going to do anything right\nI think the president should still work harder and still talk about more which he does not ... you probably and and I I'm thinking the probably the White House says look we can't win this ... because our own party\nDoesn't care any more about the debt well you know what ... what's really disappointing I guess the downside of the capital of the thing or what may have motivated a lot of people\nOr whether it's the never Trump or his or or the the moderate Republicans or who now are standing up for conservative principles again it could be too little too late not not in the Senate but in the house\nAnd the president and the Republicans if the just imagine that that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate\nThe motivation to get things left now work on getting things done right that's\nVery real but it can't happen if the house isn't there\nIf you lose the house it's going to be limited in what you can get done [noise]\n\n\nAs soon as ... radio on Westwood One listened to\nRead I radio show wherever

Turkish\nCulture that Saudi Arabia the crown prince himself\nMohammed bin Salman in states that he had left that location safe and sound and then he simply dissipated as far as the Saudis would concern now we have the Saudi foreign minister saying not only that he was ... but that he died at the hands of Saudis and that this was a mistake\nSo\nTone is set that we don't need I mean let's face it at least one or the secretary of state was thought it was okay allowed an above board to have her own email server outside the security server\nAnd we all know why that reason ... the the reason the real reason was\nThat it was to avoid the freedom of Information Act and she thought that that was well wasn't lawful but she was trying to tell people what was allowed and above board\nLook when you have that pattern of behavior expect that the rank and file in all these departments is going to act accordingly whether they get a directive to or not right\nYou know we we wonder about our top secret so I read this oh man when I was on vacation I Can't remember who wrote it but it just popped into my head now as you were talking about it that talked about Hillary Clinton you know while she removed herself\n... uh you know from having top secret clearance you know she she removed herself and the point was made well she should have been removed a long time ago right\nIf if putting a server in your house if being so ... is a with\nAt the minimum ... and then the maximum absolutely premeditated or a mindset\nOf breaking espionage law them by allowing the top secrets of the country to go through your private server\nWhich now we're told foreign enemies were able to access if that doesn't get you to lose your security clearance what in the hell well right\nThere are no top secret if somebody can be so careless\nAnd not lose their top secret clearance because as written mean if yeah and and I read that I said oh you know that's the point that came out of this\nIs not well she voted to really do to your wasn't but it was taken away from her that still pointed should have been taken away from our right\nWhere's the oversight\n\nBut from the judge or I Want to read part of the transcripts\nOr from a U.S district court judge Royce Lamberth the transparency group judicial watch initially sue the department of or the state department and twenty fourteen seeking information about the response to the Benghazi attack\nAfter the government did not respond to a freedom of Information Act request other parallel lawsuits by judicial watch are probing issues like Clinton's server whose existence was revealed during the the course of the litigation\nThe state department head of a mid ... uh moved to dismiss judicial watch his first lawsuit on the motion for some re judgments sane and an affidavit that it it conducted a search of all potentially relevant emails in the possession and provided them the APA David noted that some more documents and emails could be forthcoming\nBut Lambert denied the request to dismiss the lawsuit at the time and on friday he said he was happy he did charging the state department officials had intentionally misled him because other key documents including those on Clinton's email server\nAnd in fact not Ben produced it was clear to me\nThat at the time that I wrote initially that false statements were made to me by career State Department officials\nAnd it became more clear it through discovery that the information that I was provided was clearly falls regarding the added the adequate see of the search and this is what we now know turned out to be the secretaries email system Lambert said on friday he continued\nI don't know the details of what kind of IGA inquiry a there was into why these career officials at the state department would have filed false affidavits with me by the way that's perjury\nYes you do that yes you're telling the court something when you know what to do something else\nI don't know the details of why the Justice Department lawyers did not know false affidavits were being filed with me\nBut I was very relieved that I did not accept them and that I allowed limited discovery into what had happened during a tense exchange with Justice Department lawyer Robert Prince Lambert press issue accusing prince abusing double speak and playing the same word games but Clinton play into\n\nThat was not true that's a quote the judge said referring to the state department's assurances in sworn declarations but at a searched all relevant documents quote it was a lie\nAnd I thought about this the culture 'cause we talked about the culture of the Obama administration the culture that existed in the IRS\nWhereas we know they purposely we're trying to hold up\nThe uh the uh tax or documents what do you call it again the tax um of all I got my bike here are the um\nWhen I return ... no no no the ... though they were trying to hold up these groups that wanted to get a tax exempt taxes yet right ... status as they held them up by the way ... you you want to know why I'm against the income tax I'm against the income tax for that reason right there\nI'm against the income tax because the government should never have to review any group as to their intentions as the federal government was able to do that's why I Believe there should be a sales tax\nMhm that's why I'm against an income tax write because the government has used the income tax to get involved\nAnd to censor people and to do things that they have no business being involved in your life right\nNow and then by the way you're touching on something I referred to earlier you know that that whole process of and well it was a couple of rogue agents remember that yeah it was a couple of rogue agents yeah no it wasn't no it wasn't\nAnd we're not saying it it was a direct order from the White House down what we're saying was there was a tone a clear tone that was set we know we know to be the behavior the pattern of behavior during that administration on many levels the question is\nHow far did that go and was the tone and the department of justice or at the state department just that look will do anything we want to we don't we don't have to tell the truth even to the courts well\nAnd and when I when I look at when we look at the situation with the IRS which you look at all the rest this seems the Irish might be minor [laughter] compared to ... compared to everything else when you when you when you look at for example here at the department of of\nOf a state where the judge is saying you lied to me yes you absolutely lied to meet you committed perjury\nYou let an affidavit says his accusation right or you know it to a ... to them you look at what went on so that we're looking at the FBI and the department of justice you're looking at after\nWhen the Pfizer application was declassified and the other documents declassified but the president didn't release it but sent it to the inspector general\nOf the department of justice who looks at what\nLooks at corruption\nYou look at how they were so willing the state department to lie on Benghazi yeah and and this is why the whole thing\nAh with the um\nOh I just I got my ... like you're in but on the air for a while [laughter] we have it on vacation I Do I [laughter]\nI was just showed it mhm with the ... the debt murder of of ah a\nSister a jump off a cause show ... over in Turkey or wherever it happened where we've sold on all the information because nobody has been able to independently verify what turkey has said I'm sure somebody in the CIA may know but the average person doesn't know and this is why the Democrats have no business on talking anything about this administration\nAnd how they handle it so far especially when there's a lack of clarity as to what actually happened in this particular case mhm should it be investigated absolutely should there be repercussions if what we believe might have happened to happen\n... absolutely there should have been but the Democrats have no business to talk after all the Democrats and the media backed up Hillary Clinton's line about a terrorist attack that got Americans killed and they lied about it yes\nShe knew about it and I believe the White House and President Obama knew that they were lying about it why\nFollowing a weekend campaign rally in Nevada

McNamara\nThanks so much for being here this morning or early voting starts up for us here today in Texas I don't know when it starts across the nation brother or a state but just Fifteen days away from election day in so much to talk about us we've been doing throughout the morning back you we go let's talk to Mike in Washington state Mike Hi you're on the radio Hi my\nThank you this whole meal or the thing is just like it's just so frustrating for the voters because it drags on and on these coming up with nothing it's false accusations and it's I think we're going to win the house because of it because people are sick and tired of it ...\nIt's interesting because there there was a report that was out last week my dad said a ... mall or a ... to issue his the core of his report after the midterm and I'm Wondering why after the midterm\nAnd and what's going on why is the media\nThey just a band in this story and I mean they've banned in this story completely there's really nothing going on like what you saw up until a I don't know what a couple of months ago maybe\nAnd then we're going to win the house I well I I don't know that we will but it's interesting Mike\nThere what I don't believe was is this ah like the FiveThirtyEight thing saying uh you know they an eighty five percent chance that the Democrats will take the house\nBecause you have to get into all the different polls and all these districts and I mean there's a ton of but then we can break it down much easier into those thirty one talks of seats right that that right now according to our sleepy there are thirty one tossup seats there are things like ah Texas thirty two\nUh Pete Sessions and his Democratic challenger is someone who was in the last poll which was twenty eight days ago\nToday a was within a point now we know because\nLive here in in this area we know that that district is a north of Dallas County uh and so there has been a ... a demographic shift that's been going on\nThe shift has been happening really over the last uh probably\nA three to five years but really over the last few years especially because so much growth in this area brings individuals and for jobs right so there's a the the demographics change so that could be an accurate ... we don't know my question is why aren't we seeing those big posters in these\nA toss up districts and why aren't we seeing these new polls come out especially a couple of weeks out because if you're looking at the house you would think that there was some interest there by the media in order to hire these pollsters these major pollsters\nAre to do a more in depth polls we maybe we'll see some starting this morning and into next week a and over the next couple of weeks as election day is one week from tomorrow but my question is\nReally not if five thirty eight or any of them are wrong or because um who was it\nThat uh had the basically the the it was like a fifty fifty on the house was that NPR a couple of weeks ago the Saturdays ago yeah\nYeah so and and it came out to eat yesterday that in what is it likely a vote or ... or the Republicans are moving closer right okay that that came out just yesterday I think I have right here somewhere yeah\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and

slapped with\n... she literally did that for a solid Fifteen Twenty years ... career\nBut because she is well then we must share her roar and you can see that the radical feminists are out in force

worst thing you can call lesbian but in the ... era it's time to reclaim it\nOkay what do you mean tore through shy while she will tell you in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearing a dyke friend in her twenties posted that real talk she doesn't like men I hit the like button super fast feeling secretive and sort of guilty about it\nShe'd come through the same radical we're in France circles I came up and and then that click I felt relieved to acknowledge an obvious truth most men free within like something less than human whether accidentally on purpose and that means it's hard to like them\nMen are bad men are evil\nPolitical argument I can see that you're you're aiming for a political victory here by immediately alienating half the population\nHad recently been scanning the men

you're like I Wonder who cares rape someone okay so I I stand corrected tenure so she does this every day in any case\nThis woman says if you're right this what about him where does he fall on the ... scale it was an old impulse that had returned enforced as a nation debating just how many of their husbands brothers and sons were perpetrators given that one in three American women experience sexual violence in their lifetimes\nOkay again that is a very very big definition of sexual violence you have your suggestion that one and three women in America is raped over the course of her life and it's just not ... that is not at first it is and it's just a false statistic\nJust Republicans insisted that men were the ones who should be afraid when women were counted the everyday heroin ways we rule re route are live to avoid it solves my woke male co workers made me to joke as if the whole thing or a funny spectacle it was enough to make me want to stop talking to men entirely\nI have a feeling that the feeling was mutual yet still inside my head and not and then course roared what about the dad to who liked to all my angry tweet\nThe guy who showed up at the hospital too much food when my spouse labor or my friends who are transmission that's where it gets really confusing when you actually I'm a woman who says she's a man I supposed to hate her for being a man or it's supposed to like her for being a woman does when things get really baffling for folks on what\nPatriarchy runs so deep that I defend hypothetical men's feelings right away even to myself I'm a married lesbian as far away from needing male approval as a woman can get and I still feel it the slow while he's in a strip of cultural conditioning and tells me to prioritize men\nActually that cultural conditioning says you might want to treat human beings like you know individual human being because they're human beings just my imagination that thing that could break us out of American fascism\nYour imagination is not going to break anybody out of anything\nI mean it's a break you ought to be asylum lady just trapped in an old feminist loop because I've been friends with the worst thing I can be as a man hating dike but it's time to confront the late and homophobia and that and so\nIt's not late and homophobia natural just home for the ... and it's like late and about that and so then our fear that anger makes us seemed to gay because anger not fear is precisely the emotion that need these days\nThe where the person who said that anger is the proper response to your life the people who say that anger at the proper response to\nThe generalized situation in your life that\nPerson is not getting the device ... has a great praised his anger is the devils cocaine I think that it's basically correct and that if you are looking at your life and you don't have a specific instance of injustice to point to you'd have a generalized outrage about the world you're going to fail in life a great way to fail and life is to\nThink yourself into a generalized feeling that you will never be able to succeed especially in a free country it's one thing to say that in a dictatorship but this is a free country and world history\nI mean this lady is writing a piece about how much she hates men in the pages of the national newspaper basically\nAnd probably being champion for it by a bunch of folks on the left\nThe radical feminist movement is in full swing and this is why Hillary Clinton could still come back because it would be easy for Hillary to say\nThe real reason I lost was radical sexism and then try and drive out single women to the polls in high numbers\nTo take ... against Donald Trump when I get more interested in just one second but first let's talk about your bathroom habits how are you getting ready to go out tonight a shower and wash the workday away are you selling your hair brushing your teeth are you a human being\nI'm asking because as a proud member of dollar shave club I Am here to tell you no matter what you do to get ready dollar shave going to have everything you need to look deal and smell your bat\nTaking your lunch all day it's really gross which is why you

product\nAfter your ... partnership regular price get yours today a dollar shave club dot com slash then that dollar shave dot com slash then\nThe the anger that has broken out on the radical feminists left is good for Hillary Clinton obviously it's also good for folks like Kamala Harris\nOn the answer sexuality scale radical feminists are trying to push women up that hill right now\nThere's a philosophy that I talk about a lot on the show on the left that says that we can prioritize people's viewpoints based on their genetic based on their ancestry based on their ethnicity based on their class is so basically here's how this hierarchy goes of abuse that we should respect it goes it goes like the old you each person\nBlack person Hispanic person woman Asian person Jewish person\nWhite person that's how it goes that the hierarchy\nAnd women are similar in the middle as I mentioned right there ... kinda behind Hispanic but I had an Asian and unless we're women are\nSo well radical feminist are trying to do is elevate women in the hierarchy of victimhood higher up the ladder and that way folks like Hillary Clinton have a better shot at being elected by claiming victimhood this is why it because women are tighten up on the intersection ... scale they saw Elizabeth Warren trying to claim Native American ancestry\nBecause you're saying it's not enough for me to be a woman and Democratic primary I also have to claim membership in a historically victimized group and also a Native American\nThat of course all the proper ... so if you can't if you can't beat the intersection out of course he joined the intersection LA course radical feminist are trying to elevate women as victims in American society\nAnd do this this woman as late as crazy as she sounds just tore through straight who says that she wants to be a ... that you basically wants to be part of the she woman man hitters club\nLike within the reverse of the of the gang from uh from alfalfa you know she when she says this is not actually that far out of the realm of the mainstream in certain democratic circles I Love this here's another example Carolyn ... an advice columnist over at the Washington Post\nAnd there's a letter here's a letter deer Carolyn I have a daughter and some other moms and daughters and I started getting together and local playground and a set time each week\nRecently a mom of a boy brought her son to the playground at the same time we were there I asked her nicely I bought it she would mind leaving because we wanted to be a girls only time she refused and seemed angry at me if she comes back is there a better way I can approach to approach her this has been such a sweet time for moms and daughters and having a boy there is naturally going to change things\nWe live in a world where boys get everything in girls are left with problems\nAnd I would think this mom would realize that but she seems to think our son is entitled to crash the girls only time I Know can't legally keep her from a public park but can I appealed to her better nature\nAnd then the response was showing off the mom and her boy was terrible\nBut I have to admit that I actually have a little bit of sympathy for the ... not in the sense that you should shut the boys but boys do change the dynamic when girls are playing I based on I have a daughter they play very very differently when boys go to a girls only go to the changes that I doubt it\nBoys are different than girls radical something just want to have it both ways boys and girls are exactly the same\nBut girls are different from boys and therefore should be separated off from boys when they want to be separated from boy\nI think that we should recognize ... boys and girls are different also we live in a free country and because we live in a free country people should be able to rise and fall on their own merit without claiming victimization at the hands of the free society in world history okay so it's Hillary Clinton to run again I highly doubt it I don't think she's going to but maybe she loves them okay coming up President Trump did a rally in Missoula and\nThe nice thing about President Trump's rallies they are highly entertaining the bad news about President Trump's rallies sometimes he says things you should not say well last night's rally ... some of them have all of the audience and this is a ... year old [laughter]\n\nI mean this is Dr ... author of the Phillies cancer step outside the bar\nI Want you to do some very important information in Nineteen eighty

filter\nThat made these authentic and also mean that that sometimes you test that he should not say I've given enough we up to this clip here is the president just fresh off his messaging about how the Democrats are engaged in politics in violent rhetoric\nTalking about how it's a good thing that Republican congressman body slammed reporter\nYeah this is real mhm\nWe enjoy as very early\nBut I urge that body slams a reporter [noise] and I said oh this is like the day of the election or just before and I said oh this is terrible you said it was the elections and I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well I think it might help them [noise]\nYou know\nA great guy cookies\nHere's why that bad do you make the argument [laughter] ... it's weird me that I have to lay in bed when the president of the United states has it's good for people's bodies lay reporters\nLike but I guess that's where we are right now I Know most of the body slammed anybody in public or private it turned out like violent not good and civilized society bad bad\nHonest to God I punish my two and a half year old for pushing his that's where\nI Would not allow the congressman or picking up another human and by you mean by that\nAnd when you say that we're like here it's it's almost two parts of stupidity what Trump said here the part one is I thought you know I thought it was bad when your body on the and then I thought well maybe it'll help ... first of all your net removing the moral component from eastern body slammed people and then second of all you are saying\nThat your own people the folks who support you are the kinds of people who are enthusiastic about the treatment of by violence of your political opponents\nIn the middle of the giant campaign and what you are tweeting cash jobs not mob why why ... why\nAnd then the president doubled down on it he challenged Joe Biden and he again makes reference does uniforms mistake not like just slipped out now he knows that the crowd cheering for it because the crowd cheered for the president has to double down on it very very important that the president makes clear absolutely clear there is no problem body slamming reporters areas again\nGo out [noise] sleepy Joe Biden sleepy Joe [noise]\n\nVery challenged me doing fine and that was fine I what I said you wouldn't last long it'd be down faster than Greg would take them to [noise] you'd be down so [noise]\nOkay so now the president is then yeah let's use if I took it was idiotic when Joe Biden challenge Trump to fight and now it sounds like you and it's like first of all I Will admit\nWhat I actually like to see a twenty twenty debate that his justice to cups between two eighty year old man you bet your ass I'd love it I Would love every second of it it would just get up there they have their walkers have the tennis balls on the bottom and they just club each other they would just be great\nI mean what is it and by the way probably be more articulate than an actual debate between Joe Biden and President Trump like they are actually more political content them just smacking each other with walkers than than actually talking politics but is it good that the president again references ... no it is not is not because this is a moral behavior and like\nI can lead for the for the millions time on this program I can like a lot of President Trump's policy I can log on like a lot of what President Trump does I can be inclined to support him in twenty twenty and I can also think ... this is stupid and also immoral these things can just do things can be true it once\nBecause this is reality and the world works that way now president from does benefit\nFrom the fact that the media are completely insane so instead of the media simply saying\nYes he's talking about my politics and Democrats being violent then he goes and he says stuff like this and it's really hypocritical and grows and you shouldn't say that sort of stuff\nInstead of them doing that the direction they go is you know what this is just like the Saudi Arabian government\nThat just took a guy in the Istanbul consulate killed him chopped up his body and then look we'll fight it when he says the ... the body slammed that's probably that's that type of attitude that led the Saudis to believe that they could murder a journalist\nI'm not making this up this is what members of media say now because the member of the media are insane and respond so let's say Trump says something that is one hundred percent stupid and then the members of the Democratic party and the media come back and say something that is for a hundred percent stupid folks on the right to go see from President Trump ordered them it's being Trump is really good at furthering them\nWell I don't think it's actual genius\nI always attribute to stupidity what I cannot attribute to malice\nAnd I think what we're watching here's President Trump just staying stuff and then the media being unable to hold themselves back and saying stupid things and respond to do I think that this is President Trump manipulating the media into being crazy no I think they are crazy and he drives them crazy and he's good at at poking them but\nThey have a unique capacity to pull his chest knocked out of the fire he'll say something\nAnd then the media overreaction is so insane that you go well I guess I Can't tell you
