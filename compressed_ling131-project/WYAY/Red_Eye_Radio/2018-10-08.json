I'm flabbergasted okay uh for ... I\nCame here in Nineteen Seventy two I think I started I started working with this particular person to whom we are referring syrup viciously right now are probably in the\nEighties early nineties I did not ... so you know like Thirty years ago ... thirty five years ago probably not at Ninety One to two thousand twenty twenty twenty seven twenty ... twenty five twenty twenty or twenty five years ago let's say\nAnd uh this particular person was a a fairly well known sports guy\nThe sports uh anchor sports reporter or he did he covered ball games he did sports anchoring stuff on the radio stations at least a couple or three in this area that did he did TV stuff to to to ... he was very well known as the guns is Twenty years ago if he hasn't been on the air and probably a good\nTen or Fifteen you know more than that more okay so is it probably hasn't been on the air since the nineties maybe it would that be safe to say something like that I I mean there may be out there for Twenty years but he was a big a fairly well known name a for years and years of this market as a sports guy\nWell lo and behold we go to a hit from somebody to check out Facebook could go on Facebook where you weren't weren't right foot friend yeah a friend that's a little so friendly there is no this is the oh my God what you believe that we all of a sudden there was an announcement that this particular person said\nSomething like I'm going to be a leaving my profile I'm going to be changing my profile be leaving my profile blank for a while then I'm coming up with a new profile and I'll be back later something like that\nThat now we get a picture\nIn Harlem his page right yeah in late August it came out ... so a couple of weeks ago I mean there's a middle of ... like three two or three weeks ago\nUh it started unfolding and now on this particular person's Facebook page is the announcement that he has changed his first name to a feminine name and he is now becoming a woman\nOr is or is a woman I\nDon't know what that means physically or is that just emotionally still are in the head or whether he's had surgery I don't know but I'm telling you you couldn't you couldn't knocked us down with a noodle when I saw that\nPicture of oh my God I wait a minute average one here [laughter] no [laughter] no the issue is uh yeah I I feel bad because I mean\nI really need to be taught him name who we are talking about just I just to be up above board about everything then obviously\nIt's not like pm moving dot com studios Y. A. Y.

Harry according to New York state police and Iran's a parked car and the restaurants parking lot all Eighteen people inside the limo including the driver were killed according to a deputy superintendent Chris Fiore souvenir history of standing nearby\nThat we want you know educate people educate people on on a you know not on the left ... impossible but in the great middle\nBecause it makes sense to them clearly independence understand the presumption of innocence clearly they understand due process under the law the polls have showed that\nDemocrats may they just wish to ignored because what they want now is more important than anything it is about their day to day politics\nAnd so I think it's just important just a little nit picking their and then I'll move on those goes do you remember him with anything no men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content but we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks\nWell it's a couple of things the um the the whole idea\nOf of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is is a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center you know the left a you know says there are since Saturday evening\nWhile we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will happen\nWe'll see about that um will look at early voter turnout as we always do\nBut really even with the right and I know I Know the motivation on the right is there we know that so that's not going to go away\nOr the motivation in the middle\nThat's the question that's where you win the elections and so you look at the undecideds\nAnd how many of the key races right now are undecided or have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that grew going one way or the other end thrown out\nIs is is the key so beyond that the win at the highest court\nRemains to be seen\nBecause we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice ... rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench is a victory and not the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey they\nJust started the process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president or how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so that when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we've been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart ... and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race and\nTalking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time\nFor for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart censor was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support a John Roberts uh Neil Gorsuch\nOr Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect\nOr if that's going to happen uh for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decides and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history\nI Would say that are most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I dunno ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree\nI'm a ... with him you know we we talk about a true construction as some and by the way when we talk about ... what was that the or\nWas it the location device\nWas at the location of ice on the cars are about ... what\nWas the case that everybody has a cell tower case wasn't ... there for everybody where everybody said well we're especially the never Trump first came out and said she said oh you did you see he started with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge mhm\nAnd then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court or and and the Gorsuch that actually used the Scalia ruling them\nOr you know Scalia was probably the true with the the most construction as judge\nOf of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court has a has a has has done\nClarence Thomas always is not always a construction it right Clarence Thomas will\nA judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that's up to the legislature to decide to meet is these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the constitution said does it say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda right so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably ... ah Scalia was almost\nNinety nine probably Ninety nine percent just doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a\nA you know you have a cabin on that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least the for me on on the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare right oh huge and and then\nYou look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't\nA a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you and I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party a\nI think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party\nThought they they were a\nAnd I will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump hers\nBut to see it in action and to see\nThem look to see the debate points that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of\nA a presumption of innocence this stereotyping that their convenience all women are to believe unless you're deals those type of\nWoman over there by the way to one of the stores that saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for Kavanaugh being put in women I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started blaming of Eddie and the case if he\nWell wait a minute thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case of too many holds well that's the whole point that the\n... so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case Frank you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is they're just trying to fit in an argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in\nThat will fulfill their liberal desires and the judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nYes\nTheir opinions don't ... their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left and them and not just the far left what you saw because we\nNormally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw over the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\n\nAnd we'll slander and defame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nI think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting\nHe was the burn in my ear ah because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent Bob for years

point out something that that I just you know I look at conservative media and I just say stop it\nAnd whether it was the you know in a drudge you we know he's conservative but you basically just you know lists things but he had the Taylor Swift story as the number one story half the day yesterday yeah and it's the number one story right now on Fox yeah All right\nNobody cares what she thinks no ... nobody cared opening your Taylor Swift things why do the editors at Fox News\nBelieve that she deserved the Taylor Swift comes out in support of tendency\nDemocrats who cares oh before she said she won't speak on ... not ... who cares nobody cares nobody cares what she thinks\nThere's so many things that we can be doing as a as as as a media that are important\nAnd I'm not saying you don't put the you don't have the story somewhere ...\nYou know 'cause you could you get your story but it's been the number one story now for a few hours sitting there\nOn as we go into a Monday with everything that's going on right right Taylor Swift as a story that they they put up there even though ... story and you know him supporting Donald Trump is a Side Story it's notable and the different because you have\nA mega hip hop star supporting Republican president who was aided by pretty much everybody else in his community and in in his profession so that's notable because\nIt's not what a what he was unique in that ... news just things that are unique and different right ... and ... and the thing is is that\nUltimately though the the endorsement\nDoesn't really do anything now sometimes you'll see a you know these mega endorsements come on come on board for an Obama but that wasn't what got Obama to the White House the endorsements don't do anything except show that those celebrities are getting on the bandwagon\nAre most often but you're not it doesn't matter who the celebrity is\nThat's not the influence with the with the people that's not the the real influence with real Americans they really don't care what celebrities have to say politically unless those celebrities are getting involved in politics and they're going to run for office that's that's the

I'm only a princess but National Transportation Safety Board is investigating what they are now saying it's the deadliest automobile accident and us since two thousand nine involved the limousine at a town about twenty miles west of Albany New York living twenty people dead discounts and bomb reports\nEighteen people who are inside the stretch SUV limousine including the drivers were killed when the limo failed to stop at an intersection in to Harry according to New York state police first deputy superintendent Chris Fiore limousine\nTraveled across the intersection into a parking lot is strictly two thousand Fifteen Toyota island there that was on occupied and ... to ... standing nearby were also struck and killed\nThat the left wishes to get rich rid of freedom of speech and wishes to use the power of the government to punish you and destroy your life\nTo do that\nWe know that I mean no that's not even debatable anymore when we talked about the first amendment we can look at freedom of religion and the bakery and artistic expression and all that that's going on right now and the left is again that individual rights\nOf I get to choose you know how I Wish to express of what I you know what I Believe\nSo we've often talked about the fact that the left does not and this is the mainstream of the law does not believe\nIn the first amendment they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion the second amendment it's obvious they don't believe in the second amendment they believe it's antiquated they don't believe in due process or under the law you and I've talked about this during\nAh during the uh uh uh during the whole uh uh uh\nIn ... when you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had the president giving their opinion on it when they didn't know what happened right and we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know\nYou've got to take each case individually if you're not then you don't believe in due process well we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have her was a political trial yes uh it wasn't a civil trial it was in day it wasn't a a a a criminal trial by\nMany aspects of a real trial were there you're under oath mhm and you can be you can go to jail it was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not be a criminal trial or civil trial but it was a trial\nWhere many of the enforcements of a trial a ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail for that mhm and they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption of innocence none of that matter to them\nThen we got to Trump putting the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore now this one when you have a ... and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nOr that are now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you've been listening to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of was the Senate\nWell if you don't want the Senate if you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is the legislative branch mhm and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment\nWhen you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe that the ... and the presumption of innocence\nYou really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about\nAnd we understand now on the show we believe that that\nThe majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though ... close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the hour by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords in the house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states\nThey wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most scared of was that a ... take care of their group a either a particular group of ... a a person a small group of people a particular kind of a legislature or\nCourt or presidents see they were scared to death that power could be concentrated in one of those areas and they ... they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at the history of the world\nAnd seen\nHow authoritarianism works and they didn't want it and the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and when you look at it the house of representatives or you have I think fifty three house members in California\nOnly one in Wyoming why bigger population in California fewer people in\nA ... in Wyoming both of two senators or that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population and by region but the Senate\nAnd on and and by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years so you're closer to the people more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the\nHouse of representatives would be closer to mob rule than a Senate [laughter] [laughter] and but so they they but they wanted it they wanted to the the\nCongress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country were you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state\nBecause if you had more population and a bigger state you had more representation\nIn the house but they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have some kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little things\nThat was the reason right the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are unconstitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why separation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights\nAnd that's why it was done and do things move slower yes\nBut founding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that then mob rule\nThe reason the electoral college exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can't have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate\nIn the executive branch ... it was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power cannot congregate in one area and as we said when it comes to the by camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house\nAnd then the Senate which is to per state which is six years so they could be more long term looking at the country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years\nAnd the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership\nOr represents I'm most\nRoom of I daresay that the vast majority of the left have no idea of I think most people I listen to our show do it and understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or cares to understand\nI don't think they care about it because what they want is again a and as they often engage in in fantasy they create and there might a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way and\nYou know it's interesting because you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you had people on the left you know then at at at that point start talking about uh we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment\nNow they're excuse the point did of course directly to this president but it was about the same idea basic idea\nOf the second amendment and\nOften too little too late for the left they called for something something changes well we didn't know it was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course change through your way with the Senate completely\nWe didn't know we were going to have to pay we've got someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well lessened weren't you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game on them all\nYou know the the the whole um a changing of the first amendment isn't just about protecting their free speech because of the things they want\nSay and doing away with yours and we talked about that though it is also doing away with the freedom of religion because your religion is bigger than\nIt it needs to go away completely because we disagree with the

I Know when the Republican base is motivate\n'em and they are quite motivated right now I I don't know\n... they're uh they're motivated and their unified when when I saw that what George W. Bush how many times and he called Collins and he called her numerous times during this whole process is George W. Bush ... to push for a Trump\nNominee mhm for for the Supreme Court this says you're not at everybody and I think one of the reasons that you not everybody is look we've dealt with Trump for the last two years the people in the Republican Party that just can't stand\nAnd all of a sudden the last three weeks I woke up and what hoops he is really not our enemy\nIs really not our political enemy there may be some things that we don't like we don't like his tone we don't like this we don't like it'd be exaggerates we don't like when he doesn't tell the truth at times but he's a lot better than these insane people on the other\nSide I Believe that that's what a lot of never Trump ... maybe not all but I think it's a ... well it's just that everybody except Bill Kristol\n[laughter] well [laughter] it's interesting [laughter] and that's not going to happen and possibly George with 'em but [laughter]\nBut the the the the the idea if you look at it and I I find it kind of a interesting that the George W. Bush the same president who said well signing campaign finance law I Know parts of this are unconstitutional but I'll let the courts work it out [noise] called Collins to make sure that the court gets it right\nUm but but [laughter] that that\nIdea is set by the way it right by the way great observation I miss\nYeah well I I just ah you know but but certainly anyone from the Bush family doing anything to support a a Trump nominee is is definitely notable but it also goes beyond what we do it well it goes right to what we will set and goes beyond the\nThe political aspect of this and removes it from the current White House because it is\nAbout the long term makeup of the court and George W. Bush of course recognizing that I'm certain um as many of us do and it is\nAlso recognizing a indirectly and while we haven't and I would love to hear from the former president on this or asking the question uh if if it is the case with him we pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth on the comments made\nA the end the communication errors and and things

anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion on the ideas and we believe\nThat our audience than the rest of

first first week on the Supreme Court the White House and many Democrats are looking to the mid term elections and beyond what custom teeny report\nLeading the administration's charge against Democrats in the wake of the Kavanaugh confirmations on Sunday programs adviser Kellyanne Conway she tells ABC's This week senators Cory Booker Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for starters felt compelled to attack happened on for their presidential ambitions\nPeople praying for the cameras already out there I was running for president and twenty twenty on the hill who and who are raising money for their presidential campaigns during a Senate confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court Booker\n\nYou know and and and it's it's just because you look at this look these we know that these protests\nAre organized drew a great deal it was happening during the Trump rallies in twenty sixteen we know that there was a great organization and money to a certain extent going behind a that was behind and driving a lot of these protests are we know or the left is very good at that\nBut that's that's why you can't find for a lot of them you really can't\nIt's hard to I identify with them and and for most Americans that is you know\nIn the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe\nPeople are quick to you know speak out and that if there is a pollster that cold weather it's kneeling in the NFL or any other as you know I Believe people should you know have the right to be heard but how many people actually do it are active\nIn protest most people are not the overwhelming majority or not and in fact if you didn't have a you know a Soros organization or any or the organization\nOr that I mean we can go back to Ferguson\nFerguson vein authorities\nThey they told they were equipped to tell you look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away and that was clearly organized so when it comes down to how many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven\nAnd motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization\nI'm well we're we're the Facebook crowd opposed recalled oh yeah yeah we'll answer the poll a Facebook there will click the liked by and we share it we might retweeted but the fact of the matter\nIs is what is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives and when we go back to the poll that you brought up earlier and we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to corroborate the claims from this additional background check on Capitol we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent it's not Ninety percent of sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that we stepped back from\nThe insanity under display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying people aren't going to react to it ah you know sorrow can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to\nAnd even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most in saying things if they believe what's going to get them political points well it just might\nIn your state of Hawaii or California\nBut if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think ... and and again this is a not a ... analysis of facts like this is just\nMy my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who have paid attention to this\nAnd even though they do sympathize and because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are more ... a more conservative was if you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation alone without cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation\nThen you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling raping our society right well that ticked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what what's the thing that you always believe the woman you don't believe anything but evidence\nAnd to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark\nIs ... ... most\nAmericans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that said we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or Trump pick somebody they don't want him but I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said\nNo you don't always believe the woman you have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always lead anybody gets the evidence that you make the judgment on and yeah these senators are accusing him of being a rapist without the evidence without the evidence and in fact they're accused of being a gang rape is\nWithout the evidence of of being there they say believe all women or men or women don't tell the truth\nBut it's a majority doesn't matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that ... Americans understand that they understand\nBasic fairness and when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democratic party the mainstream of the party that are arguably has more people supporting it mhm\nNot by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote\nOr when they see that they say I don't really wish to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of\nAnd and and when you find out that you know that the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford it was a Dianne Feinstein she burn victim Chinese the one that wouldn't keep the anonymity of the victim right it was the Democrat who leaked it\nIt was the Democrats right it was either find of Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman mhm\nRight was it was that or or her staff that said it had to be one of those do right\nAnd so when you look at it you all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief\nAnd the presumption of innocence the stereotyping the bigotry all women all need to be we believed a white man white men or ... white men can't and people look at that stage and it's just like stomp it well I think\nYou chew we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a this is recent history we don't have to go back and so the Democrats the sixties\nRecent history you have in it because again the same side that said we're going to stand up for

to work out for you if you attempt to do that and he said probably unconstitutional to try to impeach him for something that he did when he was not an office right\nYou know that he did as a teenager that is that the point you're going to try to bring you know bring up I mean there is no I mean they're going to try ... they're going to try to make the perjury claim right again where there is no

don't want to go but if the Democrats want to pick a Supreme Court justices win the presidency\nRight that's what you have to do and and that would be you know going forward a your best bet in fact if you're on the left and we you and I talked about this off the air last week look to play would be look okay Kevin all seated but\nWe can't let this happen again we can't have a third justice seeded by the current president I mean that would be the argument from the left or I guess the a proposition or concern issued to\nThe rank and file 'em but the left doesn't operate that way the failure of with all due respect that Mr Dershowitz in his appeal to the left\nI'm really is to\nIs to not recognize what the left is all about they don't care about the process they don't care about whether or not there's a case there or not they don't care about anything else just keeps screaming whining crying a you know foul and that's what they'll do\nNow that's what we want them to do because it's working

you know I I read all the polls and everything else but I don't know because to have something like this happens so close to the election yeah so I think that has United the Republican Party like I've never seen before and I don't look I don't know how if it's motivated the Democrats because\nIf twenty six team didn't motivate the Democrats mhm right and they hated trumpet that point mhm uh will the motivation be there now or is it more despair from the the the Democrats and well the Republicans\nWho have definitely been energized follow this will they be energized those additional

you got what all three cases well you're done yeah you're done in the corner to pop your opinion because it does it so yeah I did the ... case\nThe forward it did did remembers case heard it and then the ... case heard it even more yet but it all starts with the fact that the first case was not credible yes\nSo ... would have come out first that might have been the first one and an orange would have been viewed as not credible because she couldn't remember the majority of the incident from that night except that was one hundred percent Brett Kavanaugh well and and I think that's\nYou you look at that uh like the the and again it and the court of public opinion when when we're forming opinions but\nIt is often foreign through information that as a given to us by the media and and the people that represent anyone making the claims but if you look at the winds teen cases right mhm what did we we started everything started to be corroborated through through\nUh the well not just the number of people\nComing forward and others who said that they were aware of this kind of activity pretend ultimately his own from that essentially had to pay schedule find schedule based on this kind of behavior if he were to be caught and and so\nThere were things where again if if if Ford made the claims and couldn't get anything to substantiate those claims that were nothing there and then Ramirez came forward and their war and then a third accuser came forward and she had things to back up her claim\nThat case would have been hard for the president or Kavanaugh to deny those cases collectively as one big situation that Kavanaugh would have been face\nBut that didn't happen\n... ... were we and the only ones that the only reason the Ford came out as because it was late yes\n... and so that it would not it was an all likelihood would have never come out if it had gone through the proper a judiciary a of way if ... if I Would have taken it immediately and taking it to ... then they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been anonymous said what and what the\nWhat you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford story changed\nYou know and and they talk about how the remarry story change how the sweat story changed but look at how the Ford story changed but but their point was on the political picture of being believable the scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he said\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart what they what they were trying to point out here was\nShe could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give them a Dr Ford were to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least played or spend with out the evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes\nBut because of the behavior and they mentioned Collins making the or the you know talking about having that these role in her speech\nBut it that happened all of that happened because of what\nBecause of the left and made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nTo you and you think about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was your major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim if it's a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it\nMust be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point right I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they are the ones that plane you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even that you know they're they're yeah they're just you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't\nTrue yeah well so is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices huh yeah that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance en route and relevant to it I mean they ... they were right by the way uh in in in November of twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way\nYou when when you look at well I have an empty a stormy Daniels' case that and no one absolutely no one is shocked\nThat a playboy billionaire had an affair no and again not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it\nBut the let creates these narratives they give out in the the the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt if it's against Trump Trump so it would have to come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there is that like I said the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point what is Joe Manchin have\nOn Schumer [laughter] I'm fine dining and what does he have a Democrat leadership nobody's calling\nFor a primary challenger to him in the next\nElection nobody has criticizing Joe Manchin from the left at All right he's a Democrat wire their screams that he should be kicked out of the party where is that right exactly\nHow come all the Republicans are taking the flack from the ... the left but the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh not saying that no\nNothing nothing like to go back to West Virginia just yeah I mean because because the reality of it I mean you know they they I I saw somebody

then and then I thought to myself well wait a minute how many of these liberals on social media would vote for Susan Collins had she voted no on Kavanaugh zero\nYou know it's this disingenuous well

McLean McClure McLean when she was trying out for a job with the federal government\nShe then said that that had never happened it also turns out the ... is probably the quote unquote beach friend that Christine Blasey Ford was talking about who urged her to approach Democrat so Monica ... does he democratic activist was involved in this thing basically from inception\nThe statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr Ford allies or working behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions of the alleged incidents as we're judge Kavanaugh judge cabin on the Supreme Court nomination will be debated in the Senate friday has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct\nOn Thursday adapt or sending to the White House report on his investigation into the allegations against judge Kavanaugh the FBI sent the White House and Senate and the digital package of information that included text messages from this Micheline to miss\nAccording to a person familiar with the matter is Micheline lawyer David ... said in a statement hold\nAny notion of claimed that ms McLean pressured wheeling Kaiser to alter ms Kaiser's account of what she recalls concerning the alleged incident between Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely fall\nIt's Kaiser's lawyer on September twenty third sending a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee she had no recollection of attending a party with judge Kavanaugh\nThat same day she told the Washington Post you believe Dr Ford on September twenty nine two days after Dr Ford and the judge testified before the Senate Judiciary committee miss Kaiser's attorneys sent a letter to the panel saying his client wasn't refusing to forge account and then she believed it couldn't corroborate it\nA person close to the former classmate said it was her understanding and mutual friends of Dr Ford and miss Kaiser including this McLean had contacted the Kaiser after her initial statement to warn her that her statement was being used by Republicans are about the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nThe friends told them as Kaiser than if you had intended to say she didn't remember the party not that it had never happened she should clarify her statement the person said adding that the friends had not in fact pressured miss Kaiser\nNo it wasn't any pressure at all so good stuff happening there from the from the politically oriented legal team and friends\nOf Christine Blasey Ford this is a not obviously good for her account and obviously Chuck Grassley is taking this stuff very seriously to Chuck Grassley\nWho is the was the head of the Senate Judiciary committee on behalf of the Republican you actually sent a letter to Christine Blasey Ford legal team and this letter is pretty explosive stuff for Christine Blasey Ford he basically said why don't you turning over any of your records\nYou testified about your your psychiatrist record and then you won't turn them over to us you know show them the Washington Post but you won't show them to you testified about a bunch of material that you will turn over to us so why why won't you turn over any of that stuff\nHere's what Chuck Grassley wrote to Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer is quote\nYou've repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to doctrine for delegation I don't know what other interference we should draw from inference we should drop from your refusal but at the withheld evidence does not support Dr forge allegations\nIn quite the way you explain I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nAnd here's where it starts to get real dicey for legal team forward\nIn addition to the evidence I requested my cobra second letter in light of recently uncovered information\nPlease turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representative than any of the following one US Senators or their staff particularly the offices of ... senators Feinstein at her own uh other than your communications with me and my staff in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing in other words\nWere you coordinated with Democrats in order to try it out a particular PR line to the alleged witnesses identified by Dr four wheeling Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith\nIn other words we think that you've been corresponding with witnesses including Leland Kaiser about what they ought to be saying on that and three Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating it or the representative in other words were you coordinating with other people making allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nChuck Grassley does not actually released that letter unless you've got something his back pocket it geographically is a very cautious center and this is not a guy who's going to go out there on a ledge and then suggests that all of his his is some giant conspiracy without some evidence V. isn't that's inappropriate\nSo we will see what arises from all of that by the way\nWe're athletes office did release an executive summary of the FBI finding your findings\nBasically said that there was nothing when they talk to eleven different individuals ten of the great to be interviewed that includes mark judge PJ Smith and Leland Kaiser as well as other individuals included on judge Kavanaugh's July first Nineteen eighty two calendar entry remember Democrats were suggesting\nThat on on Capitol calendar there was a party for July first Nineteen eighty two and what you listed some people some of those people had crossover with some of the people mentioned Bible as you forward\nEven lazy for lawyers are now saying it wasn't the July first party\nFunny how they only say that after the FBI interviews all these folks are the batteries all these folks and then and then for the words come out and say she would never have said that it was July first as possible date some of the people listening on his calendar she knew well and would have remembered ... interesting interesting how that works though again\nI've never suggested not one that she was lying or making this up I don't know the answer to that I Do know that suspicious political activity around an allegation makes me more suspicious of the allegation than it otherwise would in just a second we'll get to the chaos that is happening\nOn the hill right now but first let's talk about your

them do we say OK so\nWe'll get to the chaos that's been happening in Washington DC in just one second first I think it is worthwhile noting that having lost on all counts or the Democrats have turned their final gamut they said that Brett Kavanaugh was ... and then they said the Brett Kavanaugh was a rapist and now they're saying Brett Kavanaugh cried and that makes them a baby\nIs it I'm I'm Serious there's an article in the New Yorker by person named Michael ... who apparently is is kind of a what a person repeats garbage on a regular basis here's what he says\nBrett Kavanaugh's years make a kind of sense from a single phrase by Thomas Jefferson that public life is about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the fulfillment of the white American manned Adam eyes desires as soon as the forces of the ad and became the ultimate purpose of this country society\nSo if you don't understand what he's talking about that because you have a brain what he's trying to say here is that the phrase pursuit of happiness means that white men get to pursue happiness but everybody else in the giant victim and therefore if you believe in the declaration of independence just because you're a racist which is an insane statement\nAnd then he said you have a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis in his body and his body politic both\nReally that's weird because it seems to me that rape laws have been on the books and for ever since all of human history written into America's founding document is the franchise from in my cabinet a week when he is unfulfilled\nThat isn't really in constant connection\nThat not really have you read it is in this was a citizen of his society then one of its disgruntled customers were always right

until two weeks ago was that he was robotic\nHe was emotionally you didn't have the sympathy necessary then he reacted emotionally to being called the rapists and then it turned into well Brett Kavanaugh is too emotional to be a judge and that was written an op ed in the wall Street Journal Frank or about that criticism here is Brett Kavanaugh\nTrying to make amends for his uncouth behavior after being called a gang rape is by sitting United States senators\nIs what he said I was equally honored and at the White House to live with my wife actually and my daughter is Margaret and lie to the president from nomination to be my former boss and match our Justice Anthony Kennedy an Supreme Court\nMy ma Martha one of the first woman to serve as Marilyn prosecutor and trial judge and my inspiration become aware that in the audience my dad at\nThat and I I told the American people why and and what I Believe I talked about my twenty eight year career as a lawyer almost all of which has been in public service I talked about my twelve years as a judge on the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia circuit often called the second most important court in the country and my five years of service\nIn the White House for President George W. Bush I talk about my long record of the dancing in promoting women including as a judge\nA majority of my forty eight law clerks had been with it and as a longtime coach and girls' basketball team\nThat explain that like a good judge must be an empire a neutral and impartial arbiters if there was no political party litigation or policy as Justice Kennedy has stated judges do not make decisions to reach preferred result judges make decisions because the law and constitution compelled the result\nAnd he talks about how he has ruled\nIn the past and then he said as Justice Kennedy showed a judgment independent not swayed by public pressure are independent judiciary as the crown jewel of our constitutional republic the Supreme Court might never be viewed as part of an institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides in Iowa you're not talking in separate rooms if I were confirmed any part of a team of nine and then he gets into\nHis his sort of me a call but\nHe says during the confirmation process I met with sticky five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters they violent violent threats against that backdrop I testified before\nThe Judiciary Committee last Thursday that offend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service my hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nAbout it because I fortunately and passionately denied the allegations against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement in response to questions reflecting my overwhelming frustration of being wrongly accused without cooperation of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character my statement it answers also reflected my deep distress and the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\nI was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been I might have been too emotional lifetime I Know my son was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a sign a husband and dad\nI testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad my wife and most of all my daughters and then he talks about going forward I can always be counted on to do what I've always done\nHe owes no apology he was not too emotional at times his tone should have been sharp\nAnd the fact that people on the left you know the ... by by the way the less the same people who suggest that I should not be allowed to speak at UCLA or USC or Berkeley that might hurt people's feelings\nThese are the same people are saying that feelings are unjustified when accused of right so in other words feelings are justified anger is justified protesters justified when I say a man is a man and woman is woman but feelings are not justified if I were to accuse you of gang rape in a public setting\nThis is all insanity obviously and that's why I\nPray to God that tomorrow the Republicans do the right thing I'm Talking to you Susan Collins I'm Talking to you Jeff Flake\nLisa Murkowski it's too late for it's OK out has now taken over the Senate buildings they've already set up barricades outside the outside the Senate\nBecause of protesters that are expected tomorrow I Will not something it is pretty amazing it's pretty amazing that we have reached this point in American public life with regard to Supreme Court seat this did in fact start with democratic left that decided that the court was a tool for the promulgated in of public policy and not merely an impartial arbiters of constitutional meaning\nThe reason that the stakes are so high is because the court became something it never was before during the war in Iraq and afterward and that was an actual political institution dedicated to a specific set of policy goals\nThe reason people care about the Supreme Court the reason that the people think that the Supreme Court matters is because of things like roe v Wade when the court decided that it was going to make national policy on the basis of left wing viewpoint having nothing to with the constitution\nAnd the left believed that the court was going to be its final bastion of left his him no matter what happened they could always count on the court to step in and defend leftist policy priorities\nAnd for a long time that was basically correct and now it turns out that when Republicans want to restore the judiciary to its proper role namely reading the constitution as it is written as it was men\nThan the left as well hold up a second hold up a second that's why people are so passionate because let's face it nobody cares about the local dog ...\nNone of this would have happened if we're talking about a branch of government like a bureaucratic branch of government nobody would a caring about that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "08"}
