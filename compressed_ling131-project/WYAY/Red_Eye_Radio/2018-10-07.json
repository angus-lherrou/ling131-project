his home yeah he had to be ... or ... ... not because he was resisting is because they are going to bring their favorite later\nOh hey Ninety five year old ... how to get all\n\nHave acted Nuremberg a British and Ninety five year old guy apparently was an armed guard at a that'd be ...\nLabor camp and help to kill six thousand Jews in one day in Nineteen forty three up one day\nWhat Fox called the polish step camp yeah\nUh and by the way that I was telling me the polish people are not very happy with this because every they're describing is at a at a polish death camp well it happened to be in Poland but it wasn't run by the polling you're putting trust me it was somebody that German polish had nothing to do it and so I mean there's there just wasn't a poli stuff can happen to be there but\nAnyway so they're trying to make the point he had his citizenship revoked Fifteen Years ago he appealed and that was denied in two thousand five\nAnd a ... and find a way this guy maintain friendships with Nazi guards who also came to America under false pretenses back when he did in the late for like thinking forty nine and how about this for a a coincidence the Nazi and his wife\nBought a home in Queens near La Guardia airport in Nineteen sixty six\nThey bought that home near La Guardia airport in Queens from a polish couple who were Jewish and survived the Holocaust all week and he bought their house\nThey didn't know anything about it but they do about it now and\nThe great he's been deported\nSix thousand and by the way a he was saying well I was a you know I was a German and during the war but he he denies that he was responsible for the thing and then you have the whole question again even even the German government is saying this was a troubling situation what do they call it uh the U.S ambassador to Germany called it a difficult task\nDeporting this guy back to Germany and now we're going to do with them\nThere I assume I don't put them on trial he won't be dead you know ... before too long I Can't imagine so but what happened to him now I don't know but this has been going on for almost Twenty years\nActually more than Twenty years since I'm ... and his neighbors first realized that he was a belief was announced anyway they're going to and then people are saying hey wait a minute it was just following orders [laughter] you know and here's the other thing I actually did think about this I suppose you it was Nineteen\nForty one and you were drafted into the German army and given a gun and the helmet and stuff and he said he our guard this uh entrance to this campaign is it okay so you're guarding the entrance to the camp that's all you did was ... of the camp you didn't shoot anybody just stood there in guard at the entrance for a couple of years in the war is over are you a Nazi war criminal\nOr you didn't have to be a Nazi to be in oh no way am I right you know you just where you work criminal\nNot necessarily Nazi but I mean if you'd anything that didn't stop the slaughter or whatever I mean I don't know I I don't have an answer to that but clearly if they get this last known one Ninety five years old\nI got you got there

the gym or [noise] on a new talk one oh six seven\nHere's the number eight for for for all fours hen sixty seven one zero six seven eight for for for all for ten sixty seven [noise]\nThis was a very day in Nineteen Seventy two grace slick got sprayed with me\nAnd Paul candor got body slammed or the floor when police showed up after a Jefferson Airplane show in Akron, Ohio somebody phoned in a bomb threat fans started throwing rocks at the top the cops responded with tear gas and then all hell broke loose [noise] Ninety Seventy two in Akron, Ohio Jefferson Airplane\nNineteen Ninety six on this day Rick James gotten out of prison regime served two years for beating up a woman remember that story but ironically on this day two days earlier in Ninety six the woman who was going to marry got put in jail for shoplifting a pair of thirty nine dollar boots [laughter] see [noise]\nAh let's see actor up happening around the same time you spend on that in the report like three or four yeah yeah absolutely I almost every day every other day is a regime in Ninety six or da go ... from the blacklist is thirty nine years old today and Brooks wheel in the comedian from Saturday Night live is thirty two years\nAgo for Fifteen quarter after ... repeats coming up later oh crap it's almost baseball we have a game tonight at a seven year on at six for five six o'clock and we won last night ... different Colorado Rockies took for in a row from is in Pittsburgh we want ... as\nWell in any way when we're absolutely Windsor good or a for for for all for ten sixty seven a lot of things going on including Michael Cohen the president's personal lawyers in court right now pleading guilty to a\nBank fraud and tax evasion or something again and has nothing to do with Donald Trump's election has nothing to do with Donald Trump's so called Russian collusion Paul Manafort's jury is now in its fourth day they sent another note to the judge\nAnd clearly they're stuck on something we don't know whether they're stuck on one of the Eighteen things or on all parts of the things we don't know but there are Manafort jury is uh has sent a new no to the judge so they're struggling with something\nOr if I'm guessing I there's no way to like I'm totally guessing my guess is they're going to have to convict him of something or or also feel they waste your time wasting their time and I think I'm guessing so they probably get 'em convicted of something but I don't know whether it'd be won't be ugly will be everything by a long shot\nAnd how about this story here in Georgia very very sad story ally handwritten could've been a lot worse oh\nAlexandra Suarez is uh twenty six year old mother excuse me [noise] uh who uh had her kids in the car she took two children inside their grandmother's house a couple of weeks ago actually about ten days ago\nI took two kids into her grandmother into the grandmother's house and left them there and then she went about her business and then realized that she had left another kid\nIn the car for about three hours a three year old child she left in the car outside the grandmother's house now this was in the afternoon eight o'clock that night the woman realized what she had done and called nine one one and said my God I left my kid in the car\nAnd so the cop showed up and they arrested her\nAnd they took the boy to a physical checkup at the hospital he's in good condition he's fine\nUh but uh miss Juarez was arrested for child cruelty even though she said oh my God my kids in the car called the cops Stewart and make sure he was okay for them to the hospital is going to be fine and now she's arrested she's being cooperative with the police\nBut my God she's charged with second degree cruelty to children\nUh she drop your kids off to grandma's house third was had fallen asleep in the car or she went\nHome and realize later it was like eight o'clock you realize that kid was must still be in the car and she called the cops on herself and they arrested her and put her in jail what happens when you were a snitch\nThat's right things do you know your ...\nSlightly different story or aid for for for all for Ted sixty seven you know I don't understand how Michael Cohen can be an all this trouble as Trump's lawyer when the only reason he's in trouble is because the FBI broke into his office and is a home and his condo apartment that he stays in when he's not home with the family\nAnd they stole all the stuff including all this tape recordings as a uh conversations with clients including the president United States all his lawyers notes\nAnd then they supposedly\nAre saying well we only looked at the ones that are relevant to our charge uh-huh they took 'em all they took all of it\nIf it's not rocket stop on time yes exactly what they did that's what they did and the same thing with Manafort wasn't a Manafort they broke into his house at three o'clock in the morning or something if he would have showed up and then he would they would have said hey come on down we're going to rescue night I'll be I'll be there\nI mean but no they show up to you know break into the house\nBrand class and the doors and just to show Donald Trump\nBy the way Manafort his trial has nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing and Michael Cohen his up pleading guilty today has to do with his tax evasion and his bank fraud has nothing to do with Donald Trump's presidency or a campaign or the Russians\nSo so far Robert Mueller's investigation for millions of dollars over two years has resulted in two trials that have nothing to do with Donald Trump\n\nBetter and you know he's not going to yet he is not going to ever cleared Donald Trump Mohler we'll never clear Donald Trump he'll have a final report that will never said Donald Trump did nothing wrong he will never have report clearing them\nIs it just disgraceful and you know that my mother and call me are best friends\nThey've invested with close friends best friends for Twenty years\nI tell you this whole thing is just a ... I was out in the ... it's obviously a conflict of interest in when when Donald Trump talks about the angry Democrats I mean my God the fix was in from the beginning\nThe same people who tried to fix the election for Hillary Rodham PC give our cabbage or fixing the trials the federal empire out of control it is\nA will and they're still trying to ... the metaphor jury is still the sort of knew no we don't know what it is it will if we find out will tell you obviously but holy moly oh oh oh [laughter]\nThat camera show replay ... by ... and I always listen to do a replay of the camera issue because you never know what might\nPop up\nThe cameras on a weekday afternoon lived three to six PM on the New York one of those six seven years just sprinted toward him at this flashing of ice shelf is brought you by Stormy Daniels storming was now appearing on celebrity big brother yeah yeah stormy said she wanted to see\nJust how big brother why Joe and now here's your host the camera\nOr whatever they want you to tell a story here's a second [laughter] little city coming forward twenty six already [noise] it's only me it's only the cameras you have a chance to go home go home now and not getting any better green army traffic ... and\nThis was a day in Nineteen Ninety five R.
