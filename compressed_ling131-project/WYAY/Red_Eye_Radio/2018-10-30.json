media made that the story\nComplaining that Donald Trump is up in the ... at three o'clock in the morning tweeting exactly but here's the actually set a Joe Lockhart the former Clinton press secretary said this\nYeah yeah you know frankly I'm a little tired about worrying about the president's psyche he was elected to be president of the United states not you know I hear you know a mental patient and being up at three thirty mental morning you know there's the famous ad about it all comes at three thirty well the president this guy's tweeting and criticizing people you know who who are just

man now says he regrets dressing his five year old son is Adolf Hitler for a family photo\n\nNow regrets it ... hours he regrets it here's the problem regret\nDoesn't happen sooner [laughter] initially attempted to justify the costumes by saying that he and his son love dressing as historical figure yeah OK airline and he condemn those who were approached and threatened him and his son during the party\n\nUnsurprisingly the people didn't take either league yeah so that caused by the way that the remember the father also addressed his of Nazi soldier to yeah I should I should point that out here\n[laughter] I'm just surprised so many people didn't take kindly to the guts to joy who do you think and countless people like the social media server right so I\nKnow that's a Sherlock moment\n\nNow my nephew I heard my nephew did a cool thing yeah\nI don't know where he got it but my dad told me that he\nCame in he went to a Halloween party my nephew's in his early thirties ... uh it was going to Halloween parties shows up at my parents' store and my father said you open the door\nIf he gets there was Abraham Lincoln [laughter] 'cause it's got the top had he goes I don't know where he founded you said but the ... the suit everything was perfect and my nephew max and the door oh wow you want to show us the cost of those yeah but ... grams I Know you know the Gettysburg Address\nSame [laughter] came to get the so my father told me is sitting there studying this time I don't know how long it was you said to my father knows\nThe almost the I I think my father said I Know the Gettysburg Address he he did about a paragraph or me\nAnd he said he kept going and my nephew couldn't he couldn't get it only got about a paragraph or two and he goes that's all I Need and so he went to the party walk through the door and started with the Gettysburg Address\nIn their right and I'm like okay that's cool that's good that that's a good one so\nUh I was going to go as a

said hey we're just one week from the mid terms what I it we're one week from the terms is it just me mhm pre show meeting you and I said the sort of the same thing\nIt's really quiet for a long term election with everything that's when ... ... maybe it isn't quite maybe it's just with\nThe you know the ... from cabin on everything else a caravan and everything else that's happened it's just maybe just a temporary low for a day or just see it like it's quiet yeah\nYeah I mean I I think right now especially with the house seats you're seeing so much concentration in those districts\nAre right now because the Republicans are just you know doing everything to hold on still the chances the odds are against that the Republicans would maintain the house but\nIf a ... again the momentum has shifted and there's some things that we haven't seen in polls we we mentioned this earlier and at the end of last week and yesterday we mentioned it and at the end of last week as well\nYou know there are only a few polls the pollsters aren't as active in the house races so I you know there's there's a lot of stuff we don't know um could this be another Nineteen Ninety four or is a\nNext silver right you know is it is a is it pretty much a given that the Democrats are going to take the house we don't know but ah next Tuesday will be a very interesting day well I mean has said is it to the point\nOf the the ... the one woman or was it on on CNN who said that I Believe it was CNN ... who said that ah you know a\nTrump has radicalized more people than an ISIS yeah right yeah now she apologized later on it's ridiculous the GQ call them yeah yeah\nUh she was on CNN the the lead Julio Lafayette apologizing after claiming President Trump has radicalized so many people are so many more people than ISIS ever did ... why did she apologized she meant\nIt she meant it when she said I'm guessing she thought of saying it before she said it and uh and thought that was a good idea and and believed it and still believes it\n\nAnd you just wonder does this help motivate the Republican base when they just keep and being\nYou know it up and we spend a lot of the show yesterday on the\nOn the political divide to go back and forth between the tweets and you know who's to blame forward is eight in in our opinion just useless discussion to have ... or it's you know the person that did it we're not going to stop the heated rhetoric is\nNot going to stop it has never stopped in the United states from the beginning\nThe insults\nAre still the same remember we what we forget is social media amplifies\nYou know the the\nCrude and and and rude and\nUh whatever you want to go out of a book called them you know Bob\nPolitical outrageous and provocative statements are and so everybody gets their turn to do it so it may seem like it's more\nBut the fact is politicians used to have dual they used to shoot at each other and\nWhen it got to the point of personal insults we get to this thing again where\nWell you know we're doing things that have never happened before\nPoliticians aren't doing\nAs far as we know what I mean we're not paying attention to every house race in you know now it could be happening somewhere I'm thinking the viewership for sports is\nDown and so that might be an idea from\nBattle of the network politicians take ten step toward turn around\nBut it would be more and it obviously we don't want anybody to actually get hurt but what about tasers\nI don't know how about ...

warming destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet Al Gore back again it's destroying the planet destroying the planet destroying the planet\nAnd we have asked since this has been going on for Thirty years ah where's the debate between the scientists right you would think that the left would want if the world was truly being destroyed\nBy what we weren't doing that they wouldn't sit that scientists debate it and as we've said tell us one federal veto one national debate that's ever been held\nEver\nOn global warming scientists who believe that men manmade uh you know ... you know man made up of\nA lot you know the manmade global warming scientists aren't sure and scientists believe that it is not and have them all debate it had the

though the mayor asked him to wait until all the dead have been buried funerals are scheduled for each day this week with three being held today White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says the president wants to express the support of the American people angry with the community\nWe are not in that camp we are in the camp a lot I don't have a I you know I\nI think Trump overall done a great job there are things that I disagree with him on and it gives it a great job in foreign policy one of the best that we've seen post\nA Cold War uh uh I think that on parts of the economy he has done great things with you and I both agree we would never have seen a Twenty one percent corporate tax rate right\nAh and we were not never seen across the board and by the way this comes from two people who under the Republican tax plan promoted by Donald Trump\nPay more in taxes\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] [noise] you know it and you know the Trump said that they wanted to get a tax cut done during the lame duck session and oh man God we don't know we\nDon't want another tax got Eric and I don't want another tax cut yeah stop it with their tax\n[laughter]\nStabenow right now but the Republicans talk with your tax cuts stupid tax\nCuts because lately when you do a tax cut Eric and I get a tax increase\nI don't know how that works like John Allen I resent now [laughter] I knew that get us one way or another dang it I knew that get us [laughter] after all these years ahead port this was what I\nGet [laughter] the trial [laughter] that's good trial\nBubble we still agree even though our taxes increased we uh agree overall with the with the the tax plan without question\nBut some of the economic things we disagree with the way that the president's promoted terrorists than we've had some ... not really much debate on it because we explained the economics of it and most of the response and we've talked about earlier about some people even on the right not wanting to debate it's well oh he's a great businessman ... that doesn't justify that's not an opinion\nThat's not an opinion on on the at an actual economics\nAnd so really people don't want to do when we happened to when we talk tariffs really nobody wishes to have a debate on that am I Am I correct right I don't know anybody that's really wish to have a debate\nA closest we came last week when a guy called up and said but yeah but it's helped my business and and and uh everybody works in the price of the you know the the increase in price\n[laughter] well [laughter] no they don't [laughter]\nIt's lived for your main you wish that they would but no no when you raise the cost of goods and ... of goods and services artificially it hurt the economy somebody gets hurt right now you can pick the winners and losers when you put tariffs then I'm gonna I'm gonna do good for this position\nAnd against that business that's what people didn't like Obama for but an economic snow but overall we agree with the president but when we\nWhen we disagree with him I don't believe it's hateful rhetoric is where we believe he's wrong which everybody should do we should not practice political I dollar tree and believe that our candidate does everything right because they don't none of them do ever\nSo make Eric great again\nLower my taxes [laughter] ... so uh but\nHere if this isn't hate what is it\nBy the way here's somebody who's trying to save their job or save the whatever money they get for being on CNN because\nShe means it in her heart\nAnd think about this I think about how delusional you have to be how out side of reality you have to be you couldn't look like the president for some of the things he's done that's fine and dandy\nWe can talk about that in the arena of ideas for took ... pair the president and say he's worse than ISIS\nAnd that his followers are like the the followers of ISIS the members of ISIS\nThat will kill innocent men women and children is just as reprehensible and hate filled more than anything but I Know any Republican\nIn recent memory has ever said yes\nAnd and that is too because what again when we talk about the the rhetoric what is it that you're trying to portray how is it that you're trying to label the president\nAs a major and in this case immediate threat\n\nThat he has radicalized that it's not just him that he was radicalized a great number of people that are also a threat to you\n\nThat they would attack you the way that ISIS would attack you\n\nI I haven't seen now correct me if I'm wrong and maybe someone else has seen it I haven't seen a group of Trump supporters shouting people out of a restaurant to even have you\n\nPeople wearing making ah America that great again hats shouting people out of a restaurant there there was some group that followed below sea\nOr that was a couple of weeks ago ... okay\nAnd and by the way immediately condemned by all by almost every Republican I'm there saying don't do that yeah don't do the tactics that they do don't do it\nYeah and I guess that's the only instance we sing yeah okay well you see like\nWell what it at at at the rallies but I mean where is where is the same kind of behavior I'm Talking about on the level that the left has\nAnd in which the\nIt just became well chasing them down at airports chasing them\nOut of restaurants will do behaving like that and they'll send it to the the thing that one of the things they've got that comes up every time one of the major points it's brought up every single time and has for a while\nThe Trump is creating instability by stating you know by being part of the chant lock her up lock her up lock her up as we've said before though that's not an uncivil comet\nThat's a comment based on the fact as we've said before\nOf many people believing that Hillary Clinton should legitimately be in jail well it is based on the fact that she broke the law that is recognized I don't know who doesn't recognize that fact right she just\nWasn't prosecuted for breaking the law hope the SP espionage law and the or trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act law by putting the server in her home mhm\n\nAnd we have gone through this ... the actual law and even call me said well yeah yeah but no reasonable prosecutor would if because we'd never fought an instance like this yeah because you'd never had a secretary of state that put a private server in their home\nTo avoid the freedom of Information Act and to allow foreign entities and she knows that she's smart enough former first lady former senator secretary of state to know\nThat our enemies are looking for anything that's on secured mhm mhm but thinking and believing though that's okay we know what the intent was the and everybody knows that the intent was I Want to keep stuff private I don't want it to be documented by the government\nAs is law to be archived by the government right now they're there for subject to freedom of information that right\nThat's what like lock her up about it's not about locking up because she ran against Trump son about locking her up because she's married to bill ... it's not locking up because they produce the offspring of Chelsea Clinton who now wants is is expressing interest in front of him for political office\nWell it's not it's not based on rhetoric it's based on a fat right that she broke the law and that she is not above\nThe law now you may disagree with their analysis but you cannot disagree with the facts that back up what they are saying\n\nAnd so they use it by the way they use it that every single time and the like the last month where I've seen them saying well here's the what you're saying that the lock her up lock her up that's on civil that's a no it's not meant to ... it's actually it's meant to promote civility that you locked up people that have committed crimes your eyes but you believe in committed crime right\nI mean\nThat's something that is provable by the way that fact that basis is not debatable right\nThe actual facts in the case nobody has debated no she hasn't gone to trial or she hasn't gone to ... you're right but nobody debate\nFacts right and nobody debates what the last day right it's simply called me who hated Trump they didn't want a prosecutor now\nWe know the whole story when we've been through it before we've gone through the loss specifically we went through the first draft of as we know the first draft of analyzing Hillary Clinton what she did it how they changed the language of it because the language that they originally had was the exact context of\nThe law that she broke right that she was not prosecuted for she broke a lot this is the fact she broke the law but was not prosecuted more\n... ...\nTake some time

I was shocked that was like wow I didn't know that exists here it is that it is eight years later now the picture comes out they knew about that if it was a picture of truck with David do from fifty years ago\nThey would be plastered all over the place so I mean they they just this is why Trump keeps winning because they just don't get it and they're still with hate the very eight that they're trying to convince other the they hate trucks so much\nThey hate him there and they hate him\nMore than they love the country they have more than all the success that he's having a it's just amazing that and the best antidote is for him to keep winning mad because that's the only thing that gives me you know as far as this is concerned satisfaction because they're they keep coming they do not stop but\nYou know he keeps coming to and he keeps winning\n... so that's what I you know be able to hang out with a ... wants to make it okay to\nJohn ... a ...

morning yet so you know when when we talk and analyze the mid term elections we've talked about the strong and weak points for the Republicans are and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing that Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have hit it too late but it still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when all of us I mean we here at at at our job I had to put in for you know benefits you're the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it a Obamacare but you know premiums are are coming in now\nAnd we had said this back then that the Republicans left this thing wide open\nThat you know they did a horrible job or a you know when it came to especially premiums that we're going to sky rocket\nAnd we said they got to come up with something as to what they're going to do when they really haven't\nAnd Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and so the twenty Eighteen mid term elections were less than two weeks away this was three days ago and many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters were not yet made up their minds at the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans are on the boat so these undecided voters an honor commitments to the Republicans who already support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken healthcare system\nAnd he goes through the whole thing that the derby Republican principles\nUp for the book for America as a Republican principles for America is helping healthcare system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life supported by a healthcare system but it's simple to use innovative unaffordable\nWe believe that every American should up his or her choice of the doctors and insurance that meets his or her specific needs we believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost and quality of treatment options and that this information should be available to every American\nAnd assemble understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions about their own health we believe in protecting patients\nWith preexisting condition so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage we believe in the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs that dramatically improve\nHealth outcomes while significantly lowering costs\nThat a doctor patient relationship is the center of ineffective healthcare system and it should not be disrupted\nBy micro management from public and private bureaucracies we believe American seniors have earned their health care benefits and that they their families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats or a private third party\nPayers are middlemen we believe in a competitive healthcare market where private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare interferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps new medical breakthroughs provides less asked access to treatment and lead to long wait times\nFor critical care we believe that the current health care system\nIn America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is much less effective and helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important\nWe believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system in an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step towards a better future and then he goes on to the Republican accomplishments and they go to the accomplishments [noise]\nYou know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nUh the uh uh six billion new to fight opioid epidemic in the past the right to try legislation passes stored VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited duration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to\nThe states the states make a decision as to what they wish to do\nRight and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drugs supply\nChain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax reducing Washington's mandates that limit choices the drive up
