Jay thanks for calling you on the radio\nTowers are very well Sara what's going on good I'm open\nTo make two comments about the uh the not too was deported\nThe last known Nazi collaborator living in America the blast when they know of Ninety five year old former camp guard played an indispensable role in the murders of thousands of Jews apparently six thousand killed in one day where he was and he's they've known about him for Twenty years and he finally got deported a welcome aboard whether you want to say about the guy\nOkay the first thing was that I had the correct in our day it made earlier in the day\nWhen they went to retrieve the Ninety five year old man they accidentally grab Bernie Sanders by mistake and then the one other thing was when there were were removing the Nazi from his home yeah he had to be ... ... ... not because he was resisting is because they are going to bring their favorite later\nOh hey you're not a five year old Jose how to at all\n[laughter]\nHey good Nuremberg a British and Ninety five year old guy but apparently it was an armed guard at a that'd be ... labor camp and help to kill six thousand Jews in one day in Nineteen forty three up one day\nThat's what Fox called the polish step camp yeah uh and\nBy the way that my team was telling me the polish people are not very happy with this because every they're describing is at a at a polish death camp well it happened to be in Poland but it wasn't run by the polling you're putting trust me it was done by the German polish had nothing to do it and so I mean there's there just wasn't a polish that can't happen to be there but\nAnyway so they're trying to make the point he had his citizenship revoked Fifteen Years ago he appealed and that was denied in two thousand five\nAnd a ... and find a way this guy maintain friendships with Nazi guards who also came to America under false pretenses back when he did in the late for like Nineteen forty nine and how about this for a a coincidence\nThe Nazi and his wife bought a home in Queens near La Guardia airport in Nineteen sixty six\nThey bought that home near La Guardia airport in Queens from a polish couple who were Jewish and survive the Holocaust all week and he bought their house\nThey didn't know anything about it but they do about it now and a great he's been deported\nSix thousand and by the way a he was saying well I was a you know I was a German and during the war but he he denies that he was responsible for the thing and then you have the whole question again even even the German government is saying this was a troubling situation where they call it uh the U.S ambassador to Germany called it a difficult task\nDeporting this guy back to Germany\nAnd now we're going to do with them there I assume I don't put them on trial he won't be dead you know ... before too long I Can't imagine so but what happened to him now I don't know but this has been going on for almost Twenty years\nActually more than Twenty years from the family and his neighbors first realized that he was a belief was announcing anyway they're going to and then people are saying hey wait a minute it was just following orders [laughter] you know and here's the other thing I actually did think about this I\nSuppose you it was Nineteen forty one and you were drafted into the German army and given a gun in the helmet and stuff and he said he our guard this uh entrance to this campaign is it okay so you're guarding the entrance to the camp that's all you did was guard interest in the camp you didn't shoot anybody just stood there and guarded in France for a couple of years when the war was over are you a Nazi war criminal\nOr you didn't have to be a Nazi to be an now than where am I right you know you just ... war criminal\nNot necessarily Nazi but I mean if anything that didn't stop the slaughter or whatever I mean I don't know I I don't have an answer to that but clearly a ... this last known one Ninety five years old\nThe the guys who got the million and then we got so attack of the week on the\nBike in town keeps running me over Joyce said now it's a vicious cycle that cycle bell vicious cycle\n[noise]

only the ... coming up later all the crap it's almost baseball game tonight at a seven year on at six for five six o'clock and we won ... different Colorado Rockies took for in a row from is in Pittsburgh we want\nWhere nearly as well any way when we absolutely Windsor good or a for for for for ten sixty seven a lot of things going on including Michael Cohen the president's personal lawyers in court right now pleading guilty\nTo a bank fraud and tax evasion or something again it has nothing to do with Donald Trump's election has nothing to do with Donald Trump's so called Russian collusion Paul Manafort's jury is now in its fourth day they sent another note to the judge\nAnd clearly they're stuck on something we don't know whether they're stuck on one of the Eighteenth things are on all parts of the things we don't know but there are Manafort jury is or has some of the new no to the judge so they're struggling with something\nOr if I'm guessing I there's no way to like I'm totally guessing my guess is they're going to have to convict him of something ... are also feel they waste your time wasted our time I think I'm guessing so they probably get 'em convicted of something but I don't know whether it'd be it won't be ugly will be everything by a long shot\nAnd how about this story here in Georgia very very sad story ally handwritten could've been a lot worse oh Alexandra Suarez has a twenty six year old mother\nExcuse me [noise] uh who uh had her kids in the car she took two children inside their grandmother's house a couple of weeks ago\nActually about ten days ago I took two kids into her grandmother into the grandmother's house and left them there and then uh she went about her business and then realized that she had left another kid\nIn the car for about three hours a three year old child she left in the car outside the grandmother's house now this was in the afternoon eight o'clock that night the woman ... what she had done and called nine one one and said my God I've lost my kid in the car\nAnd so the cop showed up and they arrested her and they took the boy\nTo a physical checkup at the hospital he's in good condition he's fine uh but uh miss Juarez was arrested for child cruelty even though she said oh my God my kids in the car called the cops to make sure he was okay for them to the hospital is gonna be fine and now she's arrested she's being cooperative with the police\nBut my God she's charged with second degree cruelty to children\nUh she drop your kids off at grandma's house third was had fallen asleep in the car or she went home\nAnd realize later it was like eight o'clock you realize that kid was must still be in the car and she called the cops on herself and they arrested her and put her in jail what happens when you were a snitch\nThat's right things don't you know your\n... slightly different story or aid for for\nFor all four to six or seven you know I don't understand how Michael Cohen can be an all this trouble\nAs Trump's lawyer when the only reason he's in trouble is because the FBI broke into his office and is a home and his condo apartment that he said stays him and he's not home with the family and they stole all this stuff including all this tape recordings as a uh conversations with clients including the president United States all his lawyers notes\nAnd then they supposedly are saying well we only looked at the ones that are relevant to our charge uh-huh they took 'em all they took all of it\nIf it's not it's not rocket stop all the time yes exactly what they did that's what they did\nOn the I mean this is this time you know to sign a couple of paper documents or something yeah baby classify something you know I Do something like that had a kid I've just written a song about really I'm so excited I'll be indicted because they only tweeted and I didn't fight it that's all I've got to so [laughter]\n\n[laughter] oh boy did you see Hannity last night no it's like he knows tectonic you're bringing caught another line where he said that his campaign it's ... it's like catching Hillary Clinton the liquor cabinet [laughter]\nCan Jerry fiber in your wallet for God's sake [laughter]\nBombing a bath house his like things that are out\nIn the air in a bar somewhere like catching camera in the drawer you keep your masters\nBag of misunderstanding right\nIs that enough analogies for letting catching Keisha Lance bottom in your ... guy on that is is it ... here you know boy things were popping on the sketch Late Show this morning oh really is especially dangerous I mean it's raining they can do about that you know maybe [laughter]\n\nBoy my data was getting blasted the small a man you're not kidding what's new about\nThat I Know they've been through

hell do you get like Mark Aaron canceled his late night truck a show you know the two in the morning rush to Alexandria, Virginia when I fly well you heard the Manafort jury might be hung well how how do I tell\nYou this week I was actually a great show Neal but the president's going to be funny when you're facing impeachment was the president and\nBy the way apparently the judge has declared a mistrial on ten pounds\nIn the Manafort trial [noise]\nGuilty on at least one count I guess are coming out with the right now um [noise] the two girls going on Michael\nAbout blown up pleading guilty Michael Cohen the Trump lawyer is pleading guilty to campaign finance and bank fraud and tax evasion charges which they didn't know about until they stole all the stuff out of his offices and as a law for Paul Manafort is apparently guilty on one count\nAt least ten were thrown out by the judge\nAnd I don't know anybody that's all we necessarily know that it's coming out in the bits and pieces so apparently a Manafort guilty on eight counts jury undecided on ten\nOkay the verdict is reached on eight pounds but he's guilty on at least one we don't know how many they breached the verdict you could be innocent on the count on at least seven counts we're seeing guilty on one\nOf the reporters no running out of the of the office to try to get to their phones so they call it in you are listening to the commercial replay\nWhale darling this gum or pile and you're listening to a rape lie of the cameras show you know I Love the camera because he never minds it went up but in Ga\nLoses

he was found guilty and eight counts in his front trials so that's going to be some serious stuff [noise]\nAnd then he has another trial after this one\nTime and again it has nothing to do with Donald Trump's campaign or Donald Trump running for president or Donald Trump in the Russians or anything else nothing [noise]\nOh my God how\nWho was who's had pets so what's her name that's Tiffany\nOh my

pleading guilty to\nTax fraud and tax evasion or something in the bank fraud or are they getting things that have nothing to do with Donald Trump in the so called Russian collusion which is all fake or Donald Trump's anything so nice school and Robert Mueller has the FBI\nSweep the office of the president's personal lawyer taking all of his tape recordings conversations is notes files and looking through it and then they finally got him to plead guilty to something\nCongratulations in fact a a peach going to have a story coming up about the uh uh Washington Nationals and something a move that might or might indicate that uh things\nI couldn't go too well for some reason I mention I wanted to say the whole thing but the reason I mentioned that is because uh the former or one of the the ... best morning man in America time he used the king\nIs a is a checking in what's going on in Washington right now the ... and made a few trade so dark days in Washington every man for himself rats

they may\n\nFall over\nCan do love\nWay the way Mr manager\nAgainst well by six fifty seven or the new talk what six seven eight for for ... for ten sixty seven what a sad story this is and I don't I just I hate to even to talk about an\nEleven year old boy in Iowa named Caleb Hammond has leukemia\nHe's been undergoing painful treatments at a Des Moines hospital for months it's not working other doctors are saying it's not working and we don't really have anything else we can do so the eleven year old kid said you know what screw it I'm going home\nSo he went home and he has a final wish for when he dies he's eleven and he's making final wishes\nEleven year old Caleb Hammond wants people to send him racing stickers\nHe's loved auto racing since he was two years old healed his passion is what prompted the request for stickers and his uncle says the stickers have been pouring in after social media appeal is trying to keep everybody spirits up\nUh he's been home for about three weeks now and he does what other eleven year old kids do as much as you can but then he gets tired really easily and he's hoping to get some racing stickers to cover his casket\nWhen he dies that's what the eleven year old boy says he wants to racing's tickets are stickers to cover his casket when he died from leukemia God what a heartbreaking story that is\nAnd how about some good news it's also a little sad in some ways to have you seen the video of the reunions of families in North and south\nKorea holy smokes a Donald Trump by the way is getting full credit for this\nHe arranged between the presidents of north and South Korea to get together to make a deal so that families who are separated during the Korean War are finally getting a chance to meet relatives who were separated from them fifty sixty years ago\nAnd there was video of of of of families women who are in their Seventy five eighty year old range seeing their brothers and sisters for the first time since they were for\nMe and there I mean it's ... will they now have more than one surname ... [laughter] I think they're all the same name still but can you imagine I mean the videos really is it's really astounding there you know they haven't seen family in sixty years Berlin Wall stuff God\nI mean can you ... and ... and here's the here's the kicker and the sad part about it is that apparently they were given a Donald Trump arrange the meeting to have them get the reunion together but apparently the deal is they are they can meet together in the same spot for three days\nBut they're being limited to only talk with each other actually sit together with each other over the three days for a total of eleven hours\nAnd the reason for that is the north Koreans don't want their people to find out too much about how good it is in South Korea for a fried dill defect or tried to defect\nBut again there at least getting to see the relatives for the first time since Nineteen fifty or even before that when they were separated before the war [noise] a quaint and spell oh man I don't think\nI'm standing on your show [laughter] [laughter]\nOh the Justin Justin [noise] uh the current level of terrorism threat has announced a ... required the following announcement from the French government has just announced that has raised the terror alert level from run to hide the only to higher levels in France [laughter]\n\nThe only the only two levels higher than runner hide in France are collaborate where surrender [laughter] who rises precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed Frances White flag factory\n[laughter]\nEffectively paralyzing the country's military capability meantime the Spanish or all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy these beautifully designed Spanish subs have glass bottom so [laughter] so that's a new Spanish Davey get really good look at the oldest they shouldn't be\n[laughter] ... [laughter] Iraq [laughter]\nFour oh one of the new talk what six seven I'm not making this up at Parris Island when I was there or if you were more than about six pounds over what they thought was your weight your called a fat body when I went to Paris island I weighed I think I weighed something like two ten maybe to come up by about two ten\nAnd clearly they're stuck on something we don't know whether they're stuck on one of the Eighteen things are on all parts of the things we don't know\nBut there are Manafort jury is or has some of the new no to the judge so they're struggling with something\nOr if I'm guessing I there's no way I'm totally guessing my guess is they're going to have to convict him of something or or also feel they waste your time wasted our time I think I'm guessing so they probably get convicted\nBut I don't know whether it'd be it won't be ugly will be everything by a long shot and how about this story here in Georgia very very a sad story Alexandra could've been a lot worse oh Alexandra Suarez has a twenty six year old mother\n[laughter] excuse me [noise] uh who uh had her kids in the car\nShe took two children inside their grandmother's house a couple of weeks ago actually about ten days ago a took two kids into her grandmother into the grandmother's house and left them there and then uh she went about her business and then realized that she had left another kid in the\nCar for about\nThree hours a three year old child she left in the car outside the grandmother's house now this was in the afternoon eight o'clock that night the woman ... what she had done and called nine one one\nAnd said my God I've lost my kid in the car and so the cop showed up and they arrested her\nAnd they took the boy to a physical checkup at the hospital he's in good condition he's fine uh but I miss Juarez was arrested for child cruelty even though she said oh my God my kids in the car called the cops to make sure he was okay for them to the hospital is going to be fine and now she's arrested she's being cooperative with the police\nBut my God she's charged with second degree cruelty to children\nUh she drop your kids off at grandma's house third was had fallen asleep in the car or she went\nHome and realize later it was like eight o'clock you realize a kid was must still be in the car and she called the cops on herself and they arrested her and put her in jail\nWhat happens when you were a snitch that's right things do you know your\nSelf snitching a slightly different story\nOr a for for for all four to six years of it you know I don't understand how Michael Cohen could be an all this trouble as Trump's lawyer when the only reason he's in trouble is because the FBI broke into his office and is a home and his condo apartment that he stays in when he's not home with the family\nAnd they stole all the stuff including all this tape recordings as a uh conversations with clients including the president United States all his lawyers notes\nAnd then they supposedly are saying well we only looked at the ones that are relevant to our charge uh-huh they took 'em all they took all of it\nIf it's that it's not rocket stop hotel yes exactly what they did that's what they did\nAnd the same thing with Manafort was Manafort they broke into his house at three o'clock in the morning or something I mean he would have showed up and then he went and they would have said hey come on down we're going to rescue night I'll be I'll be there I mean but no they show up to you know break into the house Brad plaques and the doors and just to show Donald Trump and by the way Manafort\nOr his trial has nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing and Michael Cohen his up pleading guilty today has to do with his tax evasion and his bank fraud has nothing to do with Donald Trump's presidency or a campaign or the Russians\nSo so far Robert Mueller's investigation for millions of dollars over two years has resulted in two trials that have nothing to do with Donald Trump\n\nTower and you know he's not gonna yeah he is not going to ever cleared Donald Trump Mohler we'll never clear Donald Trump he'll have a final report that will never said Donald Trump did nothing wrong he will never have report clearing him\nAs a justice graceful and you know that my mother and call me are best friends they've invested with close friends best friends for Twenty years\nI tell you this whole thing is just a ...
