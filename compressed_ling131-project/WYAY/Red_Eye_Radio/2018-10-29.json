in the fifties the Brooklyn Dodgers where every year they would go to the world series only to me you know disappointing and send them to bomb calling them to them again right now this is\nWe were suffering right now our nation is suffering because of socialism because of a number of things and he went through a couple of specific items of what was going on and he said look at it can't it's not sustainable this can't hold\nAnd so what you see here's this shift in power or at least for the moment to the right I'm In Brazil I don't know where I ... you know there's going to be I guess a a ton of work to be done to to bring their economy back to where it was\nA I don't know how you do that but certainly this was a reaction to what has gone on in recent years\nI I it might have been if we were talking about the impact of the Tea Party and I believe he called the talk about the fact that there was a movement that people in Brazil we're looking at what was going on in in the United states and when they see what's going on in the in in the United states\nThat helps you know in inspire other countries like Brazil and uh and with a boat so narrow winning the presidency ah he\nYou know part of his platform is to privatize date companies liberalize gun ownership and mine the rain forest\nSo go after ... natural resources give people the right to defend themselves and get the government out of business yes\n\nSo we'll get to that coming up here will tell you about the drunk students overloading this one ER in South Carolina while a LeBron James\n[noise] [laughter] got to

I Will be here next year right Kevin if your next year or the year after you still can't you can't vote here now\nMhm [laughter]\nI just burst out laughing because I Will\nWhat happened to the left screaming about white males\nBut based though is the is the new guy you know white males they do Hirono need to shut up yeah what happened to that well you know this this gets into the whole conversation of\nOf where we are you know as a country right now we've seen you know the the the blame game\nEspecially from the left the last couple of days or not the disks loose up to the left but the vast majority on social social media and in the media in general is the left attempting to blame Trump whether it's a synagogue shooting\nOr whether it's the the the the mail bomb or a ... scare I I mean the the piling on is just incredible I mean we live in a society where the left and I think this is very important you have to understand\nThat that they don't have anything else to go on\nPeople don't I I heard Bill Maher said that uh\nThat uh people support the the Democrats and where they stand on friday I just saw the headline that's incorrect they don't if you look at the major tenants that the Democratic party supports the American people do not the American people do not support sanctuary cities the American people do not support\nA open borders the American people do not support\nThe amount of gun control that the left would want a ... in in this nation they don't or they do have\nWhere they do have an advantage of by the way I I just love did you see that some of the Democrats are now coming out against the debt\nMhm and you know that's that's beautiful except the fact that if you see the plans that they are putting in\nIf you if you see what ... Cory Booker and everybody is talking about free health care well forget about it you're never going to pay for it because you can't tax everything that the rich has to pay for everything that you want but it's interesting because they're bringing up the deficit and the debt and look you know look what Trump's on the debt and we've often said this\nFor a ... you and I've been doing the show for Thirteen Years so we were there for the last few years with the Bush administration ... where we had Democrats constantly calling St Bush were spending too much and we said well we hope you're here when Obama is is back in in ... when Obama's in power now by the way we criticize Bush on a spit yes we ... we\nAbsolutely did yes uh and we [laughter] we create criticized one of the images of of Texas a conservatism\nTom DeLay when he told a conservative just shut up because we've got just about everything we can and the budget we said you're full of crap mhm so we have no problem if you listen to the show ... you know we have no problem taking on\nA Republicans when they claimed to be conservative but they are not and so we invited all those people\nBack then that should be between two thousand five and two thousand eight and we said look the Democrats takes it in two thousand eight we expect you to come back when they sky rocket the debt how many calls do we have from Democrats in the eight years\nOn the debt on the deficit or ... years of Obama in ... I Can't remember one zero\n\nSo I mean that they have they have no credibility of that and and people don't care that's the other thing too people don't care anymore Republicans used to screen the debt and they realize people don't care now the Democrats are screaming that people don't care they they they just don't have\nA run a couple of things over the weekend where people were saying you gotta understand the country is and I think I mentioned this last friday to this country's really going ah we're really going right we're really going right we're really going right in some areas we are\n... physically were not no not even a close eye on on economic issues we're moving to the left well and and the Republican Party is moving to the lab yeah and\nYou if you look at the uh the the the major threat from capital of the two capitalism and freedom more importantly\nA it is that that uh because if we're not going to if we don't care about it now then we're willing to let it go over the edge and at that point you can't turn back which means\nYou have government take over control of industry when industry goes south or if there's a program that goes south or you're going to have what\nAgain or imagine a scenario forget about cutting you know we talked about the whole hair cut thing you know to two percent five percent ten percent\nBut the problem was is that now you can't talk about a one percent cut you can't talk about a one percent increase snow you can't you can't live with your increase to one percent so there's there's just no way you would have\nRiots in the street remember in Europe when they were cutting or some of the social benefits and there were then and there were riots by young people you know they were they were talking about the especially like retirement benefits and everything else and the young people were writing there were setting cars on fire how dare you take away all of our free stuff\nWell imagine you know an economy our size and we get to the point that we can service that debt anymore\nI don't remember it was one open that door it was the jet I mind trick of Brock Obama as president the debts not a problem\nWell today the the economy isn't collapsing but it will then I compared it to saying well you're bedrooms on fire but you're in the kitchen and\nEverything is fine on on economics on on a tax cuts yeah the Republican Party is moving more conservative\nOn on spending uh on on a\nOn tariffs and we're not talking about China we're talking about the other ones and no we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right a a a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers and a half\nOf the increase we talk about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending mhm not not the private market booming now half of it is the private market and preventing and we agree with that\nBut we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go\nBut to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs to get and you got as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic mind ...\nBecause you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase or in prices in goods\nAnd services because the goods are going up and they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better\nActually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better know doesn't know we live in the ... and so people that were conservative around his delusional state of increasing prices helps the economy it doesn't\nIt helps the ... the

countries all religions they did a video down on the border several days ago\nTen Fifteen Twenty years ago but the debate has changed as you just brought up right before the top of the hour the political divide now is we don't believe in America yes we don't believe in the first amendment to the constitution\nAnd\nThis goes to the point of how you sell taking away people's rights we talked about McCain fined gold that really started in the late Nineteen nineties which was we need to get money out of politics which was always the dumbest thing in the world Democrats aren't talking about that are they especially with better when Texas\nNow they're in fact they were applauding better do for getting you know tens of millions of dollars raised\nRight so taking the money out was dumped ... was was a concept of what you're going to happen to begin with but it got to the point is we know McCain Feingold we need to limit speech of groups groups shouldn't be advertising because it might be able to influence an election where they're supposed to be\nThat's where we got to the point of the dumbest the slogan ever from the left corporations are people nobody said they were of course corporations aren't people\nCorporation is a set of laws set up by government to regulate business if you're a citizen or a group of citizens that gets involved in that you don't lose your free speech rights and the story\nThat's when I looked at it and said wow it's that's an easy sell because you had McCain that agreed with it and then you had George W. Bush sign at you and I both have the same opinion back then what are you doing you don't get to dictate who was free speech and who does it\nOh you are defending the corporations I'm not defending anybody I'm defending free speech either we have it or we don't that to me going back and that's why I say roughly Twenty years ago that to me was the beginning\nOf the push to say that the constitution had it wrong\nWhere we've seen our free speech as a as has gone to write ... we've we've seen the beginnings of it New York city human or New York city human rights council\nA you don't use the right gender pronoun or will find you out of business California well yeah OK jail times in the law\nOr you're not going to actually put him and I'm sure they are they going to put it in the law it was going to put it in in in in the law and so we've talked about you know that we talked about the first time we talked about free speech the left does not believe in free speech\nThey don't believe in freedom of religion we've talked about the different you know a Baker cases floors cases are out there\nAnd as most people in America bullied look do what you want to do behind closed doors but don't care what you want to do with your life\nDon't force me to believe it now the left wants you wants to force you to do it rubber when Obama became president oh no no no come on I mean Obama Care now this is going to be find no we're not going to force or anybody who was religious to\nDo anything against what they wish to what to do oh contraception contraceptives yeah we're going to force you to do this\nWe knew it all along\nSo you look at freedom of the first amendment they don't believe in that anymore they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion Second Amendment they want gone they believe is antiquated and as we as seen now and this comes from the identity politics ... created and nurtured by the Democrat Party\nAre there to the point now of as we saw during Cavanaugh a woman is always to be believed due process doesn't matter when a woman makes the allegation\nEverybody knows that's total garbage every case is on the evidence if you came out and said you believe now there should be a presumption of innocence and we should have due process\nYou were called every name in the book your called a gang rape enabler and that's where the political divide is in this country then we go even further with the election of Trump and the ... and and what happened with cabinet\nThat now the leftist promoting and we're seeing the beginning of this\nAnd it's and it's spreading now go to social media and see how many people on the left are picking it up\nWell you know yeah the electoral college was wrong and now so is the Senate the Senate is wrong we shouldn't have it set it anymore and we shouldn't have the electro college which again to me there's no compromise on those issues why\nBecause I understand why they were created they were created to protect individual rights that the left used to care about we've often talked about the ignorance of\nThe people in this country especially on the left when it comes to understanding the constitution which they don't even want it seemed to understand what so ever\nBut we live in a constitutional republic not a direct democracy and there was a reason for it\nIt was sold the majority could not rule over the minority it was so individual rights could be protected but the majority could not rural your constitutional rights invalid that's why we live in a constitutional republic\nThey don't care and so now the political divide is not how much a government should provide to everybody or how much the transfer of wealth should\nBe\nNow the left has moved into the political divide is Ben we don't believe in the United states we don't believe in individual rights we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the second amendment we don't believe in due process\nUnder the law we only care about what we want and however we at tainted including tearing down the constitution of the United states if we had the power to do so where's the compromise if you sit in our streets where's the compromise on that\nWell there isn't any there isn't any so there's going to be a political divide and it's going to be fierce and it's going to be passionate\nWell and that's always going to be the case and and right now the reason that it is a the the debate is so fears is because of the importance of those items\nThis is why you seen the Republican Party has been jailed especially since the Kavanaugh thing but I think the the Kavanaugh thing was was not just about\nThe Kavanaugh process or the lack of respect for the process I think it was an eye opener for a lot of those that were in the middle I think it was an eye opener for Lindsey Graham\nBecause\nYou and I had a one time during a pre show meeting during all of that after it happened we were like I said wow\nWho knew Lindsey Graham huh but you had Lindsey Graham actually say during that are passionate speech talking about the process during Sotomayor and Elena Kagan's confirmation\nThan what the discussion was about but I think for a lot of them they live inside the bubble they\nDon't see it as we see it every single day they follow the rhetoric but they don't follow it like we do certainly they they hear things and they see things but now they were people were getting in their face\n\nNow it had come to their table right there on the committee\nOr did they start with the Senate majority leader basically being chased down in an airport they saw it with what Ted Cruz and it wasn't just protester groups that kind of behavior had reached the Senate chambers\nAnd I think it was an eye opener for them to put it on perspective and say well yeah of course it was bound to reach our table it was bound to get here ultimately and it has and that was the real threat because forget about the\nThe the the protesters and and and all of those who are shouting at the faces the people you've had the endorsement of that behavior since Maxine Waters and even before that of others saying it's okay uh Don Lemon saying oh it's it comes with the territory\nYou should expect this but then they go further no we need more of this Michael Moore just the other day we need to wrap it up and he was talking\nIn the context of the bombings or the attempted bombing the mail packages\nHe was saying we need to wrap it up well tell me how you wrap it up from where it

on the political divide from our point of view and wide exist today and\nAnd it's just it's a reality of what we what we live with\nA we're not the first ones\nTo live the political divide in this country and we won't be the last the only difference in the political divide now is it's not a political divide anymore as I can see it\nBased on the fact that we as a nation need to provide more to the people with a bigger federal government under the constitution but now it's a belief on the left\nThat the laws and the constitution that we have to protect individual rights and the minority\nDon't matter anymore and so you know we\nWe talked about capping off the caravan also brings not just illegal immigration or into the forefront but it brings in the concept of sanctuary cities mhm and I still believe that the Republicans have failed miserably to capitalize on this\nBecause yeah science or you think about sanctuary cities just the belief\nThat in a legal immigrant criminal\nAnd their freedom is more important than the\nRights and security of American citizens that's the point that it's been brought up enough what you hear\nOr is sanctuary cities well we need to protect these people\nBoth what are you doing you're not protecting just the illegal immigrant you're protecting the illegal immigrant criminal\nThat's ... ... by the way that's actually wired news\nYeah\nYeah it's it is not you know this is the you I think the the situation\nIn California where you had a city's come out and and go after the state for sanctuary state policy and\nThe the concerns that were issued at those all of those events surrounding that and it's still going on it'll be ... that will be an interesting legal battle by the way uh to watch in the coming years um\nBut that threat is is very real when you talk about your cities' leaders are you're counting or your state leaders saying we're not here to protect you\nI mean that goes beyond think about the empty political but the political promise the promises over the years we're\nGoing to be tough on crime we're really going to work to improve things now some people actually were able to get it done\n\nBut those empty political promises people usually scoff at this is quite the opposite it's not just a political promise it's an in your face action by the government that says we\nAre not here to serve you and your safety interests were here to serve the safety interests of someone who doesn't belong here who was not a citizen\nAnd so I think it's important where the political debate has because many people are falling into the political debate has become the back and forth on social media every tweet let's analyze the back and forth who had the worst in Salt\nWho made who who who made a the the social media statement that can be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violent and even if they were kidding around and we're like let's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about what is the substance of the political divide\nRight and I believe from my point of view that's that's what I fear\nI fear a loss of liberty I fear last of the protection of the uh minorities\nIn this and and and I mean across the board I'm Talking about constitutionally speaking ... the the reason we live in a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy and that's why the call to get rid of the Senate and the call to get rid of\nOf of ah the electoral college even if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent of where the left wishes to do when you see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting lawlessness\n\nPromoting it yeah that's when you get to the point of people saying I don't know where I can compromise how do I how do I deal with you how do I talk to you\nRight\nHow do I how do I get it how do I want to get across when when the cabinet thing goes on and you have the main stream of the Democrat Party the mainstream Democrat senators promoting that a certain demographic always has to be believed in this case a woman\nThat's our old buddy Rand yes it is

political divide that exist in the United states in today and analyzing it what it is let's head right back you would go to ray a in Birmingham, Alabama should me Randy Randy Hi you're on the Radio Welcome to the show Hi Randy\nThank you sir I my my opinion is is that the last is trying to take us to take the United states to the point of failure and I believe that the United states files that you know where's the rest of the world understand\nWhere the where the savior of the world if it were not their face a problem happens in the world we are there what happens\nYou know you you make a a you make a great point and\nUh I remember when\nFirst started running for president people wonder if you'd be an isolationist mhm he wants to back off he doesn't want to get involved he's been present United States now he probably has projected us power\nWithout you know any type of major war better than any president I've known yeah in in in my lifetime ... you know projecting it I guess maybe you can make a case for Reagan because of the the the Cold War or a different thing\nReagan ... post Cold War say let's go post okay for sure but if it's I don't I think it's unfair because I was totally different situation when you were going to the Cold War that exist there but post Cold War\nUh I I think he's actually he hasn't been an isolationist I think he understands that even though we don't want to get involved in everybody's business you've got to project American power and I believe that he has why they want to do it is an interesting case I Do think that you have for example you have left us professors that are sitting there and they're think tank\nTalking about how we need to be you know global citizens and how the United states needs to you know needs to go away and to become part of a Europe or whatever but I think when it comes to comes down to the average person it's not that complicated I think they're not getting into theoretical political discussion leftist discussions\nI think it's about the fact that they get into the tunnel vision and say oh we didn't ... Kavanaugh's in we can't have cabin I'll get rid of the Senate\nWell uh it's coverage I'm prompt draws president tried to get rid of the presidency I'm there will be electoral college at really we get rid of the electoral college we can't have a ... if we lose the electoral vote and\nWin the popular vote we can't have that right and and and it is pretty much the solution to everything from the lack of that didn't go away we'll get rid of that\nSo I don't I don't know if I don't believe that the average liberal running around who was outside of university\n[laughter] or liberal think tank is going through that process of saying we wish to all be global citizens I Know that's promoted but you see in a mostly do those kind of comments mostly come from university\nA type people I think it's the average liberal politician out there sits there and says I Want to win the next election what can get it for me open borders well I really don't want to open borders but I Want as many illegal immigrants to come in 'cause if we claim that if we claim that we care about them than if they can get citizenship will get their vote\nWell and that's it it it's you know if we can it if we can uh pose as people as the side that cares the fact of the matter is is they only care about again their side the things that they want they want to completely do away\nWith the foundation of the nation they want to\nDo away with this with the with anybody who disagrees with oh we want free speech but only free speech\nFor the things we agree with her uh [noise] well that's not what free speech is about free speech is about the stuff you don't agree\n[noise]\n\n\nIs Cesar ... radio on Westwood One\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell road selling hotline at eight six six nine

there's something like this is going to happen\nBlaming Trump for the synagogue shooting certainly shows that are so it's really tough to make that call and as we said earlier\nThe the gamesmanship that we get involved in now especially the left immediately jumping on anything that happens in a country three hundred and thirty million and say well somebody does something that must be your fault over there and so the person who actually has committed that heinous act\nAnd so we have this political divide but we believe I Believe one of the things that is that that is different right now in this mid term and\nDon't know the numbers the numbers may not be that great but the imagery\nWe said this when Kanye West West was at the White House and he was immediately marginalized has some mental case he wasn't a mental case when he went after George W. Bush was he\nWould you hear the way that he talks is our rap artist but the fact was he was called everything in the book\nFrom a mental case to Uncle Tom any has to be by the lap if you come from their point of view he has to be to hear how we ... started up black ... mhm yeah [laughter]\nAh you had the the group of a of a black Trump supporters last week hundreds of the meat ...\nNow I don't know I don't know whether he's got it you know whether the in the midterms you'll get a couple more percentage of blacks blacks still overwhelmingly vote for Democrats we all know that but the fact is imagery the imagery and it's growing each and every day\nWhether it's Kanye West coming out or uh some of the biggest conservatives supporters right now and Trump supporters in this country are blacks\nIt may not be a world when the change at the moment but the fact is they're getting media coverage\nAnd the more that comes out more the more blacks to stand up and say I like Trump and I don't believe he is a racist they can't add that on the left that is not permissible\nYou and I've always said on um you know Trump or racist how many years is the anybody ever have an allegation of him being a racist in business ever know\nAnybody who's ever worked for him personally you know you saw a number of people that were in fact he was at a resort or when he was campaigning twenty sixteen and you had people that stood up you know from all ethnic backgrounds who said he used to create pasta worked for\n\nNo they they praised him until he became a threat in ... until he started working you know for things\nHow many how many and see a A N double ACP awards did he went right\nNow he was praised across the board the liberal left love Donald Trump up until the time he decided to run for president and promote things like tightening the border lowering taxes\nYeah no they loved him\nBut he was well it's still live on most everything that he's done these well within the mainstream of American politics as you pointed out many times but that doesn't that doesn't matter no he's an extremist and we must be labeled him as such\nThis will be the tactic for you know it hasn't been the tactic by the left or for many years on presidential candidates but it's going to be the ... it's the tactic by the left on on pretty much everything now\nAnd we address this last week I don't like a lot of Trump's rhetoric and I don't think it's needed I don't think it's needed to win but I Know it's part of his personality I hate to say it but as ... as\nThe great conservative political pundit shots you said ...\nRemember during the campaign or was it after the campaign and it was after the campaign last messing with people's heads yeah we're from queens we messed with people right\nNow I don't like it because I think that on so many issues he has the wind and he doesn't have to get personal well and my in ... in a lot of the rhetoric right order\nOrder to get to win and we've talked about this in great depth last week got some complaints on it that's fine [laughter] welcome to talk radio but it's not needed mhm the instant satisfaction of somebody on their side was mean so you can be mean back and you get that instant enjoyment stop but we don't need it\nEspecially with the wins that this president is getting that the other Republicans haven't been able to get or weren't willing to take on in years right\nLet the when do the talking\nBut I understand but I've come to realization of of who he is although I did see some ... or somebody that social media are posted well you can't no longer look at them and say that the rhetoric is acceptable because he has good policy\nWell no\nActually you can and you can also say for all of his rhetoric um [noise] look at the opposition mhm\nLook with the choice was what was the choice mhm the angel Hillary yeah my name's ... death ... was it look as if it's [laughter] about that rhetoric [laughter]\nIt's a grim reaper [laughter]\nBy the way she said she would like or to be president but she isn't going to run in two years on I saw that had went over the week yeah mainly because she knows that the the left is going to call her outlook they're done with her they're done with the establishment left or whatever you want to call it\nNo no no how much else it won't be long before possibly but it won't be long\nBefore they're done with a Casio court chosen O'Rourke without work it's gonna be November seventh button [laughter] another said might\nBe a little bit longer but it's but this is they did this in Georgia sex remember you know the the race there oh he's the next he's the face of the party okay\nOr for any of your Democrats without Googling it tell me who he\nWas\nThey don't because that's that's they move on they're done with you a tomorrow because you're going to be the oppressor tomorrow\n[noise] well I got to be what's wrong with high the nation I did hear and he's a I heard him say no but I did I hear he was then asked the question even when he loses taxes you know when you run for president right in twenty twenty so ... may still be around for a little bit yeah we'll see\nYou know run for president ... who else who else is there did did\nA warrant kill her chances yeah she's either way I what is it one of the DNA places\nI don't know whether they did this after that whole controversy\nBut I keep seeing people who say I went to you know what's my DNA dot com whatever ins are sending my sample got it back and I'm Nineteen percent Native American mhm there's two different commercials I've seen where they're Native American I'm thinking to myself it's just a coincidence\nYeah\nJust a total coincidence or do they make the ads after Elizabeth Warren\nMy uh my wife and I both did ours and mine came back a dude you're a middle aged white guy\nOf European descent did you really need to spend the Seventy bucks on this now have you done it yeah yeah see I I have no I have no interest I just don't care yeah I Do I think it's a fascinating thing but it didn't tell me anything\nI didn't already know are already done my homework before that I Know a lot about my family tree where are you part Native American\nNegative okay I mean we have some and the lineage but it is I had asked the question literally is down to like one or two a people that I've been able to find in the history you know moving to to what became\nAmerica One out of one thousand twenty fourth probably not even that\nYeah no no\nUm basically a white\nEuropean guy that's what actually sat white European dude\nSo the euro centric theme of the show tomorrow will be\nWell it's you know here's the thing is that um I I think that ultimately the the left is going to ask her you know whatever happens a week from tomorrow\n[noise] uh they ... let's say they win the house a week from tomorrow okay we've got the momentum we need to check the

I really need people that are readily willing and well eating Jews Willie ... we've\nHad crazy people in our society deranged an evil people in our society for quite some time\nThat's not sure it does so saying that it's getting to this point and that's the cause of what happened in Pittsburgh that the cause of the person mailing the the device just through you know you just said\nWe're becoming hyper partisan you're against it and you become ...\n[noise] I don't mean to be hyper partisan and I don't mean\nWas viola I'm Down in LA we're we're not all ... owner left and we're very reads about what were your brother I Want to your nails\nAll right I Want to address one thing that you said that nobody wants to open borders I Would disagree with that tell me one Democrat what their policy is in a in any\nOf that\nIllegal immigration plan to secure the border tell me any of them that have said\nThat this is our plan and we need to have border enforcement and we need a because you'll hear a lot of we need comprehensive immigration reform but they'll never get into the specifics of what should be included in that comprehensive immigration reform when it comes to border control\nWhat you have ... ... ... what you have a right now you think about this\nTrump is being blamed for the caravan look you can play it in me blame because they are not being blamed for the game is being blamed that he doesn't care\nAnd the and the and the point is because you said we're going to stop and that the border and Democrats are saying no they all should be able to get through because they're only looking for the American dream and that's what's fair\nWell then at that point is nice rare but if you believe that as the mainstream now or the Democrat Party believes you may be a liberal\nAnd you may say you disagree with it but it's what your party now endorses\nThey may not you know they may not use the term open border but that's what they mean go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead\nIt is it is unfortunate that that\nPerception of the Democratic party has now proliferated but I I Would I Would venture to tell you that no president\nIn the past three or four administrations has deported more illegal immigrants ... he deported more immigrants than any President Trump Bush Clinton Reagan none of them\nOkay and look I I don't know I Love to know what I hear leaning Democrat okay wants open borders okay one day here's here's we're lying here or there if we want safety here here's a point I Want\nI mean we we can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true that nobody deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing the Iraq Obama believed it things are hyper ... has\nA little bit less than ... than Obama did when it comes to his ...\nAnd the way he talks about the way he talks about it not what he not what he wants to do nothing subtle he's all art against what he wants to do is that where you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is the is it seems to me or as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you don't have a ton of conservative trends Republican friends\nWe're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying is that it seems to me that Trump and the way he characterizes people who are\nIn need and if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you wouldn't want the best for your friends you would you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me that\nYou're in an okay but what is not the ... after that we're gestures guilty okay well let me we're Jerry Lee are using language to characterize right right well here's not ... it here's the point oh ugly right now that people are dying in life than ... okay are you people are dying but the result of\nFifteen million children struggle with hunger in America that's why the feeding America nationwide network of food binds works to risk your surplus food to help provide billions of meals to families need across the country during the fight against hunger is Feeding America down the gathering we can solve hunger together we're Feeding America run\nBy Feeding America anything I can sum you talk\nTo one of those six seven\nAnd when I radio he's currently and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety row\nDied or to the last caller we\nUh you know ... after your call and I'm sure we'll get more people saying this because they do every time both sides are responsible for creating the type of rhetoric that causes these shootings I Would disagree with that but are they what happens after we have a shooting\nAnd and I go back to O. wild when I first became a talk show host in the nineties there were a lot of the shootings that that happened I I Will say this that\nThe ... from my experience sitting in my chair and I'm not going to say it's a dumb argument to get in well both sides do it well you know you'll be able to find both sides to do it you're going to ... when you have tens of millions of people in each political party yeah somebody from both sides are going to try to make political hay out of something\nBut what does the media\nWhat does the mainstream media and when you get to more official politicians off of social media what happens when there's a shooting almost immediately the left comes out and starts talking about gun control\nBut it happens I mean it's it's right away they don't even enjoy it instituting not one day or two days it's the same it's at press conferences from local officials before\nWe even know what happened in any incident is immediately politicized\nUm\nAnd then you will have from what I normally seen it could be exceptions to the rule\nBut what I normally seen afterwards is then when the right gets involved and start talking about the second amendment ... and then that debate goes on ah to sit and discuss what rhetoric may dry\nBut a mass\nShooter to do what they want it's I guess on your part it would be a guest on my part\nNone of us know you don't know\nThat saw people and so to say we need to tamp that we need to temper the rhetoric across the board\nOr ... I think we should uh as conservatives because I think we can win every issue without doing so I understand why the left and I understand why some people on the right do it I disagree with that but I ...\nThe leftist nothing else to go on the last caller I like I said it was really interesting he was talking about how you need to get rid of the hyper partisanship and then he went into hyper partisanship\n\nWell and and and saying that he doesn't do anybody that's for open borders I don't know anybody that well the fact of the matter is is that there are\nThere are people out there that are calling for open borders I think we sort of convince and here's the thing I I Would ask a huge ask those that use side with and I mean the people running for office or that are holding office right now\nAsk them\nWhat level of enforcement on the border\nDo they believe that it's a very simple question uh\nBut we live in a nation with free speech we're not going to get rid of free speech the second amendment isn't going away free speech is going to stay\nA there is a party that was just to get rid of it ours is not bad party\nWell and they're ... they're working very hard right now to to do that and and if you think to the last caller if I don't think that doesn't exist then go to talk to the people of California by the way you're using the wrong pronoun there is a penalty of up to a year in jail and that law for a reason\nWhen I say ours I mean conservative mhm I said party amid conservative because Republicans as you remember McCain was a Republican assigned McCain or that or a sponsor McCain fined gold and Bush signed saying that he knew parts of it were unconstitutional but hold up the courts deal with it and you and I were in serious when he did that so there\nYou know if you if you think that you know you're the the color in describing well where are your brothers were you know we we are trying to paint every one is as someone who thinks is him\nOn the left that's not the case\nTell me it's not extreme in New York when they say if you use the wrong pronoun we can find you up to the point that it would shut your business down\nIn California [noise]\nIt's in the law [noise] they can put you in jail for using the wrong pro now [noise] now tell me that's not a sprint [noise]\n\n\nIs Cesar ... radio on Westwood One\nMisses show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day is it red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that's red eye radio show dot com\nIf you're farming today you know all about taking real well here's one risk you don't have to take any more the risk of ID I be internal diesel injected deposits because now cynics ruby field mess they're bringing in diesel fuel has an advance injection stabilize\nOr to prevent id ID so you don't have to risk injector failure clogged filters in downtime andme more cynics ruby field masters even backed by a ten year ten thousand our warranty\nFor even less risk peace of mind power alone synergism ran to the age [noise]\nCobra electronics is proud to support the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink and traveled centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty ninth LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right did CB\nRadio is helping to save lives the rest of ovarian cancer by empowering women to liberal activists for every radios gold man who was making a donation device thinking the fight against cancer the right to the radio is available for a limited time ... travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nAttention owner operators how you're tired of chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join their team offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for cello drivers or two dollars per mile for teams RSVP pays all miles that hadn't back\nHome or not in their vocabulary they're naturally rentals needed a male hidden secrets are I think the today and ate and ate RSVP three six five that's eight eight eight RSVP three six five four apply online at RSVP I Am the dot com that's RSVP I Am the dot com\nHave your driving right now and you'd like to read the informative an entertaining content found in the current September October issue of rotating magazine or if you'd like to listen that's right I said listen\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of vote your drivers is now available for free as an F.

I'm always curious as to the people\nWho do participate especially an early voting it's not just you know conservatives um it's liberals but even in our state you know it's a red state but you see that participation on both sides so you wonder what they are thinking and\nAnd if I could have a conversation oh with a number of them just just a roundtable\nYou have you have my mindset yesterday\nWas such a nice day yeah I mean this is uh to me this is this is not work today\nI'm In the middle of a three day vacation ... I just happened to be doing this today ... because if it's supposed to be in the like eighty today in eighty tomorrow and then it's gone so I'm pretending this is like a long weekend and I just happened to come in here and what a chat with you mhm I wanted to bring in some alcohol to pretend I was staying out real late in the morning and mhm\nRight so I took a long bike ride yesterday Fifteen mile bike ride\nAnd I did it all throughout my huge subdivision that I live in ...\nAnd as I was driving around 'em or we're probably knows I'm riding around I'm looking for one crew sign\nOne because I told you the other day I I didn't think I saw once why specifically when Fifteen miles around I\nLive in a subdivision that probably has about three thousand thirty five hundred homes I think it is relatively new uh south south the ... of south west to Dallas a twenty five miles southwest of Dallas or right before you get to farmlands where I live you know it was like subdivision farmland ... but the big subdivision\nOr probably about two or three every block I Would go down every street two or three ... didn't see one crew sign in Fifteen miles driving through my subdivision ... and you and I asked the question is that even an effective way to spend your campaign dollars mhm [noise] yeah\nI see a number of them are of in my neighborhood uh there's there's a few but there's just as many Ted Cruz signs right now and\nYards and my neighbor yeah nah ... totally couldn't couldn't find one yeah and and but I'm driving it I'm\nGoing violent man I Would love to talk to these people ...\nLike if they were sitting out there and drive wages pay how you doing pull up my bike oh yeah riding the bike and then look at it or even ... even even if I had to not to be honest and tell [laughter] well ... and not just a volunteer information just go oh see uh even\nPrevent why over Cruz no that that's exactly the way I Would like to approach it especially at the polls just have like a ... just a roundtable discussion of people that are voting or just cast their vote\nA okay you know what do you think as you just cast your vote so it would be you'd say what are you thinking not hell\nYeah yeah so you're exactly okay what are you like what is it that is you know because it it it's different in every low college it's different in every precinct\nUh it's different you know state to state or we do have you know\nDemocrats that that when I mean Beto has won his district I mean and and can if he wants to serve in the house he can he can stay in that district I think for a long long time if he wants to\n[noise] um but there are you know again as you as you kind of wide now through the state I'm just curious as to what the the average everyday person is thinking because clearly the act of voters\nSo there's there's that um is it a routine kind of thing it almost is routine for me but I take it very seriously and it is a very thoughtful process because I Do take it seriously\nYeah but routine there's nothing wrong with routine of means his party ... is part of the culture that you grew up and vote right but\nI Wonder if they are their sons and he had all that that have a routine and it's just based on you know this is the ideology and and this is it and it's not or not even a ideology there's just no way I can vote for the other side I mean there's a number of questions that I Would have\nAnd I would sit it would probably take hours to sit around just a just a regular you know to think of Frank lunch and the stuff\nThat he's done you know Fox News or the years I like Frank but I always think he asked the wrong questions you know why he doesn't ask the questions I Would ask ... exactly [laughter] and and I think in that setting\nToo I mean these are these are people that I I Know just voted these are people that are active especially if you were to do it like in an early voting setting ... you know it that that are active early and it's going to I Know it's going to be on both sides\nUm I Would love to see what is it that's driving you and we'll we'll see some of that I think you know after a while a week from Wednesday we'll we'll learn what some of that was here's a\nQuestion I Would ask in Texas nobody has even talked about the governor's race\nYeah there's really not a race they can talk about [laughter] because Greg Abbott has a roughly ... point lead yeah over Lou ... Valdes the Democrat yet by\nA former sheriff of downtown ... ...\nAnd that's not even close you you don't hear anything about that so here's the question that I Would ask this is very interesting question you have probably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more\nThat are voting for Greg Abbott but will not vote for Ted Cruz ... there are people out there that are voting for Greg Abbott who will vote for better over why would be my question mhm right because there's such a disparity\nCommunities numb uh everybody's grief stricken heartbroken uh\nOne of the dead and came from my district to one of my constituents are all of western\nPennsylvania's grieving and it means so much to western Pennsylvania that the world is reaching out or\nSet to appear for his first court hearing later today don't futures down twenty two\nI'm only a for instance [noise]\nI Can't believe that we're playing foreign for basketball with a barber shop for that\nBall ball ball a little bad\nUm\n[noise] no I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car insurance with Geico\nKnow ... percent or more car insurance\nOr you or someone you love one of the nearly one million Americans living with Parkinson's disease there is no known cure\nThat you have the power to help the teams that played dissipating in a clinical trial then Michael J.

confronting people in public places incitement one activity is not necessarily incitement to sending bombs in the mail or shooting people up on a congressional baseball field\nBut the media have led to a particular conclusion Bernie Sanders in two thousand Seventeen was completely innocent of what this guy did agree and then they say well a crazy person like an obvious crazy person is President Trump's responsibility what happened here and that is absolutely a bunch of crap and it's dangerous crap to it is because\nThere's a lot as well as the climate polarization the climate has gotten too nasty in this country it's just a bad nasty climate of polarization that we have here in the United states and that's all President Trump's fault\nSo maybe we ought to censor what people on the writer saying maybe we ought to claim that people on the right are uniquely evil\nAnd they understand that that claim actually radicalized yourself at the best thing that if they were there were two sided about that they were objective about that is what they said well listen everybody needs to tone down their rhetoric Bernie Sanders needs to tone down the rhetoric Democrats need to tone down the rhetoric Republicans need to tone down the rhetoric they don't we start consistent\nIvan thing that that was enough for literally years on this program I've been saying that\nThat's not what the media are saying what the media are saying that every time a democratic ... job does something it's the fault of democratic last job\nThe Republican ... job does something it's the ultimate all Republicans across the country and that is going to drive people not and it's going to make people less likely to tone down the rhetoric is likely to make more people anti media\nThey all this talk about radicalizing people against the media the media don't read President Trump's help for that they do it pretty well themselves and does it mean that President Trump ought to be saying what he's saying it does mean that the Democrats in the media are\nAbsolutely radicalizing the population of people on the other side by claiming falsely that everyone on the other side is responsible for the action of somebody who is clearly and saying\nThis stuff is really really gross and the media were doing this in advance or they're prepping the narrative for legitimately days in advance of the actual discovered here will get through the Republicans in what they did wrong here due to the President Trump's response to that was really really idiotic but\nLet me show you some of the entire on that were preemptively attacking President Trump when they didn't even know who this guy was\nSo this was from yesterday and the host is standing in front of a a screen that says men hunt for serial bomber and then it has profiles in various people like ... cents than Eric Holder Maxine Waters Robert De Niro Joe Biden and then underneath here's what the current that men hunt for serial bomber going after Trump target\nThe idea here is that President Trump somehow deputy tie this crazy person to send bombs in the mail but that was president from doing\nIt CNN was saying this openly they weren't trying to hide the ball here here's another high run and that is a reporter on screen from the White House and it says underneath CNN from has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber\nWhy would he have ... plans to claim personal responsibility for inciting a serial bomber to Bernie Sanders claim that he had responsibility for inciting a serial shooter\nIs there like really is there any evidence that President Trump inside of this guy that he had a piece of mail this guy saying you know the awesome and pipe bombs Maxine Waters but this is exactly what CNN was cleaning\nAnd you wonder white folks on the right don't trust me this is like built on the right\nDon't trust the media like it's just it's absurd there's Maxine Waters a person who legitimately has set it in the past few months we should get in people's faith\nIn causing violent ways in public places on politics and now she's ripping into President Trump and saying he should take responsibility for obviously crazy person by the way this is why I object to all the false flag garbage that so many on the right we're feeling right out of the gate because\nMy feeling is that the obvious answer to this was it was a crazy person you know who send bombs to people in the mail\nHigh profile people in the mail bombs that don't work properly you know does that crazy people and the here's Maxine Waters letting president from that can water probably the most volatile and the most violent rhetoric using Democrat in the United States Congress here she is blaming Trump for all of it\nI think the president of the United states has been dog whistling to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there and I think that they're acting out let's say the lead the president wants them to do and the way that he wants them to add\nOkay that's crazy okay the idea that Trump wants people than bombs in the mail is insane but that's totally what Maxine Waters with would say you would expect her to say this and this sort of one side of the coverage that leads people not to trust the media now media are not responsible for people sending bombs that the media are responsible for increasing a volatile climate\nAnd they blame President Trump for increasing the bottle climate I agree President Trump certainly has not tamped down the volatile climate but the media are part of that volatile climate and they're making more volatile not less volatile and the fact that they are denying that demonstrates their completely out of touch with reality I'm more on that plus more information on the\nOn the suspect on the alleged bomber but first let's talk about the fact that at some point here hopefully in a while you're going to

I didn't really know what was wrong with it and then I looked into it a little more and there's a problem with the tweet\nIn sort of effect it's correct but in but in practice it's wrong to President Trump's weed out to those in the caravan turnaround we're not letting people in the United states illegally but back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing\nSo people pointed out that the people who are trying to get to the southern border of the United states are applying for asylum you can't do that unless you're already in the United states or us more you can actually apply for political asylum from the country of origin\nHowever President Trump the actual suggestion is that these people are not actually looking for political asylum instead they're looking for economic opportunity which means that they would be fraud you won't be filing papers if they were seeking political asylum\nWhen they were really looking for economic opportunity she'll go home and apply the right way I don't think there's anything wrong with Trump saying go home and apply the right way but if the idea is that if you legal for them to approach the southern border and apply for asylum that of course is not true\nEither what is also not true is that the United states has an obligation to take an everyone who wants to cross the border and no matter what\nWhere they come from or what their motivation is John ... back and he says the guy he's spoken to God\nNow as a religious person who speaks of God three times a day doesn't talk back to me but I talking to a fairly often like a lot okay but apparently got does talk to John Case it\nAnd it's funny how leftover mock Mike Pence when he says that he has to prey on things in order to make a decision but when John cases mouthing left his platitudes and the name of God that is totally fine there's John Kades suggesting that God doesn't want us imposing the Caribbean\nAnd let's stop putting up walls around ourselves and not understanding the plight the trouble and the problems of others it is not right and the war doesn't want it and are peaceful atmosphere\nHearts wants to reach out to others look at what they do in these storms they go in a real people they don't know they put them in their homes they feed them that's America models is garbage in this division and yelling and screaming and hatred on all sides\nOkay well it is also true that why does America is maintaining a border so there's that as well but even John ... the guy who's going to bring us all together can't stop themselves from using this sort of overheated rhetoric\nIt at the ... okay so meanwhile speaking of overheated rhetoric Megan Kelly is going to be out at NBC", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "29"}
