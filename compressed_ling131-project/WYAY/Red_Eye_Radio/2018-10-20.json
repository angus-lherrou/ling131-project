an altercation during a roundtable event in Arizona President Trump was asked how his administration will address the situation\nThey've been a great ally in the middle east oh we need them as a counterbalance to Iran and says that's the simplest solutions censorship lists situation to be a\nOf course it helps in all of us have the media on your side perpetuating these faucets I recognize that that's huge and one of the other callers pointed that out mark you can't leave out the medium\nSo those on our side are often on the defensive even though they are explaining the ... by the way one of the other things I mentioned last night\nThe left is very good at slogans right so hoping change right Obama had open change how could you argue with hope and change you have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second\nOr you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know where you're happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change or how about a change you know the ticket when your car not every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're explaining the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why mentioning because it's happening now but I'll get that in a minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages never mind that this was started under the bonus ration\nPresident Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but you're hardly ever heard of the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue\nNo one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes this is so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again\nThere's a simple right how can you you know you're ripping away from the parents how can you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like what is it coming here legally means why that's not acceptable\nBut the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they will lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there and that you would\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal\nAnd they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one\nThat's a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these Honduras or Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen to very shortly whenever they get here\nYou never get to stay with your kid who hid you can use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and put our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and I was just in case the latest reincarnation of this conflict is is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crime children and distraught mother you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obviously too it seems to me to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our\nOpen border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to know or ... well you can't if they come here and Russian or even five matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nThe Democrats want more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of a better name they want cheap labor so you have a newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and I would talk about immigration in the title\nAnd then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and some are in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been great for America over the years how could you you were in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane\nBut they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than like knowledge ring that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nAll Lawson politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption\nMost illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us paying for and by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they don't need\nTo who these people don't vote for it's not that hard to figure out and if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border\nNot to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but it has to undergo long waits on and says some paperwork to even have a hope of getting here so they have to follow the rules but those who dashed across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one caller this week and if you didn't hear him suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run while we tried to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIf to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like hates finally use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera because I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise in lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by illegal immigrants that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage isn't that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas for murdering Israel's Israelis is working to shore room\nLogic these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say but I Know we have to go to break surely let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more eight six six Ninety red eye and that's the same as eight six six nine seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended were sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through ratings schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you see in the first CEO to jail for hiring an illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun they actually had a right to use the wrong language ... there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take them back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there were no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with\nHim because they be things the right reasons\nThe mega millions

[noise]\nYeah it's more casual back with you again I should say yes nothing yeah\nA retreat eight six six Ninety red\nEye that's each six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine getting your take\nOn illegal immigration and by the way I don't blame the illegal immigrants you may not have thought about this before I put myself in their place what would I Do if I was living in a country where there was little hope little opportunity and tyrannical government let alone violence like you know solve door\nOr the drug cartels in Mexico\nI don't blame them and I did television show years ago at a TV show and I have people from all over on the opposite side of me saying yeah we agreed that the government they'd given a signal to come on over\nA or mixed messages or it's not clear I don't blame them for trying to seek a better life\nAnd I blame us and the government and this idea comprehend the George W. Bush did the same thing as the wall to Wall Street journal\nOr would you know talk about immigration how great immigration has no no one's arguing that people are ancestors are relatives came and landed at Ellis Island and they share our values and and what they wanted to make a difference and they wanted to get freedom but it was\nLegal immigration and by the way if you had a bad disease my knowledge is they didn't let you in\nThat's coming here legal that's a huge difference\nSo don't don't call me in Iowa list every country has a right to have borders are much you believe in open borders one world and you know good luck it could be Venezuelan a large scale or Cuba\nNo let me know what you're thinking let's go I said I'd go to your calls and let's go to Steve and I'm In a whole Virginia Steve you're on with mark\nHey yeah I Love it or something that I Want to ... you know well why don't we\n... or ... or ... and with all the aid of\nA though the money but we go to the amount of um but we don't do it anyway\nSo why I like your idea about the way it's an interesting idea why do you use the phrase and document\nWell at that point it does get a call at whatever you want it all up illegal what that's what I think lately but if you want to call it ... you get ill or any I'm not only that when we say about it or whatever or look of\nA plane whatever we do that as well and or any children go to a great way for you know I mean there are\n... in some ways you're harder than me but it it yeah I Know that I'm Out on the amount of\nThat's assuming you're giving it to every one of those countries which is the case for the most part of our writing on\nState aid or stolen but oh well mania quite true you know I'd say we don't give\nYou you don't mean in the United states you mean in this hemisphere\nOut of the world I mean the world go we ate\nYeah well we don't give a to the Soviet Union I mean you might say on now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we get paid like the China you might say we give them aid because they take an unfair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have a ... there were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is a good one which is we ought to charge of the countries um for their illegals coming here I I I kind of like that idea\nEven though oh\nNo no it's a it's an idea\nOr a monitor their own people at that point\nYeah and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right thoughts and those that sentence the poor and his ... not our problem right and there's your problem\nAnd it's ... and then you can also add on to the health care bill of health care bill I'm sure it will go on forever\nBut basically it will stop at work and stuff but you know let me but\nUh yeah there's nothing like the right and center and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive to come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get the drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nWho seven seven zero nine three

Michigan hey you're on with mark\nHow're you doing mark [noise] um I just wanted to say that um maybe these um immigrants that are coming over to the u._s. um might want to be a little bit smarter and think about other places to possibly go that may be easier to get into\n'em if they have farming skills I mean South Africa or they're kicking people out of there and taking their farm so\nAh maybe put together a band of you and some of your ah guys that are I think you have the\nThe Gulf to go over there may be protect some of those people get paid some money or or use your farming skills and go over and help out South Africa because uh they're digging themselves into over right now so\nI hear your sarcasm delusion seizures and it's yeah I I Do hear by the way you bring up a new story I don't know if it a lot of people know about South Africa's expert breeding the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggling and a lot of them are going to resist right with the force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nWe well it was you know when it takes me call when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but likely did South African you've gotta be careful what you get I ... and all this talk of makes me think Egypt right we we helped them over throw a\nWhat's his name ... and I asked of the time I was doing national radio and I said wait a second that what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten there for a second I'm\n... now Brian was helping and not their spring it was some something with spring but anyway uh the fact is we got where she got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you got the Brotherhood Muslim Brotherhood which was to radical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over but an air we were saying maybe it was the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think that um producer Brian so you know I'm mentioning\nThe fact is that you you can't just do the spine when we did that in South Africa right you overthrow what you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney right open the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask goes next are you happy looking\nAnd seeing what you've gotten ... instead of the shah I ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that you might say Russia or China but certainly the biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens\nSo it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm taking a ... in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that\nWhat is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right\n... ... you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with somebody now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion needed stone assassinate people like that and go inside chop them up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business\nBut the other side of President Trump's got a huge problem now is they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israel in trying to do work against Iran because Iran's their threat to\nThis world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we worked with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work with the Soviet Union during World War two because we had a bigger enemy and Hitler\nSo a lot of left is liberal say well you work with these people what how do you respond to lead well life is not easy you're faced with difficult choices and you got to figure out what makes the most sense\nThis stuff is not easy\nAnd that the same thing with illegal immigrants coming in right now it's not it's a tough challenge let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine I'm

guys crazy loon Tucker Carlson phrase rooms not that bad right\nA sleazy porn lawyer bought a let me know what you think Andy in New York City you're on with mark Hi Andy\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call [noise]\n[noise] um I just was interested in why there's such a big um such big talk about Saudi Arabia and what they did [noise]\nUm you know what they did was terrible but you know ... you know even if though to do something small that's all right but it's such a big they're making such a big uproar about it I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally we get involved in things abroad when it when it's in our interest you know when when we can prevent you know bigger a human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is defense\nBut in this case I mean he wasn't a US citizen I'm here to green card\nUm you know if they did it ... it is and our best interest to just you know the big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know they they help us out why um what's the big ... you know they've\nDone things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months to get to make them pay ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know\nIt is not your regular guys like I'm a stay you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about it\nLook into that it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east and write the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBut I got to tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to save and great about him because he was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know the their their enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt\nSo I'm not a big fan of what he believes in in that sense but to go when someone or be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have a special status when a country has an embassy in another country that if they're in their territory their land you lord in there and and then you chop them up and\nYou assassinate him and I it just so revolting to people I I think that's what was going on and you're right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to find Iran\nSo it's a very difficult situation for President Trump but just thought I I must have been taught to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with him probably many as\n... yeah but that's you know agree with him but ... getting getting killed like that is horrible phone\nYeah I mean so ... yeah ...\n... even though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want a large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and\nAnd sanctioning I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's it is a horrible incident but for this alone I don't think you know I'm In the bigger picture you know ... ...\nYeah well I cringe when you said cutting off\nBusiness I Know that's bad in this in this story but um you're right we we need them we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump is isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who's terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey yeah I'm never going there again while in this guys and the princes in power\nAnd this and the Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know as as crazy as it sounds you have to have some civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out food and even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was was so outrageous to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but uh I I follow this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved the mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not seeing Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved\nBut you know there's there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way out ... was so outrageous by a Obama a because he was becoming our friend\nA difficult yeah so you you get it and it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff do the right one although I have to different countries and assassinating them go ahead\nI ... I but I Do feel I mean my my impression is is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the ex spy on I'm sure you know it's probably known you know in Washington is probably like you know\nKnown that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure Putin takes out you know yes people going down his political opponents you know here and there\nIt's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon\nYou know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became like ... it's a very public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there\nAnd it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and he said you know if I don't come out and you know here's what you do and and he just disappeared and they made it worse no we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up and they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that it was\nA wad of interrogation that a guy got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little trays are well yeah though they'll show they're pretty\nSure they're pretty ... [laughter]\nIf you ... yeah this wasn't a by the way I was mentioned my produced last night this wasn't a job interview that he was going in for that that would that would be a job interview that went badly you know the incredible hulk I think people\nEven on our side are reacting viscerally and I I don't blame him because I felt the same way you can drop 'em up and when they brought didn't they bring suitcases it's reported it and you know how to do things body on the I mean so I don't want to be gross that way on the air but I I think all of that stuff you may be right just the fact that we knew about there's always espionage there's always dirty stuff going on\nBut this one way played out was not good\nYeah\nThank you Andy I appreciate your call very much by the way\nHow old are you I'm a twenty two\nI thought you sound young who is your choice on the Democrats' side who would you like to see run against president ...\nI'll tell you what for the fun of it I Would love for Pocahontas throw on I think I think that would just be you know those are just be a lot of fun to watch [noise]\nThey evidently have underestimated the level of outrage at the world now feel\nRepresentative Jerry Connelly believe Congress will take punitive measures against the Saudi Arabia with arms sales sanctions and financial sanctions as well all possibilities I bought next\nThursday Night Football\nThought prime time on in a film F word\nGame player [noise]\nWhen it's on it's all\nSort of the NFL Network boxes from the subject\nBut here's the story of whom he wants to play for parents love of the game to them and going\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nThe trumpet but\nWas never that good at going but he also learned\nHow to give them a lot of money on our interests which is your story has a happy ending after all\nHello Shelley De\nMe that we all need\nWhen you're working in your feet together when even\nBoroughs right now yeah a little bit hang out my browser forty I knew when you get together and\nWe uh maybe have some beer shoot shovel\nOr ...\nI wouldn't be awkward in Ocala, Florida there's a Florida agricultural science teacher around to\nAnd a possum in front of his and he will face criminal charges because investigators say the killing torn are inhumane watch so she ended up playing in the finals for the U.S open championship a Chinese woman has never won\nOr jak and Asian woman should everyone have Haitian abject well there you are\nProfit land and there are impressive leaders and organization making a positive impact\nThe good work show is our effort that goodwill in North Georgia to highlight the good\nThat make the Atlanta work every Saturday at noon will bring you this story the leaders nonprofit and people making a difference if you know the area and leader or organization you want to be on the show emailing at good work at G.

sanctuary state which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to them I Know some of them have actually\nVoted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any load about sanctuary city that here\nAnd you know the ones you know it wasn't so they were on it it's just that does the Democrats in office a very liberal extremely leftist a Democrat as an office and he just he said that's a good idea does and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump now partly what it is\nI was there a few months ago and a ... it was amazing to when I was walking the streets with my kid is someone yelled at us now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another time something ... someone says something about a night that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over service\nPatients I think they said market street and of course the problem with the trash and the and the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh but I think uh I I miss San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah it's\nIt's it's it's the only thing we voted on and I like to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is to fellow I spoke with first but but you have you heard the thing about the the um um birth tourism\nHere it was on our throats and this just\nMentioned this to a few people and they had not heard of it and it actually was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty or dateline or one of those where they fly on the east of Chinese women that are pregnant and they may have a place all set up and they go there and they have a baby and get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your in laws source of of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby and then\nThey're they have all the rights and wrongs of course is wrong and an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that you either keep politicians here\nAnd they well I mean there are people that work for them and they had heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to say it on on national radio so people can know what's going on\nIt's we're very close to the border here so it's I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I came down from I mean they have them and I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world do that\nNot just somebody had a major in Italy I said to the baby out deals citizenship and they said no he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why we're handing out citizenship like if I can do it you know it's it's if the parent is\nThere actually yeah glad\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a ... with the with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of in any way but of course if you pass a law\nEvery every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was at one time a solution every problem was the one time\nA solution to something else so you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing\nWhen I Lived in say in Asia and I get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby yeah of course that could go wrong if the baby's late I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah getting runners mark\nYes

President Trump he looted to the cost of such a move during a roundtable event at Luke air force base\nYeah I'm I was kind of I'm\nStruck me as kind of finished or some of the stuff that was being said I don't know a week or so ago Hillary Clinton saying we can't be a civil until we have power and uh it it seems like they have no concept\nOf a loyal opposition to like the British Commonwealth school and um it's the idea if you're ... you're disloyal and and that's just not good I mean that that it's going boldly in a bad direction it's like they want to be a peace they expect to be a peace them when they're\n... they're gearing towards you know they'd be very comfortable with one party rule if it's their party and and\nThat goes back off it it it was sinister\nYou you said the disloyal it and they don't think we're disloyal they think we're evil it's worse than that they think if you don't agree with them you're evil look a judge Kavanaugh a guy was there ever made I mean there was not even any proof it doesn't matter they by the way that never came up they were looking for anything they could find their against them before they knew who he was\nSo you're you're too nice civility from these guys are evil and they they want to get rid of us and they would do almost anything to get rid of us and the hatred for Trump oh my God do they hate that guy I thought I thought it was bad with George W now they this guy worse\nIt'll it'll to Seventy Nineteen\nTwenty it almost seems like the Nineteen twenties in the Nineteen thirties being replayed doesn't it\nI I go back to the

didn't want to hear that did I ruin your night [laughter] no\nNo it's not that I I I was just kind of stunned you know that there are I'm sixty seven I kinda\nI kinda remember that time and it was just a it seemed like um\nIt seemed like being lost without a map or accomplish it uh\nUh it was it was crazy making and ... and this idea of 'em were idealistic and Warsaw morally superior it's really bad stuff is when people think that they do some pretty awful stuff that you wrote history even you know\nWell did you see Rand Paul ... says he's worried someone is going to get murder or in our homes happened was the least last year and a yeah he's right\nYeah I mean he he he is a a um I I heard a lot I heard a joke that wasn't very funny about that you know I mean they're not about the skull east thing but uh uh murdering politicians wholesale and it was a joke and I thought it's happened you know I mean that's a ... or\nSomebody opens fire on a people at the ballpark and uh\nIt just uh uh it it's like it it it it's like a little spark and cause a big plane are or were at that point right now it seems like in that uh there are\nThere is no good will I mean it uh uh\nWell are you here last night it was a lot less than it should be huh\nDid you hear me last night when I said who do you think should be the Democratic nominee and then has evolved into who could you have a cup of coffee with and even people on our side had a lot of trouble saying they could sit down with people they disagreed with him that was going to be one of my themes tonight\nUm what are you what if people say to what happens with your family when they see her on the Republican or conservative side people lost families um\nIt's it's gotten bad and then another call previously said to me what do you think if the Republicans keep the house and increased their numbers in the Senate and they have the presidency what's the reaction going to be I worry about the reaction they can't handle it now their hope is that they're going to turn things around in November\nAnd if they don't look out I see riots in the street I mean not a you know I'm no expert on this\nBut there's no look I'll ... I'll tell you a quick story I'm Out walking around my house and my kids' friends um best friends or one of her best friend's father\nI thought it was just going to say let him he runs after me I'm taking my walk\nAnd he says I saw you on radio and you you guys are crazy and Eve I felt the kind of going to hit me one point I'm just trying to do my walk and he'd never done this before but at the anger was so strong\nAh yeah I Know you're you know what you you and the Fox and the rest of those people thinking on their you know you're a radio guy and all of his ... he was so angry me yet we ... civil discussions you know at the end of the parties that he put on his house or whatever and the kids were best friends you know it was amazing it was I I really thought he was going to get violent\nIt it's it's gotten really bad so I I don't look forward to they'll send you saying asking them to be civil I we've pass those days we've really pass it was a\nPretty pretty discouraging and we I'll speak for myself I Know people who think like I live on my side we think they're misguided that they got the wrong ideas and they think revival one of the other things I threw out\nWas they have such hatred for President Trump they have no idea that a lot of us hated President Obama the same way but there was no resistance we just waited patiently until his term was up I wanted him to be on the first time I thought he was a disaster maybe the worst president in our history\nWhile we wait until it happened yeah we did everything politically we could\nAnd they picked on us 'cause ... a senator\nMcConnell said Mitch McConnell said you know we want to do when we can to get rid of my forget how we phrased it that's about the most we saying but these guys this whole are saying you know I don't agree with Michelle Obama when they go low we we kick 'em or whatever they he said I Can't remember the other on your rights saying we're not going to be civil until we get back in power\nWell that makes sense in her case because you can never take not being in power right there for sale anyway ... fun this this is not good\nA man there is okay I have a gym you live in Portland I'm just looking at it again your mayor doesn't even want to police to do anything right\n... yeah I I recall that real close but that's my understanding it or or if he would uh I I thought I heard one anecdote most of my news I I don't read the newspaper so much I get it on the radio and word of mouth and it's like a he thought the uh the uh ...\nRecording antifa one word of mouth straight they were the victims a lot a lot of people are trying to do their daily lives you know I'm thinking what wouldn't hit you know I mean it uh it it's appalling I you know frankly I'm a little ashamed of I'm not having the guts\nTo uh uh you know a ... not having the guts to ah ah have everybody obey the same laws\nNo ... ... years such a nice guy didn't want to disagree but it's not a matter of cuts that's what he believes is a leftist he believes are probably supports ... you know that's it's not because he doesn't have curves that's who he is probably probably supports them and it's worse than you think it's worse than do you think\nYou know he campaigned on the different uh you know what the different personality or different persona that the it's like what we got is what we're calling us you\nKnow that's always the case I said the left doesn't want to admit that they want to impeach the president is going to be chaos in this country if they'd retake the house they don't want to tell you when it's time to raise taxes that they want to raise taxes I rushed it but Michael Dukakis if you remember\nHis campaign was destroyed when he announced that he was in favor higher tax actually I think it was ... he had a problem with that tank but Mondale announced against Reagan that he's for higher taxes the kiss of death but this I don't want to do that they're learning their lesson\nYou

I'm listening to your um commentary or your new show um I guess the point of minute is that these\nThree thousand or what I remember coming up from um under since so long to Guatemala through Mexico have already given up their right to asylum because they're in and and the country's ... out of their\nUm desperate situation as far as yeah it might it it it becomes an economic situation at that point but if they want to seek asylum they should be seeking it in in Mexico and then go into our embassy\nTo get proper immigration to the United states\nYeah but you know and I know that Mexico's not going to give them anything\nThat's that's a relevant\nIt's all relative to the fact that they're in that country and they the proper way for them to immigrate to the United states would be good we are Missy and apply for immigration ban but they're another country wants to enter that other country and they're out of their situation\nThey are no longer asylum seekers\nIf they wish to seek
