Canada have reportedly reached a deal on NAFTA sewer Crawford reports through\nWeeks of intense work the two countries settle on a framework to update the north American free trade agreement that includes according to Reuters\nGiving us farmers more access to candidates dairy mortgage and shooting candidate from possible us auto tariffs America's second largest trading partner wasn't excluded when the U.S and Mexico reach the preliminary deal in August to revamp NAFTA\nAnd the Trump Administration had given candidate until midnight or need to sign on or facing schools you're from the pack in the past President Trump is railed against the tree deal blame game for the loss of American manufacturing jobs we have the worst trade deals ever made in history here Crawford Washington\nBefore the terrorist moved in and as a support as we are even over six thousand so you you do things like that you set parameters that mean nothing look we said this long time ago [noise] or the president will be out all week promoting the fact that he got it done he got the free trade deal done\nThat he got exactly what he want want it or we will see when it comes to fruition mhm but as we have said with most free trade agreements\nRemember it wasn't that the president said he would get a free trade agreement done what he said was he will get a free trade agreement\nThat will get rid of the trade deficit yes now I Know the president will be out and he will be selling his ear respectable what is in the free trade agreement\nAnd the people to love the president will say he did exactly what he said he was going to do I'm fine with that as long as he heads in reality he doesn't do what he initially said he was going to do\nWell you know\nI'm just fine with everything if they'll just get behind us you know the the the moving of well we'll do this much more of a here\nAnd and this much less over here it really isn't because there's there's been no promise the only thing I've seen in terms of the measurement of the dairy agreement\nIs that it will mirror that of the the agreement that Canada just reached with Europe and other other countries other parts of the world so I have no idea what that means for the U.S\nI don't know how to quantify that and it it again [laughter] there was no um target right there was nothing\nWhere they said look we must get this much increase right or the dairy farmers of of the U.S you know we're this is what we're working on this is who were working on behalf so I don't there was never this this I guess\nLine or or goal for them to reach the administration in fact just a few days ago they were saying yeah we're way too far apart to be reaching a deal before the deadline and ... and here we are a few days later\nSo we have no idea what it means and how much of an increase for those dairy farmers in terms of being able to sell the camp Canada that is\nYou know what I didn't hear mentioned it all ... and ... article but right now it's early on and maybe in the maybe tomorrow nothing on the soft amber\nNo I didn't see anything on that in fact the only two items I did see the dairy and automobiles that ... that's the way I guess my ... and by the way when we say win\nOr lose we're not talking about win or lose by our standards because women lewd by our standards with trading with Canada should be free trade across the board no tariffs no limits or anything if Canada puts tariffs on that's wrong if the United states put tariffs on\nA you know uh uh the batters wrong but is that where we made the compromise unsolved timber and that's why you didn't hear the administration come out\nAnd talked about you know the the soft timber\nThan we upset okay when it remember they were going after the soft timber industry claiming that the government subsidizes it in Canada right uh and with the duties and whatever put on soft timber\nAs we know a construction in the United states will become has and will become more expensive\nWhich will hurt the bottom line of the GDP\nSo I you know look there's a there's a ton of things here and you just mentioned something that just a couple of days ago we're way far off we're not going to have a deal well the president knew that he had to have Canada in the dealer was a no go when Congress was going to go anywhere right\nSo he was under that he was under that pressure to come up with some kind of deal otherwise it wouldn't go through and he had to get it done now because they want it done before December first when the Mexican president does out right so we're right at that sixty day deadline it's got to be done now\nSo there was pressure on the administration did the administration crumble on parts that they wanted I guess we shall see it was interesting that ah run a couple of articles in the last couple of weeks from Canada\nWhere they said you know what the Canadian government decided to do we're just not going to respond to Trump on anything ... he can sit there and script just be quiet say nothing don't give them a target back don't say anything and so if you if you think the Canadians have been quiet lately because of it\nThat was their whole purpose let's just be quiet but Canada knew that they they look they understood candidates stood that look one of the things that we have against the United states in this deal is Trump has to get it done he's got to get it done by a certain time period\nOtherwise you know the Congress is not going to pass a trade deal that separate from Mexico and therefore that's the pressure they have in the administration\nI guess we shall see well yeah it it here's what I don't fear right now I don't fear any um\nAny promotion of of a massive I guess concession by Canada by the administration you\nKnow because the dairies tiny ... and that's that's the whole thing is that the movement if there were big movement here we we know about it already that would be in the media that would be the story that Trump planes\nThe following\nSo\nAgain how much of a victory as it did it do anything to change anything and if we haven't gotten the steel and aluminum tariffs done then what does that look like\nBecause that that right now if you look at it what is really impact the economy so far it's been it's been that just the threat of those when they started talking about those tariffs\nSo let me ask you this is it are we at a point where both Mexico and Canada because we talked about how not a lot of details have come out about Mexico right so we just to the point where they said look we both got to say we have an agreement to start the clock ticking for the next sixty days\nRight\nWe've come to terms and will work out the details later and we push off the deadline for now\nThan we have a lot of stuff to talk about including that a cabin on the FBI investigation or how the goalposts have been moved remember last week I said that they moved the goalpost\nAre basically from a a a you know a a an American ... American football the Canadian football now I think the goalposts moved at the soccer field now it's that even that ... that much longer now\n... keep moving with the Democrats will get to that plus your calls and comments we had a great show ahead if you'd like to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety red eye\nBooks with what I told him that he ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nThe drivers knee jerk service pilot flying J truck here has got to eat in the yard service centers and twenty four seven roadside assistance you want it and we got\nEveryone eventually sees a when trucks carrying side grocery store shelves\nGoods to help the community\nProducts they keep the business running\nWhat they don't see is what the trunk or ...\nYou're driving your history\nWhat we do we see you know\nWe see you carry a career that help support families communities\nWe see you carry the title of friend and neighbor parenting provider we see you carry the sacrifice and the ... of a job\nEach was a determination to get the job done\nWhen you carry inside is more valuable than an\nBecause it's what's inside [noise]\nDid you know that studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lacked the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are off and unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fun dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need learn how as the African help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on the sink Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help too that's\nTruckers fund dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nYou feel helpless and withdrawn from work or your family do you feel as if you're a burden to everyone around you\nThere's just no reason to live a fees are your thoughts we want you to know there is help understanding the warning signs of suicide and knowing there are resources available to you could save your life suicide is preventable and save can help\nATF has taken the lead of the sophistication but we along with the FBI as well as the county agencies or may not seem to assist with processing the scene and any follow up investigation anyone with information about the answer to urge to contact\nEight eight eight ATS bomb educate paid eight ATF B.

again at the end of the day and the third Thursday evening after the testimony by Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nThe word coming out of those meetings is that mentioned was a yes\nA\nFlake in fact announced that he was going to vote yes all of a sudden he gets cornered in an elevator\nThis is the difference between\nUm a well this is exactly what ... what really got us here was the idea of putting all of this on television and the first place because now the left feels empowered\nTo be able to change the landscape by screaming by shouting at you and they will be thanks to Jeff Flake\nThey they believe they can win they in fact one of those shouting at him and that elevator was all over social media on friday this is why we'd go direct\nGoing direct means getting in your

then he kept asking the question but surely but surely but should he and he ended it by saying this and this is ... this is not a quote from somebody else\nThis is Eric writing at least on line that I

was eliminated\nWas the nation is deeply divided sometimes it feels like we don't agree on anything but credibly accused sex offenders should not oh shoot basketball girls\nOr boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that that was eliminated when USA Today took down the one story deleted the tweet and put out a new story not in the regular sports section but in the opinionated sports section\nDoesn't matter whether you asked the question\nIt's a hit piece what you're trying to portray is that you suspect him as a pedophile\nAnd\nIt got me a little bit because I'd rather it for Thirty years I like I said no one when I was a teenager\n\nAnd I and I look at this and and I over the last you know year or so I Will admit that I could see in some of his personal post\nYou know you could you could tell he didn't like Trump but that's okay I mean come on I got friends who do that I'd Facebook friends who do that all the time we never ever got into a political conversation ever on Facebook right\nAh but I did see that you could tell that the you know that that it was in there it was in there somewhere but that's that's fine because people have their political opinions and I'm fine with that we've all got our family members and friends that disagree with some politics all the time\nAgain I haven't seen era what since we were teenagers so I I you know I don't know but like I said\nUm\nI always thought that he wrote with class this is completely classless article\nA it's a hit job it's unwarranted\nA it is not up at all\nTo the sport journalistic standards\nThat I knew from Arab Brady when he started writing as a local writer and then went with USA Today probably for the first you know for for the last you know Thirty years this was just an absolute hippies and\nAnd what gets me angry about this Eric you know you and I've done talk radio for a long long time and sometimes we may get a little bit of overheated whatever but\nWe never really got to we've never really gotten ourselves in any trouble where we've had to apologize for anything that we've set on the air you know we're management comes in you must apologized because the sponsors are all Bailey and that's because number one we don't think I you and I don't think in a kind of radical ways to begin with\nWe're not hateful people we don't hate anybody\nBut I've always said if somebody says on the radio and loses that for a little bit to me that's a little bit more understanding even if you tweet it out and it's just a sentence but white here what he did\nHe wrote an article this was absolutely premeditated it was a premeditated hit job apparently because of the range that he feels of anything that's relating to Trump\nWell and this is you know indicative of the ... the entitled to get on the left this is just one more in a long line of people that are now just throwing everything at the cabinet nominations because they have room to do\nAnd you know how you know he's wrong and now he knows he's wrong\nBecause the editors or somebody got involved and said this goes to the opinion section you got to take out these sentences because these aren't fact based at all because he called it a credible accusation ... that's a political statement that is not a statement of fat\nLow\nAnd the the the fact that the u._s._a. today how to delete the tweet oh and then he deleted his Facebook page completely he deleted for a reason\nBecause he knew the blowback that was coming why because what he wrote was an absolute it piece on a man where there is zero evidence except for the allegation that he's ever done anything wrong well again\nThey you know for them now the claim is reality\n\nAnd so this goes to not just a hippies but a hit piece on his family\n\nNot he's not capable of making unbiased decisions not\nWe're against him because he might overturn roe v Wade\nNot anything else\nIt was a hit job directed toward his children\nIt involves the activities of his children mhm imagine had somebody done this\nWith Brock Obama and his daughter oh that person would be unemployed by now that person would be done if they were especially if they were working for a major news organization like USA Today\nThat ... that would have been over\n\nAnd and but this is what the left sees as a win this is what they see is acceptable tactics and it will continue now thanks to Jeff and it's not acceptable and Eric knows writer Erik\n... doesn't care if I make sure Eric breeding knows it just so somebody says to him to the conversation they don't think I'm referring to you [laughter]\nAnd they don't care they don't care so that it's unacceptable because it's acceptable to them because anything to stop Trump and anything to stop this nomination process\n\nJust reprehensible what he did in USA Today than that and they wonder and then the gas that Kavanaugh was passionately defending himself yeah\nExactly\nYeah you're a bunch of hypocrites you

knows how long it will take them\nI mean it may not be Thursday night they could go back Wednesday or Tuesday and say we're done we've interviewed everybody\nSure\nWe we asked we because they're going to interview everybody who is a part of this particular process and they'll probably ask those people is there anybody else we should talk to mhm but once I talk to those people it's done\nWhere else

I cannot see the Republicans delaying it any further\nNo I don't know that do have the votes um if it comes back early\nAh I'm I'm I suspect that uh that you will have further scrutiny you know and

interview and anybody who's come forward\nThat will likely by the way that that part of it will likely that claim will likely take the longest\nThat likely is more involved because the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr Ford testimony is a matter of record and there's only so far I think with Dr Ford's case\nThere's only so far you can go and it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the ...\nWeb but I mean politically if they get ... and you know and they get her you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding it

intended\nBut the implication is that it's not going to be enough and they've already right all that into the argue all but it was narrow in scope because it's an investigation of the allegations

I think it was news busters that has the story on the show boilers on HBO\nUm\nI think the rock is in that I think he plays an agent or something but they were talking about the whole Kaepernick thing and the people who objected to capture Nick kneeling and everything else and they use some of course it's HBO so they use some language blank them\nAnd uh\nIn the in the dialogue and I thought to myself why is that\nThe story even for news busters I mean I Know news busters typically they're promoting the or they're reporting on the media yes you know if it were CNN saying that or ESPN which I'm\nSure they have well blank them it was a ... blank to people that are buying so the people who objected to come away\nOkay All right I ... what Eric I I've said this before though when every\nSingle person when they say you're not watching ... ... why not explained to them why mhm they go\nOh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that\nEvery single person that I talked and there's probably fifty over the last that you know it's been over a year they said well I think it's a free speech issue well actually it isn't a free speech you know what they did ... because of you know here's what it's about and here's what I object to when I\nTell them they go get it okay I ... I didn't know that I didn't know that I didn't know that\nWe live in an ignorant nation let's be honest the majority of people on the majority of topics are completely ignorant not our audience well they make a choice a majority are yeah they they make a choice to stay out of it and then jumped right in the middle of it right up knowing they don't know they don't even know what's going on and we talked about this on economic issues\nWe talked about it when it comes to understanding how government works the vast majority of people and we're talking over two thirds of people can't tell you\nThe three branches of government they have no idea they don't even know why we live in our society and why we talked about it and why we talk about American exceptionalism they have no idea why as I said before I understand why these people come out now and say America is an exceptional have no idea how it works ... ... ...\n\nBut I heard somebody else say they don't like it so they don't like it either\nBut yes that's where we live right now it's on it's unfortunate that in\nThe day in age and think about it I just I go back to when I was in high school and college and how you had to search for information remember going to go you want to have a question you'd go to the library it it could take you\nIf I I you know I really need to find out about this let me go to the library okay I have to get in the car drive to the library ...\nYeah you were ... limited right fine the find the right book there's the book open the book go in that's not the right book go to a different above you got ten books in front of you just to find out one thing I mean\nLook at the difference in the way the media runs everybody complains well the media controls everything actually they don't these days imagined back in the day that you went to a newspaper stand right or one of the machines All right so you had a newspaper machine and you put your quarter in and you\nGrab the only one only one grab the only one because you don't grab to matter how many coupons you need\nAnd imagine at that next to that same newspaper machine were Fifteen to twenty two hundred other machines fact checking what was in that MORNING EDITION of that\nNewspaper that's what you have today yeah you can\nThe Washington Post can come out and they can put their story out or CNN well and and and that's the thing we've talked to on people say well the media controls\nGo whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa one thing we we tend to you with age as we know how it used to be back then ... and not only are there more news sources out there\nBut you just brought it up ... not not only they're more news sources out there but you have to realize that heart access to information to find out exactly what's going on is greater than it's ever been before we were growing up and they can say whatever they want and if\nYou wanted to research it it would take serious time to do the research to actually know what was going on yet might we say that people were actually more informed back\nThen they are today well because they did the basics first they actually learned and paid attention to and knew the basic ideas

Jake Tapper asking the panel yeah uh that at you know the saying row the it's clear now that the Democrats somebody or in that party\nLeaked right and there and and the response was so what\nRight and\nAnd so you you know they did it and so Lindsey Graham being on the Judiciary Committee mean to then that's an fury aiding because\nIt's something that I Know Lindsey Graham has never done ... and there's a certain protocol that you're supposed to do understanding what's your role as the senator is\nLindsey Graham may be at times are hard of what\nWas used to be ... they called the swamp ... but as we know the swamp as involved in Washington DC uh especially when Republicans look at it are Trump supporters look at it or even Trump looks at you know what the swamp is\nAnd\nThat's I think what are the other reasons that Lindsey Graham was just so infuriated ... and why he led off at that at that point\nIs that you know you you think about it remember first it was an immediate knowing he should be disqualified he's not qualified for this whatsoever secondly they head to an allegation and then ... Greenleaf serious allegation\nFrom the Senate Judiciary committee she got word of it she's the ranking member mhm\nShe's supposed to bring it to the Senate Judiciary committee or tell the woman look or I can bring the says to the district committee but your name's events you going to become known we keep it secret for a while but I Need to bring it to the ... committee and then we'll have the FBI do it we can keep your name out of it until then but at some point if you wish to continue\nThen\nYou know we can keep it anonymous in the in the FBI in Korea but after that if you wish to continue than your name will become well known she didn't do that you know\nAnd\nSo everything along the line of [laughter] who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector or the the suggestion of a law firm everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak her name\nAnd\nYou know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her and that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind ... as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that\nNow when I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left\nRemember he was doing the whole ... thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be or the politics has gotten so ugly\nBut on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically a nasty administration request demand really but he was not going to vote on the floor\nHe would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling him out still because they if they believe in this coup by approach it has never about working with the other side\nWould you prefer to read wrote king on your smartphone will scroll down version is also available at Rhodes ... dot com simply click on view digital version or current issue\nTo listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected headset or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker icon for any story and voila just start listening wrote teen dot com\nHey drivers this is Gary earn a long road volume on and now lonesome road volume two is just out and we would love to send your copy give us a call what six one eight three eight three twenty on old seven log on to our website owns a road dot org mentioned that you heard this ad\nOn red eye radio and we'll send you a copy of buy into for only ten bucks and if you didn't get one we'll give you a special deal if you order a volume one and two years ago\nThis is the financial advice you been getting sound like this uh this is mark ... principle of the group here in Atlanta and hosted the financial symphony and the lead report when we're talking finance as we know it's important to communicate in a language you can easily understand straight\nQuestions deserves straight answer the call the ... group right now and you receive the complimentary financial consultation in one of our many offices in the area\nSeven seven zero nine three to zero three and seven seven seven zero nine three to zero three aids testing testing one two thing on\nAre you an over the real classy CDL driver looking to make a change in twenty team now it's time to recharge your driving career with the ... systems offering fifty cents per mile for ... physicians hold weekly\nWhat we can vacation after Ninety Days in a six thousand three hundred dollar sign on bonus joins even more today\nBy a mine have been only logistics dot com or golly five five the number four or five five the number for me in both parties\nThat land and there are infected leaders and organization making a positive impact\nIt didn't work show with our effort that goodwill in North Georgia is a highlight the good\nThat make the Atlanta work every Saturday afternoon we'll bring you this story the leaders nonprofit\nAnd people making a difference\nIf you know than area leader or organization you want to be on the shell email and that didn't work at G.

president the president of Mexico leaves where they believe that would be no chance after that and the other point was they had to get Canada aboard because there was no chance it was going to pass if it was only between Mexico and the United states so there was pressure on both sides um\nUh Canada's been very quiet and was reading a few articles in the Canadian media over the last couple of weeks that was stating that was on purpose they said Trump can rail all he wants we're not going to say anything anymore we're done\nWe'll negotiate where we need to negotiate but we're not going to get in the back and forth with them because they believed that fuels it ... it feels his passion and then support for what he is doing in the state so they said if he's just screaming and we're not responding\nIt brings all the rhetoric down and they said Jared Kushner was the one who helped the deal really you know get through on on a ... what the actual deal is we don't know but we don't see any major changes are in the free trade deals steel and aluminum or not included don't know why\nOn that one\nYeah and and nothing is done until it's done and the signed agreement\nWill be the agreement or yeah because it would they haven't even worked out everything you just are a lot like Mexico and I and I do think that one of the things is they they said look we got we have to announce in we have to announce that we've come to an agreement to get the clock ticking on this and we can work things out over the next couple of months\nAgo right but that\nTakes it off the political table and gets behind the the number\nOne one of the problems is we've always said it is with the president we have no idea since he gets covered every single opinion on on trade we don't know where he stands we don't know what's acceptable or what's not acceptable he's gone from a complete protectionist\nA and a much of a you know rhetorical protection is during the campaign\nAnd then ah he had the ability about to two months ago to be on Monday a complete free trader and by the end of the week was being protectionist again and so when you hold every opinion on free trade it's tough to figure where the president stands and what this eventual free trade agreement will look like\nUh but uh if it's more free trade and it's not protectionist as he promised in the campaign and his supporters are happy with it I'm fine with it\nYeah I mean it's it because it\nOnce and I think we will get the aluminum and steel chairs are those that's going to fix itself at some point it will have to just the way it did during the Bush administration and it takes\nIt takes a lot longer for that process or let's say [noise]\nBack in the Bush years it took a lot longer for that process to play through to the market\nThis year or or or these days I don't know that that's the case actually on on aluminum and steel because when you talk about the basis of the of manufacturing the based materials for so much manufacturing you're going to have ... have already seen a number of industries\nScream over the the aluminum and steel chairs ... so that's likely going to play itself out naturally the way it did during the Bush years\nWell you had a lot of financial publications just over the last five days staying up all\nThe indicators are already in that the economy is starting to slow down in the United states and also when China because of the tariffs that had been there and as we subtle along we believe that the president was absolutely wrong to isolate the United states if you wanted to isolate China\nBecause of their unfair trading practices yeah that you could win if you didn't isolate yourself if you ... the the goals should have always been isolate China don't isolate yourself because you are going to have basically the same free trade agreement that you have\nRight now with Canada Mexico when Europe Raul modern western civilizations but you're not going to massively be able to put tariffs on all of their products and they'll let all of our products going free it doesn't work that way we knew it you're not going to get rid of the one hundred and fifty billion dollar\nA trade imbalance especially when you have such a huge\nInvestment surplus into the United states\nSo we knew that wasn't going to happen and so to us we thought there was a lot of wasted energy in the administration trying to\nUh have such incredible trade war rhetoric with Canada Mexico when Europe when there was really no reason to have it and and with the Asian countries as as well but I Do think that when you see it you're going to see everybody clean their little victories here they're already sunk Canada\nSaying okay this is a great deal of great deals so they're going to be promoting their victories\nIt'll be interesting to see the media in the United states promoting what is viewed as a victory and as we said you have to understand that when it comes to trade now a victory for a particular country\nIs when the consumer has to pay more\nFor a product yeah that's how posterior backwards we are on trade with it's a victory our consumers pay more\nYeah ha but somehow that's that's\nThe way that it is it the last house promoted yet I was promoted that's the one that ... that have that the political positive right is what they say we're hurting the economy slightly All right good [laughter] that's because the consumers pay because the consumers pay right\nAnd if the idea is protectionism which it is for targeted industry which it is then\nBy definition you're asking well you're allowing that industry to raise its prices it's not just about being the tariffs it's about paying the higher prices for the industry that you say you're protecting\nAnd it's the first initial impacts as we've always talked about the initial impact as when you see that there's an over supply in the market and they can't sell it for as we've seen with a with a ... in many different growers in the United states\nWhen the Chinese tariffs hit and then they had to sell it you know that's what it initially happened took rock bottom prices ... ah you know everything because they need to get rid of it\nAnd then when the adjustment gums those prices will go the way right they'll go way up afterwards after you get rid of the stock the demon tore\nThat you already have that you have to get rid of and that's why you had so many of the poor producers of Iowa get killed over the last four to five months and because of those particular terrorists because they had to drastically lower for as we've said all along\nA economics is simply how people respond to incentive\nThat's it right\nOr ... or you can say this and set up and send them one way distance that's it ... or anything else his opinion and the president can change that nobody can change that you can you can distort the market\nYou can help one industry wall hurting another industry but you can't change how people respond to it and send them a disincentive\nAnd so when you do that when you decide to raise prices you hurt the overall economy if you decide to raise taxes whether it's income tax or attacks through tariffs you hurt industry\n\nYeah and it that simple and I don't decide that Eric doesn't just to get people mad when we say that one of those some tax is helping the economy no they don't\nKnow no\nThey hurt an economy and so I'm a I Can't change that you can't change that none of us can change it the president can change it all you do is to start the market in some way\nAnd that's the that's the only effect of it and then ... then there's inevitably the reaction against that\nBecause when the economy if the economy starts tanking if steel and aluminum products start skyrocketing which they will by definition then the consumer is going to react to that\nWith the consumer reacts to that the economy changes that's when you have to have another political answer which is the opposite political answer that you gave for the first place\nYou undo what you did eventually\nA lot of a of our listeners lined up to talk about cabin on the FBI investigation was some audio

... lives in Orville California and he made the ten hour trip to Las Vegas\nI Need that comfort that support I Need to love which I get some here\nFrankly I thought he was under state of so many on the left are saying he was overstated to emotional I thought he was under state is it better than me and you've been accusing me of raping a girl back when I was Seventeen are attempting to rebel girl back when I was Seventeen and then accusing me of participating in a gang raped multiple times\nIf that's if that was the allegation I Would have gone in there I Would flip the birds no senators I would've never stop yelling at Diane Feinstein never I Would still be doing it it'll be thirty six hours later I Would still be yelling at Diane Feinstein\nYou know she she would look like one of those outtakes from the test flight simulators where the person's Harris alone straight back I Would never stop yelling about it yeah Brent Kavanaugh acquitted himself well and it was yesterday by the end of the day like Brett Kavanaugh was well on his way to nomination\nThen came this morning so this morning a bunch of things happen they're about to have the Senate Judiciary committee hearing and at the very beginning of the hearing\nMazie Hirono and Kamala Harris walk out the very first thing that happens\nThey walk out of the of the Senate Judiciary committee hearing thing is the first this is nonsense we won't be president for this out they said well it was all spontaneous\nSpontaneous that House Democratic women lined up in the back of the room simply to stand there and then walk out that's how spontaneous it was it was so spontaneous that these senators knew precisely at what point in the hearing to get up and late super spontaneous you understand\nNot pretty organized in any way not political grandstanding spontaneous you've got a sheer outrage Kamala Harris and made you run a walk directly out into a pile of cameras where they didn't discuss that\nThe ... the issue so here's Mazie Hirono and Kamala Harris walking out\nI'm here sending my colleagues because it's very clear that the Republicans who will break every norm every rule to get this person on the Supreme Court where he will be there with a cloud of weekends at Fort ... and this has got to stop so I walked out I'm not going to participate in this charade\nAnymore okay well she's not going to participate in the charade driven to participate anyway because the Democrats don't have any power under these circumstances and she wanted to make it look like she was rebelling against the man you know really biting the man so that's how the day began the day began with that then Jeff Flake came out the Republican senator from Arizona and he said I'm going to vote for capital\nI'm gonna vote for cabinet because I see no corroborating evidence\nI still don't know whether this happened or whether it did not with lady for but I've seen no cooperation and because us you know cooperation I Can't sing good conscience destroy a man's life and career based on that's what I'll vote\nFor him to join the Supreme Court\nAnd that's when things went wrong and that's when things went wrong so Jeff Flake was walking through the Senate and then some girl comes up to the young woman comes up to him\nIn the elevator and start shouting at him about how he's being crew will do all women for suggesting that maybe we might have a smidgen of due process here she is she started yelling at them you can see just like break as a human in this clip\nWhen you're doing is allowing someone who she'll be violent and a woman to sit in the heart\nTolerable children in your family think about them having children children get\nThat it for the next few years they will have\nMe that she was on fire\nAre you kidding\nMe\nOkay and so these two women started yelling at flake and it's like sort of shuts the door and of course you in and is covering this up to watch it because it's dramatic footage\nA dramatic funny when we got to have\nSome emotion here that's what we need we need some women yelling at Jeff Flake deeply important deeply important that random protesters yellow Jeff Flake for taking the simply honest position now without corroborating evidence you can't ruin into his wife\nNow all of this ties into a claim that Democrats are making yesterday at the claim that Democrats are making yesterday was a fairly simple one that claim was that if Brett Kavanaugh did not require an FBI investigation if Senate Republicans didn't request an FBI investigation is because this was all part of a broad ... cover up that was the claim that was being made and of course it was on it\nIf they and find someone in the FBI investigation you're going to call for one back in July if you want to note by an FBI investigation she could have done so for the next six weeks she did not\nIt said it does have the power to actually investigate that's why it's an investigative committee they have the power to subpoena power to ask questions they did in fact interview all of the witnesses have lazy Ford mentioned including mark judge\nAnd Democrats refused to participate in those interviews Democrats at if we participate in those interviews then we will be giving our go ahead to this process we want the FBI now\nAs we all know the FBI really has nothing to do with it the FBI investigated the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill finding and they found nothing that didn't stop the Democrats from destroying Clarence\nThomas's life and still calling him a sexual harassment for the rest of his wife the FBI doesn't routinely investigate allegations vague allegations from thirty six years ago state crimes to carry a one year prison sentence for misdemeanor typically not the purview of the FBI\nBut because Democrats kept asking it over and over and because Jeff Flake felt bad down in the ... and it's hard because he felt that and his soul he decided it was necessary to cave to the Democrats because people yelled at him in an elevator\nAnd that was bad when people yelled at him in an elevator and so he needed to cave to Democrats and also blamed what he did in just one second\nBut first let's talk about your sleep quality so there was nobody on the planet like why would you build a generic mattress\nBy educated men has built for anyone else you would build asleep wouldn't take two minutes to complete\nThey use the answers natural body type and we'd preferences and the perfect metric whether your side we were a hot weather you like a pleasure from bed with the like there is no or guessing and no more confusion just go to ... dot com slash Shapiro pick their two minutes because they will match your mattress that will give you the best we build your life for couples you can even put that mattress down the middle\nProviding individuals support needs and your preferences for each side you have a ten year warranty you have to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress ordered again to a hundred and twenty five bucks off at ... dot com slash Shapiro that he would sleep dot com slash a bureau for a hundred and twenty five dollars off your mattress order\nHe would sleep dot com slash grow I Love my helix Lee mattress my wife and I took the liquid we ordered the mattress it came in the mail and wrapped it went directly on the bed and supremely comfortable so good that I got it from my sister for wedding as well go check it out he looked bleak dot com bust your bureau for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or so\nJeff Flake feels really bad and then it gets worse another woman can fronts like I just don't you look away from me don't you look away from me if you will go away from me let me tell you if you will have walked away from me and don't go away from me and Jeff Flake would not look away from her\nThrough your timing when\nYou're married and they should just even sell because you have to treat your\nWay\nTo tell me what you're telling me that my daughter [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nWell that's actually not what he's selling her I mean spoiler alert that's not what he's telling her what are you selling or is that this woman's assaults or he doesn't have any corroborating evidence which is true\nAnd I think your story doesn't matter I'm getting very tired of that you're telling me my I don't even know usually I don't know your story I don't know a cooperative evidence you brought for I don't know anything about you you're claiming I don't care about you and I don't know your name or who you are\nAnd yet this is the claim that have Jeff Flake has a specific view on a specific allegation about a specific man and a non specific time a non specific location a non specific place with no specific detail and that means he doesn't care about it completely separate woman who may or may not have been assaulted at some other point in time by an unnamed human we don't know\nMakes perfect sense yes all of this makes perfect sense but just like being Jeff like Jeff Flake then decided okay well I've got to back off this right before the Senate Judiciary committee it's supposed to take it one vote down the line vote on advancing Brett Kavanaugh\nJeff Flake huddled in a room off the side and this is where all the Republicans can feel their heart sink into their shoes all conservatives start to think oh boy Jeff like I Can't imagine why Jeff like it's so unpopular in its own state I Can't imagine\nWhy so many Republicans can't stand Jeff Flake even those of us are not huge fans of President Trump or at least we're not in twenty sixteen even those of us who have serious criticisms of President Trump\nWe still think Jeff Flake stinks there's a reason for that because just like lives up to his name to just wait they huddled in a room with a bunch of Democrats and what comes out from that meeting completely up and this entire process once again\nThis is the ninth generation of whether Kavanaugh gets on the corner not yesterday I thought he would not be on the corner for then I thought it would be on the court after his testimony\nNow I have no idea because of Jeff Flake\nWhy will have to explain for you in just a second what exactly Jeff Flake just did what Jeff Flake is really thinking here why Jeff Flake is doing it in the first place there's a lot to unpack devices and say that Jeff Flake is not giving up a whole hell of a lot\nOf hope for the process is going to end in anything like an orderly fashion

timeline find time or the letter July thirtieth does nothing for next week that\nIntercept revealed releases and anonymous account at which point Feinstein goes to the FBI and the Democrats say why don't we have a hearing and Republicans say sure let's have a hearing then Democrats they no she can't wide Republicans say well we'll send someone to her and Democrats say no you can't send someone to her she needs to be here they're probably going to say okay well how 'bout you come here but\nOnly under certain conditions and then she says I don't like those conditions and they changed the condition then she finally shows up you testify and the Democrats and why don't we do an FBI investigation\nWhich they wouldn't do in the first place\nGreat and then Jeff Flake like the I demand an FBI investigation who the hell voted for Jeff like\nMy goodness Jeff Flake comes forward and he says well we really need now is a weeklong FBI investigation into Christine Blasey Ford delegation which will result in precisely the same situation we have now accept more annoyed why because what people think the FBI does for a living they didn't the FBI or the magically\nYep yeah it's like you go in the back room and the FBI building and there's Tom Cruise the pre ... because we're the gloves Don ... manipulating all the pictures in the background so he can predict the pre crime\nAnd that was the FBI does the FBI doesn't have a magic delorean they can't go back and I ... to does he stay crime in Maryland and an unspecified house an unspecified date\nIf I just say something bad happened to me at a place FBI go\nWhat exactly are they supposed to do\nEspecially since she's named a bunch of witnesses we've already given statements under penalty of perjury\nIt's not just that these people get statements they gave statements under penalty of perjury mark judge by the way the man who's at issue for the Democrats he said that he's happy to talk to the FBI in care they'll just say to sit on the same thing he's already said in his statements under penalty of perjury which he doesn't remember anything like this ever happening he doesn't remember being present at a party like this\nSo what will happen next week yeah yeah I Will come forward with a bunch of Rio to these aren't signed sworn statements\nStatements will say exactly what the current signs warning statements that Democrats will claim that more investigation is necessary or why don't you believe all women and then we'll have exactly the same fight and Jeff Flake can be a cost in elevators again if you think this is going to buy him an escape from the elevator\nHe is wrong is bound to be riding and all that are one week from today mark your calendar he will be going up and down on the elevator at the Dirksen office building you can find him there being screened at by random protesters\nAnd presumably caving whatever their next demand that President Trump response to all of that and honestly I think that President Trump seems mildly amused by all of that [laughter] it's the first time he hasn't been in the news for two years so he's probably like okay I get to go home and they came by it do it but here's President Trump\nReacting to Jeff Flake and Kavanaugh and he basically said\nFine you went up to gauge and find whatever I don't care you know like seriously ill any alone can you just leave me alone\nWill love you lift the Senate handle that film and decisions and the ...\nRoute professional I'm just doing a little bit about it because I've been with the presidents of Julie we're talking about some very important subjects but ah I'm sure it will be very good I guess the vote who's advisor to vote for this seems to be delivered a learned more about it is today goes or\nNay so he doesn't say anything of substance there and then he said that lazy Ford was a credible witness and then he said that Kavanaugh's witness was witness testimonies ... okay fine and then Lindsey Graham is asked about that the Lindsey Graham who gave an impassioned speech incentive Judiciary Committee yesterday where he basically ripped into Democrats\nNo one rules with the punches quite like Lindsey Graham mean that'd be rules with punches do the very next day you have to undercut by Jeff like who says we now need an FBI investigation and Lindsey Graham says well I guess I'm gonna have to go to the White House and explain this one to President Trump sounded like party was Lindsey Graham\nImmigrants and see if we do we're just saying that we're in the process a history of at least a few of them I don't expect him to vote for the job but if we sci fi I haven't looked at was in front of us are\nNo later than a week no longer than we are and they would say that would be a better process that will be progress and just try to try and is this just\nBring the country together vote for this where he knows how\nOkay yeah so this is all gonna is all going to go great I definitely cross the Democrats you know I trusted Democrats\nBecause they've been taught trustworthy throughout this entire process they've just been magnificent magnificently trustworthy like just this morning Dianne Feinstein who leverage these charges against Brad cabin on the first place in the most dishonest possible way\nShe hit all the information genetic many questions about it she waited until he was basically confirmed and then she dumped it on him today and in the Judiciary Committee she said you know the problem with Brett Kavanaugh he went on the attack\nOK it turns out after you after you you verbal diarrhea on a man for weeks at a time he might be slightly miffed but according to Senator Feinstein he didn't show the proper level of respect to the senator's\nFirst of all I agree he didn't show the proper all proper level of respect to the Senate or if he had he would have been flinging vomited them that's the proper level of respect that they deserve any senators are a joke this body
