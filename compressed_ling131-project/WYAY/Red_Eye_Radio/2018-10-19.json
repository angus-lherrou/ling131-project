are there are there are there are lots of some of the you know there are lots of stories out there about what has happened\nThat was that was interesting you guys you know we're asking the right questions I suggested maybe it was George Soros paying for all this one way or another and sure enough people are talking about that today so I may have been right about that\nBut I certainly become more cynical about what is going on\nAnd this one seems clear to me I think they're timing it so that their arrival at our border is time to heard President Trump and Republicans in the upcoming elections whoever's paying for it\nUh doesn't matter I think that's what they're up to so I think they don't ask me of course to consult with them but I think the Democrats are once again misreading things as they didn't earrings with the judge Kevin to where they clearly overplay their hand\nAnd showed you know the even the independent voters remember most people don't follow the news like the those who are listening to talk radio you guys are actively involved and you know what's going on most average people don't even know what's going on [noise]\nUh but they showed their mission to ruin a judge Kavanaugh's reputation in his life and I think most people could see that whether or not her evidence has yet is whether\nIt's MORNING was credible or not even if they felt sorry for her I think they thought\nThe Democrats were going overboard and I think that's going to hurt them in the election so I think most Americans saw through their surface and now they want the American people will seek crying children right so is the children and distraught mothers at the border\nWith a willing press reporting how heartless Republicans are to allow such suffering to take place they just you ever notice it's always the children's something or other cars people's fears feel sorry for children it doesn't matter if they're manipulated by the way\nYou know if it's as someone's kid a tan or eight or whatever that when they spouse certain points of view you know they've been indoctrinated by the parents\nEven if they're precocious than some of the things that come out with you know the parents have just using their own kids by the way not unlike the Democrats use you know a Ford there\nAnd they're all the usual spin I oh this line drives me crazy that this is not who we are as people are not who we are as Americans\nAs if we're not allowed to defend our sovereignty and our values\nThat we are in effect basically what they're saying we're stupid people that would let all kinds of people come through our border on their word alone now I Want asylum whenever you don't know if there are terrorists or you don't have half contagious diseases which is happening more and more\nPeople have not been vetted in any way that that we are not those kinds of people either that can't we be smart enough to have some you know the rules and procedures about how people come into this country so when they say it just drives me crazy oh this is not who we are as people Hillary set at everybody said it you know\nIt just seems like that on the left though we're we're not we're so compassion and we take everybody you know you guys just full of it you want them here for the votes\nAnd you didn't care about basically for whatever her name is because of the final analysis you leak that when she didn't want the stuffed leek\nAnd Dianne Feinstein the rest of your time this so do maximum damage you didn't really care about her\nBy is a bigger topic for tonight just like I Believe the Democrats don't really care about minorities that just using them they know they take their votes for granted and whether they help them or not it's is it relevant they are using them for them to get power [noise]\nSo I Want you to comment to continue to comment on any of those stories that I reviewed tonight at eight six six Ninety red eye and and let me know what you're thinking and I go with where you want to go there is a hot topic uh after our topic I'll go to their pretty quickly\nEight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine is is the same number a digitally\nBut colors also mentioned the reaction of some of their friends this kind of always comes out a little bit some of the friends and family members to or if their political beliefs are on the conservative or you know you call them on the right I guess\nAnd a friend of mine Scott who used to live in California now lives in Colorado I'll leave that his last name because I didn't get permission to use his last name\nSo this is what he posted on Facebook yesterday he was ... just because of his political beliefs and he thought I I thought he wrote a thoughtful commentary which I Am going to just read from is pretty quick\nA and from what I remember by the way he's a moderate Republican not even a conservative like me here's this quote we continue to learn life set lessons in many ways today I had a friend who I've known since high school an friend me she was always known me is a nice person\nIn fact I helped her out in school and gave her job to provide her additional Lincoln\nNothing has changed as far as who I Am\nBut today she and friends and me not because I was nasty to her or because I was mean to anyone she knew about the cause I posted a political post that she disagreed with\nKeep in mind that she posts political commentary that I disagree with and some I find very offensive she asked me to never comment on our stuff and yet she comments on mine but sadly there's a way of our politics we\nCan do people for years even all of our lives yet they have no tolerance for a different political view than their own it's so angers them that you have a different opinion that then there's that they will not talk to you anymore\nPersonally I find that beyond said today I've only an friend that one person mainly because they're noxious and intellectually dishonest\nAs most no I guess people know him I Will debate anyone on any issue and I've changed my mind than issues and vote had others change their mind yeah I appreciate that too when colors of done that in the past\nAnd you'll see me say sometimes yeah that's a good point I didn't consider that but today it just seems that we're starting to forget the whole of a person is not just measure by their political views and if the ... if you've had a lifetime of friendship that it should be more important than a different view on one area\nHe should have said in one area of your life\nI think I'm more saddened by the fact that my experience today is more symptomatic of what our society's becoming than about losing a Facebook friends if we can find a way to be more civil to each other and then we're in for a bumpy road ahead I actually I think he's under doing it\nUh and by the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago so I used to doing a show in Los Angeles with two Democrats two Republicans discussing the issues in the news whatever came up that we can\nThe audience and the guests loved it some of the gifts I they greet each other and a future show I said how do you know ... oh we became good friends because of your show mark up and I I was really that touched me a despite their differing views they become friends socially and otherwise and kept in touch\nI'd love to reprise that show at some point if I was given the opportunity because of the audience loved it I loved it it it was just a lot of fun we didn't have very professional way you know\nBut one of the guests moved to Tennessee and posted on Facebook was one of the other guests and more you see what he did he posted in on Facebook after Trump won that he was the ... anyone who is evil enough to vote for President Trump\nYour host included I just think well he wouldn't friendly you know he did\nIn all of his appearances on my show he was one of the milder very friendly and plus you guess on the other side\nAnd he ... he shares vice with me when I was dumb enough to run for office in California which you can imagine for Republicans waste the time so I was pretty surprised when he posted his letter saying goodbye to all of us now evil human beings I'm not sure you said the word evil but that's what he was implying\nForget his past interactions with me or others he thought were his friends they thought he was there for his friends so I Want to know from you what has been your experience when people find out your views if you're a Republican or a conservative or maybe you keep your politics quiet as I Do with my teaching job\nOne of the reasons I'm getting lower now I'm probably still teaching is the left just about never listens to the other side\nSo they have no idea that I'm a talk show host if they knew that might be the end of me but here it's a several anecdote you might appreciate on election day when President Trump was running it was the first day of new class of my school\n... a lot to see the election results and I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might win but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like you going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called me into her office at the end of the night and she said you know what mark I defended you to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that ... been going on [noise] it didn't even cross or my for second that I could be on the other side\nAnd another time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... a teacher trainer who's running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room tall your teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you [noise] I Do you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life how could have been the end of me\nAnd a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia die another teacher said mark what's playing knock knock joke so I played along\nAnd his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI'd probably didn't hide my look of dismay because he shot me because you immediately walked away having no idea that I adore Justice Scalia and he was my ...\nThe judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching the public school system\nAnd they won games and you know we were in those games and we we had opportunities

Trump and as she was more of a Bernie Sanders\nShe was all about Bernie Sanders and um she was happy with Hillary and so as it got closer and closer when I actually started leaning orders Trump we we

there are ... and in fact they were at the doctor's office at that time and her husband and for me she said that unless I re now Donald Trump and would no longer speak to me\nAnd one thing they were

are white you know most black people are ignorant expected this Don ... anyway\nI have a two other lifelong friends are very liberal or over the years they've always known that I lean to the right I'm

that everybody's having problems with their family members have nobody to figure out why people are going crazy\nYou know you bring up Trump or whatever and it's just like it's like a trick word that a a mind\nProgramming like they did the old shows they had back in the seventies whatever you know they so they cost will be on the phone and say a special word they'll go kill somebody I'm not advocating anything like that what I'm saying is when\nAbout six seven years ago my daughter wanted me to go with her to the Huntington said her which is a big arena and said Ohio and it was about to interview for a job now the new dance club that was opening up in Toledo and so I took her and they'll\nPretty much still two thirds the arena were filled up with families kids in Paris editor for was a panel of\nUm people pay six people they each have their little steel to talk about this new dance club that was coming into the going all around the country opened it up these clubs and\nThe thing that struck by interest first of all was their pictures didn't get paid by the hour they got paid by how many other kids they brought in\nNow there are five hundred families in this arena there is no way a little club is going to hire all these people but what they were doing was trying to bring the kids in and as I listen to this bill I said told on their cells by saying\nIt will be music playing and food and then at throughout the night there'll be certain times with the musical stopped or what have announcements and it was or political announcements\nSo these people in your family especially already thinking about Twenty years old twenty two year olds watch these people as people and and people that are out there in the streets blocking the streets these kids have been a doctrine ate it almost like he's a cult and\nYou know if it was his ... who's got the money to rent the Huntington center\nFor this club now I tried to get in there to find out more about it I told my play drums which I Do and uh\nI like to get in and sometimes the kids like the answer to the extra beat suicide plus years ago they had that and so I could get inside the walls to find out exactly what was happening but I never heard back from them but this\nThese people that your family members do\nEven though you see that have come out in the heart do hate that it's not their fault I mean if you had a family member that was ... or ... and they're not only programs that's basically what it is I mean if I like blue and you like read we can discuss it and there's not a titled\nOr whatever it gets into the area of controlling the elation of the population then\nYou see the anger come out that because I I really believe there are programs by son is thirty one right now but she was in junior high back was a Gore and Bush was battling it out at Florida he said dad who you're voting for and back then I just you know I didn't care about politics I almost I didn't vote for nobody 'cause they're all crooks\nHe was a well we had a mock election that school and Gore won by a landslide them thinking wow I don't know a whole lot by pretty sure that guy is Lydia\nSo I started listening AM radio and I don't know what a Democrat is or a conservative or a Democrat or anything I mean I don't know anything\nAbout anything so I mean you have an open mind as it didn't take me long to figure out that it was a conservative\nAnd even back then the hatred was prominent in the discussion on the talk shows that were more of a a liberal I'm democratic side and what I what I've just seen\nAs just as I feel sorry my heart goes out to everybody you know I was driving a truck with my brother\nYears ago and started talking politics and he you know I bring up a point of fact and he didn't have a ... he got mad started calling me a warmonger\nI'm like is that all you got is just name calling was basically that's all they've got they have no place that makes sense you know how can you not understand it's better\nTo have people working to have their town doing better that lower the climate I mean all these things are common sense but\nThey just you can't get through to there was a mental problem there is there is a programming problem I Believe my heart\nSo like I can say that I wanted to let you know\nWell he did a good job Charlie and I think it's more emotionally although you here I never thought of that so the Democratic party as a cult cult of a motors because that's what they do most of the people there I'm not saying that Brian I'm not saying that a nice a lot of them they ... there's no issue about that\nAnd there's many you know nice Republicans I assume is Democrats and vice versa\nBut the fact is that a lot of it's based on emotion like you're saying yeah you always a liar oh he's a racist way what about the economy what about foreign policy what about the countries in really good shape in terms of things people care about they often vote their pocketbooks\nNo he's he's just how could you like him he's he's just a small you know this most the heat of a person I've ever met\nAnd if you and if you do like um I'm not going to date you I'm not going to talk to you I'm going to be fringe on Facebook\nIt's incredible just you know the reason I laugh at this point 'cause otherwise you cry I mean you hear these stories\nAbout people losing their friends and their
