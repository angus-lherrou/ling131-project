the deadline to help Governor Scott and the Dems obstructionism used the link below from Florida A M says Ken this is Craig from the Rick Scott campaign Governor Scott will get\nThings done for Florida not obstruct Trump they're sending\nMe wrote all males or email messages and by the way I'm also getting are you getting these I'm getting on my cell phone I'm\nGetting ... dot com studios why why\nShe\nBecame a source live streamed surgery I'm only a princess a postal facility in Florida and I'm a focus of the pipe bombs mail to several high profile Democrats roast the country and CNN the FBI warning of additional packages after three more bombs were located Thursday responded Caitlin tones\nSources tell CNN Mr Trump believes he's being unfairly linked to the attempted assassination and has no plans to back off his verbal attacks on the media\nOne confidant adding there's no talking him out of that one day after calling for unity and condemning the taxes on American president changed course riding on Twitter that a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media\nBombs and you know and and there it is a investigators believe some of the ten suspicious packages center prominent Democrats and Trump were mailed from\nFlorida so that information is coming out there were mailed from ah from Florida I saw the story that that the uh sources are saying that the whole uh ISIS flag thing that authorities believe was to throw them off and they don't believe it had anything to do with\nA a a a ISIS they belong or the cable guy or learn the cable guy right I think it was something just to to throw them off and so we're getting all these different stories and meanwhile all day yesterday my question is\nWhere they live bombs were they ready to go walk right not rise that makes that makes a difference if you're giving out all this other information all this other information is being leaked\nOut there why isn't anyone why ... why isn't any media outlet\nReally insistent in asking those questions for me it was quite frustrating yesterday and then ah was ah was busy a lot of the day uh yesterday in and went to sleep in and woke up late\nAnd when I woke up late that's the first thing and I saw like five hours I woke up right just about two hours ago and and as soon as I woke up I ... you know okay there's gotta be\nThe story out there whether it was a lie bomb or not in the same thing right like wait a minute this is not for days since the first you know since the first bomb right you know what what is it why can't why can't we get a straight answer when you when you talk about Austin Austin a bomb went off\n... so at that point you knew that they were alive ... here no bomb has gone off so the question would rain just for public safety or public knowledge are the bombs live or not\nAnd still referring to them as you know suspected of you know the devices potentially dangerous devices potentially dangerous devices that are you know that are dangerous mhm well why would they be dangerous does that mean because this will be the question I Would have\nDoes that mean that some contain gunpowder right et cetera and tainted explosive device but there was no detonator and then right so they would be a potentially suspected of you know a bomb\nA with a you know explosive material\nThe explosive material wasn't going to go off and it wasn't a danger to anybody unless you took a match and put it to the gunpowder right right\nYeah just simply by handling the package itself it wouldn't be necessarily a dangerous in the way that a live bomb would be but but but again\nAh you know that this is something where you know not not hearing at all ah it has been\nAnd and there is no nothing wrong with an over abundance of caution by any one ... and you know in the scenario except for the fact that you don't have something for I guess that the public if they were armed\nAh those bombs were ready to go off in transit that's something I think that would be warnings all over from authorities saying that you wherever you might be anyone could potentially encounter one of these devices\nAnd that kind of warning I'm not I'm not hearing so\nAnd when you get to the press coverage of calling them bombs yeah which is if you know if the Saudis have not said that they were lied bombs why are we calling them bombs right what is the purpose of of doing that is that accurate reporting if they are not bombs ... were telling you in real time the frustration that we have right\nRight and we think it's important to point out the frustration unless there's a reason for\nYou know unless there's eight investigative reason for for doing so accept the fact is the people that are the person or people that mail the bomb they know whether they were alive or not and they know the authorities are already know right so what what would be the investigative purpose for doing it is beyond\nIs is beyond me and so when I finally saw some frustration because\nIt got to be a little frustrating yesterday when you're trying to figure it out or they live bombs or not and would they have gone off was it just some explosive material but they wouldn't have gone off right because that that one of the reasons that the leaks are happening they give out information\nBecause you see it all over the place I saw the the the tweets people retreating if if you know anything about it and now here's some of the information some of the information we believe you know it's it's the authorities now or be directed to Florida well leaks come out for a reason\nLeaks from investigative agencies come out for a reason so why are all these other things leaking and being told that the public by the media but not the one question but I think most people would want to know with with what are they live where they live or would they not lie bond right right\nSo there's where we are so we'll get to that like a more that coming up here I Chelsea Clinton I'd consider running for office\nMhm I just had to throw that in there yeah it's a friday why not anybody's shock no\nWell you know she has experience that NBC so\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] who was it who wasn't on NBC\nI Can't remember who was the I think it was Brian Williams was it Brian Williams okay she's well traveled\nThat's how he described her ... ... ... the you mean she's been on a plane I that was the first daughter of course she's well traveled you know when I Will never forget him that night we I Know we played it on the air yeah but that was just unbelievable yeah it was like gosh\nYou know over the fact right the Chelsea Clinton was not working for NBC ... and they do that when when when uh George Bush's daughter went to work for NBC not so much that there were a couple of articles you know but yeah but but not no gushing no no you're not getting as what I was referring to did you did pause the news you know and why\nIs that it was like OK we'll let her in for now [laughter] I did a great job\nIt's like Megan Kelly exits stage left but once the entire contract and I looked at you and I during an appreciable meeting and said and\nDoes it seem like that NBC went oh wait a minute oh we can make this call is it not ... uh she's already making too much from she hasn't made that kind of money she hasn't pulled and that kind of revenue\nYeah or so this is an opportunity to get rid of her now right well because the ratings I'm I'm guessing weren't stellar\nUm and ... and in a good excuse right ah yeah we're going to let you go\nSo I'm Megan Kelly yet and who knows will she be back on friday but it looks like she's going to be off the air for at least a wild and she lost so here's here's how it went down she made the blackface comment I I don't know when that was Monday or Tuesday and then by Wednesday she had lost her agent\nYes they parted ways and\nNow it's basically it looks like there won't be any any you know coming back to to say goodbye or or sign off or anything else it looks like it's pretty much done and you're wondering you you just wonder okay that was the old saying that escalated quickly\nUm she came out on\nWednesday\nAnd did some kind of apology and they said the audience you know that was their gave her a standing ovation I I'm not sure why an apology\nIt deserves the tent no fishing [laughter] [laughter] it's not like some kind of great performance that's our society that we live and well yeah yeah uh but they gave her a standing ovation\nUh and then later on that day it just kind of went down from there and that's when the agency that she was with atomic agency I decided to part ways whether there was some celebrities that we're going to appear on the show that after the comments on black face they weren't going to appear and they decided you know the cancelled so\nAh and but the\nLikely comes down to the fact that the ratings weren't great you know is it the worst thing ... anybody has ever said\nAh no\nNo but ... but ask Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr that situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood than what Megan Kelly said I I don't know I ... I don't know I my two\nMy two conspiracy theories and the ones you know initially they weren't going to\nInitially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans with initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it as you said in our personal meaning\nYou figured out they'd suspended until after Halloween yeah come back after Halloween but but then they went oh wait a minute hold it she's not producing yeah don't wait a minute rating we can get out of this contract we can we bought one of the lawyer said you know this could be caused and if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off or contract that's one side of it the other side of it as\nMy the conspiracy theory is making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks but I don't want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough for them to justifiably fire me for cause\n[laughter] well but I mean and if they try I can still collect here's the difference Megan Kelly's saying that on her old show on\nFox News would have just been another night of making Kelly you wouldn't have heard complaints made the I mean on social media you would've yes but it wouldn't have been treated the same I mean she may have had to follow up and say you know\nHey that's not what I meant it's not okay or whatever but it wouldn't have been what it is that NBC for a morning show there is a big difference and and and the type of audience that you have there so who knows what will happen but ah yeah maybe maybe it was amicable by both parties\nWill no longer accept the inflated prices being charged to our seniors I had a congressman respected congressman come to the oval office and say sir for my constituents drug pricing is more important\nThan health care is that a friday so open and go on Wall street right now don't futures down one sixty seven I'm only a for instance [noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you're a fifty year old male maybe humid Porgy and you may even have type ... diabetes a million dollars a term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month\nCalled germ provider speak with big Lu at eight hundred three four or five twenty seven eighty nine big we will find a term life policy for you even if you have type ... diabetes are overweight or have high blood pressure\nTerm providers helped thousands of people like you think they can afford term life insurance to buy a million dollars of affordable during life for you all you need to do is call big Lu at eight hundred three four or five twenty seven eighty nine will make sure the scales are dipped in your favor\nCall eight hundred three or four or five twenty seven eighty nine may Lu we'll answer your call and work to fit you into a term life policy that you can afford that remember big lose like you\nHe's on meds to go late hundred three or four or five twenty seven eighty nine eight hundred three four or five twenty seven eighty nine\nVirtually every stockbroker and financial adviser is solely focused on one thing and that's your investment\nBut they're missing the most significant piece of the retirement puzzle a tax efficient investment strategy\nBecause every dollar you save in taxes is one more net dollar that goes right back into your pocket Hi it's ... from the CPA wealth advisors radio show you know the most qualified person to create your tax efficient investment strategy is a CPA we live eat and breathe these strategies everyday\nAnd having one could save tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars and MORNING EDITION of lifetime income\nDiscovered the impact a tax efficient investment strategy can have on your retirement plan with a free tax efficient analysis if you have at least one hundred thousand save for retirement be one of the first ten callers right now\nAt seven seven six to nine one four or five that seven seven oh six to nine one four or five\nMister show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day visit red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that's red eye radio show dot com\nI'm here with a unit royal truck tires engineer to talk about the unit royal LD can drive time\nYes the long lasting L.

Fox News so I just wanted to throw that Katherine Harris wrote that with explosive material and that's another thing that we have road right which is and we mentioned this uh in the last segment\nThat we've heard explosive material and we've heard\nA pipe bomb potentially wrote dangerous potentially explosive devices\nA but we haven't heard actually lied bombs and so we're we're that's the question that we\nAre asking that would they have it all from what we know all ten of the explosive devices and uh went to the u._s. postal system right which means they were handled so it wasn't us a question that it wasn't\nTouching it or in in any way that it seems would have shut off the bomb so were they timers and would they have gone off at any time or where they just\n... did you have some explosive materials but they would have never detonated unless they might have been in a fire right uh and so those are the questions to understand the motivation of the person who was sending it that's why you like to get to that point but now four days into this\nAnd we still don't know whether they were alive bombs are not authorities have been set and so you ask the question why but postal markings on those packages sent\nA two prominent Democrats have helped federal investigators were find their focus of your investigation with Florida described as a region of interest to sources told Fox News\nOn Thursday the investigators have not said whether they believe the suspect or suspects are in Florida or call the packages were mailed from the state New York and Maryland are also in oak is Fox learned a government official noted what appeared to be thick dark electricians tape on the pipe bomb sent\nTo former CIA director John Brennan now that's where they use the term pipe bomb there\nMhm so Fox uses the term pipe bomb was that a pipe bomb right because what's the definition of a bomb bomb is something that will go off\nMhm right\nThat you have a detonator in it which is going to set it off one way or another there might be various ways to set it up so was it a pipe bomb or nobody has said it was alive pipe bomb at this moment right\nOr the officials that investigators are hopeful that the black tape capture DNA fibers and fingerprints on the mock ISIS style logo on the one mailing to government officials sudden investigators believed it was designed to create confusion not to indicate a connection to a known terrorist group right\nA Miami Dade police announced it was working with investigators essay precautionary measure bomb squad and canine units are currently providing assistance to our federal partners and the United States Postal service\nFor there's where we are at this point here we go let's go to Mike in New York Mike Hi you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi Mike\nHow you doing very good\nYeah my comment about the mail bombs and also the way how it relates in an odd way to the concept of like\n... minutes don't work the people on the left said it all different status of the victims well you know we've always known that if someone on the right gets injured by somewhat on the lap while it's not nearly as important as the other way around but now we know\nIt's also not nearly as important as if someone on the left\nUp here is like they might have been injured you know by someone who every oil they water was still alive but nobody really knows and so I guess maybe in the colleges they could start to think something like if that's actually quite victim status so they can help straighten us all out and you\nHave that [laughter] well you know my hair Eric you were talking about what's at the tweet\nWas a Donald Trump junior the pointed out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media or yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well\nSaying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice and to his residence and\nAnd it was you know they've got a ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking uh I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things that happened uh that and with any president or presidential family but especially this one\nYou've had how much you know that has happened had been said\nUm and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and thank you might\nFor the call ah this was a

I think she can be financially helpful because she has a history of fabulous fundraising and I think that's where she should stay\nAs far as I Know what we now and making speeches for missing ... I don't think so\nWhen it hits the typically think that how might Hillary Clinton harmed the gallon campaign I think\nBad ... bad credit peed on trust her that when ... when I the reality is I I voted for her [noise] um I supported her\nBut she does things that um\nShe kept out for herself and she makes a big mistakes eloquent so there you go [laughter] [noise]\nSo what you're saying is she believes shouldn't run and twenty\n[laughter] forget about Gillum we're clear on that what about twenty twenty\nYou know because here's the thing you know the bubble that the Clintons have always lived in ... many people live in inside the beltway or inside of the chapel club beltway um\nThe ... they they\nWhen they when they go on the you know a speech to hurt or you know um if they if they go out and just do some rallies right or it is the case for any of them right or left that those rallies are filled with Friendly's for the most part I mean except for outside on the sidewalk they're filled with friendly\nIn other words the Clintons have been surrounded by people who have been telling them they're the greatest for a long long time\nWhen you step outside that you step away from it a bit I think Hillary got some of this even when she was running and twenty sixteen remember the reporters that approached her during the campaign season and started asking questions about bill\nThen they had to pretty much at that point Debbie Wasserman Schultz was hiding Hillary [laughter]\nWhere's Hillary was the question and you ... the ... they had to create that while they had to build a wall around Hillary so that they you know she was not approachable so she's been told by a lot of people oh you should run again you should run again you should run again\nBut it really will be their own internal that will tell them you know our millennials on board\nNow that's a very different question as to whether or not she should go on and endorse or she could she help Gillum or any other candidate right now in the left\nIt is a very different question in terms of what she run or or should she run or would you vote for her and twenty twenty many of those same people that just criticized for maybe a few of them might\nVote for her but I don't know that for sure because by the time we get to twenty twenty\nI don't know that you're millennials going to look at that and go\nYeah she's just not the ... and we need somebody new and fresher gentleman besides her\nJust you know because I was actually watching the the the video over here so you didn't have access you weren't looking at the video but the woman who said\nThat she should be there just for fundraising and she was older I'm going to get she yeah she was fifty plus I'm guessing ... she was the same woman or who said we don't trust her right that she's not trustworthy and that's interesting because that somebody who's experience Hillary Clinton\nThe other two were younger there they were probably in their thirties so they probably don't go all the way back to\nAs many of us do Hillary Clinton and Hillary care way back when\nWhen uh you know she was in charge of of putting together a you know some type of single payer health care system in America in the early nineties uh so I thought that was really interesting yeah she can raise money but then we don't want to hear from or we don't want her image around we don't want her people don't people don't trust her\nAnd what she means as Democrats don't trust her she didn't trust her\nRight and I when I found that just to be I I found that\nTo be really really really interesting one other point that I Want to make her because we hear this all the time and we've addressed it before\nBut it came up again the media this week is at Trump's rallies when they talk about Hillary in lock her up that that is that's it you know instability that that is look you're talking about a political rally and you're also talking about you know why why are they saying lock her up you have to go back to you know what's it about just because she exist\nAnd she opposed you lock her up no that goes back to what that goes back to the whole email scandal where people can identify what the crime was you can look at the law and say this is a crime that she broke\nAnd many other people who did this anybody else who did this any normal person who allowed top secrets you know to be so accessible and broke the law and she did would end up in jail that's what that's based on not just based on the on what the left is attempting to portray as just\nPure instability they don't like her so they want to put her in jail no it's based\nOn her behavior what she did and the fact that Republicans have looked at it and said ... and many have looked at it even not just Republicans conservatives without a libertarian since they are actually broke the law right she put the server in her house that's breaking the law she knew\nThat people were going to have you know at that at that level as secretary of state that every foreign government is every\nUh unfriendly and probably friendly foreign government is looking to tap into anything they possibly can to find out what you're doing as secretary of state by you doing that\nOn Friendly's where we were able to get into some of our top secret you knew it and you did it so you could hide emails from the freedom of Information Act that's a crime yup there's two crimes they're the Espionage Act and trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act that's\nWhat it's about now you might say well but she never went to court it doesn't take away the fact that nobody disagrees with what the law is or what she actually did\nWell it's different than the chant by Rosie O'Donnell on the white or in front of the White House you know that is based on\nNothing it's based on false which you know saying that this the current president is an agent of the of of Russia a and that and you know again implying or that and saying in some cases that he got there or to the White House illegally\nIn the in the case of lock her up it's based on a crime but nobody debates was broken by her\n... that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know it we can point to it now again it is rhetoric but it's it's the people what they're what the point that they're making is she should be in jail she's not above the law\nRight and it's also the fact that the system you know lock her up is also an attack of the system and the up yeah and the department of justice at that time for not following the law right\nSo that isn't that isn't a again\nThe same as in any way justifying\nViolence ... and that's\nIs being portrayed I just wanted to hit that 'cause we'd hit that before when when uh uh the you know they were being criticized at the rallies were saying that and when you would read the articles that would say it was horrible\nIf they didn't even understand what the point was that even a wide that people were saying right they didn't even a dress that particular point so if you just you're lock her up lock her up and you have no clue\nAs the majority of Americans don't understand the constitution if you have no clue of what happened in twenty sixteen and its millennial said we don't even care about that right anymore well then you look at it and so yeah it's unfair what they're saying about what's not unfair no you ... if you want to get in we do have a line open your calls and comments coming up eight six six Ninety red eye\nCountries even threaten to

[noise]\n... radio he is our economy and I'm Jerry Mac or if you want to get it we do have a line open in so much to us to talk about but I just wanted to address something\nThat you that you had said during the bottom of the hour and it was you know when we were talking a ... from an earlier conversation and talking about but you know the heated rhetoric of you know calling a Trump Hitler that you know I ... and going back because we brought this up months and months and months ago\nI I don't even know it might have been after the school shooting much I'm not really sure but when we talked about look heated rhetoric out there and what it means you know what you're communicating now we've never been one that have drawn the heated rhetoric\nAnd blame the people of heated rhetoric for somebody resolve and kill somebody we didn't blame Bernie Sanders or anybody else no when ... after the ... shooting we didn't we didn't do that but uh we brought up you know just\nHow inflammatory that kind of rhetoric\nIs because what you're saying is Trump is the same as a guy who committed you know a genocide of six million Jews ... which of course is just the most bizarre statements you could ever make and the only reason you do that is to inflame\nA rage in people that's why you do it ... because you believe that they'll actually by that and they'll be in theory aided\nOr with it and then you've got you've completed the brainwashing by doing that you and I remember that during the Obama administration you brought this up uh uh to me just now when he was being called\nDictator right we had to get on the air and say guy stopped that right went on the issues is not a dictator he won he won he was voted in by the people the United states conservatives and Republicans might have ... distasteful but he's not a dictator well and they we talk about the you know they want the the idea of right the\nThe idea of a him acting uh you know again using the egg executive Penn\nInstead of going to Congress every president has that power we don't agree with that method right but every president has that power um and and you know it was about you know cap and trade and things like that that that he was essentially implemented implementing a through uh the EPA\nEvery president has that power didn't have the power for a recess appointments\nLand lead civil court stopped he lost in right I I think you can find every president eventually you know when they served their their terms have been rejected\nBy the courts in some executive order that they have yeah up you know a put out do they try to stretch the power that they have yeah you have to make 'em dictators no no I think that it would be somebody who was not elected yeah he was the ...\nDuly elected and and the other part of that as we need to remind you that that's how people vote whether it's two thousand eight two thousand twelve\nThis is how the people voted\nUh you don't but the the the Democrats want you to believe that it's not how the people who voted um or there or we shouldn't have the ... like they may every excuse in the book it was the Russians\nAre we've got to get rid of the electoral college that's the problem um the uh the the majority of the people didn't vote for him well this is what it comes down to this is the process we have in place we have it for a reason\nAnd we respect the constitution and that process\nBut I think it's very important as we talked about before for a ... and we we spent quite a bit of time on this this week is for us not to be that don't argue like them right\nRight\nThey have lost because of the way that they have argued mhm so even though it may satisfy your primal urge or instinct to rage out to somebody like they're doing to you and you get a moment of satisfaction out of it it's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times when he was true mhm and when you look\nAt the things that we believe they work\nMhm that's why we promote that that's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down\nTo the issues at hand and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right they'd want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the height\nYou know you and I and and that's why we you talked about dictator remember when uh we we sit here Obama's Muslim and we said where's the evidence right while his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes what does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm\nWhich wasn't preaching you know Islam but was preaching hay and not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America or a\n\nMessage message and thank you very much and [laughter]\nIt's a friday or hate America message ... as he said come on if you look at Obama certainly not religious what do you think\nThat if somebody like Obama worshipped anybody else [laughter] do you really really think that you really think he's a devoted that there is a got up there that tells him what to do and please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence matters across the

general Eric Holder to take sides in that\nAnd they took sides early on and then hold his own Justice Department found out that the whole hands up don't shoot was ally when the FBI did the investigation or are there and they talked about the conspiracy in the neighborhood\nTo keep the truth from coming out hands up don't shoot is still used today mhm when either side does it it's wrong we should be basing our opinions on facts not speculation but we don't do that there is something I don't know what it is maybe it's social media\nWhere people believe that okay I have an audience now and so just like the media there's this third that I'm going to be first and then if I get the right conspiracy theory if I can guess what happened before the facts comes out somehow that gives me some type of journalistic legitimacy\nYeah it's um you know it it because it would be one thing if you had sources right and you were putting together a puzzle but then that's not what this is the speculation\nPure speculation pure speculation based on zero evidence based on nothing you know if a Catherine heritage\nOr says look ... ... it's possible based on the leaks that are coming out or that it is but that somebody who would put pieces of a puzzle together a I think she's done some stellar work I'm a number of stories\nOr over the years but what are you doing you're going to people that have something for you and then ultimately you see if that peace fits into the puzzle or how the narrative starts to build out or how the how the truth I guess starts to come together\nThat's all that is called journalists for those under sixty journalism was very important you go to our nation and its rarely practice true journalism today\nBecause what you have is people wanting to 'em and they believe they're right in doing so I\nHave an opinion and have their work justify their opinion\nOr their behavior their words they believe that they're right we talked about this earlier this week about how the the biased media you know operates\nBecause they believe they're right they don't believe that they're biased they believe it's the right thing to do activism in place of journalism\nIs what we see today more often than not and you when you look at a story especially one like this that still unfolding and and the public we don't we simply don't know all we know is what has been found that's it we have no idea\nAnd we're ... and what the mode and we're still not sure what has been found\nAnd we're still not sure what the nature of what's been found\n\nLet's how do you go to George in New York George welcome you're on Ron I Radio Welcome to the show Hi George\nHey how's it going guys good\nShow um yeah I was calling about um [noise] it seems like there's a lot of uh [noise] that are are going around about um [noise] the damage sleeping in the midterms last I heard Newt Gingrich I think it was a\nReport I charge report I've got where it gets on a panel some\nNews network I don't know which [noise] saying that the Democrats had two or three chance of winning the house and it turns out I'm just wondering if\nYou build up the scale way independent voters now maybe a scam away by his heart and there were just say well you know the law so why bother you\nAre you saying that's why he would use and that's why Newt Gingrich did that\n[noise] well I'm sure I'm not sure about him specifically 'cause you know but in general I mean I think she was first\nOf all ... how do you know that that would scare independence from voting if independence right now are leaning more conservative as the polls sense that they do that would actually encourage independents who leave conservative to me to actually go out and vote\nMaybe well that can be at a point to maybe that was as you point cushy\nI looked at it when when you're talking about political operatives who you know you'd have to ask them what their motivation was and they'd probably be more willing to tell you after election you know why they why they did what they what they did ... and again we have looked at some of the polls out there and we have a question you don't need silver for example we still question\nYou know how how legitimate you know how you can look at all these house races and make these determinations we still have a ton\nOf of questions but when you look at it overall I think the consensus is more that the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house in a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate I think you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with Republican\nYeah in fact I saw something today uh that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it was it was the headline was directed more at the Republican candidates in those races or republic Republicans in in general believing that they were going to keep the Senate\nOr where the house is going I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even\nThrough polls but if you do it strictly by the polls\nRight now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats would take the house that would not be shocking\nOr when you talk about a first term president are often that first midterm\nIs is something where the that shift a power happens that happened with a bronco bomber in two thousand ... right\nAnd so you could look at at at history that dictates says now do we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yeah trend in that area yeah Trump yeah cabinet and that's what I was saying about the\nPolls have you go by the polls in history than than you could look out and go okay about Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate\nThen you look in Nineteen Ninety four ... how did that happen right I was only a talk show host for a couple of years I still remember it how shot everybody was\nAnd said whoa really except for his albino ... nobody really got that one did that and I wouldn't really came out of nowhere how did the Republicans take so many seats mhm well there was this underline you know a underline passion that existed and voting excitement\nFrom a public ... to go out that somehow nobody saw now with the technology today and with the way that we do polling today have we improved it I don't know well and then we'll know a little over a little under two\nWeeks from now call outs is the only way you're going to get an answer for I'm a Republican or conservative in many cases you're not going to see them at protests\nYou're not going to see them at at you might see them at a presidential or the ... the president's rallies but you're not going to see them doing these grassroots rallies but the left is doing right now but the whole get out the vote make sure you out that kind of thing\nOr a independent Bob yesterday and had a post about wow that ... ... a really putting up a

pollsters are our state in here one of them is Trump and the other one is cabin on the other one is the ... going on right now you just have a unique set of circumstances to me in this midterm election that really makes it a a toss\nUp especially in the house because the pollsters are not as active in the house races as we've seen them especially the big national pollsters who have a you

G.\nAnd ... women everything else is leap from the White House what would stop this because it would be if we think it's ... that just assume that it is beneficial to the president potentially that would be a good ...\nLet me backtrack that many things have leaked from the White House I own say every so many things\nWhen you look at the nature of something that if if the White House believed it was going to help or it would it be the position of the chief of staff and advisors to the president that look\nHand this over to the guy gee allow him to do what he does and don't say well the everybody's speculating and the media everybody mhm\nUh about the bombs and then what the motivation is\nNeither speculating ... nobody's even nobody's speculate nobody's analyzing nobody's saying what I haven't seen one story anywhere\nBut maybe one exist that I haven't seen I Would love to see mhm where somebody has made the same points that we have oh wow why did you give it to the inspector general there's only ... the whole thing was trained the story was initially framed that uh we had foreign allies that didn't want us to release this information\nOr we heard one story said it was the British Government because of Christopher Steele and we said well wait a minute why would you pay attention to them they don't know what the top secret information is they don't know what the president had I don't know what you have they don't know what's in the Pfizer warned so why would you pay attention to them\nAnd if you were going to not release it because things were top secret you would have gone\nTo probably your secretary of state who would be dealing with those governments and there's also an ex director of the CIA and you'd be going to Dan Coats your own director of national intelligence you wouldn't be giving it to the inspector general\nWho only looks for one thing\nAnd that's corruption and therefore once it was declassified\nAnd people saw what was declassified in the White House they looked in said there are probably possible crimes here\nAnd before we released is we need to first give it to the inspector general\nOf the United states to go after the corruption that we see\nHow come nobody has written that story right and if somebody has I haven't seen it I've not seen any major publication right the possibility of that story and why this all went to the inspector general why would you give it to the inspector general you saw something that you believe warranted his offices action\n\nAnd what his office deals with is corruption so you're giving him the only the only path that you can go down is you're giving him evidence of corruption in the FBI and the department of justice there's no other pass to go down right\nAnd nothing on the story right\nBecause if you didn't believe if if the president looked at that and didn't\nBelieve there was some kind of wrongdoing\nThan there would be no reason to contact or was it would be only if you believe if you saw it and said wow this looks like there's a possible wrongdoing within the department of justice\nThat's up to ... to write to report let's handed over because that's what the inspector general does\n... and by the way we'd be bringing this up and thanks to many of our listeners who I get a few a week ... people running the emails saying\nWhat's going on right what's what you guys walking around saying do you hear anything I mean we haven't seen any stories on it either what's going on I mean that should be one of the biggest stories right now and and who should be reporting this biggest story who should be encouraging it Republicans are they no\nNo no no\nAnd I would think that that the media would be curious I Would think\nThat uh Katherine Harris ... or someone else like that would be curious you know anyone that that is a not in the mainstream media but ... but you know someone who has done some really great work in all ...

Seventeen ... ... and they really go back to you know the president's real you know the really the first budget when he had no influence on his when looking at right\nOr to growing at a two point nine percent rate since April twenty Seventeen\nSo there's a huge difference in defense spending that turnaround added a point to one percentage points to the ... on average to the nation's\nEconomic growth rate according to the Commerce Department when a including faster spending on non defense items and spending at state and local levels increase government spending\nAccounted for a point three four percentage point of the point seven percent point increase in the growth rate since April twenty Seventeen which means\nUh the economy has grown a two point nine percent uh since April of twenty Seventeen the last quarter was what for for one was ... right ... was it was a very good courtroom or almost half of that has been because of government spending\nIf now it has also increased other factors are at play faster business investment due in part to energy investing can trigger point contributed point three percentage points to the growth rate\nFaster consumer spending accounts for about a third of the pick up a slowdown in home building has some attracted\nTwo percentage points from that growth rate\nThe concern is as we have said before is wants to government spending moderate than that increase goes away and as we said before the true growth\nAnd if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent uh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democrat president or the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the truth expansion of well\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increase in government spending\nOr you would have had a a a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "26"}
