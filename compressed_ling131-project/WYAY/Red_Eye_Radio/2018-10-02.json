one time why why it was important\nFor me\nWas showing me that I'm foolish especially from the start from we'll never let me say\nTiger Woods lived with the Ryder Cup here and the new talk when I was six seven actual live feed the tumors shouldn't secret microphone arthritic over their parents who say three fifty seven I hold on years of valor repeat or the new talk one oh six seven on five Valerie welcome aboard how you doing what's up\nI'm doing great thanks for taking my call yes ma'am and I was just having a thought about the\nFact that he said when he left the party he went home why didn't you tell her parents were worried that he would\nGet in trouble or being at a party when you drink beer so he doesn't you know tell anybody or her parents about this alleged assault until now thirty six years later and Senate hanging her ... getting grounded for being with me and you gonna run with him I didn't really it as a family like\nValerie not only that let and let me say this and again I'm hoping that people don't understand meticulous runway especially women but\nHere okay here's a woman who is apparently happily married has a family she has a bachelors degree two master's degree\nA PHD and she's a college professor\nBoy I guess her life was really ruined after this horrible event when she was Fifteen I mean she came out pretty good you know this was like being on it this way I like being I'm Sorry I just I feel so bad for women who actually have had\nThings happened to them that affected their lives and and this woman does not represent rape victims is is a political smear campaign that is what you represent\nAnd I and our ironically she's a victim to she didn't want to be out of it was the Democrats are thrown under the bus for the publicity and for the purpose of trying to psych rent\nThe nomination and it it's a it's a scandal and it's an embarrassment to all women it's just it's a shame for all women because of what they're trying to do for political reasons Valerie I feel bad for you honest to God I Do\n[laughter] appreciate it I feel bad for her but I have\nAn idea that thank you Valerie and here's a Debbie Deborah I'm Sorry Deborah and a new dog one of those six seven I ... I\nI just wanted to say don't lose faith in women because there are a lot of women out there\nWho think that this woman is a liar and she is and the real victim here is judge Kavanaugh yeah I'm a victim I'm a victim of assault and guess what I Know the ceiling of not being able to report something because the perpetrators going to kill you and you know that for a fact\nI Know that feeling what she did sit up there and acted like a victim of a ... call her in the civil service arena twenty five years in civil service\nWhich you have this Feinstein had a mandatory uh obligation to\nProtect us now hold onto it projects week political junkie can report it\nAnd no one is how holding her accountable no one is mentioning the fact that this woman had a vendetta against judge Kavanaugh because of his mother ... because his mother was a\nIt goes on judge her yeah exactly against her family and that's what this is a personal vendetta ... I don't know who\nThe real heroes here is judge Kavanaugh's why that's a real woman because I think if it were me I Would have lost my mind's yeah well and\nShe was wrong I saw her and she didn't blink an eye she I mean she was so strong she was like a rock their weight in it and his poor parents can you imagine this kind of thing with your mother and father sitting there behind listening to all ...\nOh I mean just pick a ball and disgusting and all these women who are out there who are getting in people's faces you know what I'm a woman and they do deserve to be punched in the face they really do they want to act like men yeah they should be treated like\nMen Debra glad you called thank you they're not you are from a real woman you know and then with a woman that's an that's a real woman and these politicians ... because they're afraid of the women's vote yeah don't they realize a lot of women agree with\nKavanaugh yeah and and the problem is it's the old that the problem with the old quote silent majority whatever that means women women like Deborah are not going to march in the streets with a sign and take a day off from work or whatever to protest against\nYou know the left or something they got stuff to do that got wives they you know taking care of things that are going to ...\nPm the dot com studio why why Gainesville option where\nMe I investigate from Boston I guess memorial I'm only a forensic we'll talk with Kevin O's high school\nFriend mark judge but they say the interview was not your complete the moral majority leader Mitch McConnell wants to the chamber to vote on the nomination last week of course one or two men and\nWith the story has been shifting in terms of what the limitations on what the FBI can do I've actually been told multiple senators have reached out to the White House Susan Collins in particular was in counsel patience with the White House\nAbout making sure that there were limits on what the FBI can do now it's worth noting when the discussions were had on friday about the scope of the investigation the focus was really on the first two accusers not the third accused of the one represented by Michael ... white\nNow I don't I have no idea uh who would pursue anything if there is anything that could pursue for her given a sworn statement but we were giving were were given by ... uh the the media was given\nA a document that had her making statements as fact and then she walks back but I think this is what the president was getting at you know so many things have changed in this entire thing you could look at the claims\nAnd depending on what is said to the FBI in these interviews you could be looking at\nFor Dr Ford and I think this is what her attorneys\nAre worried about I think it's why they were so anxious over the weekend remember they said over the weekend we've contacted the FBI trying to set up the interview and as of Sunday they were saying you know no interview yet they haven't talked to her\nWell why would you want to do it so soon after testimony because you want to keep her on track you don't want to change in her story\nNow yuppie ice not going to do anything against her and I don't know that there would be any action against her except for the fact that she was under oath last Thursday so whatever she said then her comments to the FBI are part of the process\nVetting Kavanaugh and if they differ from her testimony there will be questions\nAnd so the the left is coming out and this is why I think they're also going for perjury or for Kavanaugh they keep making up these bogus perjury things that aren't going anywhere\nAre and all of them have to deal with the amount of alcohol that he's drinking and he was never very ... who was having said well listen I was very clear to only have a four four ounces of\n[laughter] which I found a ham and dabbling in a dad okay\nFor those under the age of Seventeen Ritchie Cunningham was a a character and a show called happy happy days yeah yeah right but it was on all through the eighties all them wandering was fed and now Ritchie Cunningham as a as a as a liberal a director but his\nBrother yes is it can serve and that's right and so he at Ron Howard\nWho were ... anyway so if that ask them well because then I you know I just had you know this these tiny little drinks well how many did you have Seventy\n[laughter] and I had a [laughter] I Love that episode it was great I'll I'll never forget a you know the you know looking at it that rich you face because he actually [laughter]\nRon Howard ... trunk I thought man that's good acting but if if Kavanaugh had come out and made certain planes I was clear to only have one drink at any function he didn't say that in fact at the time in my mind when I was watching it\nI was almost critical of him and I thought no\nActually this is exactly how judges are they're very forthcoming especially about anything that they have done in their past or to this extent it's just not criminal behavior to the\nOf throwing the was the exactly throwing the ice at a bar you might according to one police report he might have thrown ice right yes yeah and he never says he threw eyes but in the police report someone claims they threw eyes and the guy's ear was bleeding\nWhat people's ears bleed altogether deer ears leaving was not from the U.S [laughter] that was from the other person's throwing down here they said look I'm\nPaying attention to this because damage I Need to know how you know\nAll matters is that it was listed as an assault and somebody was bleeding\nSo you've got to think like a liberal updated so this is but this is the the ...\nIn my sanity by the way you know I'm laughing huh I was a club DJ for years yeah I saw a massive bar fights and why would I in my time and and\nAnd all the oil field workers in the ... are probably asleep right now but uh out in West Texas or screaming the guy got to leave the bar with his ear intact oh [laughter] well the recall that a good day\nSo here's the thing I'm [laughter] actually comes from a real scenario um but at the the entire equation has to be distorted and there has to be this distraction\nRight and now it's about what did he know when did he know it about the claims right because the text messages now show well that that he knew about the Ramirez claim ahead of time before it got\nTo the media well okay here's the here's the concern I think for the Democrats is that the president has essentially directed the yard to talk to anybody and everybody who might be relevant to the situation will that includes\nPeople who were supposed to have corroborated if they've got the FBI agent sitting in front of them they're going to be nervous they're going to ... and and I wonder how the story is going to change and again if it does I Wonder where this thing\nGo while just it just as you're talking about that just as we're talking about this this comes across a from our news feed from uh from Westwood One okay our company guy\nSo Westwood One is Eric Swalwell ... the the us representative from California and I took her curls before this guy's a piece of work yeah and it just comes across as you're talking or just how do you mean to interrupt you but it's ... yeah it's a Swalwell Senate cabin all lies are disqualifying\nAnd I went well what are the lies or above out right apparently I've ... I've not listen to this audio cup and I'm going to play it here okay a but it's as a former college costs would have Brett Kavanaugh says the Supreme Court nominee was not truthful about his drinking mhm here we go All right let's play this\nTypically this would not be disqualifying for any Supreme Court nominee the fact that they frankly in college like most people in college do however it is disqualify him because he has painted himself as a choir boy who never engaged in any of his behavior wrong and I'll\nSay wrong he lied wrong there's ... that's the whole point of lying disqualify you from the Supreme Court then you need to step down from office\n[laughter]\nWe'll say we'll say it again CNN did the interview over the weekend with one of them cabinets former classmates\nI Would have stayed on the sideline if he had said I drank to access in high school\nI drink to excess in college I did some stupid things but never sexually assaulted anybody his actual comments I drank beer with my friends sometimes I had too many beers sometimes other did I like beer I still like beer but I didn't drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone where's\nThe perjury there [laughter] and that's it the leftists rambling so hard right now frankly I leave the fears thank God it gave me that Eric Swalwell well in this this entire thing as a gift\nTo the Republicans if you're a Democrat right now you should be worried about this ... this behavior right now by your party this should concern you greatly because here's the difference\nThe blue wave may happen in the house Nancy Pelosi I'm going to be speaker again\nI'm don't grab the keys just yet Nancy even if you do when\nIn the Senate\nYou and I you were going over some polls are some recent polls are some that had Thursday included but not just Thursday and that's that's important because of this right the hearing\nBut if you look at these polls in the Senate they're very close right now\nAnd if you get a a a a couple of other seats a couple of more seats for the Republicans\nIn the Senate\nThey can afford to lose the columns on the next Supreme Court\nNominee I mean I you you look at it I mean we were looking at uh the the New Jersey Senate mhm or hugging versus a Menendez Robert Menendez come at the Democratic incumbent right and and it says if you look at the real clear politics open ended up\nBy for well the Quinnipiac poll in August with registered voters had him up by six the Stockton University poll that goes to the twenty seven to last Thursday of likely voters that's more accurate\nOr a has a Menendez only up by who yeah and that's the margin of error for points very\nWell again this is not over and you're a\nDemocrat and you should be absolutely worried about this because I I never in my lifetime in my adult lifetime I don't remember the Republicans being this health\nOr an motivate Kramer over high camp just out from the seventeenth or NBC valley news from the Seventeen to twenty seven there's just a a came out alright six hundred and fifty likely voters he breaks the fifty one percent he's fifty one to forty one over Heidi Heitkamp yeah\nNow that goes to the twenty seven\nOr Donnelly in a in ... in Indiana\nOr the Fox news poll a but that goes to the that's the latest one of just until the eleventh of September but still a his uh his ah were Republican I'm\nA\nOpposition Braun is up by two now that was before any of this you know ... eleven that was really before we got an any of this and and so I just wonder really what the polls are going to say that are going to be\nYou know the latter part of this week in the polls are going to be coming out now much more frequently as we get closer to the election we got a great show had

don't know of anything right now the brings\nThem back from the brink than in our lifetime because\nThis is what happened last friday\nWhen Jeff Flake is confronted and the ... and then those who confronted him later that day said this is why we go direct what it did was to justify and attempt to legitimize the shouting about Ted\nCruz out of a restaurant even though that same restaurant is not hired security guards it is they see it as well it worked\nAnd this is why we're going direct this is why we will keep doing this because they believe again they're going to get the same reaction that they got out of Jeff Flake well\nNewsflash he admitted in the sixty minutes interview if he were up for reelection that would have never happened you never would have gotten him together with Coons that agreement to delay this thing and have an FBI background check this week\nWould never have happened he admitted it he doesn't care what the people of Arizona I think he doesn't care what the people think he only cares what the people think if it served\nHim him and so this entire equation um ... is is the what they see is the momentum\nNow here's the problem the party has and by the way to the party we need to repeat these people don't care about you either\nThey don't they don't care that Jeff Flake had disdain as a Republican for Donald Trump after he got with tunes and they came up with disagree\nAnd to do this FBI background check\nStarted screaming it's not enough and so they don't care about anybody in the party\nBut the future of the party is certainly in question when this kind of behavior derives that paints a picture for the rest of America and as you mentioned Gary earlier that twenty percent of the middle that look at this and say and all of the all of the people watching\nThat NBC interview was sweating it where she's walking back and see how the state\nThat they couldn't corroborate her then there ain't no story that New York times of course did that

near the punch bowl I don't actually know if he was putting drugs and and I don't know if he was putting drugs in the punch and he was\nHanging out with people in the hallway I don't know if he was actually lined up but it seems like she said it seems like a that's a strange coincidence no it's not\nActually it's not you could have people at a party that would never condone that kind of behavior and still not know that it's going on behind closed doors\nOr in the the fact that they ran with the story to begin with shows you word journalism that Abdel ... no you're absolutely right that trash

A. Y. Janesville ...\nWe should explain currently being court I'm Elliot Francis Republican senator so called the White House the stress that they expect a complete investigation and the FBI reviews obligations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh corresponded to medically explains the process\nOf White House has to order it than the FBI goes does his interviews does its review\nMentions that information back to the White House the White House then sends that to the Senate whole hundred senators because it's the Supreme Court nomination will have access to that information\nBut they'll have to read it in a private room that information cannot be released publically only very limited number of staffers will have access to that information so that raises a key question that I've been talking a lot of senators and top aides about\nAt and and it's a it's a good message you will convince the independence and that's what we've always stated and we've always received ... the response but you can't convince everybody we're not attempted to convince everybody that that's the wrong premise you're not attempting to convince\nEveryone the poll found that even if uh he ... the the FBI comes out and find snow cooperation sixty percent of Democrats still don't want 'em confirmed for well dug\n\nCould be it could be Mother Teresa alive and and\nThey would still not want him to be a confirmed the point is a ... is the evidence there to make her testimony credible and it absolutely is not and that's the message\nThat you need to get about you know you need to get across and there needs to be a consistent message there you go to social media and the questions are being asked\nJust are just bizarre and if you look at the media and that's why we started off the show with it and when you look at what\nUh uh for example the the the uh uh a Yale I'm of the the person who went to Yale\nWith a class have another classmate ... and you know and she came across instead of if you don't want or you said this and then you look at his testimony well he did say that they're actually to the point now where the liberals this is how bad is you're asking will they ever get off the brink lower to the\nPoint where they're making an accusation he's line really yes he should've said this well he did see he's line no but you said if he said this wouldn't be line nobody's line but he said that\nI mean that's where we are right at a media carries the exact media gives that life because here's here's the difference\nIf you look at the case of the New York times talking about\nThe the ah\nThe accusations made in the New Yorker piece they this\nIs what they wanted to do they want to do their their their tactic on this story this claim was to go find an interview as many people as possible to see if they had first hand knowledge of this happening\nThey couldn't find one NBC goes out and says well we couldn't find anybody to back it up but we're going to put her on any way the ... classmate\nActually makes a statement that parallels what Kavanaugh said and said if you said this then I wouldn't have a problem\n\nBut still the media carries the story because what you're looking to do is it if I were writing that story if it were my work to put that story into print or put it on TV or anywhere else\nIt would be my approach to say\nUh this is going to be torn to shreds because what she said and I need to go back over to this is what I Would do I would get the transcript\nAnd I would read it and read it again because she's claiming the classmate is claiming he didn't say something when he did it's an all out lie but if you're in the media and you're taking that story to print a TV to whatever\nYou're part of the lie\nBecause it took another media organization to tear it down and say well I'm actually he did say that\nOr does it ever feel like that\nAnd and and this does not come from arrogance whatsoever because you know that we refer to ourselves Institute idiots overnight\nBut does anyone ever get the feeling and this is a doesn't include just you and me are but everybody listening right there does it ever get to the point where you just think to yourself\nDealing with the Democrats right now the mainstream Democrats is like dealing with our children yes and the excuses the children will give yeah and I'm not saying that ... out of meanness I'm Talking about the arguments that they are making you know you and I said this\nUh last week\nSaid the American people when you basically they understand due process\nAnd if you talk about the due process in what the Democrats are doing here and not you know the belief and\nYou know that you're innocent until proven guilty but the fact of what they used to claim they cared about ... you know that's what the liberals are to care about\nAnd in fact they do and I said but if you keep pushing it the majority of Americans do believe in that even Democrats say they won't vote for cabinet they still view this as a cheap shot against him yes they view it as if you if you get them alone and you ask\nThem they'll tell you that oh by the way one of the uh\nUh people that I Know on social media that uh doesn't talk much used to talk more as a liberal\nAnd has been quiet over the last year came out in favor of Kavanaugh wow and and did it in a very subtle way and I was like wow but if you actually talk to Democrats right now they're not happy with the way that the ... the the this is actually going\nOr they won't come out publicly and criticize their party for what they're doing but they feel very uncomfortable and they understand there is no evidence here they understand and then they see this just rolling and ... and that's the whole point\nThat many Republicans look at this and go wow are you kidding me they're going down this path and now they're they're just taking anonymous sources and throwing it out I mean this is just so slimy and so dirty yeah or against Kavanaugh because there is no cooperating evidence there is no evidence\nAnd look people aren't stupid that will sit there and say this\nReally stinks well and that's that's it because it does that they'll look at the forward and say\nAll these go find me accounts another now of what a million or over a million dollars what are the world's going on here the lawyers were pro bono you're talking about an airplane flight ... why is all this money being a rate it looks dirty yes it\nAll looks dirty and the American public and that's why when you bring it up about the cooperation and when people actually look into it and you you said it earlier to me good uh off the air\nYou said this is really liked the experience that we have\nWith Capra Nick that you have no idea that cap regular it's about free speech to wired you're watching the ... well look I'm not angry it's just I don't prefer to watch it because of\nAnd you explain what he actually did and you explained the pig socks every single\nPerson that supported Kaepernick had no that that I've talked to and it's in the hundreds over the last year ... had no idea about the cop pigs sucks right once you bring that up to go it's a good point they had no idea about Michael Bennet ... no idea that Michael Bennett who was the catalyst\nOne of the catalysts last year and has become one of the leaders\nOf the movement who was also you know in the locker room yesterday for Philly ... got famous and became the poster person last year mhm to continue with because he lied about the Las Vegas police every single person that was supporting Kaepernick didn't know about that either\nAnd they went oh oh okay yeah that is bad and I'll leave it at that I won't judge them\nAnd but you can tell they know when you bring up things that are common sense to people when you bring up something like fairness\nAnd the\nPreponderance of evidence before finding somebody guilty that it has to exist somewhere there's a reason that NBC wouldn't run Mitchell's report why wouldn't they run it\nBecause\nThey know that he'd been there a few listeners there doesn't listeners viewers that that are left even if they're liberal would say\nYeah not good right and\nWhy do you do that to adults why don't you want adults to know the truth right why we don't hide anything on the show there's nothing I Would hide\nAny news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't they right why will they hide things that are important\nTo a story and even if they disagree with it analyze it right but they they as we talked about before we talked last week about lying through omission mhm and a lot of stories out there now right or the short lived through omission we just won't include parts of it and if and while they'll\nGive an interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right they will ignore a key piece to the actual an official piece of the actual procedure the actual process in place they ignore it completely\nBut when you give Americans when you start telling Americans will look here's what's going on with this case and you lay it out to them that's why all of a sudden you go to\nYou know sixty percent say oh or fifty seven percent say oh we didn't know okay\nYeah that that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation well and if the FBI finds out there's no one sixty percent of Americans believe that that's almost all of independence mhm yeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always get this and we've talked about the administration and said look you can uh\nMore successes if you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because well you never convince the liberals that's not your goal is not\nYour goal and and you know it's like Jeff Flake saying you know what I'm saying when I went to Coons I I was just I was telling them this is tearing our country apart we have to we have to do something well who's responsible for the damage right you're going to the person that tearing the country apart yeah and telling me up just stumped telling them you're

talk about when you look at these specific sub of what's going on with Kavanaugh\nNobody wants to focus in and say okay what's the actual thing everybody's off into a different tangent the same on on on the economics and trade everybody picks their own little corner and they stick with it instead of saying okay what is the result when you raise prices overall\nAnd that's what the president has done in the free trade agreement and our trade negotiators have done he has made cars more expensive\nTo buy in Mexico in the United states and in Canada were all in it together yeah the cost of buying a car in the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric you mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused instead\nEric ... uh but as you said yesterday or the and you and I've been doing some some uh uh reading an analysis\nOn this is that her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of ways to finance them and so what are people looking to do that looking to buy used vehicles\nYes and that's driving by market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles they used vehicles and the price goes up\nAnd so for some people on the what they believe this is ... none of it's personal it's all economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president things because of president or even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things ... and that's one of the bad things as automobile now it could've been a lot worse than what he was promoting before\nBut the fact is it didn't affect probably Ninety eight percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing as we said what happened we had predicted look who's going to be all this hype all the soup ... and what we're going to basically get\nIs the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here or there they get a little victory and timber we get a little victory and dairy\nThe big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states in Canada and Mexico that you that consumers are going to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship\nCars from the United states anywhere else and the president views that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great victory\nRight yeah and I I think if you look here's where the tell will be\nYou'll see certain industries that the reason the automobile industry is is key to the economy is because you look at the the the how often now people purchase vehicles right\nOr more and more they're holding on to their cars so that hurts the ... because well they want the stuff off the assembly line to be sold\nYou make that more expensive you start hurting an industry you start seeing layoffs as a result of that\nThen and then also make the used cars by default more expensive and you're going to see not just the automobile industry but of course all the dealerships\nAnd all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms\nOf those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that because people will choose as they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time because that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else\nWe're not talking about well whether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car or electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce that it's hard to come by it that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine\nHow expensive it's going to be for us that's the difference\nAnd we view it as a victory and as we've said nobody can explain to us why\nThat's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy you know again that that's moving in and in some of the agriculture stop where we do have more free trade now because of it and we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine\nBut it's almost as if we make the victory over there and we've done we shoot ourselves in the foot on automobiles now the other good thing is Canada will like this would be was mentioned with the timber\nThat the president in all likelihood will be lifting the terror if they put on timber and now that has to go to a panel to decide whether\nA candidate is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction\nIn the United states because that timber will be coming over\nAnd that was a fear builders that housing prices were going to skyrocket another construction from the use of of would because of the Canadian timber and hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down so there's wins and there's losses across the board but but overall if the president is stating\nThat the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs and the aluminum terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on it\nWell and that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and if people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase\nOn on vehicles and you start seeing that slide you start seeing the economy slide and that will be your tell this is what the the Bush administration saw steel terrorists they saw companies leaving the country\nAnd they said this can't stand we cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this because the the job loss will be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those still terrorists ah prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right\nAnd so uh you know the president which was called a victory fine we just do the analysis on the reality of economic\nSlump he gives me when he ... he just got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China there's the then ... and by the way politically you can get away with that all day long to it's going to it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by the world Trade Organization rules\nThen not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with China need to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy in it is going it it has to be effective because\nI don't know how you can put a cost on on trying to not playing by the rules and stealing intellectual property time and time again and getting away with\nEight six six Ninety rod I\n[noise] for six weeks\nOh really [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by

you're on radio walk into the show\nAre you doing today very good\n\nYou're on the radio entered yeah yeah I Want to tell them how can the Republicans cry now when they created all the problems that they're going through right now how is this date they've talked about\nMoving in a field goal post they chose to fill goal posts all still feel well we couldn't even kicked the feel go\nDavid ... explain how what are you talking about\n[noise] okay if they would uh let Obama appointed\n... at least ... we might not even being a situation where cabinet can has\nOkay let's break this down then like All right All right well let's break it down let's break it down now let's break it down okay as you've made your major what you're saying is uh the Republicans put themselves in this particular situation okay let's say that they did because Merrick Garland was not you know given a given given a chance\nYeah ... ... yeah and you know why they won't blow I'm we understand both on the way we understand let me speak let me respond okay what you are stadium then is\nThat in a republic\nThe representatives said get elected and the party that gets more representatives elected by the people they get to make the rules and regulations of that particular body you're dating since the Republicans won ...\nAnd they could control that body which means control that nomination because in or what the public\nIt is the majority representatives of that party they get to make the decisions that since they make a decision that you disagree with its okayed defame somebody's reputation\nNo I'm not saying that what I'm saying is this first of all\nThat's a lifetime for this so\nThey get to go over your whole life when you and your mom wall if you did something wrong at that point or someone witnessed it that's part of your life twinkle when your whole life not says part of your life\nWell and I serve in London and we'll I Want to thank you I Want to thank you for your call because you now have you thank you so much for calling us up to now saying it goes into the womb mhm so now according to a Democrat it's not a woman's body anymore right\n\n[noise] but I'm not sorry [laughter] well wait we're Indians or not we should go back to daycare when do I know it\nBut no it goes back to what we originally said that the if you're in power you get to make the rules mhm right\nWell keep in mind though that position was nothing new uh on the Senate for back in the day the Democrats held the same position because it was just as much out of respect for Hillary Clinton as it was for Donald Trump remember\nThat scenario was that the new president should should pick their nominee right and I ... and that did not that was not there was not a given at that point that Trump was going to win\nWell no the the end but the point is that this was like dealing with the woman that was on CNN last week was the the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why Harry Reid decided to change the rules of the Senate when he was\nThe head of the Senate when it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that\nUh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules are going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice\nYeah the people in power we get to ... these aren't laws were not changing laws were simply changing rules the Senate that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections as what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's okay to fame some buddies or what is it the same somebody's character because that's the reality of how a Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got into the point that we now have to go back into the womb when you have a life time yeah position so that uh that anybody agree with them that we need to go back to the moon I'm all Supreme Court justices we need to go back to the boom\nEra currently here for the sink Christopher truckers relief fund\nIf you could help a truck driver get back to work make their pile of bills less daunting give them one less worry wouldn't

they'll jak welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nGood morning I Wonder if some sixteen year old to night posted something on Twitter or Instagram that will keep them from becoming a job\nFive years from now but my point is that Senator Flake man actually ... the Republican Party by calling for this investigation you you're a senator\nIn a a purple shall we say state or a state where your reelection is a tough one\nA year now and say hey look I was kind of go towards not going to end or I was leaning towards voting for him\nI wasn't sure I sat through the hearings and like so many Americans I couldn't make up by my only cold than the FBI did a full investigation and any reasonable person would say that there's no real conclusion after that investigation under the vote for him so I think this is that's the gay she\nGives some cover to Republicans\nWho may have been afraid to alienate some of their email or voters and then gives them a little political cover to vote yes\nWell there's this only works if they if the polls since Thursday which will start rolling in over the next couple of days that by the ... by the end of the week those polls show that the American people are not with them that the but more importantly the senators in those states especially where it's close\nA are not getting the support of their voters and their stage a and ultimately it only works if the vote is to confirm Kavanaugh because it doesn't work for the Republicans if he does not get confirmed or it becomes still a very very much so an uphill battle\nOr even in November even though I Do believe that this whether he's confirmed or not will work for them politically I don't know too what effect in November at the mid term\nAnd I think the Democrats plan is it doesn't really matter what happens with Ford anymore it's let's get at whatever other allegations that we have to try to delaying that's yet they really want yeah\nYeah they want for their delay there are going to want Ramirez to have a hearing or\nYou know there will be a coal somewhere along the way when they know the voters inevitable and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying on Monday that there will be a vote this week and so we don't know when that's going to be I'm assuming Saturday there could be a vote on the floor but we don't know\nUm he said it's time for delays I'm hurt his ... yeah so they could\nDo that Sunday and get a cabinet seated on a by Monday morning he would only miss a week of Scottish material and could easily get caught up we'll see if that happens [noise]\n\n\n\nIs

point two trillion dollars over the last year mhm right you want to make this I'll make it simple for you okay so I did the figures in my head or something that you and I came up with um what was it maybe ten years ago I Can't remember ... okay when I was swimming in my pool ... and instead of thinking things that normal people think\nI was thinking to myself how do I simplify the budget situation so everybody can understand that within thirty seconds and then they can say okay they can relate to it because you say billions and trillions in a\nLab a blah blah blah blah blah or\nThe situation we're in right now okay yeah 'cause the ... the budget just\nEnded what just September thirtieth just sun ... last year or so and these are all rough estimate but but um if you if you took the federal budget and put it put it and basically somebody who\nLast year made thirty six thousand dollars okay okay so this is the situation that we're in right now in this country\nA as a person that made thirty six thousand dollars last year you spent\nForty point four thousand\nFor a ... a forty thousand four hundred dollars is what you spent\nRight and you made to thirty six thousand right you have the\nOutstanding debt\nA of a\nMissing make sure we get this right here two hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars\nThis year\nYour salary is gone down to thirty four thousand dollars and you're going to spend forty four thousand dollars\nAnd your current debt\nIs two hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars with bills that must be paid over the next two years of one to two million

that easy like the movies and the yes that sort of an inside joke with us we we just we always tease him we always tease him on that show uh there's where we are right now as a nation\nOf a fiscally does anybody believe that that's a good situation to be and would anybody want to I wouldn't want to be in that situation\nYou know\nEspecially with the bills that have to come do over the next ten years when you're talking about the millions and you're making thirty what something thousand a year yeah right\nIt's time to ration your Rahman but no we we don't want to do that we don't want to
