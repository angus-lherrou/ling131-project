I think that's the name of the Portland airport or even the city of Portland was organized by patriot leader Joey Gibson a response to Portland mayor ... wheelers oversight of the city's police department you may remember he doesn't want the police department to do anything most of the time that's what's great part of the problem\nSo in my opinion is preventing them from doing their job I bet you if you interviewed the police they would say the same thing hey just let us do our job we they cannot I Can't imagine that they like to see violence take place on either side but this is just one indication of how the nonviolent civil war is turning violent\nAnd you're currently I Know you know as you certainly can't speak on college campuses without interruptions or the threat of violence if you're a conservative on college campuses that's not a problem for the left or liberal to speak\nWhere the you know if you remember the free exchange of ideas was supposed to be the role of the day if you go to college campuses you'll often see that somewhere that they talk about truth and the exchange of ideas that's not taking place anymore\nAnd of course now you can't even go to a restaurant or have privacy in your home\nIf you're on the conservative side of an issue in the opposite side recognize you or knows where you live they were giving out one guy right he was arrested and think last week for giving out phone numbers of various senators and addresses and he did it on the government computer\nAnd just this past week the state Republican Party headquarters in New York was vandalized they smash windows and spray painted the doors with anarchy symbols\n... left behind in the building read that the attack was putting the Republican Party on notice mentioned as they continue there's a code heart attack is merely a beginning we're not pass if we are not civil and we will not apologize uh-huh unquote\nBy the way maybe they're following up on Hillary's remarks did you hear what she said this week where she said Democrats can't be civil with Republicans during Donald Trump's presidents I Wonder what would have happened if she had one\nAnd Republicans said the same thing we certainly can't be civil until Hillary Clinton's term is over\n... of course get it if you wear a make America had ... anywhere you're you're in danger you are in jeopardy I mean it's amazing what's going on out there\nYou may be put in your life in danger and even putting a sign in your yard or on your car risks great property damage but it may be getting worse than that\nWith the shootings of congressmen so what was it about a year ago who serious injuries though Steve is ... ... who could have been murdered\nAnd of course on an order ... from the very beginning I forget which actress or singing or whatever was I don't fault those people there was a threat to blow up the White House or worse you know I remember that and Senator Rand Paul said recently you've always fears about possible deadly force being used\nAnd who can say for sure that he's wrong you said it's it's gonna happen if this continues at something like that is going to happen the left and the Democrats and the media which kind of dissolves think these days the meat is not supposed to me like that but it sure seems to me that they're on the left\nThey can't accept the fact that President Trump won the resistance as you know that's what they call it\nStarted before he was even president and there may have been we're finding out now a soft coup against him to remove him from office\nMore and more information is coming out about that\nBut by the way we were not supposed to find out the information Hillary is supposed to win and Obama said he was gonna win and there was no reason that you wouldn't when we went and found out about any of the stuff that that makes me think like a banana republic\nBut there were those in this country they were ready to overthrow the will of the people in whatever fashion they could so in my opinion that was the beginning of the civil war may have star before that but that with what's been going on with the President Trump\nTo overthrow sitting president to go against the will of the people just because you don't like the results let's let first is right and it continues they have President Trump so much\nThat anything goes because they have truth on their side they can't imagine this a shock to them when I say it on other shows\nThat there probably an equal number of people that were devastated by the election of President Obama I Do for many resistance but I got to be honest I I like to count the days are okay this years over you know all you have three more years left of him\nBut that I didn't never occurs to them because they're so arrogant to begin with\nSo why don't you tell me if you agree with me how bad things have gotten between the two sides in this country and do you think we're fighting for the soul of our country\nThat there is such a thing as I Believe as American exceptionalism that is under attack along with our basic institutions free speech and I love that's under attack what we used to think of traditional marriage\nFrom individual rights to free market capitalism these are all under attack and if I Am right what are you doing about the upcoming elections to make sure we don't lose the house\nWhere impeachment hearings they said this now learned some of the other two by the way if you imagine who is going to lead these committees like during the Adler Maxine Waters no she's going to the banking matter what you would do\nI Want to know what you're doing about making sure this doesn't happen impeachment hearings will likely began the day the Democrats are sworn it they're going to try to teach President Trump and they've got they've already said they're going to try to teach cabinet and you're going to have hearings for ever\nTell me what you think of what you're doing about this at eight six six Ninety red eye and this whole week I'm filling in on red eye radio but just a couple of more points to consider\nWhile you're calling and I want to add that the extreme hatred for President Trump is palpable you can feel it I Know Hillary was all set to be crowded and they were shocked by President Trump's win but the hatred for him knows no limits\nPart of it I'm sure is what they regard as his unsophisticated behavior in a good part of it is his personality which can easily alienate people I knowledge that use difficult sometimes especially with the things he says he often says things you shouldn't especially on Twitter any picks fights where they should be not\nHe demeans the White House she I'm being caused by answering some of his outrageous critics\nAnd he's clearly incapable of accepting much of any criticism I get that all of a few of us are but the spice his personal short ... I think I better and see the softly so some of those in the left don't have a breakdown\nOf the mayor had half half breakdown judging from what is going on these days I think President Trump has done a great job as president\nThat's right I didn't even say a good job I said great job now you can disagree of me but then vote him out of office don't try to undo the election results\nThose on my side didn't try to undo a modest when there was no such thing as resistance\nMake sure you guys on the other side you get the vote on on your side if we lose fairly we lose but don't set up ... and use the power of government to destroy your opponents this what happens in banana republics not the United states of America don't destroy what makes this country so unique and so exceptional\nSo I Want to know do you agree that there's a civil war going on in our country\nAre you prepared to fight back to save our country let me know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye I'm Mark ice are filling in on red eye radio and the guys will be back next week so I'll be with you this Sunday Thursday\nSo I said he's done a great job tell me if you agree with me and certainly call me if you disagree more gosh they're on ...

seven thirty three thirty nine Robert in San Antonio you're on with mark Hi Robert\nHey good ... a good evening I Believe you're completely correct when you say that the left has a convince themselves they're good and the right as bad I Wonder when you can correct me if I'm wrong but I Wonder if the right uh you know sort of copying their civil war language can be dangerous I Know\nI'm twenty five and are just getting off the coast campus um the younger right we is a really um [noise]\nThey're they're in love with this idea of you know not your grand puppies guilty so they they're really getting going along with the idea of pushing back against the list but I Wonder if our energy should be more focused on convincing the left that it's not this um this good versus evil that they probably don't even they can re justified in their work\nYeah I don't think you can convince the hardcore left it there is no talking I mean you'll find out there maybe some independence you can reach maybe some of the Democrats I used to do a show in Los Angeles where I had two Democrats two Republicans on every week\nAnd those kinds of people you could convince and by the way there's a you can almost distinguish the left from liberals liberals used to be like Alan Dershowitz where if you disagreed with people you know you follow it through the ideas and and the ballot box what the left or people like the anti flicker um where they won't even let you speak\nThat there's a new fascists even though the accuser enemies of being fascists so I don't think there's any talk in the left if that's what you meant\nBut I Do think there's great middle that you might be able to reach and even some perhaps conservative Democrats are and that is true of our base to my best to the hardcore conservatives right wing conservative you're probably not going to change their minds\nBut you try to do and the reason fashion people who are open to it\nHave you met people at school that you can

feel that they didn't think did they think you're right see\nNo neither do you ah thankfully I grew up in the Christian also to stir up fairly a pretty level headed\nYeah well I I Would suggest you that you you know keep up a fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the facts many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think to me the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated and and what went on there the idea\nThat allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is outrageously is against the whole system where you're

sudden this side doesn't believe in redemption when this is the side that doesn't believe in capital punishment that even if you murder someone you should live forever\nThat's that's the same side that we're talking about that that just is Kevin ... shouldn't be a put on the United States Supreme court because of an allegation that even her best friend couldn't ... per operate\nI mean the the whole thing is insane if you want if you want I'd love to ask left is a well they wouldn't listen but liberals at least is this what you want\nThat someone accused the use of something\nI mean he doesn't ... Tucker Carson cross and saying on Fox News that he's been accused of something I don't know what that was when he was totally innocent people like that but your life is ruin your member of the players at at Duke lacrosse players they wound up being innocent remember Taiwan or Brawley in New York City\nOr a with Al Sharpton who never had to apologize for all of that stuff [noise]\nThis is what you want where you can just destroy someone's life\nAnd in their family because of an accusation that's not corroborated and people are believed just because you make an accusation and in ... in the me too movement\nWe understand women having been treated fairly and in many years in our country but the idea that that's that's enough as a what's the Hawaiian ... senators name that that's you know mentioned just shut up and go away\nThat's where we've come to I've set for years now give me nine conservative odd black women on the U.S Supreme Court and I'd be happy camper what do I care about their race\nOr their gender I just want people with good values and of course I Want them to share my views what went on and I hear I'm getting into a while to get into it later when we went on a week or so ago is just outrageous but then it brings me to my bigger picture which I talked about the first hour\nThat we have a civil war the left believes that they have\nTruth on their side and anything they do is justified so much so you can't speak on college campuses you can't even go to a restaurant and peace not right and they'll do anything and everything\nTo get rid of President Trump and Hillary say this week something about we will not be civil again and we don't have to be civil as long as he's president of the United states whoa we we've gotten to that point of view I remember that Ronald Reagan we'd have drinks with all these days you can have drinks with Tip O'Neill at night\nAnd he said to him for the regular season and say you were battling me in the daytime and Tip O'Neill the Democrat the speaker of the house from Massachusetts will say well that was the daytime we fight there but here we're friendly that that's not the case anymore\nYou saw what Senator Graham said\nThat he wouldn't put up with this nonsense and you want power so badly you'll do anything\nTo destroy people yeah that's where we've come now we've come to the point where\nIt sounds like a second civil war to me and you see the anti for the protests in the street in Portland I mentioned that last hour what took place between the prayer group and their group and bloody and bare knuckles and the bear spray and all kinds of stuff it's it's getting violent up and of course we have the situation of these police\nAh almost being murdered by a guy who you know shut up the congressmen and playing baseball that's always come to I I really worry about this country is really crucial and if you\nDon't vote come or what is it about four weeks from now I don't even know what it is in early November and the Democrats take back the house and that's the protection\nOf a lot of so called polls now and of course the polls wrong before us or hoping for a bigger turn it on our side you will you won't believe what's going to take place they'll have hearings half the hearings they'll subpoena people it won't be safe to work for the Trump Administration anymore they'll catch on something and they'll get you on everything\nSo this can't pay this can't be what you want to happen in America even good liberals on the other side I Wish you'd call me an eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine\nYou can't want this because just like the reason we now only need fifty votes to elect the Supreme Court justice or fifty one in the vice president votes in case of the pie is because Harry Reid started that\nYou ... the Democrats left and liberals can't want this 'cause it's kind of come back to haunt them and the next time they win and in American history\nIt goes back and forth between Democrats and Republicans and one side and the other side you you can't want that's the problem is you're you're not seeing you open up a new can of worms where you are guilty\nJust because of an accusation you open up a new can of worms if you will do anything to get rid of the press in the United states because you disagree their views and Trump's case even worse you know like who he is a your personally saw pose Tam\nYou and you can't believe this ... this bumped in this fool this guy is not an elite is like the rest of you that he ever could have one and by the way\nHe's going to win again I really believe that the election was held in a two years a long time he'd win reelection\nSo as ... we're we're in for a battle and we've got to make sure\nThat the the house has not taken over by the Democrats I'm pretty sure we're going to keep the Senate were probably when a few more seats in the Senate but in the house of representatives they a lot of people I I did a show a week or so ago and I had some experts on the third our including off the air they said to me it looks bath house represents\nThe guy that I Know well in orange county part of California data ... I think he's been at twenty or Thirty years he's in trouble they're spending millions and millions of dollars to defeat it didn't and then they are so passionate about this the other side\nThey are so angry about this election this past election that President Trump is in office to get what he's done and remember the courts were so significant because if they couldn't win elections the other side would make sure judges ruled right\nLike the Muslim ban that President Trump because of what he said some federal judges and decided it was a Muslim ban it doesn't matter from the president have the right to do that so they love the idea that the judges could make laws\nThat's partially what this battle was about also\nSo this is that's not what the first hour was and I want you to react to it\nI think we're going to another civil war going on I'm just hoping that it doesn't get violent that we can get through this thing and I'd already there is some votes magic you can't go to a restaurant\nThat would have been on heard of ten twenty Thirty years ago going to a restaurant with your family and having people chant around you to make sure you can eat there or having a waiter or waitress is not serving police or not serving people on the other side what what are we coming to the the other side really want that\n...

lower\nBack with you again and it's a pleasure to be with\nYou this week they'll be back on Sunday night with you and let's go to the on in Kirkuk Iowa you're on with mark\nHow are you uh I Do I just had a quick a little observation uh myself I'm I'm pretty politically neutral um but you know I must have been in as young as I Am I I watch a lot of uh you know\nMedia and and are getting in on the social media and just the way that they're portraying on the current president Mr Trump is just a little ... it seems a little unfair and the way that they're doing it it it seems like they're just uh they want to actually get into the political side they want to just ...\nYou know a lot of like the more scandalous things like this but he says the stuff that the ...\nAnd the way that they're pushing it it's just purely for content it seems like it seems like a lot of these uh these are that are\nUm showing this stuff or they just want to do it for the money and I think that's just kind of a a dangerous thing to do because if you're um you know pushing the fact that we need to get all these young people out there and and vote and then you want to only\nReally show one side of the story it it just seems like it's almost an agenda and and I just think that's kind of a dangerous thing like especially you know like I said if you're going to have all these people excited about voting and not really know exactly what they're voting for 'em I just seems that that that could be a dangerous situation\nYou're pretty perceptive how old are you a twenty five\nYou're pretty young and the it seems to me that you you reflect what I think a lot of people are feeling after the hearings especially which is that true to the the\nThat was pretty badly they're treating President Trump pretty badly now some of it um honesty I support him big time but he does bring it on himself with some of the tweets and so on but the personal vendetta the hatred they have for him as a way out of bounds\nOr I I did not like President Obama I didn't like I'm not sure I agree with him more than one thing on his policies\nI certainly wants to know harm to come to and I certainly didn't wasn't part of any resistance I I just knew you had to get rid of him the next term and I lost that one too you didn't see people on the streets you didn't he see people are threatening the ... I guess they didn't want it to the ... like that\nBut but in general the anger towards this president I Know that you may not remember this you're pretty young towards George W. Bush was pretty angry but this this is even surpassed that they we actually have to in this country trying to get rid of him even though he won the electoral college\nAny ... fairly elected president United States we have people in the FBI and the Justice Department working in\nCollusion that was where the Clinton was to try to get rid of him to undo what election that it's not supposed to happen in the United states of America I don't know I mean the first hour and a banana republic where that happens a you're pretty good and how about your friends do they agree with you or you're by yourself\nI yeah I Know a lot of the the people that you know I surround myself they they do think pretty much the same way again ah like I said I'm pretty\nPolitically neutral myself in a lot of my friends are but they do understand what the media is trying to get people to see and the way that they're presenting it and it it's definitely outright like I said I I don't really put myself in the middle of all that but I I definitely don't want to see people\nThat are expecting one thing and then they go vote and they don't really know what they voted for too you know growing up everybody's always like okay you're voted good account but it doesn't really count if you're not voting for something you don't really understand so\nThat's really all I Want it to me or now just to make sure everybody's knowing whether it be\nBefore you go in and sounds like you to go but I I'll say that everybody else out there the fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote\nI think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way the vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said\nA knowing the facts and knowing the issues and that's okay you don't have to agree with me but at least go in there don't do based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen to ... and so you're the woman I remember that was years ago maybe it is again\nA vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of courses another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this

President Clinton if you don't know of all kinds of a sexual assault they're just\nThese women are just roadkill on their way to power the absolute hypocrisy of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nI'm surprised they didn't have another Spartacus moment didn't he admitted in an op paid or something sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other phone is on the panel\nThey talk about taking the moral high ground these hypocrites have actually reached new lows let alone the moral high ground every time I think they can go no lower he break new ground that's the kind of works a kick out of the new ground tell me\nHow you're able to contain yourself I I had trouble containing myself during those weeks that week whatever ... more than a week actually with the delay have six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine seven three thirty three thirty nine\nThese people disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them Kavanaugh was not even my first choice to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nThey could have picked for example the pope\nAnd he's a leftist but they would have been against him if President Trump had appointed him why in heck did they even need hearings or further FBI investigations when they announced how they were going to be voting for the very few exceptions\nAnswer to soccer and people like Jeff Flake\nTalking about I'm sure people said that I'm not the only one that talking about being named correctly by the way he said he would vote for cabinet are having a he was all set to but it did you see this as a woman confronted him in the elevator and he admitted that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation Jeff Flake is a fool\nThis delayed did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it further divided us this was all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham had it just right this is all about power\nAnd I can take it more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can't have the Supreme Court judge or what I Wish they would be honest about that\nBut they're a bunch of phony Hippocratic hypocritical leftists they discussed me tell me what you're thinking eight six six Ninety read on it but it's worse than that\nBecause we have now taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have ... evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the accused this important\nBecause you have to prove they did it with malice if they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan's secretary of labor I think it was secretary Donovan that's the name that comes to me he was asked\nAfter he was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was they said something like what are you going to do next and he said something like where do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein Senator Feinstein has the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do some and Feinstein after you've helped destroy his life act ever so serene as you ruined his life I wouldn't have\nI Would have let them it wears his bank account\nFor all the good work he's done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton stay as president after what he did with the complicity of use Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate those hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war\nI Want to know what you think eight six six nine to read I\nMatched with Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago so I'm getting this off my chest the second time I'm very fortunate I Do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard to judge cabinet commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was attacked I don't know exactly what happened\nAnd whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies in her story she doesn't actually got there how she got home one it wasn't exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said we reached the stage where all you need are allegations so what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on\nMaking accusations and slowing every nomination they don't want and rooting everybody's reputation in the process now there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused accused and accused it's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked\nThanks to Senator Flake and Murkowski flick at least voting for it\n[noise] but Murkowski didn't I think she I think there's some movement or call her and she needs to be recalled\nRest of the bills fools who allow this process to take place looked by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin our fame can be yours with a flick of your cell phone\nDo the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nDo you remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with the judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous\nSenator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive in bowling here's what Joe Biden said he witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith and fairness and justice that binds the country together\nIs he getting that's a Democrat play book and Mitt Romney or another genius I mean I was a delegate for 'em by the way I've got to make and full disclosure he announced the support the decision to wait a week\nAnother example of why he lost he doesn't know how to fight

I I I think\nAt this point but probably not but what ... what do you what are you up a world\nYeah I'll I'll give you my opinion I I I think ... you know I've been told by experts that we're going to lose the house because I mentioned his name before one of my friends are state the Republican committee men from California's a De Niro backers in trouble and he's never been in trouble he's in orange county\nA you know typically the president's party loses the the party of the president empower loop they lose seats\nI think it'd be very close and maybe we'll get lucky and we won't lose the house but I'm really afraid of that happening is not like where the polls show that you know that Trump was going to win any one so it's it's possible but that's what I'm saying type a limited me a lot of people going out\nAnd then they don't expect to go out because the Democrats are motivated but they hate President Trump and they hated capital they want no part of this uh ... they're coming out in droves I think and so we have to match that kind of a passion so I'm not really answering it depends on the day in the mood I I tend to be optimistic but\nUh let's see if you asked me to vote today I'll I'll do my optimism saying we'll just barely hold on and that's what I'd like to see happen but you can let me know what you think and speaking what you think let's go to Morgan in Eugene Oregon

haven't done so\nFlake is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee so Senator Marco Rubio who tells NBC's Meet the press he believes ... was set up\nWhat if enough people are upset and I think they were by Kavanaugh hearings as an example\nI think they are going to become a big number so I'm not sure there's going to be this incredible blue wave\nI I'm convinced by the way there's a strong statement of Israel when the Senate easily yeah not that that's a big statement for me because of most of the races that are up for grabs her reason that Trump won the states that Trump won in a big fashion so we're going to pick up seats in the satellite\nOut about that and that should make you feel better\nBut I think if people are as frustrated as jury appears to be it seems to be a no reason to doubt it across the country I I don't think the Democrats realized what their reaction is going to be they may have overplay their hands in fact I think they did\nBecause even people maybe in the middle had had to have some revulsion to see what was going on they just measure this guy they just tell them apart and what you think Ford was credible are not credible\nHe wasn't treated well\nAnd then and then when it's all done I mean they have them he couldn't win for losing as they say when it's all done they said oh he was belligerent uh yeah I was supposed to just sit back and take\nThe all the stuff ... destroying his reputation for ruining his family life imagine what the his girls think of him now I mean maybe they haven't changed but imagine what they have to go through forget the security in the threats against him\nOr even afford had some she's going to go out of the limelight although I like the way they said that she had nothing to do all she had to do is was she was going to lose by coming out no she's not probably write a book come out on television or need to hell did you do so badly so I'm not sure she lost so much\nBut if if jury is right and he represents the frustration that all I think a lot of people feel out there\nThere may not be this blue wave it may be much closer than people think and because the thought of the hundred and said this than I thought of the Democrats retaking the house\nAnd the hearings and the subpoenas and in the if you think the cabinet hearings were disgusting and revolting wait till these people do it for two years to do everything possible to impeach Kevin out to a beach Trump\nThere are a lot of started there you know how ... works to house those at first and then he's tried in the Senate doesn't matter that they can't when\nThey didn't care that they couldn't win against cap now\nThis will be show in this little ... and their bases so angry yeah I I've never seen anything like this I remember I Want to be fair\nThey hated George W. Bush and you know they thought Al Gore had one in Florida which when they did the results I I think it's neat newspaper editorial boards or whoever did it and only one even came out for Gore and even that was assuming the absolute best scenario for him\nThese people just hey if it's possible they Donald Trump that much more\nAnd that's why you have the resistance that's why you had a soft coup in the U.S Justice Department\nAnd with the FBI at the top echelons where these guys were the lady and that page and so on they were Texan each other when they set up a Carter Page\nA two for the you know that he was if you're watching that he was a spy with the Russians and he was in on the Trump campaign trying to you know uh make sure that the\nHillary last I mean it's all incredible what these people were up to\nThey literally were acting like a banana republic\nTrust take the election away from President Trump these people are angry but if you get out there and you vote\nThere's there's gives me a lot of hope and it should give you two Charlie natural ... with a more\nYet a good show are you comparing it to the civil war and that was just saying if you if you don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it\nAnd I think\nAt least waves where I went to school but they don't teach the real division of the country in the civil war or one side and one of the slave outside didn't and Lincoln's he wrote you know you get into the real civil war there's a lot of the page and a lot of different issues that were divided the nation\nAnd we're at that point now\nAnd ... just saying that but there's a way the Republicans can win and\nIf you look at the ... if the Republicans can get eight nine percent of the black vote the country will be totally read for for the rest of this country's existence I mean if you look at\nFlorida if you look at those key states where\nThere where the black vote really swings to the Democratic side that's all we have to do just that and\nThe Democrats play they they go after the black vote by offering you know public housing all kinda entitlements and\nAnybody can see that it would be better to make eight hundred a week then to get eight hundred a month assistance and that's that's what we that's what Republicans need to breach in the poor neighborhoods and that's my comment and I'll listen to your results of their spot\nWhere you said a very Well Charlie I appreciate it two things come to mind one that's why the Democrats so anxious with illegal immigration 'cause they win usually in that category uh in fact that always bothered me when Karl Rove and\nGeorge W. Bush or seven oh you know they'll get forty percent they can get up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote and I thought oh forty percent you still lose every time but you're on to something really significant which is the black vote and President Trump they said Romney got six percent I think Trump got eight percent\nOr if we start to get more of the black vote on the Republican side the Democrats are in huge trouble because they've counted on that Ninety percent Ninety three Ninety Ninety five sometimes you know what I buy my God I think it was way up there they count on that\nIf ever they lose an interesting percentage and that even the Jewish population they they started to go the other way they the Republicans and I'll START I think at twenty five thirty percent [noise]\nThey're in trouble ... big trouble as you suggest that\nIf they can't count on of those votes and they shouldn't shouldn't get those votes the Democrats have control every city just about every major city every major school district and think about the last thirty forty years how the schools have\nA function of how well they've been doing I'm saying that in the opposite direction they're not doing well or how well our cities are doing\nAnd you come hungry inclusion one of the Democrats done for the people living in the inner city and that's a real issue if ever the Democrats lose that vote there in huge trouble and Donald Trump is meeting\nYou choke I and I was and then just right away I knew right away this last year so far I get you just from outer space honestly she

closer to ...\nWell a lot of people thought she was credible 'cause you you know she had that childlike voice and she's seen sympathetic and I can I be sure that none of this happened I'm I'm not even talking about ... now\nBut I was saying can I be sure that she was an attack by someone could chief fantasize that all that stuff maybe [noise]\nUm yeah it's suspicious but a lot of people don't want
