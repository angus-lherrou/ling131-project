I think the History Channel holy smokes I mean you know secretary we saved ... them from getting eaten by these you know I mean\nIt was unbelievable what they you know they walked on foot I mean you gotta remember they went on foot they want to cross the country on foot and they had an air rifle yeah it right and it was made it was it in my pumped air pump gun that was as dangerous as anything into it worked in the hell out of the Indian Head it was an ... I mean if you get a chance to see I think it was the history\nChannel series on I ... I wasn't the mantle made America but it was something like\nThat several years ago fernbank did disappear IMAX theater there was an IMAX film about their irony that\nT. M. moving dot com studio Scott Y. A. Y. Gainesville option he likes to play\n\nOur Cain search goes on Trump on the stump ... neck or local state and federal agencies continue to assess the devastation from hurricane Michael correspondent Martin savages more on search and rescue efforts in hard hit Mexico Beach Florida\nUnfortunately in Mexico beach today the first victim was discovered the name of stuff in released its mail it was a person who was discovered in what they say is the debris field several hundred yards away from his home and unfortunately authorities believe it won't be the last such discovery\nCase it's absolutely clear and they should start they should do it on a consistent basis and promote the fact\nThat we want you know educate people educate people on on a you know not on the left because that's impossible but in the great middle because it makes sense to them clearly independence understand\nThe presumption of innocence\nClearly they understand due process under the law the polls have shown that\nDemocrats may they just wish to ignore it because what they want now is more important than anything it is about their day to day politics\nAnd so I think it's just important just a little nit picking their and then I Move on those goes ... do you mean you never happy with anything no men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content but we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks\nWell it's a couple of things the um the the whole idea of of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is\nIs a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center\nYou know the left a you know says there\nAh since Saturday evening while we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that\nUm will look at early voter turnout as we always do\nBut really even with the right I Know I Know the motivation on the right is there we know that so that's not going to go away\nOr the motivation in the middle that's the question that's where you win the election and so you look at the undecideds and how many of the key races right now are undecided\nOr have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that grew going one way or the other end thrown out\nIs is is the key\nSo beyond that the win at the highest court\nRemains to be seen\nBecause we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice mhm rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench it is a victory in that the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey\nThey distorted the process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president or how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we have been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart ... and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race and\nTalking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time\nFor for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart censor was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support a John Roberts Neil Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide\nAnd we'll again we won't be able to see that effect or if that's going to happen or for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will\nBe key in those cases but we'll see how he decides and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across right I mean if what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree\nI'm a ... with him you know we we talk about a true construction as some and by the way when we talk about ... what was that the or was it the location device\nWas at the location of ice on the cars are about ... what\nWas the case that everybody has a cell tower two was the ... where everybody where everybody said well we're especially the never Trump first came out and said see if you didn't you say he sided with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge\nMhm and then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court or and and the Gorsuch that actually use\nThe Scalia ruling them or you know Scalia was probably the true with the the most construction as judge of of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court\nHas a has a has has done\nClarence Thomas always is not always a construction is right Clarence Thomas will\nA judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I never looked for that I Want that's up in the legislature to decide to meet is these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the constitution said does it say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda right so I'd say ... I'd say if I looked at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably ... or ... it was almost\nNinety nine probably Ninety nine percent just doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a\nA you know you have a cabin on that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least a for me on\nOn the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare\nRight oh huge and and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't\nA a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you and I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party or\nI think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party thought they they were uh I I Will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump per\nSe but to see it in action and to see them look\nTo see the debate points that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of\nA a presumption of innocence this stereotyping but if they're convenience all women are to believe unless you're deals those type of woman over there by the way to one of the stories I saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame\nWhite women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started blaming Ivan Eddie\nAnd the case if he well wait a minute thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case of too many holes well that's the whole point that the\n... the so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is\nThey're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nYes\nTheir opinions don't end their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left\nAnd them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the main stream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\n\nAnd we'll slander and defame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was you burn in my ear ah because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent fought for years and used to vote for Democrats he's sort of tell me how I can never vote for Democrats\nGet ... ever when I'm being told what white males think is always wrong and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\nAre well you\nKnow mega millions winter the jak not have been worth five hundred and forty million dollars or Tuesday is growing and there's now projected at six hundred fifty four million dollars the\nPentagon says a suburb reach travel records is compromised personal information I'm Martin Luther\nKing Day rates may apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with aids lists male Macs a patent pending formula within a greeting if that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases a muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom\nTake your manhood to the max by try your first dirty diaper bottle free shipping and handling not ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not\nFinally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with age will smell ... too intense please decrease use for your free bottle text fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not text F.

listening to talk about a new talk one oh six seven [noise]\nSo there you go read I radio [noise] and they have certain\nHunting and I'm very McNamara eight six six Ninety or right I just want to note here ... uh and and let me point out something that that I just you know I I look at conservative media and I'd just say stop it\nAnd whether it was the you know in a drudge you we know he's conservative but he basically just you know lists things but he had the Taylor Swift story as the number one story half the day yesterday yeah and it's the number one story right now on Fox yeah All right\nNobody cares what she thinks no ethical nobody cared Taylor Swift things why do the editors at Fox News\nBelieve that she deserved the Taylor Swift comes out in support of tendency Democrats who cares oh ... before she said she won't speak on ... not ... who cares somebody cares nobody cares what she thinks\nThere's so many things that we can be doing as a as as as a media that are important and I'm not saying you don't put the you don't have the story somewhere ...\nYou know 'cause you could you get your story but it than the number one story now for a few hours sitting there on as we go into a Monday with everything that's going on right right Taylor Swift as a story that they they put up there\nEven though ... story and you know him supporting Donald Trump is a Side Story it's notable and the different because you have\nA a mega hip hop star supporting Republican president who was hated by pretty much everybody else in his community and in in his profession so that's notable because it's not\nWhat a what he was unique in that ... news just things that are unique and different right ... and\n... and the thing is that ultimately though the the endorsement\nDoesn't really do anything now sometimes you'll see a you know these mega endorsements come on come on board for an Obama but that wasn't what got Obama to the White House the endorsements don't do anything except show that those celebrities are getting on the ...\nAnd why I get a most often but you're not it doesn't matter who the celebrity is\nThat's not the influence with the with the people that's not the the real influence with real Americans they really don't care what celebrities have the say politically unless those celebrities are getting involved in politics and they're going to run for office that's that's the difference\nI just just to that was just a side comment there'd be so I just saw it and would wind up sick okay let me when I woke up well you know it's funny when it when I'm when I went to sleep last night it was there when I when I woke up to come in the show was there and I'm like All right enough\nIn our pre show meeting we were talking about it because Sunday we always I always measure of the day by the number\nOf over the top breaking news headlines that sometimes it's breaking news on an event on something that happened uh and it's actual breaking as often as breaking news breaking news Trump tweet that no that's not breaking news\nThe\nThe number of stories on Sunday dwindled down to just nothing I mean it was it was really well it was down to Taylor Swift endorses Democrats\nThat's what it was down to because here's what happened Saturday you had your vote Kavanaugh confirmed\nThe left is going to wind about it they're going to whine about it a little more on Sunday Morning and then as we predicted or as we told you it's really not a prediction\nBecause they are too predictable on the left all the protestors go home and it's over you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about in ...\nNot going to happen it's not going to happen because\nYou're not going to move on it when when you know you want to well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\n\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind to elect tours no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of life doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election\nBecause these people

just\nThat the ... which is to get rich rid of freedom of speech and wishes to use the power of the government to punish you and destroy your life to do that\nWe know that I mean no that's not even debatable anymore when we talked about the first amendment we can look at freedom of religion and the bakery and artistic expression and all that that's going on right now and the left is again that individual rights\nOf I get to choose you know how I Wish to express of what I you know what I Believe so we've often talked about the fact that the left does not and this is the mainstream of the law does not believe\nIn the first amendment they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion the second amendment it's obvious they don't believe in the second amendment\nThey believe it's antiquated they don't believe in due process or under the law you and I talked about this during uh during the uh uh during the whole uh uh a Ferguson case ... when you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had the president giving them\nOn it when they didn't know what happened right and we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know\nYou've got to take each case individually if you're not then you don't believe in due process well we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have heard was a political trial yes uh it wasn't a civil trial it was in day it wasn't a a a a criminal trial by\nMany aspects of a real trial were there you're under oath mhm and you can be you can go to jail it was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not be a criminal trial or civil trial but it was a trial\nWhere many of the enforcement of a trial a ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail for that\nAnd they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption of innocence none of that matter to them\nThen we got to trumpeting the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore now this one when you have a ... and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nOr that are now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you can listen to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of wasn't the Senate\nWell if you don't want the Senate if you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is the legislative branch mhm and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment\nWhen you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe that the ... and the presumption\nOf innocence\nYou really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about and\n\nWe understand now on the show we believe that that the majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though so close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the are by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords in the house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states they wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most\nScared of was that a ... ... group\nA particular group of ... a a person a small group of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or president see\nThey were scared to death that power could be concentrated in one of those areas and they ... they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at the history of the world\nAnd\nSeen how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it and the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and when you look at it the house of representatives or you have I think fifty three house members in California\nOnly one in Wyoming why bigger population and California fewer people in a ... in Wyoming\nBoth of two senators or that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population and by region but the Senate\nAnd on and and by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years\nIs so you're closer to the people and more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the house of representatives would be closer to mob rule than us [laughter] [laughter] and but so they they but they wanted it they wanted the the the\nCongress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country were you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state because if you had more population and a bigger state you had more representation in\nThe house but they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have some kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little state\nYeah that was the reason right the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are unconstitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why separation of powers\nAnd also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights and that's why it was done and do things move slower yet but founding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that then mob rule\nThe reason the electoral college that exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch ...\nIt was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power cannot congregate in one area and as we said when it comes to the bike camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house and then the Senate\nWhich is to per state which is six years so they could be more long term looking at a country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years\nAnd the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership\nOr represents I'm most\n... I Would dare say that the vast majority of the left have no idea of I think most people I listen to our show do it and understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or tears to understand\nI don't think they care about it because what they want is again a and as they often engage in in fantasy they create and there might a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process and they don't care to understand the\nProcess they don't care why it was set up this way and\nYou know it's interesting

people wanting to talk about it or you know all week and a long ... how do you think this is going to affect the the ... election or I look I don't make predictions on elections I Will just say this I Know\nI'm I I I I Know when the Republican base is motivate\n'em and they are quite motivated right now I I don't know\n... they're uh they're motivated and their unified when when I saw that what George W. Bush how many times and he called Collins ... he called her numerous times during this whole process is George W. Bush ... to push for a Trump\nNominee mhm for for the Supreme Court this says you're not at everybody and I think one of the reasons that you not everybody is look we dealt with Trump for the last two years the people in the Republican Party that just can't stand up and all of a sudden the last three weeks I woke up and went hoops\nIs really not our enemy is really not our political enemy there maybe some things that we don't like we don't like his tone we don't like this we don't like at the exit\nRates we don't like when he doesn't tell the truth at times but he's a lot better than these insane people on the other side I Believe that that's what a lot of never Trump ... maybe not all but I think it's a ... well as I said everybody except Bill Kristol\n[laughter] well [laughter] it's interesting [laughter] and that's not going to happen and possibly George with 'em but [laughter] but\nThe the the the the idea if you look at it and I I find it kind of a\nInteresting that the George W. Bush the same president who said well signing campaign finance law I Know parts of this are unconstitutional but I'll let the courts work it out [noise] called Collins to make sure that the court gets it right\nUm but but [laughter] that\nI just sat on the way it right by the way great observation I miss yeah well I I just uh you know but but certainly anyone from the Bush family doing anything to support a a Trump nominee is is definitely notable but\nIt also goes beyond what we as well it goes right to what we set and goes beyond the the political aspect of this and removes it from the current White House because it is\nAbout the long term makeup of the court and George W. Bush of course recognizing that I'm certain um as many of us do and it is\nAlso recognizing a indirectly and while we haven't and I would love to hear from the former president on this or asking the question\nUh if if it is the case with him we pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth and the comments made a the and the communication errors and and things even on the issues that we disagree with a wheel the we are the original ... babies [laughter]\nAnd then\nHave those discussions but we said from the beginning it is\nThe reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote\nThat it becomes well as it always is that buying their decision and then\nAlong the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard\nI thought you know not one not too\nBut a total of four they're really really voting for a group and so our time for science I'm ... and and I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do when we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nFor instance what you're going to do it for him to can flush cool rose smuggling routes country agree this is just five Ninety nine twenty six just no denying celebrate Texas Chicken price big participant in hundreds of restaurants in several studies that are over twenty six to envy that only [noise]\nIf you just hand on a truck to make a living then American tracker magazine is for you each month a magazine is fat that information you need to keep your truck running and making you money\nFor new products to the latest in regulation American tracker has what you need to know and if you're running your own business American ... this is the editor Tim rainy there for you\nThis renowned author and this has expert has more than twenty five years of experience in the trucking industry and knows what you need to maintain a profitable operation each month ... visit some trucking offer solutions that difficult problems faced by any trucking organization\nAmerican chatter magazine is not just for people looking to keep their trucks on the road but it's also for those looking to buy or sell vehicle the American trucker marketplace connection with thousands of buyers and sellers across the country who may have that perfect track here looking for\nThat don't miss another issue of American tracker magazine receive your free time the tracker dot com and sign up [noise]\n\nMany have you heard about transportation nation dot com what's transportation nation dot com transportation ... dot com it's fucking spurs news and entertainment website like Netflix you can watch brand new original trucking shows and videos me just for us truckers and you won't find it anywhere else\nAll the transportation nation dot coms trucking shows in videos or on demand so you can watch whenever you want\nTo do is sign up and start watching plus three that perfect I'm going to go check out transportation nation dot com right now\nI Believe that conservatism is the only ideology the only\nBelief system that moving people forward boy country forward or a community forward cultural forward\nSo I Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything\nFrom the beans and rice id program\nTo try to keep people from buying me\nThat's exactly what he was that's right\nAnd then mama comes into the picture any age she tries to grab you ought to have her way people these days around now and he tries to him with the taser buddies Lou and Lou Bourne mess so folks don't always work as I say\n... or tell you about the time the Hillary pickup truck in Arkansas if\nOff that land and there are impressive leaders and organizations making a positive impact\nThe good work show with our effort that goodwill in North Georgia to highlight the good\nThat make the Atlanta work every Saturday at noon will bring you this story the leaders nonprofit and people making a difference\nIf you know than area leader or organization you want to be on the shell email us ... works at G.

to go lower go negative the Democrats have already done to themselves\nYou know you make a point we've made over the years that Republicans could just make ads out of the Democrats saying the things they say and doing the things they do without saying a word the Republicans say a word in the ads\nThemselves but I I Wonder even with the craziness now of what we've seen especially the behavior over the last few weeks\nWhile I I Believe that you should I don't know that you necessarily even have to John and thank you for the call\nI think that the behavior will be playing over and over again in

are slowly getting in touch with a loved one if you would just posted on Facebook so everybody can see it if they were okay we can't get any signal\nYou expect me to have an organized thought no in fact the most organized thought was a guy walked by and he said you want to talk is known and also the guy go make America great again [laughter]\n\nYou know it is and and it's it's just because you look at this look these we know that these protests are organized to a great deal it was happening during the Trump rallies in twenty sixteen we know that there was a great organization than money to a certain extent going behind a that was behind and driving a lot of these protests\nAre we know or the left is very good at that\nBut that's that's why you can't find for a lot of them you really can't\nIt's hard to I identify with them\nAnd and for most Americans that is\nYou know again the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe people are quick to you know speak out in that if there is a pollster that calls whether it's kneeling in the NFL or any other as you know I Believe people should you know have the right to be heard\nBut how many people actually do it are active in protest most people are not the overwhelming majority or not and in fact if you didn't have a you know a ... organization or any or the organization or that I mean we can go back to Ferguson Ferguson name authorities\nThey they told they were equipped to tell you look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away and that was clearly organized so when it comes down to it how many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven\nAnd motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization\nI'm well we're we're the Facebook crowd opposed recalls oh yeah yeah we'll answer the poll a Facebook there a one click the like button we might share it we might retweeted but the fact\nOf the matter is is what is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives and when we go back to the poll that you brought up earlier and we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to corroborate the claims from this additional background check on Kavanaugh we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent not Ninety percent of sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that\nWe step back from the insanity and the display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying\nPeople aren't going to react to it or you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most in saying things if they believe it's going to get them political points well it just might\nIn your state of Hawaii or California\nBut if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America\nYou're flat out wrong and and that's why I think\n... and and again this is a not a ... analysis of facts like this is just my my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who have paid attention to this\nAnd even though they do sympathize and because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are of more ... a more conservative was\nIf you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation alone without cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation\nThen you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling raping our society right well that kicked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what what's the thing that you always believe the woman you don't believe anything but evidence\nAnd to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark\nIs ... ... most\nAmericans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that said we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or Trump pick somebody they don't want him but I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said\nNo you don't always believed the woman you have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always believe anybody gets the evidence that you make the judgment on and yeah these senators are accusing him of being a rapist without the evidence without the evidence and in fact they're accused of being a gang rape is\nWithout the evidence of of being there they say believe all women or men or women don't tell the truth\nBut it's a majority doesn't matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that ... Americans understand that they understand\nBasic fairness and when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democratic party the mainstream of the party that are arguably has more people supporting it mhm\nNot by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote\nOr when they see that they say I don't really wish to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of\nAnd and and when you find out that you know that the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford it was a Dianne Feinstein she burn the victim Chinese the one that wouldn't T the anonymity of the victim right it was the Democrat who leaked it\nIt was the Democrats right it was the fines of Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman mhm\nRight was it was that or or her staff that said it had to be one of those do right\nAnd so when you look at it you all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief\nAnd the presumption of innocence the stereotyping the bigotry all women all need to be we believed all white men white men or ... white men can't and people look at that stage and it's just like stomp it well I think\nYou two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a this was recent history we don't have to go back and so the Democrats the sixties recent history you have in it because again the same side that said we're going to stand up for women\nCalled the woman who voted for Trump self massaging as they in fact the candidate herself after she lost said well the problem is is that women listening to their husbands the husbands tell them how to vote [laughter] enrichment stupid\nBecause your husband has to tell you how to vote your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself well which he has it Democrats\nThere to be believed\nOr not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage units which first\nThey will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\nLiterally history headlines right here or San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women after Susan Collins says she'll vote for Kavanaugh right ah [laughter] ah critics claim white women the rap after Susan Collins a a a cabinet or a a\nSpeech yeah because ... was women women were worthy of press women were the victims in general\nUntil they lost and now it's that women of color are the victims they blame white women well\nI don't know Dr forged genetic makeup or her her ethnicity background but she appears to be and a white\nAnd and what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to of victim you will slander people you will the fame people you will say that the presumption of innocence\nA big part of the the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed than you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do anything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say\nThere's a complete total lack of any type of fairness any type of ... it's the Democrats were screaming for civility like McCain and it's you and I said after the McCain's funeral we said by the way this will be gone Monday\nMhm this will be gone as soon as the hearing so this was all completely gone and you've seen them taking it up to a level where there was a possibility if McCain was alive today and he and Lindsey Graham would have stood side by side\nThe attackers were able to see extensive details belonging to fourteen million of those people in addition to phone numbers and email addresses\nFacebook execs said the attackers had access to user names hometown birth dates and recent search information among other details deep casting about New York from hurricane Michael the death toll now\nAt Seventeen people ...

third\nJustice seeded by the current president I mean that would be the argument from the left or I guess the a proposition or concern issued to the rank and file\n'em but the left doesn't operate that way the failure with all due respect that Mr Dershowitz in his appeal to the left\nI'm really is to is to not recognize what the left is all about they don't care about the process they don't

I Would have taken it immediately and taken into Grassley then they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been anonymous said what\nAnd what the what you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford's story changed\nYou know and and they talk about how the remarry story change how the sweat next door changed but look at how the Ford story changed but but their point was on the political picture of being believable the scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he's that\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart\nWhat they what they were trying to point out here was\nShe could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give him a Dr Ford or to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out the evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes\nBut because of the behavior and they mentioned\nCollins making the or the you know talking about having these role\nIn her speech but it does\nThat happen all of that happened because of what because of the left and made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nTo you and you think about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was their major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim if it's a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it\nMust be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point right I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they are the ones that claim you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even that you know they're they're yeah they're ... you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't\nTrue yeah well so is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices huh that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance en route and relevant to it I mean they ... they were right by the way uh in in in November of twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that\nWay you when when you look at well I have an empty a stormy Daniels' case\nThat and no one absolutely no one is shocked that a playboy billionaire had an affair no and again not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it\nBut the left creates these narratives they give out in the the the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's if it's against Trump Trump so it would have to come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there's not like I said the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point\nWhat does Joe Manchin have on Schumer [laughter] I'm fine dining and what does he have a Democrat leadership nobody's calling for a primary challenger to him in the

questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being\nRun down feeling for the you know I hear him running out of gas\nI got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that so basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and Roman\nWe need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is that Cain nutrient involved in energy production but the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I

decrease the rough and find wrinkles and your skin it's an amazing combination so I Can't give you three I gave me a little bit more than that\nWell All right even better but regarding new co Q. ten plus was very troubling purity products how many glasses or read one is equivalent to how many would I have to drink a day to get the same benefits\nWell I Would say two to three classes a day and that's what you see in the Mediterranean diet yeah that's what\nYou see exactly in the Mediterranean diet but I got to tell you personally I couldn't handle that maybe you could well I\nI don't know but I have to drink to the glasses of red wine a day yeah\nIt sounds to me about how many capsules I've got to take when they do take in order to get a multi I've got other vitamins I take fish oil\nWhile you just need to take too soft shell a day and that's really easy to take and the best time to take them is writing a book for a meal so you can take you know one before breakfast one before lunch or you could take them together but all you have to do is take too small soft shelves right before a meal\nWell Dr pressing on a pause for a minute remind listeners about this amazing

for purity products combined the co Q. ten with ... ... you\nKnow there was the key molecule found in red wine which they're studying at Harvard and I know that it activates genes are those are just to to talk to us about all the excitement surrounding ... and why you specifically wanted it in this formula\nWhile I tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging\nThat's pretty darn impressive and what they found in laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan\nAnd it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases your longevity you'll live longer it increases the activity of what we call a longevity genes they get switched on day help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt\nIn fact this gene helps increased tissue repair and switched on by a group of genes called sirtuin now they've found two things at Harvard number one\nCaloric restriction increases these longevity genes the sirtuin\nWell so does resveratrol\nAt least in their animal studies and this is exactly ... been making all these worldwide headlines because if it works in humans as it does and these animals and I'm optimistic it will\nIt represents an entirely new approach to managing health and wellness where we potentially use any traditional compound like Reza ... target the exact genes associated with these various areas of improvement that our health and our aging and our longevity\nWell now that the president you say that took you ten ... elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented so well researched you call this evidence based nutrition and they didn't give us a brief overview of the research and explain why co Q. ten research is so widely respected\nSkin hair eyes and joins he says this substance not only dramatically influences our parents and their words how young are how healthy we look but more importantly our physical strength or flexibility and mobility\nThis is our ability to do things slip things get around be physical today we're going to learn more about this once mysterious substance and how new breakthroughs are allowing us to get it back and keep it as we get older [noise]\nAll right here's our gas to health a journalist bill ... bill is an author a researcher in the field of health and wellness he's traveled around the world in search of information about\nTyler on a ... acid or H. A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan where people maintain high levels of each day and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with you pat and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic acid supplements\nWell of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update and an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support\nIn particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where\nThe body actually is highly concentrated in ha but I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because\nThere's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said free offer today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what is that we use this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word highly ironic asset and of course it's made it's all over our body it's\nIn our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body but more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. A. at it makes a while as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice\nThey never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on\nAll of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joins they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they they certainly have all of those advantages and that's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do\nAnd you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH H joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what H. A. is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones we lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we started getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints\nAnd then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers are going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do\nDermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there\nAnd you have never heard about ha before well you need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement\nPurity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of six million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down\nSo that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means\nThat you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other\nAntioxidants that be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but purity products\nIs introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives\nFor their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nIf you're just tuning in we're talking with Bill ... about ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough and what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells\nThere's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha the body is\nSeventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells\nThat connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we didn't get into a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height we we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking\nFor a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like a jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of the how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking low cost the main supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue casa means sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it\nWell it took Thirteen Years for the consummate it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time and it'll get there because patients are gonna take this to the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts\nWith patients and people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these useful levels of ha restored in their body\nNow you've written a great deal about the role of Tyler on a gas it in the bodies connective tissue sound as each a work in the joints and the connective tissue\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surrounded the nerves there's a ... addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve all of these are going to need the special cushioning\nThat ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you\nIt worked miracles for him why because purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called high drops that's taken from olives no pat you notice", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "13"}
