...\nDamage everywhere a trees down wires down homes utterly destroyed it's creepy this should be lit up this should be a major parts of the area just north of Panama City and there is not a light on you have a lot of a\nLaw enforcement getting down here so the checking things out in different areas there's been lots of reports of looting in certain areas in death\nThat one hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds and I think that was roughly if you take the diameter thirty five to forty miles or ... and it moves probably anywhere between thirty and\nYou know thirty to forty a ah depending on where it was a and I was trying to explain to people you understand this was like a forty mile wide tornado right right\nThat's the one thing that people don't I don't I don't think a lot of people didn't understand\nIs the fact especially when that you know the winds and the outer eye wall hit those areas you just knew and and I you and I had gone back and forth because of some of the coverage on the uh the the Weather Channel and um you know putting on baseball helmets and things like that\nThat Jim ... you know at one point but a helmet on and and by the way there was a smart move or because I ...\nI Will not about that I always said why you would think they would do that more often even Windsor Seventy miles an hour I Would if I'm Out there sure covering it with the the debris flying around but uh you know and a lot of them are reporting from around the vicinity of of Panama City in ... and really what the worst was to the east ...\nUh you know a lot of them in and\nYou just knew what you just said well you know it seems like if you're just a casual watcher you might say well there's not really a lot of damage your well that's because and I saw one of the meteorologist they had down near there\nAnd you know she talked to ... and they just said no get out get out you know we cannot report you cannot report from a place where you go\nA hundred and fifty five miles an hour coming to you that you can't do right which was a very I sat there and said okay that's a very smart\nMove right well that's it when you know I mean that that that tells you that the strength of this storm or when the weather channel runs recover\nThat s that's one indication that that you should to\nUh you'd look at the number of people that are that stayed behind is not a leave the area did not evacuated a and you know of course our thoughts and prayers are always with everyone affected by a storm and and and uh and others like it\nOr you know we looked at the uh the situation with with foreign so we looked at the ... and and covering that\nAnd and the recent storms in Texas you and I I mean go going back to a Katrina\nReally and then a Hurricane Rita\nAh along the Gulf Coast and and\nAnd the storms I mean we have so much devastation I have a friend in New Orleans you know and talking about that you know people not coming back many of them moving to neighboring states like ours um and staying and saying you know there's you know there's I don't want to go back there's you know again if\nIf there's not going to be a that that long term rebuilding effort that is a in some cases permanent devastation\nOr you know not only the physical devastation but of course the economic devastation of of a region or like that my ah my nieces husband is stationed right now going to school in Pensacola he's in the air force\nAnd uh I was checking in on them and they were you know they had a mandatory basically ah order to you know stay in in a shelter and ah and stay there he's a he could not leave a but they had of course there on the base where he is\nA they had it set up of course to keep everybody safe\nOr that's you know again I was watching a couple of the storm chasers that were alive on periscope and and Facebook Live throughout the day\nAnd one of them had plans to stay or through the whole thing or two to give as much coverage as possible uh but uh he had already are in this building\nHe had a a huge cement stairwell that he was going to stay in a but it was the one in fact a drudge linked to to his coverage or that was that storm chaser but he actually showed everybody where he was going to stay within the stairwell and it was meant yeah uh and and so\nUm do you look at the I guess the job of these meteorologists and and people and and and a news reporters that are that are out on these storms ah they often stay right there in their hotel is right there are close to the beach in fact though that's where the weather Channel's saying at this hotel\nThat was right there on the beach\nOr in one of their locations and\nThose are buildings that are likely a severely damaged although they are bigger buildings and can withstand a more damage than the sum of the other smaller buildings are coming up here just a few minutes\nAfter the bottom of the hour we'll talk once again to meteorologist a meteorologist a Tom hale\nHe's been with us he was with us yesterday he was with a with a for foreign ...\nUh as well and uh and Irma doing coverage for many years in fact in his career on hurricanes we'll talk to him and John trout as well we'll keep us up to date on the latest uh as of right now Michael still hurricane yeah yeah ... Seventy five on our sustained with wins\nSo that puts it out a category one just just barely a and and we're expecting you and I talking during the a crucial meeting and you were saying you expect a and I think most do or that the next report which comes up here and I'm In uh in forty five minutes or we could see that downgraded to a tropical storm\nAre still very dangerous uh you know if you think about uh the the uh a hurricane\nHeard sustained winds of Seventy five miles an hour while they're not what the ... the storm isn't what it was in terms of its power is still dumping a lot of rain and then of course those winds are still damaging so uh we'll get the latest from Tom hale and John trout along the way coming up here and just that\nWe have an election coming up here and just a little under four weeks yeah um yeah breaking news\nUh and uh some of the polls out there some of the uh interesting a poll numbers I'm from the New York times yeah yesterday right we'll we'll get to that\nLook at the CBS headline ... also coming up here on the show prominent Democrats reject taking the high road and as a viable political strategy that is yeah you know that's after Hillary Clinton\nAnd uh uh and then the more I got my like Cory Booker or none of the former attorney general\nOh I'm a I've got Eric Holder Eric Holder yeah coming out and saying if they go low kick them yeah uh and ... and we you know said this yesterday and the day before\nA in a while we said the day before it looks like they're heading in that direction and yesterday was obvious that that's the direction that the mainstream now\nOf the Democratic party holds is that we're going to be\nIt's going to be instability it's going to be mop like tactics or it's going to be getting in your face wherever you are ... it's going to be getting that on camera mhm uh in order to uh to do it and then ah at you when you had Eric Holder guinea the point of saying kick them\nThat was really the first statement of using physical force against your political enemies they seem to have no shame in at this is coming from not the fringe\nAs as recently as even a month ago remember we had to call and somebody called up and said well not all Democrats are like that and we said well your party is\nYour party and that this was really basically going to where the party is being controlled by the left mhm uh but now when it comes to instability and getting in people's faces and wanting to film it\nAnd and getting to the point of terrorizing people with a with a mob yeah how about a mob terrorizing people matter where they are\nThat has now become a mainstream mindset of the Democrats if you're a Democrat you know that this isn't again when CBS writes it\nYou know that even in the media are saying well what are they doing here what's the strategy right Hillary Clinton coming out and saying that Eric Holder coming out and and and and say in it and so here we go I'm\nRand Paul and his wife taking on a Cory Booker for news for his previous statements and I still have not heard one or maybe you may have heard it in one of the debates if they asked one of the senatorial debates I don't know I didn't see that but I haven't seen\nIn any major publication where you have had I haven't seen any publication and make that clear I have it may be out there I haven't seen it where you have one Democrat come out and say\nStop this than others ... is this is ridiculous you know and as we've said when you when you think about it I I understand\nWhy they're going there because wherever else was there to go either you were going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country yeah we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you're ... you're going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious at you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this site we add on that last week\nThere is no are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back reverse direction will you we'd said that to letters again really well and and you know when we set it after the election\nUh you because there is that at once they took that break and you know are considered going to the mid west for a

George Jetsons plume lake\nWould I rather do than anything else exactly what I'm doing yeah sure [laughter] what I Would if I can guarantee you whatever given Sunday but no seriously I Know I I mean I I look\nAt a number of things in my dad was a career military police officer and that was honestly I think I was driven to do that or for a long long time and it was my dad actually who kind of laid out you know okay this is how the ... this will go if you're successful at it\nYou know and and a number of things and he said if you want to do this and you know he got his masters degree um and he is a you know where he was in his day or a top military cop right so\nWhen he laid it out to me before coming to this job I was you know by was testing and everything and that's what the that's where I was going\nAnd you know he told me this is the reality and you have to be prepared for the reality because it's even different between the the the the setting in the military which if you were on a base is very secure the differences\nIs they pointed out and uh the Tom Cruise movie or a Jack Jack reaches jak redress or if it's a murder all of the suspects are potentially are trained killers [laughter]\nRight [laughter] that's a little bit different that was a great line\nThat right yeah but the but I mean so my dad was kind of pointing out that you know a number of things that that that considered to consider and I came to this job um and shortly after and uh it just kept coming to work\nAnd I'll quote another movie Richard Gere an officer and a gentleman I got nowhere else to go hand and no one has an answer in a in a in a couple of months at this job and and I love doing this giant to me that that's always Wayne's World yeah what oh yeah\n... where we are a little ways a him as Chris Farley\nBut you know that was what was satisfying about this job as we get to a you know in foreign people are when there is breaking news and and and storms like this\nOr we have experts ready and we can we can warn people in in foreign people and I say I think it ... and then of course the political discussions and that information I think is also key we've heard from a number of people over the years have talked about how you know they they've listened and\nAh they have become I guess more thoughtful in there and their political views\nAnd I think that's a good thing that's all you know that as well as the left starts moving toward violence and and shouting and and what was it that Eric Holder said if you know if they go oh you're in a low well you know kick them yeah right and and\nYou know when they when that happens again I don't know what it at at what point they\nCome back if they ever do to a civil discussion Hillary saying recently that it's the other days well when we when will return to a civil discussion that's basically what her message and her statement\nI I think those with the debate or with the the skills to debate and the knowledge of the ideas on which this country was founded are always going to win when\nThey go low we kick them you know when you were talking about it though what I Would have been a you know what things that might interest you and\nUh this though when you talked about you know radio and I knew this when I was I don't know seven eight years old I knew I wanted to be on the radio might uh that was dominant nothing else really entered my mind\nA bit like I said for years it's what I wanted to do I never thought I'd end up doing talk radio mhm thank God I did because I I couldn't sit and talk about a star is born\nAnd Lady Gaga is wonderful performance every day and and ... by the way I haven't seen the movie so I've no idea what this wonderful or not I'm just I'm I'm assuming that if I'm working for music station I Would have to do that ... what a wonderful performance and the music was just wonderful not that look talking entertainment and we'll talk about entertainment once in a while but to do that every single day\nAnd how it has to be positive about what comes out of Hollywood and do that every single day would everybody knows it would kill me to be able to do this and articulate ideas\nAnd and uh there's there's two things first off the people to call you and say thanks so much because I've learned a lot that's that's a wonderful thing to have wonderful thing\nThe other wonderful thing and people are saying might think well you can't really me that I Do is when people call you with extreme passion of how they disagree with you mhm\nBecause I'm always amazed wow they really care what I think [laughter] yeah I'm really I I always get that really\n... somebody's really ticked off at me for something I said you're you're getting really loud and that's interesting and so I said to me that and I know it's gonna happen but you know when we talk about the Democrats and the whole instability thing I Will tell you this\nWhen I'm dirt during the campaign\nBecause of the way that you and I you know we've always done shows we don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat no and you know we're we're conservative you know slash libertarian I have a lot of liberal friends right and and and I don't know if they'd comb your friend any more of a well we but we don't we don't care that the politicians that we analyze we don't care what your label is\nIf we're agree with you we will if we don't we don't\nA lot of people are bothered by that ... even on the Republican side had been bothered over the years and I'm starting with Trump when we disagreed with him we've respectively disagreed with a of ... when I first got to talk radio George Herbert Walker Bush ...\nRead my lips no new taxes [laughter] so it goes all the way back there with a with W we disagreed with a lot and and ah I'm with a a Trump a few things not ... you know and but the things that we just grew with Trump I Will say our core to our belief\nAs as conservative and free market or you know a a people when it comes to\nEconomic things ... uh and so we may be passionate about it but the vast majority of what Trump does you know I eat what he actually does substance wise and the legislation that he puts forward and the executive orders that that he puts forward when you actually read into it on his foreign policy\nUh I've been one hundred percent uh agreement with but ah\nYou know to be able to do that to be able to go on and just to have you know the freedom and creativity oh I Know the porno mode to make\nThat as it seems that everything is getting on civil law out there ... and things are going crazy I don't know what it is but it's like and I know would you agree with me we've never had this discussion\nSeems like I'm getting less flak\nYeah because I'm not really getting there are no I mean I there was more ... anger a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago or you know from the response that we you know the ... that I Would get from the things that I Would say ... very few and far between now\nWell and and I think the ah while the tactics clearly have changed and when the tactics change and they'd go the direct route as they call it and they became they become a ... it's it's beyond a protester\nIt's someone who's going to be in your face\nAnd when that happens they don't have because why do they go there\nBecause they don't have a debate anymore they don't want to have a debate I'm not saying this is the case where everyone on the left in fact I think there are plenty plenty of Democrats out there right now they can't stand what's going on on the left and\nCan't stand a first of all had no need for Hillary Clinton or or if they did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago\nHighly disagree with that kind of tactic and will use it but the problem is is that\nThat's squeaky crybaby whining wheel is always going to get the grease\nAnd that's where the cameras are that's where the social media is\nI I I look at it and I think to myself that the reason and Benin talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now\nFor is insane as it seems\nTo be out there I Know the flack that I get is extremely light\nI think probably people have taken it to social media but I really believe that the point is is not that are that are arguments had changed any or had become stronger we may and I think it should be called talk show host you learn\nHow to debate batter and put your points\nAre for the better I think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane I mean right now they're just insane and so people you know they look and they say okay\nYou know ... what's what's McNamara saying today okay I disagree\nBut uh he's not insane like they are over there I really think it's worth a we were you you know you if you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too\nAnd when you see that the opposition\nOne of the worst gal dropped I ... and and history and pepper internationally I kept mine for stocks they this month certainly no ... we're seeing investors really worry about rising inflation a rival interest rate as the inflation go up or saying that said take this\nTake this course of raising interest rates\nDown dropped more than ... point I'm only a Francis\nDebate was so tempting free trip gifts then you've got hooked by the

New York time CNN poll was a ten eight to ten ten so if you look at uh the previous poles and the swing the CNN poll going back to nine twenty\nFive through nine twenty nine Rosen had a four point lead\nAnd now that swing a has been a total of six points for for Dean Heller in recent days this is why we talk about pre Kavanaugh post Kavanaugh but especially the hearing\nAnd then you would look the hearing that entire week of discussion and and craziness\nAnd then the vote this last Saturday as you mentioned that's really the the period you want to look at and of course after that what changed if anything change the minds of a the voters and which voters which group the Democrats as you mentioned\nNot you can't find one that's getting a real bump but there are a couple of Republicans that seem to be getting something from it is enough to where is it long lasting will stay there are in till election day well keep in mind a couple of things first of all\nA within a couple of weeks you can start seeing early voting\nAnd those that are motivated will have that when you see early voting numbers are that are up that means people are really motivated and very anxious chomping at the bit to get out and and vote\nNow in the the the New York times poll I guess we're still continuing the it's called allied pole or the one in Texas right so they they start doing it again tomorrow but as of right now and that's the woman had Ted Cruz up by nine now using cruise up consistently\nUh you know in there and I look I I still believe Texas has different animal and probably wouldn't be the same\nAs as other states I I Believe that that uh if Cruz when if cruise wins by you know double figures yeah I think he would have always won by double figures irrespective of the cabin our race yeah I I just think Texas is a different animal than than other states are in the\nWell we're going to see continued rainfall in areas where they don't need any more rainfall that's for sure we'll see the system move through southern Georgia or most of South Carolina and the low country of North Carolina where the ground is already saturated the trees are sitting in mud\nAny amount of wind is going to topple those trees and we could see some additional flooding in those areas I mentioned also tornadoes if you picture a a hurricane coming onshore at a hundred and fifty miles an hour when it hits the land\nIt begins to slow down a little bit because it encounters homes and trees and the ground friction slows the surface movement\nOf the hurricane but as you go aloft a thousand two thousand feet up the system is still advancing pretty rapidly well that sets up a window gradient and when we get a wind gradient we get rotation and a potential tornadoes are spawned as a result\n... and of course when you look at the the flooding are often the most deadly part of a storm or that's something that as you mentioned on the ground saturated in the Carolinas but but certainly even in Georgia a with this kind of rainfall flash flooding is is the big threat correct\n[noise] it is a flash flooding and the result of flash flooding I'm aware of one possibly two deaths at this hour we're not going to believe our\nEyes when the sun comes up I just want to mention that we're going to see drone footage for miles of homes destroyed of the canopies\nOver gas

deservedly goal of removing the book\nAnd Henry curly red I review\nAnd I'm Gary McNamara long where there are currently eight six six Ninety run I let's get an update on now\nTropical storm Michael as we turn to meteorologist Tom hello good morning Tom good morning All right so where are we with ah with Michael and what is the the storm in terms of the power of this storm still look like\nWell the power of the storm is still there at about five thousand feet we've got when that are blowing at about eighty miles an hour they haven't diminished all that much and with thunder storms those thunderstorm wins the downdraft translate some of that wind so we have higher gas and so for that reason alone\nAt windows still an issue especially when it gets a cross into North Carolina because we talked about this for four days in advance as Florence was coming in that they had already had some saturation from a remnant\nA of a tropical storm that pushed its way on through and and of course when\nObviously Florence came through the low lying areas that are run up through a Fayetteville\nAnd a south of Raleigh that entire area is still very saturated John trout touched on it and he said trees are sitting in mud and that's exactly what it is we had ... that's the event that we had in the Carolinas with a very slow moving Florence\nAnd as this storm moves up through there I think there'll be a lot more ...\nA plane and also there's going to be obviously a good deal more flooding now yes they're likely to get about two inches of rain in that area but it doesn't take\nMuch for a little bit of flooding to to reef re and develop and it's west of there where the heavy flooding is actually going to be taking place\nA toward Raleigh and then back up a a up into Virginia ah Lynchburg, Virginia Roanoke, Virginia everything on the eastern side\nOf the mountains there [noise] uh up to Charlotte and nor folk that entire area um is gonna see anywhere from a three to as much as eight inches of rain as it gets further on up [noise] um and there's a you know why not to include here\nAre the folks over Allen the outer banks from okra coke island which is down towards the south end up to duck or they're under a storm surge watch in effect ...\nAnd and and how I I guess what is the potential there in terms of that storm surge uh and and what the the height might be\nA four feet okay to democracy yeah\nUh you know it'll inundate some neighborhoods some some areas where it'll come out of the banks um but um it's when you think about it it it just goes to the power of this now tropical storm\nAnd its Winfield yeah right yeah and so you just that's\nJust amazing I mean if you look at the the power of Michael has came ashore a a Wednesday afternoon\nAnd something that we've touched on yesterday during our program and that is the the because of that power because of that energy behind the storm and it grew after of course uh we got off the air\nUh the intensified that that means it's a longer lasting a storm so you're expecting Michael to still be a tropical storm a strength in terms of a ... when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah yeah why why so [laughter] yeah well\nAh to our friends in Europe or you know um you can have we hope you does it does that does that are on the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then yes okay yeah\nWow yeah I did I just assumed by the time he got ... probably be cool down so I'm surprised to hear that but there are still warming up yeah and all and\nAnd and that's why we're having these storms or you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth major hurricane\nThat we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total ...\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it gonna kinda lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter] yeah\nYeah right yeah and you were right 'cause I I'd asked that question which brings into another question that is just

I Wonder if there is pressure inside Congress I guess it's just pure speculation\nBut inside St look if you're going to do after we got to get the steel and aluminum done we're not going to do around and do it let's get everything done and that's putting pressure on the on on the White House or the fact is yeah you know having NAFTA is going to\nAt least stabilize the market with some good and bad\nAs we have gone through and we have gone through a a nap to because we do believe that if if the new NAFTA passes\n[laughter] it'd be trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA if it passes it's gonna hurt the auto industry it's not going to help the auto industry is going to make cars more expensive that's not a good thing now initially when you say it it's something that may not hit the market at that particular point\nYou know at at but when you take everything together the worries about regulation in the tech sector or all of a sudden the the you know the the fed or raising rates are the fact that the bond yields are going up again it's taken us taking us more interest money\nUh to to service the the the the debt and the possibility of the trade war with China where there isn't doesn't seem to be any type of conclusion and still a great uncertainty about\nA steel and aluminum tariffs and still and uncertainty whether you know Congress really hasn't there's been no indication from Congress or the leadership in Congress about the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA\n... well you mentioned now or the the terrorists and the PG taking a ten percent hit yesterday a and you that this is a very old company but talking about raw materials and the cost of raw materials\nAnd and so as you know there are essentially they're manufacture a and and distributor\nOf of uh of of coding and special materials special materials\nBut that is also part of the auto industry so the the the car sales ah the automobile sales\nHave seemed to have stalled out for now or what's behind that are certainly you know that the cost of automobiles is going up and that is directly related to terrorists\nThen there's a greater demand for used cars at when there's a greater demand for any group in terms of products that cost goes up so it is it's a number of things that hit start to hit all at once and you go back to\nAll right well how much of this is controlled\nBy either the fed or the federal government\nAnd how much of this this cost of government and right now you could look at ... and I think you could look well at interest rates and ran and you see those two right now sticking out but everything that we just said here\nIs related to what government regulation ...\nEverything that we just and I didn't even think about that until you just said it\nThere and say wow everything is government regulation right is so you can actually make the argument that hurt it irrespective whether it's trade agreement government regulation the fed rate you know ah on on interest rates are the the debt that with the debt that we have in service seen our our debt all of it goes back to\n[laughter] in in some way a\nGovernment\nA regulation and when we talk about the tech industry\nAnd what are they worried about government regulation so it all gets back to that we've said this before and you know look when we you know we've gotten into great debates and disagreements with the administration about ah you know their their policy on tariffs therefore or new label turf babies\nAre that the president came up with a but the look in the real world you raise prices it hurts and economy and the story right\nYou can sit there and go ra ra ra usa usa you can have all the chance you want\nBut if you raise the cost of goods and services it always hurts an economy and hurts workers\nAnd just because you wish to chant or\nYou know just say America First doesn't mean America is necessarily first by the policy that you put in because you love the slogan slogans mean nothing ... economics is related to how people respond to incentive\nIf you make the cost of goods more expensive it's going to hurt an economy not my opinion it's the reality of economics and the story well\nAnd and again it is something that can be controlled through policy it as something that can be a temper and why do we want ... why do we want to step in front of the progress that's been made that terms of you\nKnow ... what do we what's been done by the administration has done so much good that when they do bad that's going to we believe hurt them ... because I don't believe\nThat a Republican\nIn the United states can handle a bad economy as bad as they ... a Republican president can not handle bad economic news as well as a Democrat I Can't tell you why but it's just the reality although I got rid of Obama got elected for a second term there was nothing moving in the economy right\nI don't believe Republicans can survive a bad economy especially if you look good economy and then it goes down over the next two years and what is it what it was the first couple of years\nI think at that point almost all Republicans in this day and age are much more vulnerable because Democrats cell that better than Republicans do yeah\nUh you know you see that the interest rates rising and the you know any kind of slow down in in major sectors\nThen you you put those together ... the housing sector at the at the toward the end of of or I guess getting close to the actual fall out of the subprime mess the fed was raising rates\nSo you have these these loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant when it jumped to that ultimate rate it was going to be much higher than expected well when you had delinquency rates\nAre as as they started to creep up and up the forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that one\nDana Dana degrade here she then went back into the

with are currently eight six six Ninety right I well it is now a tropical\nStorm Michael but still a very dangerous storm as a now we turn to a meteorologist Tom hale who joined us good morning Tom\nGood morning don't let that fully right yeah because uh you you you look at the footprint of of a tropical\nStorm Michael now a which has been wreaking havoc on on a Georgia\nAnd headed for the Carolinas and it's it's the satellite photos or just a amazing or just ... and and this this storm again still has plenty of energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update or within twenty five minutes or so\nBut yeah the last update has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect in the next report that to decrease\nI Would think so it should drop to probably fifty if that um it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop is reasonable although it\nLooking at it and radar and just kind of clocking it I I I don't think it'll drive more than ten miles it might pick up a mile and forward speed gone to the northeast it may be Twenty one miles an hour and I had earlier predicted it would exit the United states at about twenty three twenty five miles an hour [noise]\nUh but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia\nWell before it exits out of here yeah um yeah it's a um it it it's an incredible storm it let me give you a little kind of a broad overview\nOkay along the coast and the outer banks they're gonna see storm surge from the storm in the Carolinas of two to four feet\nThat's water inundation rice and then you can at high tide waves which could cause some problems it's not the biggest one there then we'll be another one that's not the biggest one it will be feeder bands and we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes\nNow these tornadoes and the feeder bands that feed her bans are coming in from the east and moving off to the west so that kind of curbing from southeastern northwest and the bans have individual storms at him and they're moving out of about forty miles an hour now those individual storms are capable of brief\nSpin up tornadoes\nIn the individual little super cells and as we get into the afternoon those storms will be heating up in the afternoon maximum heat and that's going to happen primarily over the Carol North Carolina\nWhere you're going to see that the greatest potential for tornado activity but it's a wind and so whether it's a to an addict wind or it's a sustained tropical force winds to forty to forty five miles an hour\nIt's going to do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage\nAnd it's going to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina or what has gone on as Florence and so it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed that most of them because of the wind has been toppled over we've seen a lot of root ball photos right on on\nTelevision mhm so boom overcome the trees now what are the trees hit the power lines\nBingo so we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand customers now that's they count customers is homes right\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that number is low and an ear it already a one and a half million people already without power\nAnd that number is going to grow\nAs it gets into the Carolinas and I think the next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence\nBetween the Carolinas that over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power\nAnd then you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area a thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nThey're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas Georgia and so forth they are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh\nAround the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so you know they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "11"}
