about the limousine a modified Ford Expedition according to New York's governor it should have never been on the road after failing inspection just last month the governor says the driver didn't have the proper license to be behind the wheel\nWhich would be a likely voters unless the questions that they asked to make it so it's tougher to figure out who will likely voter is\nSix months before six months before an election right up and and I don't know what that would be a they don't that's a good point yeah right I Am so um you know we were looking at some of the different analysis out there what are the analysis that I was telling you about\nI'll bring it back up here coming up a little bit later on the show but it was really interesting saying\nThat in a normal election for example that you know and this was talking about Ted Cruz\nAnd uh uh Robert Francis or ... year in ... not in in the state of Texas and it said that and and you were talking about the ... the average went from a toss up to\n... yeah they well they had it ... the state this is our state Senate race went from toss up to ... ah ah leans Republican and it will it end if it if the polls keep trending the way they're trying now it will likely go likely Republican before the elections\nAnd ... and they the some of the analysis of looking at said six percent of Republicans a will in an average election ... will either sit out the election or vote for the other candidate mhm\nAnd they made the point that if that six percent of it was just a normal election and that six percent which is a huge amount ... old decided to vote for a walk and he would still win by five hundred and fifty thousand\nAnd votes cruise would still hurts would still witness yeah yeah I'm ... and looking at the the breakdown of it and the the uh the history of of those waters\nBecause you look in El Paso in his district um and and El Paso county uh it it he can run for that house seat and keep that house seats as long as he wants it better Rourke\nYou when you move out to the you know the the broader much broader state of course the demographics change drastically um Dallas County All right he might win that uh there's in fact you if you looked at the polls\nI'm sure Dallas County would show going for him Travis County Harris County so those are Dallas ah Austin and Houston\nAre respectively if if you're if you're not familiar with the counties but that's those metro areas are tons of support tons of money coming in from\nUh the packs that he promised to or not ah except uh in terms of that and and and not he well he promised to reject the the the pac money I guess in in earnest but you really can't reject pac money pac money\nUh ultimately I guess but the the point being is there's a ton of a liberal money coming from out of the state a ton of liberal press from out of the state\nAnd of course uh the the make up the demographics in those those areas that we talked about a bear county in San Antonio uh same thing so you've got all these are blue counties\nAnd these metro areas and and that's that's kind of the breakdown of it and he'll do well and and likely win and those that were that were mentioned are and some other counties in or districts\nIn the state but ultimately it comes down to the broader stay as it always does and uh right now it's got to according to our sleepy leaning Republican\nAnd looking at a Tennessee uh uh for example you know as as we look at how did the cabinet thing and uh how might it have you know change the way that that people are looking and you look at the CNN the tendency race\nAh Marsha Blackburn against a a Phil Bredesen\nA British thing was up by five ... democratic challenger back from the poll taken just from the eleventh of the September to the Fifteen\nHe was up by five and a from the twenty ninth to the second Blackburn up by five ... from the second to the fifth which took us to Saturday and write a note tickets to friday friday yeah Blackburn up eight ... that's a third team point movement in\nA matter of a a matter of a month and that's why we've always said we don't really\nWhen you see plus or minus ... ah you know five or even six or even seven ... it doesn't give you an indication\nAs to you know how the polls may tightened and this is the time right now I mean I'm Talking about right now in the election fight is when you get a much better idea we always hear from our listeners that polls are never right mhm that is incorrect analysis\nA you know\nPresidential elections for example you and I really paid attention\nA front in two thousand two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen ... after the election saying how many polls were close and normally you find\nUsually a a three or four of the polls were probably one or two we're almost dead on and three or four pretty close then you have the you know some of the outliers out there and we always bring that to you after a presidential election but the polls actually do do a good reading in the ... there were a couple of polls that were\nDead on they didn't have Trump winning ... because they just do the popular vote they don't do the electoral vote\nOr but they were dead on us to the boat mhm what Hillary won by what two percentage points for a and so there were a couple of polls that were dead on but they didn't figure out the electoral college so they didn't figure out in those states in those particular states because they weren't doing the electoral electoral college\nAnalysis right so uh but they had the the actual vote count which again we come to a presidential elections from now on if the Democrats if a case you're Cortez doesn't succeed in\nGetting rid of the electoral college in the Senate [laughter] uh you know a\n... will will they started trying to figure out are doing more detailed analysis and ah because you've had a you know a a Trump you know have this had this victory so right it'll be interesting to see what what happens there will go be going over some of the polls but yeah the un says that we're doomed\nUnless we pay the amount by twenty Twenty one hundred\n... two hundred and forty dollars\nTax on a gallon of gas okay\nBy our money one hundred no no I here's what I Will commit you what you I Am willing I I cannot speak\nMy children grandchildren great grandchildren or anyone else in my family that is present now or will be present in the future\nBy if I Am I live\nIn a year Twenty one hundred will will pay that tax you know it's going to happen don't you some scientist is totally totally gonna mess that up for me\nHey we found a way to make your lives six hundred years oh yeah yeah yeah ... well on the old cat that I thought you might come up with a new energy form like the movie the St ... with ... ... well no see here's the thing\nBy Twenty one hundred if we're not transporting\nIf we [laughter] if I Can't just sit there and then ... just something ... which I'm giving up and all but you're forgetting word where does the energy come from robots to disassemble and the Adams of a person and then put them back together that's got to be\nYou know it may take the energy that that a nuclear bomb would create in order to do that for a human being we're assuming that the energy source is there for\nBeaming oh it is it can be tremendously because it may beaming may leave a huge carbon footprint or a black hole\n[laughter] it's it's something that just came in like in the last minute you started with the end of the show going what the hell are they going to a to a man they've just totally lost their mind also\nComing up hurricane now Michael a could hit Florida as\nHurricane three wild ... you know a hundred and ten miles an hour you look at the analysis a and and apparently from the flyovers as as you and I are following it and we are not meteorologist salvo John trout is with us of\nCourse every hour um and we we look at that and but you when you read the discussions the the discussions changed drastically and those reports from the national Hurricane Center on Monday morning and they started to show signs of that and that ah Michael strengthening\nA and having potential to strengthen greatly\nLate Sunday and Monday morning but then they saw there's apparently a sheer that's involved here that they said typically would mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm but they said despite that share and I I read the ten pm central discussion on it and it said it defies all logic that the sheer is still in place\nOr this this element essentially that would diminish the strength or keep the strength from growing I guess I'm despite that and they think maybe it's because of the size of the I thirty five miles I uh\nIt is it is showing great potential for strengthening so for our friends there uh in in the Gulf Coast in on the panhandle of Florida\nListen to the authorities listen uh to keep your radios on uh make sure you were up to date on the information because this storm again has the potential to be and most are calling it now or that they're saying there's a likelihood of a a major hurricane hitting\nThe panhandle of Florida I Lived there for three years and\nNothing yeah I was I was I was lucky but ah I have a lot of friends down in that area so uh well we'll have the latest uh on that on the latest updates when the hurricane center or gives or update which would be another hour yeah uh I think I Know\nAlthough the ...

I think I don't know I mean you know you'd have to tell the bell rings but we're in a very heavily democratic district\nYou're going there I mean there's tons of people are talked about how it's broken and it's so polarized both of which I think are true um and you're also coming really as an outsider at a moment where I think people like for watching what happened today and want to storm the gate and you're going to actually do that well that's what's what's your plan here well I think\nA lot of it how they were changing our strategy around with that you know there's a lot of the pie baseball and inside the beltway or you know ... where we had that term thrown around but\nThere are very ... organizers when Congress and I do think that organizers operate differently from different kind of strategy and what it is really about Oregon article\nAnd and really thinking about that word Oregon I think that ... people ... action or that we're in bringing together at Cal strategy of putting pressure on the shoulder instead of only focus on the ... in fact that's that's really interesting thought [laughter]\nIt is [laughter] I I did [laughter] and\nSo this was on social media over the weekend and you know what the response was from almost ... almost universal huh no no no no I have yet adult from yes from British Conservative yeah it was like why are from the Democrats\nStop stop ... over analyzing what she says she's not the leader of the Democrat she's not the leader she's only going to be in a small district you're right because of her performance she isn't going to be right now the probably the leader of the Democrats until she gets into Congress\nAnd she starts actually saying what she believes instead of the mumbo jumbo stop because I don't know why she's going to win the she going to win or\nYou know in that heavily democratic district she's going to win anyway mhm but you know her her you know she she is setting up I mean we know what she is she's a true socialist ... she's a social issues and she calls it a democratic show socialist and you have to because the first you saw there was a democratic socialist before you become an authoritarian socialist\nAnd then I don't mean to a authoritarian dictatorial communists\nLike Cub Scout [laughter] on law and yeah you know you gotta you gotta ... she got an oriental during the ... that you've

Chris Hayes on MSNBC oh that's very interesting you didn't set a interesting yeah if I knew what it meant it would be more interesting yeah that's it is that uh you know just kind of ...\nLook ... if you look if you go back to the history of ah of Brock Obama's political career\nWho he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right\nBut the community organizers special him in the Chicago area oh the comedian and a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means a you know for politically or for any area\nNot just Chicago but getting people to the polls they they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they own that better than the Republicans that in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it and two thousand eight\nAnd in two thousand twelve they beat Romney's team Romney was if you you and I were following the post debate polls be the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney and Obama President Obama at that time\nAnd the polls showed that Mitt Romney or on the issues landslide numbers even the exit polls yet and so

Gainesville ...\nAnd closer honoring the victim's family or friends says\nHurricane Michael gaining strength right now is it barrels towards the Gulf Coast forecasters warn it is expected to hit later this week is a life threatening category three storm they were all just martial arts as strong as expected to dump four to eight inches of rain on parts of Florida Alabama and Georgia actually\nHurricane warnings out for portions of I'm far southern Alabama across the Florida Panhandle and then there was a surrounded by some tropical storm warnings and watches and it was pretty much will cover near the landfall so what the impacts expected to begin early Wednesday and then continuing during the day Wednesday\nIt is the substance of where we stand on the issues and us explaining the substance\nThat really really counts one of the things that we have done\nIs we try to find those on the left that aren't trying to be political hacks which means those on the left agree with us ah and we\nAnd we try to bring we we tried to bring the intellectually honest\nA left in and we've done that in the analysis for example of President Trump and many of the different controversies\nThat the the media believes that uh he has created into those people are Jonathan Turley\nA the a well known constitutional lawyer and also Alan Dershowitz both did not vote for Trump ... or ... especially you know more I Know more about his political past than even Turley but he is an absolute\nA dyed in the wool a liberal but he believes in the constitution and he believes in the bill of rights he isn't\nThe school left as sort of like a communal paleo that we've\nUh playing on the many many Times She's old school too and they don't know they look at today's Democratic Party and they say exactly like we do it they're they're becoming the mindset of a fascist that the authoritarian streak is not in Trump it's in the Democrats ...\nOn Fox yesterday they brought in Bryan dean right\nWho is a Democrat strategist who said\nDemocrats will suffer the rightful consequences of using the victims of sexual assault to advance a political agenda\nHe was on a Fox and friends and he explain what he meant\nBrian being right and joins us now to explain what\n[noise] well I think what we saw in the beginning of August we had an opportunity to do the right thing which is work with Republicans quietly privately and investigate those allegations not in the public domain not do a a fact finding mission in front of cameras what to do this correctly\nAnd instead we use those allegations that the last possible minute and we rallied up our base and we frankly we traumatize a whole bunch of people are not just miss for them but also a lot of folks in America who have ah suffer from sexual assault\nSo that is the strategy that I've found appalling are watching these past couple of months so of the two parties who's more energized Brian going into the midterms [noise]\nI think we have a horse race I think it's neck and neck I I think that's a real question or for November is going to be more to these independents fall so what's really interesting is that the polling shows the independents are leaning ever ... ever so slightly rather to uh to Trump and to the Republicans\nOut and this is especially true of men a white man Hispanic man and those folks who do not have a college education\nAnd other words that is the Trump coalition and so if in fact that continues to happen that's that's really the coalition coming home for November So really benzene\nThe strategy that that they are Democrats employed or has backfired\nYou know the ... and here's another thing that the women and and I talked about there's five or six women that I Know that I've been close to for a long long time ... all of them at least over a decade\nAll professional women when I first met them ... you know and and um it's ten to Fifteen Years ago\nNot that political the majority I think one in their mid to late thirties the other in their forties and fifties early fifties ... and all professionals okay all executives and professionals\nAnd when I first met them none of them really political and they knew that when I first met them that I was a talk show host and it was ... now when I talk to them total interest in what's going on in politics all of them over the course of ten to Fifteen Years not because of my influence\nOr want to make that clear a are extremely conservative\nThey are a whole not at the Republicans there appalled if the Democrats\nAnd so there is this mainstream media narrative that women naturally uh are attracted to the side of Dr Ford\nAnd feel sympathy and hate the Republicans for what has happened well the woman that I've talked to and again uh you know I've ... I've explain\nYou know what what their background is every one of them know the fact that Dianne Feinstein could have kept a secret they look at it and they said the Democrats lose across the board here the Democrats lose because they could've kept quiet\nThey could've kept that she was she claimed she want it now they're suspicious as to who's telling the truth here but they said even if you believe\nDr Ford and that she really truly wish to keep it quiet then the Democrats completely betrayed her Dianne Feinstein completely portrayed her because as he just said and he's a democratic strategist\nThe Democrats had the chance to keep it all quiet to fulfill her wishes and still do an investigation and they said no we don't care about the woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted\nAnd wishes to have her anonymity we are going to use her as a political football we say to that earlier and I'm sure there were Democrats dating down on a there is a democratic strategist saying the exact same thing\nThat's what will hurt the Democrats is because that's what he as a Democrat believes that they have done\nWell and that's the damage that's his job is to assess essentially damage what works for them what doesn't work for them\nAnd it is not it did not work for them on any level\nBut not only did you have that situation where they clearly leaked it to the media then beyond that you had the overreach with the two additional accusers coming forward and ultimately the nail on the proverbial coughing in that\nThe sweating the allegation that came across from her by their hands through her lawyer\n... that was not only overreach but it was clearly a tactic by Abernathy who clearly has it out for this current president\nSo I have to ask this question because you know after on on Saturday on on on Saturday when I heard it okay we're going to you know but you're Jerrold Nadler okay if we take Congress we're going to impeach we're going to a beach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach we're going to a beach\nAnd I thought that would die out because I thought to myself well that's a pretty bred by you know bad strategy you have lost in a variety of ways here I don't think this is a win for you so why would you go out and attempt to motivate\nThe right unless you believe you would motivate the left but still if you could impeach them you're not going to he's not going to leave\nYou know it'd be his Supreme Court seat you would need to go to the Senate\nNow ... and this is the question I was asking does the house\nOr the the Democrats who believe that they would be part of the house leadership and that would be the head of the house Judiciary Committee a you know under under you know uh what would go on it if if the Democrats won a the the the house\nUm are they saying that because they believe that the people to both of them are idiots and they believe that they believe that impeachment means we can take 'em off the seat\nOr do they believe that this would just motivate their base and then they'll completely drop it if they win that they have no intention of of going after impeachment and hold him they'll\nScream obstruction by the the Republicans that that we wanted to get it done but the Republicans wouldn't let us get it done 'em and that we still want to get it done a it is one of those campaign promises\nThat is definitely going to fall short rolled over to obligations if they had the if they had the the the majority of Republicans couldn't stop an investigation up and people will not an investigation\nThe investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing is it's the promise ultimately what that you'll remove him from the bench\nAnd that and not only what happened that that's not going to happen and what are you gonna do Dr Ford said she she's done or he doesn't want to be part of it are you going to subpoena all these women and bring them back again right so that would be my question if democratic strategist are out there stating you've done damage to your own party drop this well\nBecause here's a question when you start moving in that direction how did you move in that direction and go through the entire process without learning who leaked the media is not going to tell you because they don't have to reveal their source but the investigation if you look at an investigation where would go and it will be public\nI mean there's nothing here in terms of classified material that is going to be in place this will be a very public investigation how do you\nThat without revealing who leaked and we know who leaked it so the problem is they don't want that on ... the Democrats who leaked it don't want it on record\nLeslie

because I still don't fully understand it okay the only thing I can get his he's trying to please both sides yes without pleasing anybody with no matter\nWhat the president will announce later today Tuesday and then oh he'll go to Iowa after he announced this um and he'll talk about uh you know no doubt while he's in Iowa the you know it it is the corn state\nWhat he's proposing is raising it not um ended on the blend but raising on the line with on the blend a Fifteen Percent and then allowing wanting to change the credit\nFor uh those blanche so uh this is a centrally would\nBe kind of a cap and trade means ... approach well there are credits though that they that the oil companies can buy okay oh they don't want to put like right now they don't want to uh Bob ... blend at\nPercent they can buy credits from other companies and then get the exemption so if they have those credits\nThey're still compliant even if they're not blending up to ten percent he wants to allow them to blend it Fifteen Percent and to sell it year round the pushback on selling it year round has been for eight Fifteen\nHas been that or eat ten even is that especially with the Fifteen while the more ethanol you have in the blend\nThe more smog there is which is why you don't see a Fifteen a widespread and even the ten blend um but the they want eight Fifteen to be able to be sold year round voluntarily and incentivized\nThrough changing the credit situation with those blenders with okay company so does it take to complete mandate offer you still mandated to be able to ten percent there the ... the mandate is still at ten percent\nSo then it would be Fifteen Percent but the credits would give you the the incentive to do it even though I don't see\nThe oil companies are not ... they're not responding to this a proposed ah it it is just a proposal now but they're not they're not responding at all they they don't\nDoes here for this idea does does this increased the taxpayer subsidies\nFor ethanol a ... I have not seen that changing the only numbers change in terms of ah I guess dollars are changing hands is\nThe credit now you would have to go through of course a Congress to get those subsidies and everything else the president may say I will push for greater subsidies what is pushing for a year on the surface really is selling more ethical\nWhy yeah this is sold job that doesn't well it doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't care about the credits\nThey don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them get the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about in the past racing the mandate right to ... percent right well if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big problem politically ... outside\nOf Iowa got I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased and anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them\nI'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do right and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback\n... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I like the the ... why a city like Houston in LA they don't want more smog what gas station is going to be the first to put\nWanna put eight Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know of of a faster you could damage your lawn mower\nFaster if you use e Fifteen mhm right that it should just be ... percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it so it's just the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nZero six or visit Nicholas wealth dot com that's Nicholas wealth dot com\nSecurities off duty the insecurity thing remember ...

goal our friends in the panhandle in Big Bend area of Florida keeping a watchful\nEye on hurricane Michael in fact uh so is Westwood One meteorologist John ... who joins us live right now good morning John ...\nGood morning guys so yeah we're looking at the possibility now of a major hurricane a a a hurricane at the level free or above that's greater than one hundred ten miles an hour hitting a in in about twenty four hours from now\nWhat changed over I guess a late Sunday and into Monday the forecast seemed to change and showed the potential for the energy increasing in Michael what what was it that we were looking at or I guess you guys were looking at a that showed that change\nYeah well one of the things that are well a couple of things that will slow down a hurricane would be a wind shear we don't have that one of the things that will slow down a hurricane would be\nColder ocean temperatures we don't have that or lessening of low pressure none of the none of the data that we'd like to see that we'll see uh lessening of strikes is a is a part of this particular forecast now\nSo uh that's where we are getting this rapid intensification as we move from a category one to a major category ... storm\nJohn where do you see it hitting on the Florida Panhandle cause most\nLike talking about yeah we're talking about the Big Bend area somewhere between the Appalachian coal which is down on a state road Ninety eight over to um oh just north of saint Petersburg let's say but we are going to see some road closures definitely guys will see I ten affected from Pensacola to Tallahassee\nWe could see sections of I Seventy five shut down the right to in the Georgia or Florida wine area so are truckers are going to play an important role in this thing getting supplies in and out of the region there'll be needs for diesel fuel and some rebuilding efforts\nYou know with Florence we talked about the reign of at this will be a rain event\nAnd a wind event uh we're looking at the possibility of up to twelve inches of rain all within less than a twenty four hour period of time in that Big Bend area\nWhat about storm surge what is the threat there\nBig time or we're looking at a storm surge and wave heights in and around the\nFive to twelve foot range with a a major category ... storm so that's going to have it impacts certainly coastal erosion will see folks with a coastal interests uh with uh the maritime industry and folks with homes along the return affected\nSo will definitely see some storm surge effect and I don't believe we have a full moon right now but if we did that would increase the likelihood of being under a higher tide certainly inundation being grader\nAt this uh Michael's moving quicker though\nFlorence it's a fast moving hurricane\nYes just slightly faster uh so it's expected to a move into that area and make landfall as I mentioned in the Big Bend area we're looking right now about eight to nine o'clock tomorrow morning and um [noise]\nOr just a hope that everyone hates the warnings is we've got several I mean we're talking thirty six counties I think now under a some sort of a advisory either get out or get ready to get out and of course the state of Florida it's been under the state of emergency now for uh about twenty four hours\nAs we look forward to later in the week we mentioned Florence our friends still in recovery mode after Florence what can they expect in terms of rainfall that might affect them later this week\nYeah we'll see this system move right on up through Georgia and then into portions of South Carolina and particularly southern uh North Carolina so\nNot good news for folks trying to dry out in any of that area from South Carolina into North Carolina uh we'll see not the twelve inches but certainly are between three and five inches of rain but we got to remember those\nThose are creeks and rivers are swollen there the ground is already saturated so any amount of water not good for the Carolinas\nWestwood One meteorologist drawn trout ain't got no thank you so much for your time we appreciate it you got to just\nA John Will be on that for us in the in the coming days of course in a well keeping it will be keeping us posted a lot going on there of course in Florida would just want to remind our friends that are listening and for to please please heat all the warnings and directions by authorities there are and and uh and and and\nTake heat because this is going to be a very powerful and potentially a a again a very strong storm which means it can

perspective it's yeah I Believe it's happening but everything they're doing is is wrong\nA and a a running that the United nations climate paranoid declared that because this was really interesting because this I'm sure we'll be part of of this whole thing\nHere this new report from is this was back in September after the post wrote it\nAnd lumber go writing that the UN a climate pedal declared in its latest report that we're not seeing an increase in hurricanes\nCurrent data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cycling frequency over the past century ... Mr lumber said were seen an increase in hurricane costs\nBecause we hear that all the time right well the warming I mean look at the hurricane Costa hurricane costs are more than they've ever been before ... he says we are seeing an increase in hurricane cause not because of climate change but because more people with more well live in harm's way and noting that the U.S population rose for pulled over the past\nCentury he said declined fifty fold in coastal areas\nAreas hit by Hurricane Florence had fewer than eight hundred thousand homes in Nineteen forty now eleven point three million or one thousand three hundred and twenty five percent increase homes are bigger now and they hold many more expensive possessions adjusted for population and well\nUs hurricane damage has not increased since Nineteen hundred global whether damage as a percent of global GDP actually fell from Nineteen hundred to twenty Seventeen ...\n\nSo and I always like I said I I like going to him because he is somebody who believes he can quantify but he says he believes that that global warming is happening in man has you know something to do with it but doesn't know\nYou know what percentage but he's as you said you can't stop the economy's you can't put people into mass of poverty you can't do these insane things that the left is is they need to do people have to have a quality of life so what you have to do is\nYou have to prevent you've gotta you've you've got to do the preventative things that you need to be doing but everything that the left his too when he criticizes as being absolutely ridiculous well and and that's again\nThe proposals over the years have been a remember the former governor of Oregon saying uh we need to ah essentially a decrease the economy and I forget what the number was but it was in there that are Thirteen Priya under like I wouldn't want to have her team right I thought it was right on that but I was thinking Thirteen and and so\nIf you looked

and you you think about where the supply chain in terms of food\nThe most important item in any supply chain to third world nation\nYou look at the breakdown of that\nNot the supply chain itself logistically but the supplies\nThe content within that supply chain diminished greatly that the insanity that is the insanity that they're proposing the fact of the matter is\nWhen you have people who are willing to have a well intellectually honest discussion about it are you and I said I'm we don't need to be at the table how about the scientists\nThat are on both sides of this have the discussion with the ... the problem with that is the politically driven the very motivated politically driven agenda\nInside of that to the extent that Al Gore by the way why in the world was tea

weekend edition columnist Holleman Jenkins we've quoted him a lot and contrasted an archaeological study of the first century a de Germans who raised dwelling mounds and build dikes in response to

down ... setting a twenty sixteen studying the Stanford law review that said we call weather related catastrophes natural natural disasters but the losses are often do to questionable government policies\nYou said Congress struggled for years to reform the national flood insurance program and it's turned it into a perverse subsidies for coastal development\nYou quoted Bob sheets then head of the national Hurricane Center saint after Nineteen Seventy nine hurricane Frederick\nIt was like an urban renewal program out there he said that the uh twenty Fifteen a A R worldwide and insurance consultancy said climate change it's not climate change but the growing number and value of coastal properties has the largest factor impacting hurricane risk today a whopping Seventeen trillion\nIn property now exist inside the U.S storm surge zone\nWhere is Al Gore when you need to be continued alright the climate change crowd\nHas become enamored of coastal development because it creates a constituency for doing something about climate change well not exactly for doing something about climate change but for throwing more money at coastal dwellers and calling them victims of climate change for the benefit of generating media coverage\nOf climate politics yeah wow yeah no that's a blown genius way ... altogether\nBecause think about what that what what is done\nYou know if you if you look at that and and that's that's what happens if if you look at those you know the the wealth that was created\nUm and is very much displayed on those coasts with people that have the homes than I mean if you've got a beach house think about the value of a beach house right what's that would be now think about what it takes to replace that right\nNot just insurance but then there has to come after the insurance there has to come public aid inevitably well the left has used that are and the emotion behind that because who doesn't want to help\nWild than it is okay this is because this is

of the facts I mean if you if you look at it there'll be tax and this was why they wanted you know a vat tax it's not necessarily because of climate change it's because you can you can implement the taxation at levels before the retail level\nIt becomes a compounding tax like the vat tax this is the kind of policy that they want until you have a centrally tax the poor especially in the middle class because those are the groups that are affected immediately\nAnd greatest then they become what\nEven more dependent on government\nAnd they quote home and drink and some of the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damage by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater

that we've gotten emails on ...\nAre a lot of people very very concerned a lot of our listeners who are very concerned saying you know ... ... what's going on with the Pfizer worn thing it just disappeared what happened and what we did cover it a couple of times ... ah you know over the last\nCouple of weeks but just to just to go over it again so everybody knows and maybe do it in a little bit more detail here where we can spend a little bit more time on it\nOr the the the president ah was going to declassify\nA roughly Twenty one pages including the Pfizer application\nAnd at the last minute before releasing it he decided not to\nAnd he didn't release it because he said\nUh there were some of our allies to did not wish us to release it so he wasn't going to do with yet when we read it we thought OK they what are they trying to do figure out of some of the classified information should stay out\nYou know ... or ... should than they need to read that more and that's what was I think our original thought ... and then the president said I'm going to give it to further review to the inspector general of the department of justice Michael Horowitz\nWell we immediately said wait a minute\nAnd even Devon ... like the day after said you know I don't know why they won't release it and then we thought to ourselves well wait a minute and this is the least covered story in America right now I think mhm the least\nThe the lady made on the road I read her radio exclusive [laughter] have the money to cover it up I possibly the most important story in all of this over the last two years is that the president\nBecause he said and we were at and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain because of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to a release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review\nNow we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded go we couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general than all the sudden it was Doug that's the role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to stay review this\nAnd tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can unwritten pact you use that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence your CIA director and ah your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now you know that the secretary of defense those are the people you would go to\n... to ... to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies\nOr didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the and we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nAs a truck and like you know it was gonna say busting their\nAll of these towns and

were if you want to look in simplify it and just do a couple of words you know in in a very short sentence what we were what we were dealing with the left basically said if you believe in due process you believe in the rape of women\nMhm that's really what mhm\nThat was what the left was dating to us that's unacceptable that was ... when you say things like that Denver fighting words well they're all you do yeah those are words that up those are words that get people upset it is a charge\nToo when you when you make it at ... and it was made by Democrats and because this simple thing is people upset I because I Believe in due process does not mean I don't sympathize\nWith ... with a with rape or sexual assault survivors of course I Do\nBut I also believe in due process under the law and you can do both\nAnd the left was attempting to tell you that you must always believe the woman oh come on that's ridiculous and everybody knows it you judge each and every ... ... ... each and every\nThing that comes along by\nThe evidence in that particular incident that's the only way that we can do it in America it's well known when people come out and said the constitution be damned\nYou're going to create a lot of banks are and and remember more the yanks was coming from their side demanding that you were jak the spirit of the constitution that you were jak the presumption of innocence\nAnd then the allegation that was thrown\nThat if you believe in due process than you believe in rape and sexual assault well sorry a Robert Redford I don't know how you would act in that case but then again you are not being specific enough you're trying to you and this is\nUh I've I've dealt with people you've dealt with people like this before the people that say well I'm going to take the high ground and save civility in law for everyone blah blah blah blah blah you're a coward\nAnd\nAnd I say you're a coward because the the people that aren't are the ones that

and and and reject somebody who says that because I Believe in due process of the law that I Am somehow a supporter of rape and sexual assault I'm going to stand up for it and I'm going to vigorously\nAttack those who put out such a ... well\nYou know to this comment or when he talks about fighting it out to the bitter end you mean November ninth\nOkay wanting sixteenth [laughter] the day after the election because let's let's talk about bitter\nLet's talk about the reaction that started a actually late that night but I mean if you think about the election wasn't cold until November night or so technically it started [laughter] November night but you could see the faces being made among the evening of November\nRate will split those hairs later but the whole bitter rent thing\nSay what you will about this current president and I'm sure he has Mr Redford but the whole thing with pretty much every day since he was elected\nAnd not on the issues but on something that no one can identify\nThere hasn't been one crime identified in connection with Trump his campaign anyone in his campaign and the ... the Russians on the twenty sixteen election not one event we have a\nBig growing pile of evidence that that shows us and no one debate that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign through their law firm\nHired fusion GPS to get on verified salacious information from the Russians and then used that\nTo petition for and ultimately got in October of twenty sixteen a warrant on a member of the Trump campaign let's discuss bitter and Mr Redford\nWell I I just I get a

all of the ... and the anger and the the the bitterness without directly\nAddressing an issue to me that is the height of ... is not willing to actually look stand up for what you believe in if you believe is right and just defended and get specific about it but don't throw me this crap and not get it all the time I Know a couple of\nOf a Facebook friends would do it I'm going to rise above all of this no you're not\nWell simply let me ask you Mr Redford I'm or was it rising above when the Democrats out at Dr Ford\nOr was it rising above when chairman Grassley decided that they were going to delay the process and give Dr Ford in front of the American people or even behind closed doors that was her choice to issue her concerns and make her claim officially was it\nBitter was it divisive

the elites are in in the media in Hollywood and everything else that believe they're not part of either side\nThey just believe that they are part of the absolute right ... you know that they just

still recovering from\nFrom Florence because the ground as John pointed out earlier John trout are pointed out earlier that it is already saturated there in those areas that were affected by Florence\nAnd any rain or is just going to create problems so or not just over the next ah twenty four to thirty six hours but of course as Michael ...\nMore or flooding and other threats along a that a storm path or will certainly\nBe something that people need to pay attention to\nA head of Michael's landed a\nYou know you and I talked about yesterday which was like wow a after this you know after the last really over two weeks of the judge a cabin on the the hearings and\nAnd the ... the confirmation ... and everything that has gone out and the ... all the different uh allegations all\nOf a sudden we got to Monday yesterday and I woke up and it was there is nothing it was almost like a big exhale where it's like okay and where do we get on the axe we need a day to figure out where to the news goes because it wasn't really a big news day right of uh yesterday and it's when I came to the thought where I said\nWhat's the issue for Democrats with everything that you know what I Am disgust over the last two years I actually woke up yesterday thinking what are the Democrats have right what are they going to you besides impeachment\nYou know what is ... you know what is the issue thinking about this or we went through and and even just just before we got to the cabinet nomination it was still know Mahler investigation Trump illusion you and I I I remember ah\nThe ah the most of the the the Thursday of the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day that was the friday heading into Labor Day when and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about Russian collusion no it's not on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab Democrats\nRight now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue and you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys just what they've always use now even though at the same time the American people have said we don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations or the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "09"}
