CNN\nYeah the one side to CNN yes the one that was sent to to CNN was um\n[noise] uh the powder was harmless and but when you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I are looking each other's said man you've got to parks everything's each day yeah you got to be very careful ... ... it says the powder the outer right will Souder along with the bomb right that was in it\nIt was a ... there's ... there's nowhere in the story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the or any stores says that the a suspicious package that was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device\nWas was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source\nRight at an early in the day the NYPD had bad that the um uh but the uh the ... there was the the the suspected pipe bomb nan another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice or would they suspected might be right center you know who knows and um\nBut it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both Obama and the powder are harmless were harmless and we looked at\nYou know who they source for that which was Associated Press an Associated Press nowhere and their says yeah that the that their sources that the bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bottom was harmless or not because from what I've seen and what I have read the FBI has not come out and said these were bomb no no these were alive bombs ready to go off a specialist\nIn nature um and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been using the authorities have been using but the media's been using because the ... what is the media do inevitably they bring on as they're covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert\nAnd then they look at it except they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be\nAnd and so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here so I suppose that is somebody that supports the president and the Republicans\nWhile\nYou just heard the side that you support if that's if that's found out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case in that somebody who just write a less than two weeks before a major election\nYou just hurt their chances and and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a and we've said this all along but there was a rush rush and collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigative ... your point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something like this are and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say\nOkay uh when we find out if they were you know live bombs mhm well then\nYou know that without question was an attempt to kill these people that would end so right you go from it from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was\nThey find out that none of the bombs were active\nThat none of the bombs had any potential of going off\nThen you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things or if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature mhm it was meant\nJust a couple of weeks before an election to help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the the motivation here was to help\nDrive an election to a a a certain side mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well it is if they did this to help Trump did to help Trump and then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump\n... that's ... like I said it has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN\nIt going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive comments out there was nothing could ... be more divisive than accusing another side or a person blaming them for something\nWhere there is a complete lack of evidence as to the motivation of the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm\nNow see I'm not an jumping to China and the signing on to something\nNothing could be nothing could be more device them so they just they're on their high horse screaming but your devices they had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness anyway not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side that it's not possible she shut the door on that just days ago\nWell look this this is we're we we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after steep skull east was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and\nNo no no and\nNone of it's going to all of this has to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made\nThat the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers the media elite ivory towers claiming that they care about stability and they are anti divisive\nThat's what they're about and they hate the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack\nWould they complete lack of evidence to back up their claim there is no evidence of either way there's no way of it\nAnd we may not have it for a long time and the fact is they don't see that\nNo they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack\nUnderstands how obvious it is so not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there's a will there's a again\nA we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm not much you\nCan say the only thing we can report or the the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI or they were sent to you know prominent members ah or or uh or backers of the Democrats and so\nThat's all we can say that's it that's all we know about it\nAnd as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story\nThan we can talk about it but right now\nAbout without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was\nWe can't assign it to anything we have no idea\nAbsolutely no idea no idea\nAnd so that\nThat's where we stand right when we find out more information we'll give you more information\nBut speculation on these things is useless but the thing is that's the kind of nation that we live in ... well sure it started right away and I was thinking too that you know the media getting on their high horse you know that ... that you know hey we don't ever cause any type of device of rice right in and all I have to say is Ferguson\nMhm built on a lie mhm\nCompletely built an ally CNN and MSNBC all over that mhm enabling\nThe the uh\nUh as in in my opinion enabling the range that existed uh attacking law enforcement\nYou and I remember\n\nJake Tapper writing and writing pepper can you believe this police are there in ... has been riots for the last few days of course they're going to stage police in riot gear ... they were they kept pushing the narrative\nThat the you know that the police rotted control hands up don't shoot you remember it right they they they were\nPart of of pushing and amplifying the divisiveness that was based on a lie mhm so CNN don't set up there on your high horse as if we're just the ...\nIt's worthy innocent Arbor tours of the news well\nPresident Trump called the shooters thought process\nWe have to bring back the death penalty

shooting victims and the Pittsburgh synagogue\nHe walked into the tree of life synagogue and yelled all Jews must die before opening fire Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolfe said anti Semitism has no place in the commonwealth\nAny attack on one community of faith in Pennsylvania is an attack against every community safe in Pennsylvania\nThe gunman social media history as a focus of the investigation his writings reveal a belief in a Jewish controlled global list agenda he railed against the Jewish nonprofit that aids refugees they resettled in the U.S I'm Steve cast in ...\nThat has to be said because there's just no that that has to be said by somebody else right well she couldn't say that her\nSort of thing is is this isn't pac money this isn't something this this here\nIs the sort of a campaign this was her at yes it's her she you do hear her voice yet saying I approve this message right so I'm not one of those crazy Democrats one of those dating\nRight I'm not one of those crazy Democrats ... now I ... it's it's I think it's horrible in what it's trying to do\nYou know what I'm saying I it's not effective in what they're trying to get done from the ad because it well it's it's just bizarre it's can try\nOnly thing that that I can think of is that their internal polling is showing that independence or leaning\nAll these way and one of the reasons is because remember she uses these specific word crazy Democrats will they didn't write or some kind of ... there's a reason that huge there's a reason that you do that\nThere's ... and and the reason that you do that is because there is a segment of those undecided voters that you're going after\nThat in your internal polling you have found out they believe\nAnd and I don't know why because I didn't do I I was in ... to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be a you know everything that has gone on it it'd be you know the the going into restaurants disturbing yeah Republicans whatever\nBut in order to use that term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party\nIn a political ad means OK I'm Still safe from the base\nThe base Democrats or I don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independence and they're leaning Holly's way we believe and one of the reasons is they believe that the Democrat Party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress are crazy\nThat can be the only reason you don't do that in an ad I mean could you imagine remember this isn't even a you\nCan't even say well this is just a house race in a particular area there's just a state of Missouri and this is a Senate race mhm\n\nAnd so inside her campaign which means not just in her campaign but other campaigns across the country this is something that Democrats who wish to who wish to promote themselves and pretend to be moderate\nWhat they're facing is a significant portion of independence who believe that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party are crazy when I went in which shows that\nEverything that has happened in the cabinet thing in going into restaurants and is having an effect on independence otherwise they would run the ad\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know of being a the part of the I I guess group that was being polled\nMust have use those words specifically otherwise it's horrible writing because I think a an ad by a Claire McCaskill or could could or for Claire McCaskill could do the same again we're just talking the politics of it\nBy saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides and right now at ... proud of some of the things that are going on in my ... with within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party\n... I Want you to know that I Am not that person ...\nBut that that's the point and that's the great point right there yeah it was specifically using the term crazy Democrats\nHave used that in a Democrat [laughter] some someone had to have used that in some kind of feedback\nThat they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats not extreme right I'm not part of the extreme of my partying because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal polling\nBecause extreme means that you've gone full on one side in in one direction and and to a further extent well no that's not what's going on\nIt it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words\nThat's the only way that happens that's the only way those words end up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy\n\nMust have appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times\nAnd they're in there and terminals\nOn it now you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race yeah which means they're doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get in front of you get down to this point here and\nYou see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception of crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there's a buildup\nThat word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ads strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think at recreating a conversation that\nPeople are you know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and and portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going man\nThose Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill that's the actual conversation so you have to have you have to counter it with this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt\nBut that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against the attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the top things is\nIt's it's tough for anybody ... and and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage to really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in ... in Missouri raised in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded that you\nAre at each and every day but you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that\nHolly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym ... during work hours which with\nAll the heated rhetoric yeah an ad use that show you only thing they can make right up your own and that was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well\nHere's the thing is people are thinking oh wait a minute I Wonder if you could pick me up some wine next time you go [laughter] because people go to the gym during the day\nAll the time well what's what's staple people run errands all the time just assume OK just to frame right that it's if it's on company time and it's it's well the the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on his time\nThat's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five I'm guessing\nThere's just a few hours ... I'm assuming there's meetings there's speeches there's everything else that goes wind meetings to why aren't they going to be a part of a job but it but I I again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just\nWent ... and ... and that's but from an outsider you've heard that in your went that's a pretty weak\nWell for an ad of desperation that's pretty weak what it is I Would have I Would I Would have said\nAgainst ... strategically this is the only thing we're talking about here strategy I Would have stayed on the wait a minute she hasn't tried one case\nYeah the guy just doesn't have the experience he doesn't have the experience of attorney general for our state he's certainly doesn't have experience to serve in the Senate the war he went and bought some wine and\nTo the gym on on a while on the clock that's that's what you got by the way when does an attorney general not on the clock that exactly eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips from Gigi Keller and associates incorporated on customer service getting pulled over for inspection by law enforcement personnel is not a moment that drivers look forward to not only can an inspection set a driver back in their schedule\nAuthority said the Pennsylvania men armed with a semi automatic assault style rifles stormed the tree of life in a God and shot worshipers during Shabaab services police said this was the deadliest attack on Jews in the history of you at\nProducts are made by ... rates are very they credit history Amazon and not sponsored this promotion other restrictions apply the website for details how did I get into credit card debt a trip to the emergency room\nMoving expenses [noise] there's a million ways to get into credit card debt but one sure way to start getting out of von avant ... access to online and secure loans from two thousand dollars for thirty five thousand dollars a competitive race and no extra charges were being back early over five hundred thousand\nCustomers have experienced the convenience of alone drove on no wonder a lot has an a plus rating from the better Business Bureau the application takes medicine if approved by four thirty pm central time Monday through friday funds are deposited as soon as the next business day and now if I Would also give you a fifty\nDollar Amazon dot com gift card after your first thing that has made on time to check your loan options and to get this special radio off or go to Yvonne dot com today and enter ...

do a lot anymore because just because of the time shift ... are used to do all the time and you know public speaking all I never have told people to go out and vote ... ... because I ... number one I never felt that was my real number two I never felt the people that were listening to what I had to say had to be encouraged about\nWell this is the great thing about especially our audience I I think

us going to God that left ... dead and six wounded\nJury bowed ladder reports ... they're trying to find out all they can about this aspect\nTo the forty six year old suspect Robert Bowers who was wounded in a shootout with police has\nBeen charged with twenty nine federal counts including hate crimes and weapons offenses he carried an assault style rifles and three handguns during the attack and reportedly shouted all Jews must die the FBI special agent in charge says Bowers was not known to law enforcement\nOf the a P story that they use as the source there at National Review um the line the effective line from that a ... story is a law enforcement official says tests have determined that a powder\nFound inside a non ... delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless\nA powder was harmless now not the powder and the pipe bomb right right and so that's what they're that's what they're talking about again here in in that story but it's gone viral because the the National Review again unless National Review and do something that we don't but they don't state that understory they're sourcing\nStrictly here the peace story but the reason that it's important is because as you see something like this go viral if that information is is incorrect or any information is incorrect and the discussions are surrounding this event clearly look there's the political aspect of this can't be ignored but\nThe discussion is important because you can't discuss anything without knowing the complete facts you can't discuss much\nWithout knowing the complete facts we've discussed the reaction\nBy the media by uh the the uh Democrats and and what that has been we know very\nLittle about this ... and that's why we have a set to uh a mystery soccer over at the CNN or a whether it was close to your ... and their their comments\nOr you know going after and you know and in essence blaming the president's first provocative statements claiming that they're against divisiveness it's interesting that the people that claim that we need to stop device of this are the ones that have accused somebody of responsibility of an incident where nobody has any idea\nNo one has any idea who the person might be who would have done this we don't know whether the bombs were lie bombs and would have gone off or not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame the the ones who claimed that they are against divisiveness hard committee and the the\nOne of the biggest tens of divisive this and that is what blaming somebody\nWhen you don't have the facts behind you right right\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed just a little bit and and gone through the different questions or as others have yesterday and and we we've asked the question that if it was it if they are life ... if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off\nA then you have to look at that in a different way that if clearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare war\nAnd attempt\nA possibility of an attempt\nTo uh you know\nLook at major figures\nIn the Democratic party that are not like ... well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them ... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a big bomb\nWould be was it said by somebody on the left to try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether the bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\n[noise] yeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who are response\nRight and that could be never\nSo at the you can bet right now they have a number of greatly especially with the fact the nature of of how males sorted or by the secret service\nUh in in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation um that I think you have to take into consideration what they already know about that you know patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing\nAnd and the resources are there are probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral it's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference\nAnd we may learn\nThat uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off but that is not what you're seeing here and the a P report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight is gone it has gone viral that she there wasn't we don't know that yet\nAnd I Associated Press story does not state that and it's important that\nYou know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the\nA reporter for CNN and that looked at Martha ... who was interviewing one of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right mhm you said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state\nThat is trying to destroy the you know this trying to disrupt the election or as you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left\nMhm so\nWhat the CNN reporter pulled out was only the response from this expert of\nThat it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it could be somebody from the right ... ... it could be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away when I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what did the CNN reporter to weed out just deport they report that apparently media matters poured out which is a leftist leaning a or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion\nYou know on the left as if that's who he blamed and Martha McCalla might oh yeah Oh absolutely yeah are fascinating in something like that and see ... responded they all believe it's somebody for fake news will know the fake news is the actual fact checking of the news\nYou didn't include the entire statement right\n\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review and the difference between the story that they used as their stores\nIt's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and have for a long long time but it's important that as you as you\nYou've got twelve days here before the election this is all going to be in terms of the discussion not the investigation but the discussion about it in social media is all politically driven and has been from the start\n\nYou don't win anything by repeating false information\n\nNow you don't win anything by now you know at media matters [laughter] by putting out\nIncomplete information which indeed is false if you don't include the entire statement\n\nThat's how we deal with I mean that's the world really deal with you and I taught I have talked about this many times that ... we spend much more of our time just trying to disseminate what the truth is out there right\nAnd arguing the truth versus the conspiracy theories the half truths that are out there and and it does become frustrating at times\nNow I Will admit that the story that you know the national review story that when we read the Associated Press ... when I read it on so you when I read it\nThe first I said wow Erica look they're saying that the bottom and I read the first sentence\nAnd then I re read it again and went on and it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying that both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless\nThey didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say either way\nRight on that one so\nJust gone ahead and they are Fifteen when you hear about mass shootings in America and you don't hear about
