I just can't I Can't imagine how people especially the blacks in Delaware and I saw it I I I I how how pamphlets out for people on voting day a spot for ... years ago\nAnd and it didn't matter what you did they all just\nThey pulled the de lever all the way down they don't even know who they're voting for\nYeah they've been so thanks for the call I appreciate very much\nThe ah it's it's emotional in my opinion on the other side they just a\n... it's just visceral reaction you know Republicans are bad and Republicans are evil Democrats are good and if you care about the common man you'll you'll vote Democrat and it takes I was a Democrat who originally I tease and say it was a birthright in Brooklyn New York you had no choice\nBut when you realized way as you get older and you grow you see that that's not the case that are actually the Republican solutions are far better in in the long run than the emotional reaction of hope and change or whatever you come up with but it does I must admit it it really bothers me to see that\nYour daughter doesn't talk to you and it's just a it's a sad maybe let's go to McGill in I'm Sorry a McGill in Corpus Christi\nAre you doing today is a real well\nYou know I'm I'm a libertarian or I go to college so I'm not Republican and I'm not Democrat and I got to be honest with you you know I've heard it from both sides you know I've been called\nA racist in a big ... from the left and you know I call the ... you know a snowflake you know from the right and I think it's really come down to\nThis country is being torn apart it seems like to me um by their politics it seems that people are kind of unable to sit down and just you know discuss their politics and work towards\nYou know a a better ... America you know together and I will have to say I'm not trying to figure out but the Republicans in the right wing or almost just as bad about it is\nYeah I don't see that and so by the way I was thinking I was listening to what you said and he said snowflake and I think it's like it's not like calling someone a racist or a big hit your people and I ... and you could be a snowflake and being on the Republican side just means\nYou know things offend you got upset easily and you can handle things I don't mind being called a snowflake it's not anything like being called a racist\nOr I'm a homophobic or anything else and stuff like well I don't think I even like snowflakes so even your comparison makes a senior laughing you agree with me\nI mean I I understand um you know that that is a good point uh I guess I didn't think of it that way but\nYou know also I think a lot of you know from what I see that the problem stem from also a kind of not really being able to hold your candidate accountable\nAnd I think that's one thing that you know Republicans and the right we could do to\nFurther their message and I think it would hope you'll out so much more to trying to get your ideas out there of course is just my opinion but a caller earlier had\nCommented on the second amendment and I'm very pro second ... you know you have a right wing or is like you said that really are Second Amendment we you know if that's what you agree and you want to ban bump stocks and you want to raise you know the age of Twenty one and that's fine but that's not something you agree with a mean old your candidates accountable to that I Would think\nIt's funny you say that because it's funny I have a different view I think that Republicans do turn on their own much more than Democrats to ... ah remember at the health care vote it was all Democrats not one Republican\nOr Bill Clinton impeachment ... none of the Democrats would sign on Kavanaugh you had one Democrat who the Trump won by forty points in West Virginia so you can understand why he may have voted for his nomination\nThey the Democrats the less I really stick together whereas we I don't know you've never heard me before but George W. Bush is an example is position on illegal immigration I could never accept that there's so many things and a lot of us disagreed with him in Iraq\nOr we do it and go against their own so I just want you to see I have a different view I think that we do hold him accountable I I couldn't stand Lindsey Graham's position on illegal immigration but he was a great on camera [noise]\nUh I I think our side really does hold these people accountable and the other side doesn't isn't that funny depends on your perspective what age are you how old are you\nSir I'm Twenty years old\nYeah you're very articulate I thought you were young but I think as I could be wrong but if you check out politics you continue to follow this stuff\nI think you'll see that people on my side conservatives Republicans we I think that we don't we don't the friend people what'd you finding that out um even on social media we I don't care what if you know I'd I'd marry someone who was conservative that that shared my I mean that was a liberal that shared my values\nBut I don't you can see the other side doesn't feel the way they hate the President Trump and people who side with them so much that they're willing to abandon their the daughters willing to ban and the father\nI don't see that side hey ma Galileo's I had no longer if Ptolemy and Marcus the show dot com if you listen to me longer I have a feeling after a while like if you're just a bit maybe might or what do you think OK Britain First date you\nThank you so much thanks mckell and it was a lot of fun talking to you and I want to talk to the rest of you at eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine tell me your experiences with people on the other side of in your family among your friends even on your acquaintances\nOn Facebook what they do when they find out oh my God\nShe or he is or Republican oh my God imagine\nHe's even conservative or he voted for Donald Trump how could you guys not see what we see that this guy's a bumbling fools right that's what they think that this guy's a racist or homophobic or a massage and as you you mentioned it how could you not see that answer we don't see 'cause we don't see the facts we think it's very emotional\nAnd listen to the media so much let me know what you think Marcus filling in on right on the radio\nLooking to purchase your own truck or trailer ... financial company may be able to help with financing Eric Gifford without trial tells us about the company and the process of getting approved\nWe started back in two thousand for two thousand eight we opened our first brick and mortar office and we've been serving truckers through today with an a plus business right in front of the baby and we don't go by credit score we actually look at their credit profile experience in the industry stability factor so we treat him as a\nPerson not a score we look for the way to get approved an end of their own truck especially\nThe guys just starting out and getting into their first truck commercial trucks the medium duty to the class eight trucks all type trader so all types as well just not brand new equipment we specialize in just the used equipment\nGenerally an approval within twenty four forty eight hours after that depending on how fast the customer wants to move they can be in the new truck\nThan three to seven days total go to ... a G.

um\nAnd we always had the same use for the longest time you know maybe a couple of little differences here and there but um she started traveling a lot to Europe and this that and coming back and

choice and I was between crews that trial and uh she was more of a Bernie Sanders\nShe was all about Bernie Sanders and um she was happy with Hillary\nAnd so as it got closer and closer when I actually started leaning orders Trump we we started dating is serious serious debates you know and then I'm In June my son my youngest son was graduating\nAnd she was supposed to come out to the graduation and um\nMy son and her just had a tremendous tremendous uh a relationship and um two weeks prior to the um to the graduation we had a conversation on a song or were like hey you know what were you get here we're not talking about politics of this is about politics is about my son graduation\nAnd um and then the week before the graduation she called\nAnd she said because I'm a Trump supporter she can't come to my house\nAnd we have not spoken since that day and I I've reached out a couple of ... and a couple of times you know trying to al ... is a a a relationship with my nephew doing nothing meant nothing\nI feel so sorry few I I you know it just breaks my heart and and you have to wonder what what about your son I mean she didn't seem to care about that either that the the

know he's a cliche but it is hard to even hear the story\nDo don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the she obviously got infected with billions socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw a but uh it's it's depressing hanging there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a\nYou know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except

I Can't remember the head of the CIA guy\nUm if we don't prosecute these people for the crimes that they did a weirdo were no better than a third world or the third world country we're letting these people get away with what was wrong illegal unconstitutional and basically all those things make a make I'm an American\nAnd the if if we don't\nTake the people who commit treason and prosecute them for that then they're going to keep their little following that they're going to walk around you got plenty of people out there that are saying that well you know ... evidently it was it that bad they did break the law they didn't do anything that was so evil and um\nIt it's [noise] I I just think that something needs to be done to show them and along with all that you know freezer assets because they're ill got games in the Clinton Foundation and I mean if we're going to go all out\nOr go all lead on Kavanaugh for thirty five years ago I I'm sure we can find plenty of people and evidence for what Bill did back in the eighties\nSo I mean why can't we go that route\nYou can and although someone challenged me and said what about the civil war right they committed the certainly are illegal acts at the time and yet we were generous and you know we we didn't Lincoln didn't want to do that kind of stuff\nBut this this is a wartime assistant wartime this isn't\nPeople who actually are saying that the people who did who fought on the side of the confederacy were fighting this is\nI have a different view on on the civil war than some people do I mean I I I understand that for some it was about slavery but for most it was about a overreach the federal government and civil disobedience and states' rights that's where that's where the bases\nThere were a lot of scientists were fighting and all that okay go ahead no no you know\nI was living and finish right\nOkay I Know that I mean that's so that's where I mean to me the rebel flag that the rebel and actually it's not even really the rebel flag it was a a a battle flag from a particular state it took on a representation of states' rights to me that represents states' rights over\nSlavery and when I talk to people and I've actually talked to people who have\nFlown that flag where I've had that symbol on their truck or whatever that's what I asked him I said okay now\nWhat does that represent to you and nine times out of ten it does have to do with\nYou know states' rights and an overreach from the federal government and the people that uh take the other avenue as far as slavery and white supremacists and stuff like that then I just you know okay what makes you better than anybody else\nWhy why or why are you better than that person what gives you the right to enslave another human being so and I think this is also the difference between\nAn old dovetail hear the difference between conservatives and liberals I won't go party wise here because parties are evidently irrelevant at this point and that is we engage in conversation we engage in discourse\nDefend your defend your principles defend what your argument is they just want to shout you doubt that want to call you names now that is not everybody in the Democratic party that is why I I don't associate that with the Democratic party these are the left wing way out there which\nComes to who I Would actually have coffee with ... there's nobody really on the left politically\nThat I could sit down and have coffee away however I have met George Clooney and he's a really nice guy and very humble and I could sit down and have a beer at a cigar with him or something that would be cool [noise]\nYeah well I appreciate your answering tied the guys are not following rules yeah yeah\nWell ... well it's okay ... well there's\nThere's nobody on the

that's going to be able to beat Trump I really don't and I think he is because he's got one a campaign under his belt for the presidency he he knows a lot more one thing you can say about him he learns\nAnd uh I I think he's learned a lot of valuable lessons and I don't think he's got to be he was a little I don't say soft but he wasn't he didn't play hardball the way other people do it and I think this time he would really\nTrying to be a little bit more aggressive in the way he would uh address anybody who comes against him on the left I'd love to see Cory Booker go up there because I think each I think you ... the same thing with Elizabeth Warren I think anybody from the left it gets out there he's got a pretty much ...\nI certainly agree with you he's gotten much more comfortable in the job he really has become much more presidential I think that's what you're saying he's really grown into the job and I Oh absolutely\nAnd and he does he's he's been doing really good on everybody's watching what the right hands doing\nActually I should say left him because he is science with those right everybody's watching what the left and is doing and what his right hand he's just sign and stuff sided science on he's getting a lot done why everybody's talking about the rhetoric and looking at the ball bat sticking and\nUm my my my fiance and I have been a friend it by several people that we went to school with them suffer because you can't talk politics with him\nIs er liberals they don't want to they can't defend their arguments they they don't want to talk about a policy

talking about hate or over here on this side that are represented the Democratic party\nAnd when somebody on the white quote right or the Republican Party that comes out spewing hate the Republican Party shouts them down and says no you don't represent the Republican Party David Duke there have been many many uh examples of people who have come out on the quote unquote right\nWho's you force

shot by police have been charged in connection with the fatal shooting of Georgia a police officer when it county sergeant Jake Smith says Africa Antwon Tony was responding to suspicious vehicle hall when the shooting went down\nAs Oscar Tony and one other officer approached that shots rang out from inside the vehicle through the glass one of those shots struck officer Tony\nPresident Trump said at a rally in Elkhart in Nevada that he will pull the United states from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia\nWith Obama yeah he was a great speaker but I ask what kind of job is he doing\nWhen you start and say seven days before your election that you're going to fundamentally transform in my opinion the greatest country in the history of the world you know I'm not going to have you much use for you I don't care that you speak well that's not what's important to me\nWhat's much more important is what your policies are so I think you're comparing apples to oranges there between Trump and Obama we didn't like him because of his policies not because of his race not because of the way he sounded but because of what he did\nYeah I'm not saying that Republicans you gonna vote both Republicans the garlic\nOf course then the president if you had a Democrat or Republican is going to vote Republican and Democrat\nGonna know just let me let me say what I think a clarified for you\nThe base you're right about that both sides have a base that was never a million years or Republican vote for Democrats nor a Democrat voted for Republican but I Know I have\nA couple of times voted for the Democratic or Republican are so bad as an example I couldn't stand Arnold Schwarzenegger so I didn't vote for him I figured out who he was what a phony he was and he was in it for himself\nSo there have been times that I have not voted\nFor the Republican candidate but you write in general that's what you choose your party 'cause you agree with them for the most part I don't blame people for that what I Do blame is for the incredible hatred for Donald Trump and the fact of tonight's topic which is you disown someone\nBecause you disagree with their politics that doesn't make sense to me that's over the top of\nIt but you're right because like I said it Donald Trump is not a bad job you look at\nThe Korea issue North Korea is the first time in history to the my act the act we got him to ...\nAnd ... the the climate rate is doing a really good job that go with the rebate people don't like the way you speak if he was more for your ... probably was more ... way but\nI think he is but I think he is becoming more presidents I got a question for you are you going to vote for next time\nI don't know it's so frustrated with politics like I said I didn't vote for him the first time I didn't I I was I was never going to vote for Hillary but I I\nI like what you're doing and let me tell you that I worked for the government so you know a real happy at what he's doing you know I'm a government Henri\nSo you're a good man Anthony I appreciate you\nAnd uh hang in there and I I just got to save your way to live longer and you say you've done good stuff and you ought to vote for him in a twenty twenty thanks for the call appreciate it very much and let's go to um yeah Teresa in fair play Missouri three so you're on with mark\nIt gave Me Margaret good morning and I wanted to say that\nAnd I was raised aircraft I mean my whole family were Democrats one of them have family still it Democrat and most of my my dad kings parties and during the Reagan Era and kind of took all those kids with thing you know 'cause he ... he had Lehman Brothers and sisters [noise]\nAnd\nAnd recently we named Mike has has gotten kind of the ... in Facebook and\nOne and then just completely everything was negative everything the negative that Trump or you know everything he put up there and and\nAnd I would make snide remarks and that you know on his ... and then my other cousin came out and speak spoke but one night my\nOne cousin came down and and apologized to me he goes family more important than politics [noise]\nAnd I thought that was really really big I mean I think so much more lean him coming out and we talk\nOn you know on messenger for quite a long time now my other cousin I I had to leave him because everything he had was this negative negative negative now everything he put on Facebook was played\nPolitical that um\nI my question is is you know I Can't\nVote for something that I Am morally you know against the now whether it's Martian or you know all these people coming up here it's not the nominee against immigration that they need to be legal and\nI just can't I think a lot of the red great comes from the news because they are so negative I mean new agree with me 'cause I I I think it changes a lot of people's mind\nYou're absolutely right you make a great point thinking Theresa who the media has changed the name of the game it used to be that there there was a lot of honest journalism and you didn't even know where a lot of them stood now they've become advocates\nFor their point of view and that's maybe they learn than journalism school but that's not what they're supposed to do that just spoke to present the news and what's going on and we get to make our own decision\nBut that's totally changed and they influenced people especially young people who don't listen to that much in the ... the young people that is true of older people too and I think of it you know watch the nightly news or whatever they watch and they get a little glimpse of it and half the time they don't even know you know what's really happening\nSo I agree the media has a big play in this and it's a pretty discouraging to see what influence they do have\nAnd you know if you go out and interview people you is very discouraging to see how little Leno right they can name a vice president they have no idea about the three branches of government and of course the bigger point they have no idea what makes this country so special well we have a full board but I'll give you the number anyway eight six six Ninety red eye eight six

there's such a big um such big\nTalk about Saudi Arabia and what they did [noise] um you know what they did was terrible but you know ... you know even if though to do something small that's all right but it's such a big they're making such a big uproar about it on I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it when it's in our interest you know when when we can prevent you know bigger or human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is different\nBut in this case I mean he wasn't a US citizen I'm here to green card\nUm you know say if they did it ... it is and our best interest to just you know the big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know they they helped us out so why um what's the big uproar about it you know they've\nDone things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months\nThey said that make them pay ransom saying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know it's not it's not your regular guys like him as a you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about it\nLook into that it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east right the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players or you know like Saudi Arabia the war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nBut I got to tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to save and great about him because he was part of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know the their their enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt\nSo I'm not a big fan of what he believes in a in that sense what to do when someone or be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have\nA special status when a country has an embassy in another country that if they're in their territory their land you lord in there and and then you shop 'em up and you assassinate him and\nI it just so revolting to people I I think that's what was going on in your right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to fight Iran\nThat's a very difficult situation for President Trump but just the thought I I must have been taught to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with him probably many as\n... yeah but that's you know agree with him but getting getting killed like that is horrible\nYou know but I mean so yeah\nIt even though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want a large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and and things happening I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's it is a horrible incident but\nFor this alone I don't think you know I'm In the bigger picture you know ... ...\nYeah well I I I cringe when you said cutting off business I Know that's bad in this in this story but um you're right we we need that we need them badly\nAnd that's why I say President Trump ... isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who's terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey yeah I'm never going there again while this guys and the princes in power\nAnd this and the Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know which is crazy sounds you have to have some and civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out ... even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was was so outrageous it to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but I I follow this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved the mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not seeing Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved\nBut you know this there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way taking out ... was so outrageous by a Obama a because he was becoming our friend\nA difficulty yeah so you you got to you it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff it the right one pulled out the different countries and assassinating them go ahead\nI Know I I I Do feel I mean my my impression is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the ex spy\nOn I'm sure you know it's probably known you know in Washington is probably like you know known that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure shooting takes out you know yes people going down\nHis political opponents you know here and there\nIt's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon you know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became like ... it's a very public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there\nAnd it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and he said you know if I don't come out and you know here's what you do and and you just disappear and they made it worse no we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up\nAnd they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved then they came up the story that it was a wad of interrogation that ah got got went badly yeah a ... that that's that's a little crazy right well yeah the ...\nThree suspected rebels were killed today in a gun battle with government forces and disputed Kashmir triggering violent anti Indian protests and ...
