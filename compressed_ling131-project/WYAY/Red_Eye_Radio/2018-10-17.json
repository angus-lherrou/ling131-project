S. H. overseas new shoes but I Can't wait to get into selection from a\nSmall ... dot com studios why why do you see\n\nOn the investigation guilty candidate dies I mean we have one says President Trump suggests it's too early to rush to judgment in the case of missing journalist ... this deposed despite mounting evidence and growing skepticism over the explanation being offered by Saudi Arabia correspond to Clarissa war\nIt's just a broadening fan of skepticism about this therapy narrative which although is not official yet seems to be based on the idea that this was some kind of botched operation rogue operation and that just doesn't ... with the reality of the way the Saudi power structure works the reality is\nTurned DNA tested not even distinguish whether persons ancestors were indigenous to North or South America and they set their own legal requirements for citizenship and DNA test while they can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual he said it's not evidence for tribal affiliations\nUsing a DNA test just doesn't do it and that wasn't enough\nA President Obama's former campaign manager Monday sharply criticized her for releasing the results of this test back in her claims that she's has Native American ancestry he claimed she was thrown her party off message just weeks before November's critical midterm elections she did it wasn't a smart move\nHe said there's a quote from Democrats argue the substance all you want but why twenty two days before a crucial election where we must win a house and Senate to save America why did Senator Warren has to do her announcement no that was former president ... two thousand twelve campaign manager Jim Messina\nWhy can Democrats ever stay focused Adams the news also served as deputy White House she's chief of staff so worn likely twenty twenty presidential can a contender\nIn an overwhelming favorite to win re election in Massachusetts and November or when it first became widely known you may remember she was running against Scott Brown in a tight Senate campaign but most voters didn't\nSeem to care well now it looks like they are going to care because talk about shooting yourself in the foot the Indians do that I don't think so\nUm ... Melvin asked the M M MSNBC anchor MSNBC anchor not Fox News also Penn Warren's decision to release or DNA results on air Monday during an interview with the Boston Globe\nAnd here's a quote did warn gain anything about putting out the DNA test results Melvin us the best I can gather according to the paper's reporting she's won one fats and something like that I think I might just be as Native American uh she is and he goes on I don't know who my great great great great grandmother and grandfather is\nA this guy responded known him at Warren's claimed heritage was pretty far back meanwhile New York times New York times reporter\nWrote sarcastically on Twitter President Trump is sure to stop mocking Senator Warren about her ancestry now that she's provided\nDefended approve can you say stepping into further instead of putting this behind her she may have put it out front how many of you if you did this could go back that many generations and maybe you'll find\nI don't know if you're an ancestor of Abraham Lincoln or George Washington own who knows else you realize what that means to go back six generations\nLet me know if you think she just eliminate herself from the twenty twenty race I I think this was huge you remember when Ted Kennedy uh he was the favorite to run for president and then they asked him why are you running for president in his answer was no answer he couldn't think of it he hadn't thought about that yeah I was just next in line he was the Kennedy\nSo let me know what you think eight six six nine to read I\nMean speaking people have lost I wanted to catch up on this to Michael ... has lost another one so you heard that yes they Stormy Daniels live a lawsuit over tweet by Trump accusing her of a total con job was thrown out by judges said the president was engaging in free speech\nThe adult film star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford claim she was threatened by no no man in Las Vegas parking lot of two thousand eleven\nFor agreeing to cooperate with a magazine article about a trip she said she had with Trump in two thousand six\nAfter a lawyer released a composite sketching the man Trump accused Clifford in a tweet of a total time job concerning uh non existent man\nAnd the ... court so we agree with Mr Trump's argument because the tweet and questioned constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associate with politics in public discourse\nSo Trump's lawyer said this was a total when but against ... this this guy never gives up all we're going to appeal you remember if if you don't remember he's the one that I think her name was sweating except\nShe accused Kevin of being part of a a ring that allowed a gang rape I think by people and even the New York times than print that because there was no evidence\nSo you could see where I may be headed I I Want to know who you we on both sides who you'd like to see to be your nominee if you're a Democrat\nAnd I've been on the other side who would you like to see to be the nominee because you think it would help to so much\nSo let me throw before I for some names out\nDid you hear that great phony Kamala Harris his book the first twenty twenty ticket to Iowa by the way I think that Warren did that\nBecause she's so afraid of all the publicity others like Kamala Harris and the Spartacus book or that's what I call now you know you have the Spartacus moment\nWhich wasn't even correct of course because the Senate if you remember had already printed the information but I think she's so afraid of these people that she figured I'll I'll put this behind me and I'll be ready to run no she did just the opposite anyway Kamala Harris will travel for the first time this year to the first in the nation caucus\nOn October twenty ... twenty third as she prepares for a potential president Sharon\nHarris a California Democrat will make appearances in Des Moines in Cedar Rapids with all the stops to follow up and then South Carolina so following the visits Harris will love appeared in three or four early primary states this election cycle so here's\nThe names here are the names you can put out anything you want your the names that I was thinking about\nUh the Spartacus Booker no Cory Booker if you don't know if I'm referring to former attorney general Eric Holder did you see over the weekend he said I'm a Michelle Obama has said that when they when we meaning people on my side go will a low they go higher\nAnd uh what Eric Holder said no that's just the opposite we we we we go down to we fight we shoot whatever is it\nAnd of course is Bernie Sanders young Bernie Sanders he'll he'll be running against the favorite of any\nSenator Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren now vice president Joe Biden in poll shows that he's kind of the leader up there maybe you know often in politics its name recognition more than anything else\nYou got New York Sen Kirsten Gillibrand who either there's a winner and she loved Bill Clinton and thought he was terrific until he was maybe someone you didn't want to mention after me too movement so there there's someone you know don't trust her watch your back of your own her\nConnecticut Senator Chris Murphy I didn't even know he was running\nThat plus is not a good sign of a talk show host\nFormer Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe and he has that much of a chance but we know who he is former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick by the way you know why a lot of these people run they run because then they're speaking fees go up usually I remember after Jack Kemp ran for vice president\nHe's speaking fees and I want everybody on the staff here this became fifty thousand dollars a speech so if you wonder why these people run their huge benefits even if they don't win\nOhio Senator Sherrod brown actual what about ... he's really a Democrat I Wonder why he's not running on that side New York governor Andrew Cuomo right you know him and there's another one I did I mean I Know his name I Can't imagine what chance he thinks he has New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu\nUm LA mayor that's mine there Eric are say these people have allusions delusions of grant or I mean you know come on mayor your mayor of Los Angeles a homeless situation is is just awful I I don't know what he's thing except he wants the publicity that the power\nAnd of course you heard about Oprah Winfrey but it doesn't look like she's running but with her name recognition and all the others will have to take a ...\nLawyer Michael ... or is Tucker Carlson from Fox calls and ... the sleazy portable as time goes by came up with a good one there now I bet you didn't know this one Montana governor Steve bullock\nMm I don't think I Know who's your pick\nLike you I never heard of some of these but heck they as I said that could increase their speaking fees\nAnd if you're on the other side who would you like to face if you're on my site let me know an eight six six Ninety red eye that is eight six six nine o seven three three three nine it's time it's a ... this there are already running and we haven't even gotten through the ... elections for house and Senate but that's coming up in a few weeks\nBut by the way as I said last night and this ties it altogether I think they're all wasting their time they're delusional President Trump is going to be reelected they're going to be so surprised but again\nIf they get the publicity the name recognition you the power that all that stuff goes to the heads let me know what you think it's Marcus they're sitting in on red on radio\n[noise] one eight

said it eight six six Ninety red eye age six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine same number\nAnd we're asking you but you you know if you have other ideas I'm always open to it but we're asking you your choices for\nPresident I just really only Democrats I just realized I didn't I didn't see Hillary Clinton I I don't think we're done you can never get rid of the Clintons you've got them for ever a that was the deal I made last night\nWith someone someone said why isn't she locked up license you prosecute and I said I sit on the air in the past\nShe and bill would agree to go away and maybe as a ... a ... with them you know we can make that deal I'd be willing to let her you know yeah I Know a lot of you will be unhappy with me if I say that but I said\nOh you let me know what you think about that too should we reopen the investigation Clinton of\nCourse I Know what somebody you're going to say which is she's not above the law but\nYeah the ... we already have a civil war in this country which is what we discuss the other night you're going to make this stuff work so she above lord no but certain times it pays to ask what's best for America and let's see what you think Charles in New York City around with mark\nYes Hi Mark affected like this the first time that I'm hearing you and I really you sound like you really know what you're talking about yeah the very political\nVoice I Would like to say several things first of all I'm going to predict something which\nI'm sure almost all of your listeners are going to be happy theory if they believe we're going to say it's gonna happen I predict that the we have right now if you want to forty nine as far as the Senate goes we're going to get the gonna gain four seats minimum\nAnd maybe even more but you know fifty five old way of sixty possibly\nUh as far as the house a simple trick year because of the suburbs and because of redistricting but we'll see we'll keep the house for sure why do I say that the ...\nOr maybe I'm Crazy but I'm not because what happened last time in two thousand sixteenth why Trump when nobody believed that he would wait and right everybody was afraid to say and limit vote for Trump so even the exit polls if I remember correctly they fill up that you know here we want\nBecause those that voted for Trump avoided the survey for the law the survey now people are afraid to tell the truth then that they wanted Trump now they're petrified\n[laughter] how can you just got worse and much or you know I Know that they were afraid now the petrified that they say\nUh you know they're afraid that we're at noticed nobody is afraid to say I voted for Obama or I voted for Hillary nobody's afraid to say that nobody\nThat it's it's amazing you have the little life's only at one side ... it's absolutely ridiculous in addition to the cabinet thing ... percent lie and by the way it everybody is saying that they face got I'm bigger rated your own devout excited and nobody says another point which you have\nThe people that were on defense they finally had to see that the media it totally in collusion speaking about delusion not Trump with Russia but the media with the Democrats I think it's a big blow the Kavanaugh became a justice thank God\nFor the skin of his teeth but he did he became justice I think the the left in the media are crying over this as much as they were crying and two thousand sixty went from one but it's like people are absolutely petrified also in American than Israel following politics in both countries very closely\nThe left always the right let me put it this way the right to always does\nThree to six percent better than the prediction is\nRandy eight percent it's not a hundred percent always like in Israel that\nTerrorists labor was getting away same thing because the media is extremely left in America that Ninety six percent or something like that the same thing goes is true in Israel and ... there's no question we're going to win but\nWhat's cabin on it over here you have Eric Eric's I think his name is on his block they have a Brad Stevens from the New York times used to ride in the wall Street Journal and other ... know Trump or know Trump is absolutely not they switch\nThat saying we're going to vote for Trump because their eyes got opened so there's no way in the world from I ... I mean I don't know what's gonna happen from now till then God Forbid there can be something negative about Trump I don't know what can happen by those things are all the way they are now we're going to win big there's no question about it\nThe house is tricky but we're going to win that keep that house definitely gonna get fifty five or more also most people are probably not aware of this but in the Senate there's twenty four I think a ...\nA ... at twenty four Republicans or Democrats are running and nine I think a ... Republicans if you're running you can lose your seat so they have a bigger chance of losing their seats and they're gonna lose two years we're in trouble because it's the other way around but anyways that's interesting for now\nOh no no no no no okay I'm just kidding\n[laughter] [noise] um you asked about who we want to see a\nChallenge Trump or we'll just see Hillary were on I Want to see Hillary Ron and I want him to beat her so bad in the election I I mean I think she wants to rematch lord habit I walked her to be their mom and me and I just want to see her\n[noise] just get beat really bad in the election\nI'm ... and and you were getting ... oh yeah\nI think a lot of people ... would shut up about it is not my president and I don't know I just I just want to see your ideas for her to be it's a little bit [noise]\nBut I'm Serious about what I said man I thoroughly enjoyed a just your whole character you're just seemed like a wonderful guy and\nUh I really appreciate you and I know I think he's not a\nNot an easy thing to be\nA but you do a wonderful [noise]\n... ah\nYou have a wonderful evening\nYou too thanks so much All right have a great night Randy I'm very kind words Eric and and and there will be back next week and they do a terrific job you know than the regular host so I'm just filling in and trying to hold up do my share of there but I I have a story on Hillary no I Want to get a little while and the Democrats really fear\nThat she's going to run again that yeah that's why the more I thought about the more about it that's my number one choice not the others that you you know I Love the ... guys crazy loon Tucker Carlson for his room is not that bad right\nA sleazy porn lawyer bought a let me know what you think Andy in New York City you're on with mark Hi Andy\nYeah Hi thanks for taking my call [noise]\n[noise] um I just was you know interested in why there's such a big on such a big talk about Saudi Arabia and what they did [noise] um you know what they did was terrible book you know ... you know even if though to do something small that's all right but it's such a big they're making such a big uproar about it\nOn I mean you know I'm sure that they they have Saudi Arabia you know it doesn't have the cleanest record\nKing Solomon does for sure [noise] um and I mean generally get involved in things abroad when it\nWhen it's in our interest you know when when we can prevent you know bigger a human rights you know you know crisis or [noise] or you know to expand our power abroad you know to protect us you know as you know offensive is defense but in this case I mean he wasn't a US citizen I'm here to green card\nUm you know if they did it in it isn't our best interest to just you know there are big player in the middle east for us you know to protect us against Iran so like whoa you know they they helped us out why um what's the big uproar but you know they've\nDone things like this in the past that we've known about you know just I guess it wasn't so publicly you know he I mean this king Solomon he's locked elect all ... you know the princes in a hotel for a few months to get to make them pay ransom\nSaying he's not he's not exactly a moderate you know it is not your regular guys like him as a you know it's trying to understand that\nWell let me see if I can add something to your thoughts about it\nLook it's a ... it's always been a difficult a jigsaw puzzle out there in the middle east right the Israel's our basic friend and we can count on them but the other players you know like Saudi Arabia\nThe war more anti Israel than they are now they both have the one side of interest in terms of Iran trying to stop Iran\nWhat I got to tell you I just thought of it maybe it's a visceral reaction the idea that this guy goes in there and I'm not trying to save and great about him because he was a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and you know the there is their enemies of ours are as they weren't in Egypt\nSo I'm not a big fan of what he believes in a in that sense but to go when someone or be lured into an embassy which is you know he's supposed to have a special status when a country has an embassy in another country that if they're in their territory their land you lord in there and and then you shop 'em up and\nYou assassinate him and I it just so revolting to people I I think that's what's what's going on in your right it's a complicated situation as we need their oil and we need them to find Iran\nSo it's very difficult situation for President Trump but just the thought I I must have been taught to me too I I felt badly from even though I'm ... I think I wouldn't agree with them probably many issues\nBut that's you know agree with and the ... getting getting killed like that is horrible ...\nYeah I mean so ... yeah ...\n... even though there should be you know definitely should be an uproar and they should be condemned for it but I mean though that they really want to large scale it seems like a large scale you know cutting off you know businesses and and things happening I mean I I don't know if it's in America's Best interest to do that like just you know for the even though it's a it is a horrible incident but\nFor this alone I don't think you know I'm In the bigger picture you know what you call such yeah\nYeah I I I cringe when using cutting off business I Know that's bad in the in this story\nBut um you're right we we need that we need them badly and that's why I say President Trump ... isn't a very difficult situation and there are people like Lindsey Graham who's terrific on in the Kavanaugh hearings now saying hey yeah I'm never going there again while this guys and the princes in power\nAnd this and the Marco Rubio a ... there are people on our side saying\nWe we can't allow this to happen you ... you know as as crazy as it sounds you have to have some civility in this crazy world right you don't want the president was assassinated you don't take out food and even if you can\nYou don't do stuff like that that's why the Kennedy thing John F. Kennedy thing was\nWas so outrageous to this day I'm One of the few talk show host I should say now\nThat does think there was a conspiracy I a little kid but uh I I've followed this stuff and um I you just don't do that you just you know what I'm saying I don't know if the Russians were involved the mafia was involved I don't know for sure I I'm not seeing Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved\nBut you know there's there's something about you don't take out people and that's why by the way he ... he was so outrageous by a Obama\nA because he was becoming our friend\nA difficult yeah so you you get it and it was right he didn't he writes for the Washington Post and stuff it the right one pulled out the different countries in assassinating them go ahead\nI Know I I I Do feel I mean my my impression\nIs is that let's say Russia you know they just recently had a story you know in in England with the ex spy on I'm sure you know it's probably known you know in Washington is probably like you know\nKnown that a lot of many countries you know Russia I'm sure Putin takes out you know yes people going down his political opponents you know here and there it's not it's not really um [noise] it's not uncommon\nYou know so it's just interesting the reaction I guess because it just became very ... very public public no you know the story\nAnd he ... he goes he yeah he goes in there and it wasn't his girlfriend waiting outside and he said you know if I don't come out and you know his what'd you do\nAnd and he just disappeared and they made it worse no we always say that the the it's the not even the crime itself but the cover up and they said something they were never in you know they weren't involved and they came up the story that was\nWad of interrogation that a guy got went badly yeah uh that that that's that's a little crazy right well yeah no those sure they're pretty\nSure they're pretty ...
