guy is a Larry is\nOn the plane he must go by funeral homes just as you know do admire their decor and or something you know what I mean God [laughter]\nLike Haiti and reading dot com studios why why\nTo see\nThe video sports official runs that I'm friends with President Trump says the U.S is asking turkey for audio and video if it exists that displeased the suspected torturing death of Saudi journalist ... the secretary of state Mike Pompeo ramped up a world would visit to Saudi Arabia and turkey Wednesday correspondent or would\nThey not Payless ample room for the oil rich I like to find alternative explanation\nSix show he's missing\nThat investigation we're going to give them the space\nOf course it helps in all of us have the media on your side perpetuating these faucet I recognize that that's huge and one of the other callers pointed that out mark you can't leave out the media\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they are explaining the ... by the way one of the other things I mentioned last night\nThe left is very good at slogans right so hope and change right Obama had open change how can you argue with hope and change\nYou have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second or you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know where you're happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change\nOr how about a change you know the taken away your car not every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're explaining the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why mentioning 'cause it's happening now but I'll get that in a minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages\nNever mind that this was started under the bonus ration\nBut on Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but you're hardly ever heard of the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here\nThey made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes this is so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again\nThere's a simple right how can you you know you're ripping away from their parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like what a coming here legally means why that's not acceptable\nBut the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they will lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there and they you know\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one\nThat's a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these hunters ah Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen very shortly whenever they get here\nYou never get to stay with your kid you could you could use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and put our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and I was just in case the latest reincarnation of this conflict is is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crying children and distraught mother you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obviously too it seems to me to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our\nOpen border or disease uh we checking for diseases like we used to know or ... well you can't say come here and Russian or even ... matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nThe Democrats won more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of a better name they want cheap labor so you have a newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and I would talk about immigration in the title\nAnd then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and some are in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been a great for America over the years how could you you're in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane but they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than like knowledge that\nSo you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nAll Lawson politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they need us so who these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border not to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but I have to undergo long waits on and says some paperwork to even have a hope of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one color of this week and if you didn't hear him suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they worked in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIs to me the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like hates finally use and I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera because I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise\nIn lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrants that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage is in that office and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas for murdering Israel's Israelis is working on the front room\nA lot of these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say but I Know we have to go to the break Shirley let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more eight six six Ninety red eye and that's the same as eight six six nine o seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not ... you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended were sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they do these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you said in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun they actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport and we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take them back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them\nIt was they be saying the right reasons and for heaven's sake enough for the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know we're bilingual government documents\nCaribbean started in San Pedro Sula one of the most violent areas of Hondurans they had made their way into Guatemala that's where they are right now traveling on foot and then they will continue on their plan going accordingly in Mexico and to think us to speak at ... am I not only of friends who\nI Can't believe that we're playing for for basketball with the barbershop quartet\nAs a move by\nUm\nNo I

Bush did the same thing as the wall to Wall Street journal\nOr would you know talk about immigration how great immigration has no no one's arguing that people aren't ancestors are relatives came and landed at Ellis Island and they share our values and and what they wanted to make a difference and they want to get freedom but it was\nLegal immigration the ... and by the way if you had a bad disease my knowledge they didn't let you in\nThat's coming your legal that's a huge difference\nSo don't don't call me an Iowa list every country has a right to have boaters must you believe in open

Virginia Steve you're on with mark\nHey yeah I Love it or something that I'd want to ... you know well why don't we start\nA ... or ... or ... and with all the aid of\nAll the money but we go to the end of the amount of um but we don't even have a really good\nSo why I like your idea about the way it's an interesting idea why do you use the phrase on document\nWell at that point it do you call it whatever you want it all up you know what that's what I think that if you want to call it my dog by bill or any of the people not only that when we set them back or whatever or ... or ...\nOr whatever we took that as well and or any children that are separated or for the money in their family\n[noise] in some ways are harder than me but it yeah get them out on the amount you give them and\nThat's assuming you give a to every one of those countries which is the case for the most part of our writing\nOn state aid but there's going to go well mania quite true me I don't give\nYou you don't mean in the United states you mean in the Senate\nOutline of the world I mean in the world do we get eight\nYeah well we don't give a to the Soviet Union I mean you might say on now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say would you have like the China you might say we give them a because they take an unfair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have a ... there were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not her point your point is it is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's I'm a for their illegals coming here I I I kinda liked that idea\nYeah even though oh no no it's a it's an interesting idea\nOr a monitor or you\nKnow and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right to send us send us the poor and is not our problem right [laughter] there's your problem\nBut I ... and then you can also add on to the health care bill of health Gillum you'll it will go on forever but basically it will stop or something you know living up\nAnd I yeah there's

three thirty nine and let's go to Jay in Lansing, Michigan hey you're on with mark\nHow're you doing Mark I'm I just wanted to say that um maybe these um immigrants that are coming over to the u._s. um might want to be a little bit smarter and think about other places to possibly go that may be easier to get into\n'em if they have farming skills I mean South Africa or they're kicking people out of there and taking their farms so ah maybe put together a band of you in\nSome ear ah guys at a think you have the gall to go over there and maybe protect some of those people get paid some money or or use your farming skills and go over and help out South Africa because uh they're digging themselves into over right now so\nI hear your story as in the middle of ocean [laughter] ... yeah I I Do hear by the way you bring up a new story I don't know if it a lot of people know about South Africa's expert breeding the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggle and I had a lot of them are going to resist right with a force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nWe well it was you know when and thanks for your call when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but likely did South Africa you gotta be careful what you get\nI ... and all this talk of makes me think Egypt right we we helped them over and throw a what's his name Mubarak and I asked of the time I was doing national radio and I said wait a second that what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten there for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me in the Arab Spring there was some something when spring but anyway a defect as we got where she got to ask that question what's what's that after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you got the Brotherhood the Muslim Brotherhood which was tyrannical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over but an air we were saying maybe it wasn't the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think I'm producer Brian so you know I'm I'm mentioning\nThe fact is that you you can't just do the spine when we did that in South Africa right you overthrow which you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney right open the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask goes next are you happy looking back\nSeeing what you've gotten ... instead of the shah uh the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that you might say Russia China but certainly\nThe ... biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens\nSo it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking it Gadhafi in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that what is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right\nIn Benghazi is you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with some of you now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion the stone assassinate people like that and go inside chopped them up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business\nBut the other side and President Trump's got a huge problem now is they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israel in trying to do work against Iran because Iran has been a threat to this world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't know this historically\nWe had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we worked with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work with the Soviet Union during World War two because we had a bigger enemy and Hitler\nSo a lot of leftist and liberal say well you work with these people what how do you respond to lead well life is not easy you're faced with difficult choices and you got to figure out what makes the most sense\nThis stuff is not easy\nAnd that in St Louis with illegal immigrants coming in right now it's not it's a tough challenge [noise] let me know what you think

I Would see this you know process later you know we're on a ... year over to a bunch of radicals who are worth a mob mentality\nAbsolutely well I I great call Bruce agree with you and you made a lot of great points and we need to protect our country you're absolutely right\nAnd I I as I said thanks for calling your doctor you too and let's go to AJ in Chicago EJ you're on with mark\nHey what's up man I'm I just want to say that\nActually the last caller had a lot of great points\nUm the biggest point that he had was that a lot of illegal immigrants coming to the United states uh believing that they have the right\nJust for the landing on ah this country um I think that you know it's a lot more than just be your it's more a contributing\nIf you don't contribute your community the lowest sense or you don't you're not valuable in that sense so if you don't contribute to your country I think that's the highest sense which is what our military\nAnd most of our people who serve this country at the highest level can say\nThat they do um it's nothing then immigration Kim currently um so I Would say that I as a ... you should feel that um you come into this country to contribute to the absolute most\nIf you don't think you can do that and I don't know what your contribution to this country is\nI'm just being here it's not enough ...\nMm yeah I Do in fact I think you're ... something many of them come here and they wind up with an entitlement mentality right\nThey're entitled to serve as the hospitals schools whatever you want to say and and that you know what here's another great point what you give away for free I called the great point 'cause my what you came away for free he's usually not value\nWhat you know you give free schools and they don't value the school you get free medical care that after a while people think it's coming to them so we even hurting them the the illegals because we're not making them value what we're giving them\nRight right so I I think I have one final point you might find the point is\nThat uh if if you take away a or given for free and what do you ... you know and if you come here with nothing and they expect the most\nUm you really can you would think so you should take at least a ... in my in my expectations of what I can give and what I can take it always has to do with what my contributions are at a comedy and I gave\nThe least then I won't be doing the worst if I come here and give most I Will be doing the best there or are you planning to anything whether it's a job\nWhether it's a service position whether it's anything at all or giving your your hunger percent or what should\nShould dictate and ... percent a tape that if you gave your absolute least zero percent you're not going to get anything out of ... so\nI Do not Europe you reminded me of ... or if I could share yeah let me ... you remind me of a story if I could share with you\nWhen I was teaching younger kids in elementary school when I first started out now I teach adults you know what the kids would do with the free lunch you have any idea what they would do that they would throw in who they would take the they would take\nThe green peas and toss them all over the cafeteria\nBecause they got it for free and they place no value on it\nSo in any sense yeah in in a funny sense\nEven with the illegals they may not only is an entitlement mentality but we're not even helping them because they didn't earn any for this we're just give me in a way for nothing and then we're surprised when they don't even value being in America and they don't share you stake in the community and give it a values in fact\nWe've made it so easy that there are now communities where people don't even learn to speak English because everything's done for them in Spanish and I love Hispanic people yeah they're they're mostly in my classes that's not the issue so we've actually in a funny way\nDone harm to them and the other gentleman the other caller said we you know we should not abandoned the fight yeah but you do need someone to express it in a way that the American people it is a winning issue and that's what he said\nThat the American people can sign onto it we're not even helping the illegals yeah you say in the short run they're getting free benefits and stuff not in the long run\nNot in the long run do they value what's so special about being in the United states of America and there are set America One caller challenge me on that recall thanks so much\nAJ and you haven't even might scare you to think you have to\nThank

about a century city century state and about the people voting for them\nAnd I just wanted to I I live here\nWhere we can vote on that certainly not governor brand name and the whole state of sanctuary state which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to him I Know some of them have actually voted against a following his\nDirections but I also recall ever hearing any load about sanctuary city that here and I you know the ones you\nKnow it wasn't so they were loaded on it it's just to get Democrats in office a very liberal extremely leftist a Democrat as an office and he just decided that's a good idea does it and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump now just partly what it is\nI was there a few months ago and um you ... it was amazed when I was walking the streets with my kid is someone yelled at us now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another time something ... someone says something about a night that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over\nSections I think they said market street and of course the problem with the trash and the and the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh that's I think uh I I miss San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah it's\nIt's it's it's the only thing we vote on and I wanted to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is to fellow I spoke with first but but you have you heard the thing about the uh um birth tourism\nIt was on our throats when it gets yeah mentioned this just a few people and they have not heard of it and it actually was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty dateline or one of those where they fly on these Chinese women that are pregnant\nAnd they have this place all set up and they go there and they have the babies get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your in laws horse we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby and then they're they have all the\nRights and wrongs of course is wrong and an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that you either keep politicians here and they well I mean there are people that work for them and they hadn't heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to say it on national radio so people can know what's going on\nIt's we're very close to the border here so I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I say down some I mean they have them and I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world do that\n... somebody had a baby in Italy I said to the baby at citizenship and they said no because he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why were handed out citizenship like if I can do it you know it's it's it's a paradigm\nThey're actually in the ... yeah glad\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a there are with the with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of it any way but of course if you pass a law every every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was a one time a solution every problem was the one time\nA solution to something else so you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing\nI Lived in Asia and the thing I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby now of course they could go wrong if babies late I guess very late\nBut

first time\nI thought he was a disaster maybe the worst president in our history\nWhile we wait until it happened and we did everything politically we could and they picked on us because ... a Senator McConnell said Mitch McConnell said you know you want to do and we can to get rid of my forget how we phrased that that's not the most we send\nThese guys this whole are saying you know I don't agree with Michelle Obama when they go low we we kick him or whatever they he said I Can't remember the other on your rights saying we're not going to be civil until we get back in power\nWell that makes
