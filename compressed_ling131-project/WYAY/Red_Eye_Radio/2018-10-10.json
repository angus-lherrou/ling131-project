the fondling or anything else yeah\nRight but what the whole shot up to me or she was trying her best to convince these crazy left wing crap throwers that she had all these reasons you know solid

she's a Republican in Maine and she was trying to keep her job\nAnd she also didn't want to offend all her other Republican colleagues so she wanted to justify her vote for Kavanaugh hoping the Democrats would believe that she's doing it for a good legal reasons and it just didn't work to never give her another days ... idiot never give Susan Collins yeah what a trouble maker she is not what a real rabble Rouzer\nShe I mean she's probably the most milk toast senator we've ever had which is a nice woman but she's not she's not going to do anything ridiculous and now they're already

least maybe a million people without power in this region so they're telling people if you're going to stay and hunker down\nOf this magnitude you don't know what the supply chain of of ah goods is

items out there\nA Nikki Haley resigned says the UN ambassador you know the interesting thing is we have gone\nNow over twelve hours ... and nothing has leaked\nYeah\nAnd I do you know why you know why she's ... right even though it seems it seems that the media was jumping on the some ... immediately\nIn fact who was it was at MSNBC or CNN\nOr somebody who's making the thing while she's out because of the Kavanaugh stuff and it was like yeah come right right right I mean I maybe I saw that on social media that's where I ...\nI don't I don't want to die to anybody who didn't you know make that statement right right well I Believe I saw that on Twitter ... and and I can't remember who did it because they you know Twitter flies by so quickly but they were just pounded on immediately that oh she's quitting because Kavanaugh is going to be a Supreme Court\nA justice apparently that's been in the works\nA uh a while and it seems to to be right now\nThat most people really have no idea but they sense that she only wanted to be there for two years because she's staying until the end of the year which means he right she's been there two years and by the way that happens quite frequently in the ministry and somebody will come in put in two years gets you go in and they they want to move on to something else everybody is\nIs trying to predict what she's going to do whether she's going to run for president\nUh and I liked the you know the uh the scenario that\nThat she's out\nAh you know there and what was the scenario all I Know is this Mariel had had um pan had is going to run and twenty twenty ... he's going to be the veep it a death you know the it no way [laughter] it ended with Jeff Sessions or you know a a you know being out of a number of uh\nOf being attorney general I ... yeah ... sorts of conspiracy theories we look at it and say well we'll wait and see we don't really deal with conspiracy theories here right or a you know she she did good I mean she was if you look at one of\nThe people that he brought in early that actually worked out she was one of the few yeah\nWell and I think she goes out on a strong note I you know yes absolutely if you ah ... anything could happen in the next three months but I don't I don't think it's going to change the demeanor and uh and and the fortitude of of someone like a Nikki Haley if you listen to her words at you and if you live if you look at\nA you know her positions\nAre and how how strong she's been for the president a that is that is a very unique position to be in for it is especially for this particular president who's not afraid to speak his mind and\nHimself I think has been very strong we look at his un speech recently\nAnd I think he ... he did a great job uh and and he's been very clear on his positions or if you look at a having a Michael Bolden a at [laughter] John Bolton and it's not my cobalt and it's not\nThere yet oil man Alonzo\nSo bad remake [laughter] and the wife vast wastes [laughter] John Bolton I by the way I'm Michael Bolton could be a a he could be a good national security advisor\nHe would scare off a lot of people [laughter] oh so you're saying or not ... not the guy from office space or no is there a Michael Bolden from office space yeah that was his member that was I was holding named ... ... I didn't watch office space\nOh no no no no no you know what I'm thinking I'm thinking the off the office no no I'll hundred percent and I don't know I don't know how far off yes his face on his face the movie\nRight the yeah the iconic movie the iconic movie yeah I don't get it out safely today more coffee please yeah okay but if you have John Bolton by her side I don't know if I can reveal it I Know I Know maybe I should have brought booze or but if you have John Bolton by your side as national security advisor if you have a Nikki Haley in places you\nIn the bathroom my question is how do you feel Nikki Haley shoes I Know what you an ambassador and it's one of those um a jobs where you know you're kind of just basically in this case your the the mouthpiece for the president you're going to you're going to go out to the world to the other nations and you're going to\nI'm a ... advised them as to what the policy is we're going to be\nBut in this scenario where you have a John Bolton and you have a my palm pale did I get that one right um the [laughter]\nThe strength I think right now of this cabinet and staff or it and and I put Nikki Haley in there is is is right now I mean ... and we could maybe in the first year you could go in and you could poke holes and and people did with Tillerson\nA as secretary of state saying ... not the right guy and ultimately he wasn't but if you look at it right now where it's set up and I'm Talking about national security wise and where we are with countries like Iran North Korea\nUh and and and even some of our um you know Saudi Arabia you know the president's stance on the Saudis recently um I think it requires somebody of significant strength I'm not saying there's not anyone there what is going to have to be somebody who has that strength that can go to\nThe un and do what you I I don't mean to downplay the importance of the UN ambassador but it is somebody who can if if you're looking for quality mhm you're you're not necessarily looking for a a quality of the normal presidential spokesperson\n... and and I'm Talking about Sarah Sanders ... I'm Talking about the normal one where you know if you look at all the you know the the ... the presidential spokespeople over the last you know just like what Twenty years if you look at them and you just said because remember their their parenting what the administration want their parents and their message right and\nAnd the thing that made Sarah Sanders how can be so great is she is directed in your face mhm that is actually the way and and you want to project the image\nOf the president of the United states that you represent mhm so imagery of being able to take what the president says yes and speak at the un with that same kind of force that she did\nIs what you're looking for and I can't tell you because I haven't seen\nYou know I I really haven't seen in that setting any of the the people that I hear so far maybe up or I've never see them I've never witnessed them speaking in that particular matter one thing that I wanted to say about a a Nikki Haley though\nUh and and just shows you how the the the mainstream media is just nuts\nBecause they would always ask her and I love this question it rarely is asked to anybody who serves in a Democrat presidents or a cabinet and but\nWell what would you disagree with the president how do you deal with it of course I'm going to disagree with the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes right so of course we're going to have differences but\nIf we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve in it's like you arrive ... one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job your job is to ... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants\nTo the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with the human eyes we've been talk show hosts too long we just we could\nWe probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated that are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're a UN ambassador you have to\nYou have you know the national security advisor to be has to be in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who is mimicking or or ... a mess and and both inside the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a fight or a [laughter]\nTheir heads on John Hope [laughter] John Button was asked that he's he's always as they said\nSmells tastes it looks like something there probably is this emphasis you could look at a lot of different markers laid out well down on her part again she's very confident and she again has done a good job in this posting the layout at I think a very strong wrote to the presidency and twenty twenty four [noise]\nDow futures I'm twenty\nI'm only a princess [noise]\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry's came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades\nMost brands were overpriced over designed and out of touch and Harry their approach is simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp terrible blades and sell them at honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like fire world class German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starter set with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and the travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nJust go to Harry's dot com and enter one one three seven at checkout that's Harry's dot com codes one one three seven enjoy\nDo you feel hopeless and withdrawn from work or your family do you feel as if you're a burden to everyone around you or there's just no reason to Lance\nIf these are your thoughts we want you to know there is help understanding the warning signs of suicide and knowing there are resources available to you could save your life\nSuicide at ease preventable and save can help to learn more about suicide prevention visit save dot org that's S.

years back to them and they were in her early on red eye radio and on Gary McNamara longer they're hardly eight six six Ninety red eye meteorologist Tom hale joins us right now\nTo get a get caught up on hurricane Michael good morning Tom\nGood morning I'm anyhow you guys doing doing well ah what do we know about\nMichael uh in the current conditions and what do we expect over the next uh twelve to twenty four hours\nWell I I Wish I could say that this is going to be a pretty picture but it it's not um\nI Am encouraged by a number of the reports that have indicated a lot of people have evacuated Panama City uh also uh down all the way through St or a saint Joe an app\nAppalachian coal and and that southern point a then of course from their up to Tallahassee now folks in Tallahassee I\nSome of them have been boarding up and all that but what we can expect is really simple right now it is a category three\nHurricane that means sustained wins at a hundred and twenty five miles an hour and for those of you who are kind of geeky can write this down the minimum pressure is nine forty seven nine forty seven Mila bars and it's moving to the north it\nAt twelve miles an hour and right now it is two hundred and twenty miles to the south southwest of Panama City now it's in the ... direction so for it to actually hit\nThe target which right now is estimated between Panama City and the tip of Appalachia cola\nOr it's going to have to make a little bit of a right turn and so in simple terms what people are going to expect is in some significant or whether that they have not seen in their lifetime\nUm well it's not totally fair to say that well no I I guess it really is um because I expected\nIn the next advisory to go up five or six miles an hour if it goes up six miles an hour it'll call\nAs a category for hurricane and a category for hurricane hitting this coast according to the national weather service outta Tallahassee would be the strongest hurricane on record to hit the Florida Panhandle coastline\nYeah\nSo yeah and and that's ... that's the the strongest down yet on record yeah we we talked earlier that you know Camille down the coast a little bit into the category five hitting in sixty nine that doesn't have the state of that that that part so you have an idea of what wins\nAnd and and that's the point when you talked about you know you get to a category of of for hurricanes you're talking about winds over a hundred and thirty one miles an hour as a little different than maybe you're a hurricane one where you may have eighty mile an hour winds or a five mile an hour winds since a completely different ball game is right\nExactly and when we get to the category three it changes we call it a major hurricane a category one and two are not major hurricanes but they're still I mean we saw a category to Florence a it was a\nCategory three briefly but we saw Florence come in and get a we did coverage here on right on the radio for four days with Lawrence and that puppy just hung along the coastline and this is not going to be the case here by tomorrow or as this moves its way out of here it's wins will be affecting the\nFlorida and south and North Carolina\nShoreline and in fact the last time there was a storm of that kind of situation that came through was Kate in Nineteen eighty five and Kate's case\nKate at the same time it's wins wrapping around the giant Winfield were causing storms and uh and tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and\nYou know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle uh are are going to basically relate to a cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five um but this is going to blow Kate out all the water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially\nLife threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be offshore and it will be properly ... bill a category three but\nDarn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in the in one hour from now I may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nNight land and there are infected leaders and organizations making a positive impact\nIt didn't work show with

radio at eight six six Ninety or red eye he is currently and ah I'm Gary McNamara\nComing up following a the top of the hour or more of your calls and comments you see the story that mortgage rates are going up yeah and what a five percent now Mm wow the more resources out there as a\nArticle from New Jersey you remember when they went down to like seven percent now I don't know you weren't a homeowner yet were you when they were in that range ... when I when I became a homeowner\nThis would have been two thousand seven ... a January two thousand seven\nIs when I bought my first home I'd write all over the country and never you know never settled down so I finally bought one\nIt was five I Believe was five point six or five point seven percent while while on a Fifteen year I Would have been there yes then I you know ... ... you know re did for I think it was\nLike four point three and then the last one I mean I won't be doing it again about a five years ago or four years ago whatever it was three three point too\nYeah and and you look at the I remember one time refinance a\nA property this was years ago on a ten year no at four and a quarter and I was dancing around the house I was so happy to to reach four and a quarter\nA the the point being is that I mean you know historically you look at the rates and where they were high I mean back when when we started I'm borrowing more are getting mortgages\nIt was in the seven to eight percent range and we felt lucky\nSo but the this is going to ... this will affect a revised that will affect a purchase as to what extent\nYou know the remains to be seen because right now you also have a pretty\nA healthy economy and so how does it affect day thirty or no or younger people it's not a it's not the same consideration for people in our age group\nOr because of the fact that we'd like to get it paid off before we you know right off into the retirement sunset um but um that it is I think we can expect this from the feds if you listen to what the fed\nChairman was saying the other day by the way it didn't really make the news because the Kavanaugh thing but the fed chairman saying it is really an and I'm paraphrasing it's going to it's it's almost too good to be true how good the economy is right now it's unbelievably good um uh there was a there was one I'm\nA comment or a a a guy who's regularly on CNBC earlier this week saying at least for the next two years is a good economy so those things override some times the a mortgage because yeah the fact that we're spreading it out\nYou

Wednesday right now the strongest packing wins in excess of one hundred twenty five miles per hour you know we're all just Tom said landfall\nShould be between three and six PM right now the track and the national Hurricane Center habit of land fall as the three but it it is possible still abhor we can't worry about three or four because it's bringing with it a major hurricane status that is going to move by quickly this is not going to be like Harvey is not going to be like Florence and drop a lot of rainfall\nIs that everyone seems to be taking this very seriously as they should\nAnd anyone that is in the path of hurricane Michael needs to heed the warnings from uh the national uh authorities as well as a especially the local and state authorities in\nCase as you mentioned John truck coming up a little bit later on this hour we will chat with him a ... a last hour when we talk to Tom hale he was talking about the incredible storm surge are going to see anywhere you know when you're talking about a ... anywhere in that area where it's going to hit you know near\nPanama City Florida\nYou know probably going dozens of miles each way right you're talking anywhere between eight and fourteen foot storm surge yes which is extremely extremely dangerous and now being a a category for a they expected to drop a you know right in the the Florida area up to uh\nYou know a foot of uh of rain and and even as you get inland because it right now it's going north and it's really interesting to to watch this because it's going straight north and at some point it's going to start\nOr it's going to start heading east because it does take I mean if you if you look at it uh it does almost take a forty five degree angle if you're looking at the cone and that Cohn ... you think about it the cone of uncertainty as they call it\nHas been extremely consistent over the last couple of days that have you noticed that it really hasn't moved that ... ... it's almost as if they know whatever that that front is at you know keeping it down you know to the southeastern part part of the uh United States\nMust be pretty strong because that hasn't changed at all on the track is still the same word cuts right through a you know the the middle of um of of Georgia and it's the southeastern part\nOf a of Alabama then cuts right through a Georgia and then South Carolina in the north Carolina and then out to uh to the uh the ocean it will move pretty fast because it will be by by friday morning it will be really it'll be off shore\nOf the of of uh of North Carolina actually a little bit north east of North Carolina but you know they've been just pounded with the rain and\nAh as a a Tom told us last hour they could expect three inches five inches who really knows you don't know I mean it's so unpredictable\nYou know we ... I I think about yesterday where they said okay we're going to be a little bit of rain and it just poured here so yeah we had in fact we had some some flooding just based on on rain right I'm In our area so you think you think of when it's when it's a hurricane and then that\nThen you know downgrades to a tropical storm but who really knows in what areas how much rain\nOr you're you're going to get but an extremely extremely a dangerous storm now the update or here at one am central\nOr two am eastern time a hurricane Michael now a category for yeah strangely dangerous\nA hurricane now headed are really the bulls eye right now and I don't believe that has changed at all we'll find out a little bit here when we talk to me the meteorologist John trout but right you know heading towards Panama City\nYeah when you when you when you look back on the I guess the history of\nA major hurricanes ah there will be names that that that the rise to the top there is no doubt that based on what we know about Michael already that in the years to come they will look back on on Michael as one of those again historic storms\nAre based on the size of it and and the amount of damage it's caused a so we'll be following us and we'll talk to meteorologist John trout are later this hour a day and get his take on this and and the latest information that he has\nAnd of course we multitask here on the show on a consistent basis and in one of the things now just a little less than four weeks before election day is after the cabinet hearings you know one\nOf the poll doing and you and I really looking forward to what we're going to see a over the next to a couple of days by the time we get to you know this Friday and we start seeing a polls from the actual confirmation a vote in colon speech and and how does that affect certain races out there\nUh we do have a a a few new polls out there\nAre ... and again it just\nIt we don't we don't believe that there are any absolutes when it comes to polling but it does can give you an idea or at least a snapshot as to what's going on up looking at the Nevada Senate race right a Jacky Rosen the Democrat against a Dean Heller the ... Republican\nWhere a in of all the previous polls that were done in September\nA Rosen was up a early ah one poll done in in the early September a she was up by one the grab this poll a mid September she was up by two\nOr by the time the CNN poll came and these are all likely voter polls are from nine twenty five to nine twenty nine she was up for ...\nWell the latest NBC News ... poll done\nNine thirty ten three so you're really through all the hearings at that point\nA again five hundred and Seventy four likely voters\nOr however has no up by two now all of these really are in the margin of error even when she was in the lead mhm so it's all in the margin of error but if you wish to look at it from one poll to another and again they're sampling can be different\nBut you know what you see is a a six point swing in that particular race still in the margin of error\nBut still we ... what we're looking for is any type of momentum or any type of\nUh I I think a a change in the polls movement in the polls which could be perceived to be based on the excitement level\nOf people wanting to go out and vote right we're likely voter in these polls would say you know a likely voter who said yeah I'm I'm a likely voter and and I'm fifty percent sure that I'm going to go out and vote this time where it's I'm going out and I'm voting sure and somehow that that ends up changing the the polls are moving at\nA in another direction so or that one in Nevada you know you and I were looking at other polls of of other polls are out there um\nAnd what's interesting is looking I was looking at the Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott and if you look at that right now you have a you you've got a couple of the polls are the are seeing the average showing a Nelson\nUp a a to point for\nBut it really has been a if you look at it ah it would just say a really a tie because it's well within the margin of error\nA on a number of polls with the exception of one of the Quinnipiac poll that had Nelson a plus seven but you look at ah other polls here\nA Mason Dixon poll or from nine twenty four to nine twenty seven and now it's up by one a W C. T. V. poll that was\nTaken nine Seventeen to nine thirty which would have included a few days after the uh the the the Senate hearing\nUm they would that has Nelson up by one\nAll within the margin of boom way in the margin of error because of an air bubbles poses is three and a half away and so\nIt it really is a it really is a dead heat there in Florida and I think you I think it'll be interesting to watch uh where where the\nWhere that goes um I I just think that the\nThe polls between over the next few weeks everything from Kavanaugh the Capitol hearing\nA and the vote this is going to settle in and we don't know which side it motivates more doesn't motivate the Democrats to get out more due\nTo try and hold the line on the on the Senate race and and ah in in in order to make an attempt to block Trump or down the road for a possible third\nA nominee for ...\nAnd so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd down when he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent or and now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me a yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrats in there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri\nAnd uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied now that is before the actual vote\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out of it may be here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that had there there are a ton of these races that are\nA statistical tie with even in the statistical tie Democrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched\nToward and every single

from a meteorologist\nJohn ... latest on hurricane Michael which is now hurricane or\nA you know we talked about on CNN yesterday and it was it was just a useless conversation about defining the word Martin and and all that but but it does get to the uh you know the whole thing of not being civil you know Rand Paul calling Cory Booker ... Hussein get up in the face of Congress people and\nRand Paul and his wife remember last week\nA a running a letter and and and state or an op ed piece in state in you know she sleeps now with the gun that remember Rand Paul was attacked yep I'm actually in his in his yard by by a neighbor and what they're saying what you know and it's coming out and saying look\nYou know what you're what you're doing you're ratcheting up the rhetoric now of of complete and total instability in the end the beautiful part is ... you know just how are we a month past\nThe the uh uh a funeral John McCain right member when they were talking about civility in you and I had this isn't gonna last Hillary decided to get involved in it you're ready for this All right well we got Hillary by the way let us know announced Hillary is back\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the ... or the Senate that's\nThe lady can start a dance\nLet me ask you this because we we know that the left right down we we [laughter] we know that ... whether it's Ted Cruz being in a restaurant ... whether it's Mitch McConnell being at an at an airport the mob mentality that exist now let's get a mob and to intimidate\nPeople mhm do they believe that's going to be effective yes they believe it's working that's my I guess that would be my point to ... to begin with\nThat they believe now Hillary of course when it's well established that the instability in mob mentality now exists then she jumps on board oh yeah yeah I'm going to join I only know how many months later right yeah uh and\nShe's going back to the modern but I like [laughter] so so this this this again [laughter] is where we\nWe talk about that they believe\nThat that they believe it's going to be effective either they believe there is one of two things either they believe it's going to be effective\nOr they're just so so enraged they have nothing less nothing left of substance to offer the people yeah so they just that's the natural I guess outlet is range and get in people's face wherever\nThey are in their own private time whatever ... and what they believe that's going to intimidate Republicans or conservatives\nAnd they really believe that you really believe are if you're on the left you honestly believe oh if we do this then they'll be scared and they'll back off right do you really believe that the ... do they believe that it's going to change the supporters of a Ted\nCruz no oh wait wait wait wait it is it's going to further motivate them it's going to take people who might have decided or maybe just to have been sitting on the fence maybe haven't been enthusiastic about getting out and voting\nI mean conservatives or Republicans it is going to absolutely motivate them I was actually\nA online and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about early voting you know here's where to find out where early where the when the early voting starts in your area\nThat means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make predictions but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is which side as motivated more and historically where is that greater turnout\nDid did you see the NBC reporter went to the college in California ... and there was like thirty people waiting for a bus at a college all young people ...\nAnd all of them sitting right there and he said is anybody voting yeah in the mid term not one person raised their hand part finally they found eventually they found one person ... here they found to people that should be our going to vote well what's your concern well you know college and\nCosts to college or ... what about the rational things on the Russian busted or we don't even know what's going on we don't know tension of that stuff at all I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but I I guess the point think about this now because Hillary now coming to board\nAs we said with with everything that went on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democrat Party thinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter that Hillary can jump on board and say a civility now it's gone too we take over when not to be civil bogus civility when we get our way right right we're not we're not we're not going to\nSo ... what are we looking at in terms of a timeline what can the people in the path of hurricane Michael expect from those of first high winds coming in all the way to the I reaching the shore what should we expect and went\nThis really is the calm before the storm adjusted to check on the wind speed at Tallahassee, Florida and we're only looking\nAt about Seventeen miles an hour but from here on out throughout the day today\nWe will see those wind speeds increase we could see landfall as a category for we're kinda splitting hairs though I mean we will see wins in excess of one hundred miles an hour or talking almost a sustained a tornado here folks from the mid west can appreciate the tornadoes and we're talking about not only a tornadic event but\nA rain event as well and possibly tornadoes spawned from this system over the next say thirty six hours or so\nWhat is the threat of storm surge and where we're will those areas the highest ... be\n[noise] we're looking at for the highest be a threat to Mexico Beach Florida to ah Keaton beach nine to Thirteen\nFeet now that's just that wall of water that this wind pushes in couple that with high tide and we know a tides and those areas can range from between three and six feet depending upon where you are on the coast this water will also push a\nInland Eric and Gary up through rivers and streams and the sloppy areas so we'll see smaller towns inundated we couldn't even see some major highways guy ten affected\nNot only from the flooding but the wind event is going to cause a no doubt some power lines down power outages a week out\nThe ... on roadways from a roofs ripped off of homes were talking about a very potentially catastrophic event here\nWhat time do you see it coming onshore right now\nAh right now we're still looking at the early morning hours today around eight nine AM and uh that's the actual landfall of they say I but until then from now until then anyone\nListening to me in that region are you gotta take precautions you've got to save your life and family and he said the warnings from what the officials have been mentioning for the past twenty four hours to get out of the way this thing is a potential killer\nA meteorologist John trout and I guess we're expecting another uh update here in just a little over two hours from the national Hurricane Center\n[noise] yeah we'll get another one and by then we'll know whether\nIt should arrive as a cat three or cat for but I don't want people to split hairs on bat when we categorize tornadoes we're only talking about the wind speed we saw from Hurricane Florence ah a couple of weeks ago and we saw last year from Hurricane Harvey that the category does not\nMatter as much when we're talking about flooding because only the wind speeds or part of the categories one of the things I dislike about this effort Simpson scale the real killer here is never the wind it's always the flooding and people think they can get through the roadways they can they can ride it out but ah [noise]\nThose floodwaters are very destructive very dangerous and very unpredictable\nCertainly a meteorologist a John trout we'll be following the story of course and and the storm a in a throughout the day and then a ... as it's\nIt continues inland and by the way what should we expect are we still on target or to see a few inches of rain for those areas in the Carolinas affected by for it's\nA little less than we talked about yesterday I mentioned or possibly a foot of rain that's been scaled back by a couple inches but Ah yes those areas locally or to see a some a ... foot rainfall total amounts into Georgia\nEnd of the Carolinas North Carolina and again don't forget the potential for tornadoes spawn from the system\nAll right John John trout medic a giant time we appreciate it will actually at work and uh so he'll be following this information uh of course ah throughout the day but as John mentioned that you need to heed the warnings\nAnd any other directors given by local officials and just keep in mind that the other ... gonna be a number of things that keep first responders from getting to you\nAnd so that's the point a and also uh at at some point you could lose power or may not be safe to drink water or from the tap and so there are a number of things that could become\nExtremely problematic and of course uh the officials and all of us want you to be safe and and to be able to survive this that things can be replaced the people cannot\nAnd it was just a fifty five minutes ago that the uh the new advisory came out from the national hurricane service on hurricane\nOr center excuse me on hurricane a Michael the wanting um central time advisory that it was up to a\nStrength for hurricane and ... a maximum sustained winds now a hundred and thirty miles an hour or so it is a strength for hurricane yeah which is extremely dangerous and will be\nOn on modern records the the biggest hurricane ever to hit if it stays that of or I even believe it was a three and maybe the\nThe the biggest ever to hit their the strongest to ever write yeah the panhandle\nOf Florida in ... in terms of the wind and John brings up a great point about those a spin off tornadoes in those areas which can also be destructive as well will follow the story and coming up next our in fact we'll talk with meteorologist Tom held get an update from him\n[noise]\n\n... radio on Westwood One\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight

today we're all just John ... has an update\nThe system is now a category for hurricane data from air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft\nIndicate maximum sustained winds of increased to one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher gusts the winds will be destructive when the system makes landfall later today the rainfall will produce massive amounts of flooding there could be tornadoes spawned as a result as well a meteorologist John traveling now that\nUh you know the the border of Florida and south eastern uh uh excuse me south western Georgia and that point then it cuts right across the middle of Georgia and then uh it continues to move north east coast of South Carolina\nAnd the eastern half of the eastern southern half of a of North Carolina so they've got a ton of rain there as we all know because of\nA Hurricane Florence but also their coastline could also be affected as are also tropical storm a of a warnings are especially long the the Georgia and South Carolina ... online actually tropical storm warnings there and watches ah for\nFor a North Carolina so we are right now there quite often you'll see tornadoes uh that that that spin off from storms like this and they can become destructive and they are in and they happened very quickly\nUm the knowing and and growing up in tornado alley uh you understand that that they are that that often there's little to no warning for those tornadoes and they become of course a ... a separate a destructive force\nOf their own so certainly all the folks in the path of hurricane Michael ah over the next twenty four to forty eight hours heed the warnings or keep your radios on\nA keep batteries charged and to stay alert or coming up here in less than thirty minutes after the bottom of the hour we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale who did a great job\nAnd covering Hurricane Florence forests\nAre we talked to him earlier he also a covered a Hurricane Irma in Florida for us uh on red eye radio so we'll talk to him about this a new report the update from the national Hurricane Center which came across at two AM eastern\nAnd what changed here and and again what all of this means in terms of the energy behind hurricane Michael\n[noise] uh it uh getting back to what we're talking about a a last hour and when we played the audio cut from Hillary Clinton same civility is impossible until the\nDemocrats take power again so that was her call for incivility and the interesting thing about that is an and we've talked about you know whether it's Ted Cruz or you know in the restaurant that made a big news\nUh uh a couple of weeks ago or Mitch McConnell\nAre at the uh the the airport or a a Jeff Flake in the the the elevator or what's you know what's going on right now the the call number from Maxine Waters remember when Maxine Waters and she might have been really ignited that that political flame of\nOf actually Democrats to elected office to buy that was calling it\nA you know and and so we saw what happened this past weekend we saw what happened to Ted Cruz saw what happened to Mitch McConnell saw what happened to Jeff Flake\nOr the conversation on CNN yesterday it's not a mob it's just a people expressing their their uh their their their viewpoints and it's like well most of America looks at it and when they see people screaming and yelling and going into into a private place not an organized protest\nOr organized protest Americans were fine with you go out and you protest and you're with tens of thousands of other people and it's a peaceful protest and that's fine Americans don't want riots\nAmericans don't want mob rule they don't want you go they they don't uh most Americans don't approve\nOf the fact that you're going into a place that is not your property trespassing just to the point of harassing right or you know a ... you know somebody else has happened in Ted Cruz's place but that call to harass people are ... anywhere uh yesterday a Rand Paul again and you know Rand Paul's wife\nOr has been on this year for the last uh a couple of weeks talking about the instability Kentucky Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday took aim with the rhetoric employed by senator Cory Booker and others accusing them of ratcheting up the conversation or to the point where unstable people could commit\nViolence said Paul to Kentucky radio host I fear there's going to be at an assassination\nWhy I really worry that somebody's going to be killed and that those who are in a war ratcheting up the conversations those who are saying get in their face there have to realize that they bear some responsibility if this this elevates the violence\nThese are people that are unstable Paul says we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging them the violence that violence is never okay or there was never a reason uh to resolve things that weigh directly calling out Booker\nWho last July told activist to get up in the face of some congresspeople Paul referenced his own\nUh salt at the hands of a neighbor as well as last year's a baseball field shooting which Representative Steve ... was wounded to show that unstable people can easily take things\nAre too far and then we talk about the fact that Hillary talked about you know no civility right share her call here so you've mainstream that completely now when Hillary comes out you can't get more mainstream Democrat over the last Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability number one we talked about the fact that\nThey actually think this is an effective way to go\nTo the actually think that politicians you know calling for it now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can help civility which is the call for instability ...\nWhich is the calls to harass people in their private life and I that was the first thing that hit me was\nWas they think this is going to be effective\nBut then you get to the point of Hillary now bringing it up where she feels comfortable saying it looks Hillary's a follower she'll be asked you and not take an opinion on anything if she believes\nThat it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in her base ... we've seen that before remember when she was up\nIn Canada yeah and\nShe was asked about the pipeline right I'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president\nIt this is still a a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on it are and she didn't want to take a side right and so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability\nAnd and and they think about this\nSo now it's becoming mainstream and and and what it why instability over what what is the\nIssue you're calling for due process\nYou're calling for presumption of innocence you're calling for preponderance of evidence you're saying where's the evidence you're coming out because this is and we talked about this yesterday what came out of this whole thing\nOr you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists and therefore you deserve no stability because of it which is of course\nThat their definition it's not the definition of people that believe in due process under the law people to believe and due process under the law obviously\nAre not advocating rape or sexual assault now any other crime right\n\nAnd that's the point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that it's so radical that the writers taking were instability must lead and it's that simple point the belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case to show the guilt of anybody and not just an allegation that is what has set off even the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in civility this is\nHow far how low\nWe always wonder we always that's the question how long will they go you know calling somebody and not see you know and and and saying that that's been for a long time but you get to the point now where they're calling for instability based\nOn people's opinion on the other side that evidence is how you judge somebody's guilt right due process should apply and all of these cases which means you look\nFor the evidence to find somebody skilled you don't believe anybody because of their demographic because of their gender because of their race because of their age you believe people because the evidence backs what they what they say now you can believe them you can sit there and why I think that sounded credible\nThat doesn't mean that that person that you look at them and called them a rapist\nBecause that's what they were doing they were calling him arenas and the gang rape is yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes\nThey believe cabin odd it at the evidence isn't there right never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with them because you say no I Believe in the preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption\nOf of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if I Need evidence and when somebody stories change\nI'm suspicious those are all rational critical thinking commonsense arguments and the Democrats if you believe that way are now calling for instability to harass\nYou everywhere even invade your privacy where ever you are\nAnd it's not just the uh the old guard and Maxine Waters\nTo the United states is certainly concerns about his whereabouts senior officials at

threatening storm surge of up to Thirteen feet what makes landfall later today you know we're all just ...\nAlready seeing the outer bands of Michael push the shore right now so strong thunderstorms report it around Panama City will begin to see some of those tropical storm force winds with this as well and that of course going in for nine eventually it's a new and eventually for three PM then we talk about hurricane force winds in that category for force where they're coming ashore with one hundred and thirty miles per hour sustained\nAh get over water again is just and and that will be colder water it looks like it'll dissipate out there in the north Atlantic somewhere right\nHurricanes often spawn tornadoes just be aware that that situation is very real in those tornadoes uh you

batteries\nAh for a portable radio or device or and make sure that everything is charged\nOr so that you can stay up with it and be able to hear any warnings that come across four or something like a tornado or as it was being described by Tom hale are meteorologist on this story moved again talk with him here and just a bit\nI'm Talking with him about the storm surge and the way it is a you know as he described it it's like filling up a bathtub so\nIt is not something again or if you are not familiar with this with a a storm surge and very few people are\nBased on the the ... diction models for the highest storm surge from this storm very few people on the planet has ever experienced that and again we just have to repeat that that is a deadly deadly\nA danger to ah to to individuals well that may not be familiar with it and not a understand fully or what the impact is\nSad and I never lived in in Panama City but at the looks familiar the the downtown city area in which with a lot of residences right next to the water on the bay right and it reminds me of a lot of like Fort Walton Beach when when I Lived outside of Fort Walton Beach where I live actually lived in\nIn Fort Walton Beach for a very short time but mostly in Nevada or Florida which is between Pensacola and and Fort Walton Beach and and that's in my head trying to figure out what it would be like\nYou know when I remember sitting there right in you know residential the in in the city there and you could see the bay and\nI'm thinking if and that would have been a in Fort Walton Beach I talked to hatch you may if if that came up you know fourteen feet what that would be like him that's what I'm trying to imagine in my head ... estimates and on and look at Pensacola or look at the uh\nPanama City in and say you're going to have a lot of flooding\nAnd and again uh we we talked about it the the houses on the beaches that are on stilts they're roughly a the four of those houses and the deck roughly at ten feet so if you're talking about a Thirteen or fourteen foot surge\nThat means that inside those above the skills inside those homes\nYou're still talking about three to four feet of water\nA and that becomes the you know I think that puts it in perspective for anyone who's even seen one of those homes and I stayed in one over the summer I Can't imagine water getting that high there's a reason that they built him on stilts and that\nThe average is roughly ten feet it's because it's thought to be above the ah average storm surge in and the path of a storm a you know in the average again storm but Michael hurricane Michael is no average store\nWe'll be talking to meteorologist Tom hale coming up at the bottom of the hour trying to get in all the other stories that are out there and they're actually a quite a few stories the the one that caught my attention yesterday because\nUh you we really have gotten no response from the White House on this especially with the president coming out really uh yesterday and and dating and Monday that a Rod Rosenstein is going to stay mhm uh you know he's she's going to be there they had the talk and everything is great then the story comes out the two senior FBI officials told\nThe bureau's top lawyer they believe the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious when he discussed secretly recording Donald Trump\nAnd invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year according to sources close to a congressional investigation and an account that conflicts with the claims from Rosenstein and others the comments were either inaccurate reported or made ingest\nA this is again former FBI general counsel a James Baker more information coming out about his testimony are told congressional investigators behind a closed door deposition last week\nThat then FBI acting director Andrew McCabe an FBI lawyer Lisa Page came to Baker after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and may have twenty Seventeen Baker said page and McCabe relate details\nOf the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments though he wasn't personally in that meeting Baker told congressional investigators he took ... pages word\nA seriously the sources said further Baker trope congressional investigators\nHe suspected that Rosenstein was cooperating with two people in the administration to vote the twenty Fifth Amendment a source said wow yeah the testimony would appear at odds with other accounts of those discussions Baker who's testimony was described as deliberate and sober\nAdded he had not done a legal analysis and was not on sure whether it was unethical or illegal the source at it\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah I'm really this is the story that we have talked about the one that is\nHas been completely buried where there's been a really eye of\nThe somebody may have written it out there but I haven't I haven't even seen it National Review ... Henry McCarty I haven't seen write about it the Kimberley Process all and and this is about analyzing the the fact that the president with the Pfizer warrant application that he said let's declassify it\nAnd then came out and said well we're going to give it to the inspector general to look at\nAnd he will expedited quickly and we went for what for what you're you're if you're afraid that\nAre some things should stay ... you know redacted well then you don't go to the inspector general you go ... or a secretary of state former CIA director\nBecause what you're claiming some of the allies don't want some of the information out so you go to him or you go to the director of national intelligence you go to the director of the CIA the last verse you go to is the inspector general\nBecause the inspector general looks at what corruption oh oh they declassified it next thing you know it's going to the inspector general\nCorruption why is does it seem to be that nobody in the media is covering that story\nEveryday I wake up and I said ... what am I missing\nWell because if you look at it there is there's nothing to gain the president's not going to get any kind of I guess political feedback or direction from the inspector general no that's not first of all it's not who Horowitz says\nBut it's not the role of that office ... ... of that position to be an advisor to the president that's not the point the point of the guys use office is to investigate misdeeds and wrongdoing and possible criminal activity by people within the department of justice\n... ... if you look at how that played out and nobody talked about it except for the fact\nThat nobody talked about it\nAnd I'm not talking about the Kimberley straw souls or you know any anybody that has been covering this are you ... even a Sarah a quarter who's been covering an a number of things and and does a really good job at it\nI'm Talking about the liberal media who's been screaming rushing collusion Russian collusion Russian collusion Russia inclusion since before the president took office so it was about that time that they went completely silent on Russian collusion\n... ah Devin Nunes has brought it up like that I I don't know why the president doesn't make sense and then he stopped talking about right\nBecause nobody is talking about it in Washington none of the politicians Adam ship isn't talking about it nobody is talking about the fact that\nThey did the rejection and then gave it to the inspector General Dempsey classified it and then said oh we see something here that the inspector general who investigate corruption mhm we give it to him to review\nIt because there's only ... it whether it was\nGiven out and I were voted on by the people you know what else [noise]\n\nWho are similar\nAppeal and her Instagram feed Sunday sixty five thousand people registered to vote [noise]\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm not famous but I did start screaming company called Harris the idea for Harry's came out of a frustrating experience I had buying razor blades most brands were overpriced over designed and out of touch and Harry's or approaches simple here's our secret\nWe make sharp bearable blades and sell them it honest prices for as low as two dollars each we care about quality so much that we do some crazy things like fire world class German blade factory obsessing over every detail means we're confident in offering a hundred percent quality guarantee millions of guys have already made the switch to Harry's so thank you if you're one of them\nAnd if you're not we hope you give us a try with the special offer get Harry starter set with a five blade razor waited handle shaved Joe and the travel cover all for just three bucks plus free shipping\nJust go to ... dot com and enter one one three seven at checkout that's Harry's dot com code one one three seven enjoy\nDoes the financial advice you been getting sound like this this is mark ... principle of the group here in Atlanta and host of the financial ... report when we're talking finance as we know it's important to communicate in a language you can easily understand straight\nQuestion deserves straight answers to call the ... group right now and you receive the complimentary financial consultation in one of our many offices in the area\nSeven seven zero nuns reduced zero three Seventy seven seven zero nine three to zero three aids testing testing one two thing on\nThat land and there are impressive leaders and organizations making a positive impact\nThe good work showing our effort active role in North Georgia is a highlight the good\nThat make the Atlanta work every Saturday afternoon we'll bring you this story the leader nonprofit\nAnd people may be different\nIf you know the area and leader or organization you want to be on the show [noise] emailing didn't work at G.

with her and her only eight six six Ninety red eye let's get caught up on the latest\nOn hurricane Michael as we go to a meteorologist Tom hale good morning Tom good morning All right what a winning what do we know about a hurricane Michael at this point and when we expect another update\nOkay we should expect an update in one hour from now actually we should expect an update and a half an hour\nAbhor yeah mhm yeah and uh and then the second question\nAnd so what is I I guess give us the latest on that uh what do we know about what's the status of Michael right now and when do we expect Michael to hit the shore in the panhandle of Florida\nOkay well the first thing is you know normally the national weather service can be kind of conservative in regards to its own language\nBut the national weather service or the national Hurricane Center in this case describes Michael as an extremely dangerous category for hurricane life threatening storm surge hurricane force winds\nHeavy rain expected along the northeastern Gulf Coast and it's located a hundred and eighty miles to shout southwest of Panama City and it is one\nIt is a one hundred and Seventy miles to the southwest of Appalachian coal that of course when Spain's or a hundred and thirty miles an hour and it's moving to the north at twelve miles an hour now taking a look at at some of the radar\nI'm at indications it's a if you've been watching any of the TV stations with their radar indications that shows a little bit of ... to it\nUm and it actually looks like it may be starting to make a little bit of a turn maybe one or two degrees uh in the direction of Panama City um and and so it's most likely going to come ashore right in between\nPanama City beach and down to Appalachian coal ah Callaway is a town along their port saint Joe is also along that same area as a category for and this is the official definition of a category for\nA category for hurricanes have sustained winds of a hundred and thirty up to a hundred and fifty\nSix miles an hour obviously Puerto Rico side of the higher end of that scale but well built framed homes can will ah sustain severe damage and loss of most of their roof and and possibly some exterior walls wow\nTrees will be snapped or uprooted and power lines down fallen trees and power lines will isolate residents\nAnd power outages will last for potentially a several
