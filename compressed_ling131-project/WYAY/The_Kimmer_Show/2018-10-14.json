I'm probably closer to the five percent now Ron I have not run a stress test on that portfolio but just by looking at things um you know we're in the process of doing his analysis he is going to have a lot more than just five percent stress\nAnd when I share that result it's gonna shocking and I see this all the time because\nAs the markets go up so does your risk if you don't have a plan of regular rebalancing that's why it's important to take the time and have occasional stress testing done on your portfolio which we do for our clients all the time but we also do it for our listening audience as well\nThe subject of our conversations day is I Can't get no satisfaction but actually you can you can have peace of mind and your retirement and one of the ways to get there and Margot I can tell you all about this is if you have a diversity of the income streams why is that so important\nWell because when we retire Ron\nWe lose a paycheck would kind of joke around about it here on the show all for years we have and we call that permit unemployment [laughter] yeah which you know it's a look at it this way I retired I'm getting a Social Security check\nWhich might be you know a stipend compared to my paycheck\nIt's kinda like that Social Security check might remind you of an unemployment check or something you know ... it's not the same thing but it kind of reminds you of that Richard getting it that's it you have to have you can't live off of that Social Security check and you're not blessed enough to have a pension check where is the rest of the money coming from\nWell it's coming from your investments and like I tell folks all the time I think we really nailed down to things really really good year at the lawyer group and motive Andrea services\nHow to manage risk inside of a portfolio use risk to our advantage but at the same time help our clients protect their assets\nEfficiently more efficiently than just rolling the dice with everything in a mutual fund and hoping for the best we actually have a plan in place to manage risk and the second thing I think we do very very well here is how do we create income\nAnd I think it's important not only to have diversity in having different kinds of income but where that income comes from\nSo we have talked for years about the having different buckets of money and this particular case I use a three bucket approach when the markets are going up like they are right now\nSometimes it makes sense to take some of those gains from our growth bucket and lock those in and that could be some of the money that we use for future income\nOr we might look more towards an income driven buckets that it's going to be paying interest and dividends and we use that that's coming in\nOr we may be look at it more of a protected income buckets something that's safer or have you know no risk in the market\nBut we know that that incomes going to be based on the uh the growth that it has or the guaranteed interest that it pays those kinds of buckets are what we used to create income and they all work differently because as the markets change Ron where we choose our income from needs to be flexible\nAnother way that you can achieve peace of mind and your retirement and not have to worry is if you have a diversity of income streams as mark is just explained but also you can be confident in your ability to spend money every month without having to worry and stressed out about whether you're going to run out of that money\nNot so true I mean in a perfect world we would love for everyone to be able to continue with the same lifestyle you had when you were bringing in a paycheck or if you were both working husband and wife both working to pay checks\nIf you could live with that kind of income and had that kind of income coming in at retirement and live the quality lifestyle you have now or in some cases one of my clients said you know mark I don't think I have a quality lifestyle right now because I'm working all the time I'd like to spend a little bit more and I'm spending now\nWhat if we put a plan together were enabled you to especially during the early times of your retirement\n[noise] be able to spend more money and go traveling go do the things that you're not able to do because you're you're working all the time now that you have free time let's go ahead and reap the rewards and spend some of this money and you know all the fruits of our labor and take advantage of that well you need to have a plan you need to have an income plan\nAnd we called our financial road map and I can literally plug in the numbers and say okay this is what you're spending now let's up that\nLet's put some extra spending in their early for it in the next ten years or so while we're young and healthy let's go ahead and spend some more what what kind of impact would that have on our retirement and I can show that\nAnd I can we can change the numbers on the screen print the report our client flood it because it is a road map it is a blueprint of what retirement would or could or should look like\nAnd then we can tweak it each year and say okay we're we're between the guard rails we're on track or we need to make some changes to get us back on track\nI Love working with that what we call our financial road map and our clients see a big value I Believe from that because as we sit down and talk about it it's ... opening its educational and it gives you confidence that you are on the right track to be able to retire comfortably\nAnd listening to the financial symphony with mark Lloyd on rise sets and mark a word\nFor the rest of your life is your retirement account or your investment accounts do you really know how much you're paying\nYou should run tell the folks how they can get in touch with us to get a complementary the report and and now it says on their portfolio\nJust pick up the phone call eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight that's eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight you can get a complementary review of your financial plan just call now they take advantage eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight [noise]\nWherever you go\nFollow lurking along continuously nibbling away your hard work\nHis knees don't be afraid of hidden fees and your portfolio coming to meet with your financial ... for a review of all the fees and your current plan let us see if we can eliminate those pesky\nWhen your financial nice to Michael only serving the Atlanta area ... eight hundred seven forty nine four to eight eight eight hundred seven for nine forty two eighty eight\nA house to produce more male when listening to relaxing music\nThat's according to a study conducted in England in two thousand one and reported by the BBC did you also know that people have a higher level of financial satisfaction while listening to the financial ... was never reported by the DDT primarily because we made it up like keep listening anyway welcome back\nTo the financial symphony with mark Lloyd your financial maestro and marks number is eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight markets course appreciate you're listening to the show every week and if you like to reach out and leave a message then marks team will get back with you and you can set a time to come and have a conversation\nAbout your situation again that number is eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nMark Lloyd of course has been doing this for close to three decades now it makes it seem like a long time twenty eight years of experience helping people plan for retirement and that's what this radio show is all about eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nMark was talking about irreversible decisions we talking about this all the time about how there are some important decisions that you need to make plenty of decisions that you'll make and retirement planning process it can't really be done so you need to make sure you do it right the first time\nExplain why these decisions and I'm getting ready to throw out here are so important and you can't go back and change it number one when you decide when you start Social Security you got to make the right decision upfront\nYeah so I occasionally I Will get you know listeners who call in and come in for a compliment review and they'll say hey does that make sense when I turned sixty two to go ahead and turn on my Social Security\nAnd I'm like well all upfront you will get a twenty five percent reduction in your benefits mhm\nSo I think what we need to do is we need to run a Social Security optimization report and let's take a look at what income me if you have an I ask questions like there are health history because there is a break even point that if you live past a certain age that you will you know definitely would have been a bad decision to take it at sixty two\nSo we kind of look at their individual situation that's why I Love about what we do here is that\nEvery solution is customized based on their specific situation and by running different software and running Social Security optimization that tells me exactly when is the optimal time to turn on that Social Security benefits and if we're married\nThose are spouse take Social Security off a bus or they take it off of their own Social Security you know and there's different ways of maximizing that benefit as well so that we can elect the right types of\nOptions that are out there it is a big deal\nSome people it makes even since the even wait and take it a little bit longer maybe not at sixty six sixty seven but wait 'til Seventy pretty much after Seventy there's no benefit of waiting because you're not getting a bump up and your check but sometimes it makes sense to even wait longer because you're getting about eight percent higher check if you wait\nFrom sixty six Seventy so it's all about crunching the numbers and that's why again receiving some help with this might make sense because we can look at it and say when is the best time for you to turn on Social Security and like you said earlier Ron if you turn it on the wrong time you can't change it so you're kinda stuck\nAnd this is all about at retirement where do I get the most income to support my retirement so I don't have to put as much stress on my portfolio that I have\nWe want to get more income at retirement so that my I have a better chance of my portfolio lasting my lifetime\nAnd lower the risk of running out of money down the road which is by far the biggest fear we hear each and every week here on financial Seventy radio\nAll right here's another decision a very important decision that you know you can't go back and change it once you make it and that is electing spousal benefits on your pension if you're lucky enough to have one or not taking their spouse or benefits tell us why that's so important mark\nWell if you don't take spousal benefits and you're married and you prematurely die your spouse gets no pension zero which means that the company won your family or your wife or your husband loses\nNow sometimes is still it is the best decision to take full pension and not have spousal benefits but you better have a solution in case you die earlier it might be a life insurance policy I've taken the difference between my full pension check\nAnd that's spousal check and I bought a really nice life insurance policy to fund my spouse and then that's even kind of better at my spouse died that my kids inherit something\nThat might make sense it also depends upon the company you retire from about the the difference between full pension and survivorship pension there's a gap there survivorship pension usually is less it's not always the last but usually it could be a lot less what is that gap\nAgain by sitting down with an income plant are like us a full holistic from that looks at different ways of maximizing your income\nWe can crunch the numbers and say okay this makes the most sense this choice right here base on your scenario based on what you said based on your expenses put in some inflation in here based on current tax rates I mean there's a lot of different factors you know kind of\nKind of like around like putting pieces of a puzzle together and we have all the pieces of the puzzle and all the different software to allow us to be able to again help you make those good decisions before it's too late you make their own decision\nAnother decision that people have to make is whether or not to get ...\nInsurance sometimes it's perfect for you other times it may not be right for you right\nMarch so I just used an example there was spousal benefits pensions sometimes the solution is we take full pension\nYou know assuming that we're going to live a normal lifetime a life expectancy and just in case we don't we have a life insurance on the sideline life insurance policy on the sideline to take care of our spouse and if we want to leave something to the kids that could be used for that\nYou know sometimes that does make them the best decision but the longer you wait\nTo make that decision more risk occurs risk being oh I just got diagnosed with you know high cholesterol or I've had a little heart attack\nOr I've had maybe a mini stroke\nOr maybe there's some new medication on now for us to have to take and that solution now is out of the picture because it doesn't make sense to do that because of this medication is going to either calls my life insurance if I'm considering the buying some to be a lot more expensive or eliminate you from being able to use that as an option altogether\nOkay and uh the last one I wanted to talk about here is choosing the actual retirement date when you retire you got to talk about this a little bit we're discussing Social Security from a few moments ago\nYeah the financial road map this is critical this is key\nLike I said earlier I plug in\nThe accounts of my clients and we know what those particular accounts historically have earned how much they've grown through the years and then I'd backing down I play it a lot more conservative\nI don't anticipate a bull market I anticipate a flat market or lower market I anticipate a sluggish market I'm not trying to paint a picture that's not you know ... or not realistic\nI look at the expense is and then I immediately at inflation to that that is a big deal if our budget is we're spending six thousand a month a thousand a month five thousand about whatever it is\nIt's not going to stay that way either factor in inflation than that and then one of my clients and people that listen to the radio program come in and they see those expenses continue to go\nUp up up up and up\nThey then see how much stress that's putting on their portfolio how are we going to need to put up income plan together\nSo that we don't have the fear of running out of money\nHow do we maximize the income so that we can continue to have some of this money growing for longevity for down the road so we get we don't have to tap into all of our money at one time that's why it's important to have different buckets of money some money that's going to be long term growth some money that's going to have income that I Need immediately\nWhile I got to put my doctor Phil and my counseling adult ear [laughter]\nMiriam thank you for your question I get this question a lot I really really do and it can be both sides you know sometimes it's you know the husbands the free spender and and his wife is those saver and it goes both ways\nSo it is not gender basis question does not gender based by no means\nThis is what I find this is where the the financial roadmap is critical because this answers questions and what I normally see is when it when when someone says I feel like I have to work forever is because there's fear there the fear is once I lose that paycheck do I have enough money saved\nSo it's almost like there's an off ... the light bulb goes off\nWhen that family comes Enron and sits down with me and they're able to see way how well this is great wait a minute I can retire I can actually see it in black and white I can see what retirement looks like I can see how much I can spend\nAnd it's kind of neat it's not much different than what I'm spending now\nIt's just that I'm getting my income from different sources and I'm using the money that I've saved all these years and I'm using it to fund my retirement\nNow there's a lot of steps that has to be taken to make sure that we get that comfort level like\nWhat happens if we have a market correction or market crash what impact would that have on your retirement\nWell if we could mount a stress test of the portfolio and keep stress testing it because we're managing it for you we're managing that risk and we can see that it's\nHeaven forbid another two thousand and eight happen exactly the same way it happened before my stress testing software says we're only going to lose this amount versus this huge amount but you may have lost back you know eight\nThat peace of mind that's kind of All right I can afford for my account to go down that much if we end up having that kind of catastrophic financial catastrophe I Know that I I'm Still gonna be okay that that's a peace of mind how much money can we spend my financial roadmap answers that that's a peace of mind\nSo you know there's a lot of things a lot of answers you can get so that you don't have to worry about dealing into a Great Depression mentality\nYou don't necessarily need that I had one client come in Ron not too long ago as she says Mark I'm really really really need a new car\nMhm I just looked at her and she probably thought I had the dumbest look\nOn my

back then it was the Republicans right to free the slaves gum and and it was like the Democrats were the conservative once and the Republicans were the ones that were liberals and and that's changed over the years now of course\nIt's a really you gotta look at it as conservative and liberal the conservatives were against the uh desegregation\nThey were against the voting rights or they were against the women's right to vote even to survey the liberals were the ones fighting for them or the the conservatives were against the gay rights and gay marriage so you look out through history

after the south did after the civil war they still had slaves\nThey passed the thirteenth amendment or after the civil war in outlawing slavery across all of America\nI Know but they still had slaves in the north so it's not like them died you know the north where the squeaky clean\n[noise]\nMan I'm saying they were squeaky clean up a lot of it was they didn't want they they didn't want a slave taking jobs away but nonetheless they were fighting to get rid of slavery and the south was fighting to keep the slavery and given to some of these people some of your callers they are too far removed

really well right now so\nThat's actually a happy ending on that yet\nSo you had to call yesterday uh it said something about Democrat made some\nSort of a ... a day about the\nDemocrats and the Muslims Democrats are starting to behave like Muslims or want people to do anyway yeah whatever\nSomething along the lines um but it actually tried to make sense to me I was thinking about our science 'cause it's this level of fanaticism that that the Democrats are starting to take on and you know you can't you can't argue with a fanatic\nNo no ... and these have you know when it comes down to\nYeah ... it's really unfortunate some the images that we're seeing end up uh Mexico beach on the air force base down there to a guy that hit really hard yeah I'm storm surge was um\nThe worst case scenario I think there was top now between twelve and sixteenth beaten apple logical uh\nI'm In a storm chaser actually had their vehicle washed away in the storm surge\nWow yeah so in a bad guy got real serious him real bad they're a real quick um one of the TV stations um they actually had to be evacuated and a WNBA be that'd be a evacuated and now one of my friends works there\nUm and they had to take a shelter up in a doting\nWow well thank God there okay oh no no one got hurt that's for sure\nSo far we haven't heard of any any anything anymore\nAnd uh that was hurt 'em at the new stations so\nWhile I'm John you wherever they're lucky I mean I've I've heard right now and correct me if I'm wrong right I've only heard of two jets won in Florida in Georgia so far as a result of this storm and something else you pointed out yesterday that you are right you were you were just spot on the ... of the\nHow low the pressure was of this hurricane compared to other hurricanes and I think is wound up being the third most powerful hurricane to hit land with that lower pressure\nYeah that's exactly what it was and um it was stronger ended up being stronger than Andrew as far as pressure but not in when right um and one thing that I think I'm a lot of people don't realize is having that rover pressure is what\nLeads to those strong wins ... so if it was at that you know the third highest um pressure\nOver water you know um if they had the speed of foreign so we would have been talking about that storms I'm Michael smashing even more records right but because it was moving so fast the pressure was dropping at such a rate that the wind speeds essentially couldn't really keep up\nWith it so it ended up\nBeing a not being the worst case could have\nBeen longer if it was over water for even an hour longer than what it was\nJust absolutely uh to me a ... hour worded it on Facebook earlier tonight it's fascinating but at the yet a terrifying\nExactly and and here in the Atlanta metro area I I Know we got to a a good amount of\nRain in some wind and there were some trees that were down but down around East Point in some parts in northwest Atlanta it looked like there may have been a possibly a tornado\nThat that he has struck\nThat was all that was the only thing that was off about the forecast yesterday was that warning was a little bit farther north than what we were thinking I'm for a possible tornado\nA brief spent up um is probably what is going to be verified as a national whether it's the reason why it's a possible tornado right now right we see the damage\nWe understand there was a tornado warning therefore radar indicated you know we we we we have the technology now that really gives us I'm a clear view right so now that they go out and they survey the damage yup to then decide ... the string path\nIn size the tornado and that's when it becomes a confirmed blank tornado\nGods G ... or whatever you want ... interesting study man hey Russian\nPouring rain we're still seeing a lot of high winds are around here is that from Michael or is that the cold front than actually pushed Michael to the right\nIt's a combination of both and and I think the winds are a lot stronger today because of how low the pressure guy was\nMichael ... ended up and it ended up picking up more speed there for um oh man how do I work this without sounding too smart um [laughter] no it's it's it has to do with the pressure change your guy and the pressure gradient meaning the change of pressure over distance\nIs a lot smaller than what was in ... and because it's such a small difference and pressure change that leads to much stronger when that ... the wind is being forced\nAnd a lot more specific small or regions in the atmosphere of versus if it wasn't as if Michael wasn't as strong so that's why we're getting such strong wind today because you have to pressure systems colliding into one and that and when they merge together like\nThat you get really really tight pressure gradients gosh here's your wind currents fantastic well\nRyan I look we really do I know that there's some rain moving through the Carolinas and uh I Know there they they don't they don't need the rain but\nHopefully there won't be too much flooding up there as it moves through South Carolina North Carolina ... and Ryan thank you so much over the past number of days for\nKeeping our listeners up to date on what's going on you have been spot on with the with all the information you give us and and the information that people can actually understand what the what
