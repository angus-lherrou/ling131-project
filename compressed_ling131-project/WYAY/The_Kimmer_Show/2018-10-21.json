announced plans to pull out of an arms control agreement with Russia is quote regrettable and a top Russian diplomat says the plan is a perilous move\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker this morning said the withdrawal announcement may just be a bargaining tactic by the president\nIf we're going to get out of it I Hope we at least are in a place research and development wise where way to have develop some mechanisms otherwise uh they're going to move ahead of us quickly\nAnd basically X. rays are trained to measure risk\nAnd to figure out ways to ameliorate or actually eliminate that risk\nWhen we talk about risk on our program we're always talking about risk and volatility but it's kind of similar we have to make sure as we're getting closer to retirement that that risk and volatility is under control when you agree absolutely\nI think one of the things are kind of his prompted me to look at this is my own personal situation\nI'm sixty eight years old like myself and I'm all my friends we all have tax deferred higher race for one case and so forth and so it got me thinking a lot about what are the different types of risks that I Am going to have to encounter during my retirement years and what am I doing to eliminate those risk\nSo when we talk about risk like that we were talking about market volatility like we said earlier but you mentioned something just now taxes\nAnd you know we've been saying on the show for quite a while since the Trump tax plan has come into existence that we taxes basically right now are on sale so it was giving folks like us an opportunity to sit down and really look at this picking tax time bomb that our listeners have\nAnd they ... some cases they don't even realize they have it so the topic a little bit about four oh one K. is in IRAs and how that affects people in retirement\nWell one of the things I talk about my book no compromise retirement plan is that people have kind of forgotten about what tax deferred means most people saving IRAs and for one case everybody said oh that's what you should always do because you get that tax deduction up front\nWhat they don't tell you about as much as what happens when you start to spend that money at that point not only your tax on what you put in your taxed on all of that growth\nIs a huge ticking time bomb and whether you think about pain that tax today or paying that tax ten years from now Twenty years from now or when you die and your kids inherited IRA and they have to pay the tax\nSo those taxes don't even go away when you die\nThat's right they never go away and I view the tax liability of it are a kind of like it's like that\nSo I called that but basically the IRS has a hold on twenty twenty five percent of your IRA whether you like it or not that's where you are today and what do you pay a today or wait later on down the road they claim a portion of your IRA no matter what\nAnd it's important to really understand how the tax code is set up an and how these tax brackets are not permanent\nWhen Trump and the Republicans got them pass through Congress it was with a stipulation called the sunset provision that been ten years they're going back to the old tax rates\nBut folks it could be worse than that it could go to a higher tax rate just because of the debt that we have ... I think we were looking at the debt taught not too long ago Marty\nYeah well let me give me an example because you're absolutely right we're running a trillion dollar deficits annually now and I don't see it getting any better but but let me tell you what's happening to you know I have a business degree as well\nAnd you're kind of look at economic cycles and what you've seen is wants to generation about every Thirty years there's a major tax rate cut\nAnd from then on to the next Thirty years where you see your tax rates gradually creeping up not just the rights themselves but other ways that your income as being tax or other ways or income triggers other taxes\nSo right now we're probably in the best world will ever be in at least for most of your listeners assuming during the late fifties sixties and so forth you probably will never see a better tax environment then you see today and pushing that along these record deficits\nLittle hard to see how those are going to go down in the future ... with all the problems with Medicare with Social Security with our overall spending so today is this kind of a window of opportunity to do something while taxes are low\nCan you explain to our listeners when you say kicking tax time bomb what you mean now I I kinda know what you mean but\nExplained it in layman's terms what you mean by taking tax time bomb for people who have fault they were doing all the right thing\nBy just funding their four O. one K. put as much as they could put in there have their company match it if they didn't have a four O. one K. max out their traditional i._r._a. save on their ten forty so that they would not have to pay as much on taxes why is that now a ticking time bomb\nWell here's a problem with tax deferred savings again you get that the ducks are at the front but every dollar you turn on that account\nPortion of that will go tackle salmon taxes you can't get out once you're in it the question is what's the best way to minimize it but the fact is you will start paying that tax and it gets worse than that because at time bomb for everybody slows when they become savvy and a half\nThey have the same color required minimum distributions and whether you like it or not if you save under one of the tax\nDeferred parts of the IRS cold wet that says is when you reached Seventy and a half you must start taking money out of your IRA or four one Kay what do you like it or not because I'm co sandwich start collecting taxes and there's no way to get out of that and that's one of the inflexible parts of tax deferred savings is\nYou may not want the income that year you don't have a choice you have to start taking\nSo I tell you a quick story about one of my clients who owns a chain of stores retail stores and when he came in he was sixty nine years old so he was about a year and a half away from taking out his required minimal distribution\nAnd when I sat there and did the calculation a news names Jack ass jak you're gonna have to take fifty eight thousand dollars out of that account\nAnd he looked at me and he said march asleep and then I don't need it I said well all you you gotta take that out he says mark you know what fifty eight thousand dollars will already due to my tax bracket it's going to make my tax bracket go up to the highest bracket that there is\nI said I Know that but the you the candle laid it all this all this time and if you don't take it out it's a fifty percent tax penalty you can't mess around with this\nSo this is one of the reasons why it's important that the listeners now find out a way to be able to fix this before they get into a situation where they looked like jak\nAbsolutely and let me make that even a little worse case because there are some\nPayments taxes and other things that are triggered by how much income you report for example\nYour Medicare part B premium yeah just a ... year income so every dollar that goes onto your income I eat when you're Seventy and a half you got to start taking your requirement of distributions every dollar income could force you to pay higher Medicare premiums\nThe percentage of your Social Security that his tax is affected by your overall income\nSo basically these are what I call ... taxes and I think a lot of time in the future we're going to see more and more of these cells taxes that are amounts triggered by your adjusted gross income\nSo you and your book the no compromise retirement plan\nI saw some stories in there and there was one situation with a gentleman who was kind of a younger\nWho was forty two and he was just saving as much as he could into his ... four one K. can you talk a little bit about what potential tax liability we're talking about here always said so far we've got tax liability numbers wise what are we looking at\nWell actually the younger you are the worst of it comes but when I first started looking at my own situation I realized that nobody is asking to me what the right question was and that is if you save tax deferred\nHow much additional taxes will you have to pay over your lifetime by the fact that you do for tax to begin with now for John my little sample in the book he was saving a couple of hundred thousand dollars it as a ...\nThat's how much you had a desire of as a hundred thousand and he was saving about sixteen thousand dollars a year and a four one K. and he was in a twenty five percent tax brackets by member\nWith them like I think it was a seven percent or so earnings rate on his IRA money and I developed software which will talk about later on to calculate how much is John I'm going to have to pay in taxes over his lifetime by choosing to save on attack suffered basis\nAnd again here's somebody with a two hundred thousand dollar IRA setting sixteen thousand dollars a year his total tax bill over his lifetime is going to be eight hundred and fifty thousand\nThe Atlanta area ... eight hundred seven forty nine four to eight eight eight hundred seven forty nine forty two eighty eight\n[noise] welcome back to the financial Sanford cameras sets along with mark Lloyd and mark has a special guest today Marty ruby we'll talk more about taxes\nComing up the first year in the financial symphony I Want to give you the usual number's eight hundred seven for nine four to eight age that is eight hundred seven for nine four to eight age if you prefer you can text rather than call but all you have to do is leave a message with your contact information and someone will get back with you and we also have a special\nBook offered today or this very special show with our special guest mark ... of course as known all over Atlanta and all over the country in fact\nHe has to financial maestro for the entire nation and has hurt all over the country and certainly if you are here in the Atlanta area you're fortunate because the only group Lloyd advisory services Lloyd learning center all serving you in Atlanta\nAnd we certainly would recommend that you get in touch with mark Lloyd's office he appears on Fox five Atlanta you've seen on Fox Business\nHas his OWN TV show featured in ... get finance Wall Street journal the whole bit you know if you're a regular listener to the ship\nAnd its financial symphony and one more time with the number eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight now will go back to mark Lloyd and today's special guest Marty ruby\nWe kinda use an example of a forty two year old gentleman who was saving and his four oh one K. he had about two hundred thousand dollars already saved you know but a lot of our listeners already\nHave a healthy nest egg I mean they may have a ... million dollar sitting in their portfolio and they may be older than that they may be in their sixties they may be baby boomers what do you say that people like that who has already accumulated a lot of tax suffered money all these years\nMark this was kind of the genesis of my book because a couple of years ago when I was in my mid sixties I was asking myself these questions I said it looks like I have save faithfully and today I started work after college and a four one K. I built up a substantial IRA over time through rovers and so forth\nAnd I stopped to say well what happens now as I approach at seven and a half that requirement um distribution age what am I looking at in terms of tax liability\nAnd because I cannot find any way to answer the question\nBeing an actuary I said well developed my own spreadsheet and start calculating how much tax do I have to be prepared for over my remaining lifetime I actually is a good at predicting mortality rate so I said maybe I Would have days Ninety four for next twenty four years is two years ago when I'm sixty six I took a half million dollar IRA\nAnd I said let's assume that I'm going to defer my withdrawals using the requirement of distribution they'll release them out the Irish so let me take out every year so I applied the iris tables to that\nI said let's assume that I don't spend that money I'm just going to let it reinvest it but no longer tax suffer because it's no longer the IRA\nAnd finally as we talked about before when I die whatever remaining amount or in my ... my kids are my wife will have to pay taxes on so I said let's run the numbers and so I did that for my half million dollar IRA and what I found was when I was sixty six years old\nThat my tax go over the next twenty four years in toys Ninety\nWas running about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars wow so when I first saw that number I said this can't be right I've saved I've taken the risk I've done all the work to save five hundred thousand dollars and you're telling me that most of that work has been up until now the pay Uncle Sam\nSo I went out to my CPA and a number of either a CPAs in Louisville which is where I'm from and I said this is right that I Do something wrong here they took a look like model and they said you know I never thought about this but this looks right to me\nAnd that kind of was the genesis of software that we've developed at the ... group has access to now that we've trained you and to start saying that people stop what you're doing today take a step back look at what kind of tax liability that you will likely have over your lifetime\nAnd then ask yourself is there something we can do about it\nWe believe in having different buckets of money don't have all of your eggs in one basket you need to have some long term growth out here that is in the market we realize that the greatest wealth creation to on the planet is still equities we also need to have income buckets some buckets that are safe some book is that bring the risk down\nYour total portfolio some that are maybe interest and dividends we don't have all of our eggs in one basket because the markets are changing and we need to make sure that but do diversification that we're having steady growth and not this big roller coaster you're talking about something even more advanced than that\nCorrect in fact the one diversification that almost no retirees are people close to retirement has his tax diversification\nDiversified in terms of festive rest longevity risk using annuities all kind of risk out there but they're all in mainly in the tax deferred which will eventually be taxable arena\nMy proposal was and what I've done for myself and others and what I talk about my book is to say you need another bucket in your portfolio and that has to be a tax free bucket and how do we get that\nSo there's a couple of ways to get that because people think about how they're saving today and what they don't realize is\nHow they choose to save as being driven by the IRS coat for most people don't maybe realize it but the term four one K. plan simply refers to section four one K. or the Internal Revenue code it says if you decide to save that way this is a tax consequences of what you're doing IRA similar part of the cold\nBut I realized based on my background that there was another part of the Internal Revenue code that you could also save Andrea that actually predates four one K. and that section Seventy seven oh two Seventy seven oh two okay\nNow I'm sure none of your listeners today though we're Seventy seven oh two is wrong and tell you what it is that's life insurance okay now when I say the words life insurance\nPeople say oh you know I don't want to pay the premiums my kids get all the benefits it costs too much or too old I hear all kinds of excuses and what I tell them is keep an open mind\nLet's hear the story let's examine the facts and let's see if\nUsing Saxon Seventy seven oh two cannot literally save you hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes versus what you're doing today so what I tell people is there is a product out there called index universal life how you will and it is designed by the industry specifically\nTo accumulate amounts of tax free money that could be used during the person's lifetime to generate retirement income so this is not the kind of insurance you necessarily get if all you worried about\nThere's even a big benefit to your kid\nSo this is not like buying term insurance and just having a had died and somebody inherits tax free money correct this was something more than that\nIt's actually on the exact opposite side of the spectrum okay this is generating using the advantages sects Seventy seven up to the coat generating after tax dollars in a life insurance policy that is designed to generate substantial amounts of income in the future during your retirement years tax free\nSo it's almost like a savings account that's growing inside of a life insurance policy that could be used for income down the road\nCorrect in fact that's usually what it is used for and what I talked about in my book is really not just the benefits of the tax savings of index universal life\nBut it also does have a death benefit and I don't want to ignore that because at the end of the day I mean maybe other letters or like this but as I'm getting older I think\nWhat kind of legacy am I going to leave my kids\nAnd it'd be nice leaving something a typical IRA isn't zero some kind of game every dollar you spend is one less power that you're going to leave your kids\nThe nice thing about index universal life it's double duty it'll provide substantial tax free income when you're living in an additional amount as a Dutch benefit tax free to your ears\nSo you're really taking care of two concerns\nAnd then I talked about on the show in the past where we've used life insurance as also for health care bucket\nYou know back in the day back in the early nineties you know you used to be able to get a long term care insurance policy pretty easy I mean you know speaking of underwriters and ... and and then the insurance industry in general\nI actually had people that had preexisting conditions back in the early nineties that I was able to find long term care insurance for I Would not have any chance in the world to find those people coverage today because that industry is basically the premiums have gone up\nAnd companies have gotten out of the business and today we have to look at alternatives for health care and that's one thing I'd use life insurance in the past for that long term care benefits\nSo it's kinda like what you're saying is there's actually more war benefits to that\nWe could use it for income we could use it as a tax free inheritance for our family if if heaven forbid something did happen healthcare wise we could happen to the death benefit while we're alive if it's the right time the policy so it's kind of solving more than just one problem\nIt is and that's why I think people have got to get over any bias they have traditionally thing about life insurance and think about what attributes can life insurance deliver the other financial instruments can't and that's why I say it's not going to be a hundred\nI factor in inflation we know we're not going to be saving anymore so I ... I got to see if that nest egg that we've accumulated is enough not only to get us through retirement but Dennis through early retirement\nWe've also got a stress test the portfolios we've got to make sure that the portfolios are sitting here with the astronomical amount of risk\nThe worst thing that could happen Ron the worst thing that could happen to Greg or anybody in this situation is that right when you decide to pull the trigger and retire\nThe market has a twenty thirty percent forty percent it out\nAnd it goes down the U.S locking in law says that you may not get back because you're not making any more contributions to the portfolio you're living off of the income you're spending the money so every time you cash a check with the market down you've locked in a law that you'd never get back\nAnd when I can sit there and show you example after example after example of just taking the last crashed we had two thousand and eight and showing you that if you're retired right before the crash it\nAnd then you didn't do anything to manager risk this look how fast the money goes if you're drawing out at you know twenty thirty forty thousand dollars a year to supplement your income\nThat's what we do and we plug these numbers into our software into our system and people that are getting ready for retirement I really feel like round they appreciate how much time we put into preparing their plan and showing it to them and black and white\nAnd it doesn't cost them one red cent\nWe've been doing this for over a quarter of a century we've been doing this long enough to where I don't have the nickel and dime people if I show you that you can retire when you want to retire and I tell you how to do it\nAll I'm asking is if you need some help consider using our from\nIf you don't need help from us refer somebody to us as how we've built our business and that's how frankly that's that's why I'm On this planet today in this season of my life to fifty six years old this is why I Do what I Do because I have a passion for helping folks\nBut you know I only can help people when they want help so it's real simple you can pick up the phone and for all callers who call in the next Fifteen minutes\nThe financial roadmap review it's a plan that we call the financial road map that shows you a picture of your financial situation will let you know what we think you should be doing based on your goals the second is a portfolio stress test\nAnd the third thing we'll do the will get you a retirement income plan that projects whether you're OK and retirement based on how much you've saved the date take us up on this offer again for all color if you call in the next Fifteen minutes\nThat have two hundred and fifty thousand dollar save for retirement give us a call one eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight will get the financial roadmap review absolutely complementary and one of our neighborhood offices it's a tremendous value one eight hundred seven for nine\nFour to eight eight that's one eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight I look forward helping you\nEight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nMark ... of course as we told you so many times before his produce sharing that means he has your best interests at heart you're not going to get a sales pitch and not getting any high pressure just come in for a casual conversation and you're going to find out a lot about your own portfolio\nYour life you could talk about your hopes and dreams and mark and help you achieve them eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nTalk about your retirement eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight\nMarkets been a pleasure being with you today on\nThe show oh a pleasure being with you as well and we look forward to each and every one of you who needs help but give us a call and we look forward to hear from you again next weekend right here on the financial suddenly radio\nIs illustrative purposes only and just not constitute tax investments or legal advice always consult with a qualified investment legal attacks\n... before taking any action\nThe proceeding programs paid for by Boyd advisor services L.

devastation like that right but I Would think that there's a lot a scab and you're like hey you know what I mean\nI mean the calm and you know like I Would think there's a lot of stuff that they're just going to get rid of it won't go shirts just covered in a you know as far as you know people that were coming through other people's you know I don't know if it's garbage you know but maybe three\nYeah you know if it's on the street if it's you know something got washed down the street and you find a\nYou know some ... a lot of trouble or something like that on the in the middle of the

above their heads for an animal's\n[laughter] wow yeah wow that's a good at it but it's it's it's still\nI was just reading an article yesterday it's still a problem down in Florida there you know people going in stealing other people's stuff and you're bringing relief I'm no water not caring and people are still in that too you know and that's the problem is\nYou stretch your a law enforcement and your first responders so thin that there's not enough even with National Guard troops\nAre they all started under a ... a matter of fact that I Believe I haven't checked later but I Believe the world started under Obama\nHeld a frequent on right hand just white guy on the Internet with a you know or Al Gore started the Internet yeah\nYeah yeah well you know I I have to say though when I go er started that if you remember he was running against Bush and Bush came back with a straight answer on that he said well if he started Internet why did he make it started off with WWW\n[laughter] exactly [laughter] my dad in the plane or a good area\nOh by the way it learned it later on Jerry I'm going to have a story about a a\nA school superintendent who became a police officer so she could carry a gun and protect her kids at school\nI'm I've read that story I think it's great\nI voted at once you get to that last week but we had so much other stuff but it's a great story\nAnd I still I still do not know Jerry why school system here in Georgia have not taken advantage of the state law and allowed their administrators and die and whoever else in your school systems to be armed to better protect the kids\nI I think they're just basically afraid I think\nThere's a you know it it takes a lot to get some time to to march to a different from shore and we've been marks in that same drum all along and you know we've got to believe it is three that are that said they would do it plus there's a there's one or two more that I've been doing it on their own without it it's a little bit different programs\nThat will be going home yeah without being sanctioned by the county yeah but then there was this ...\nPrimary there's some private schools to that it will soon we'll probably next to a two or three years you proceed that expand quite a bit a little surprise me if it doesn't\n... it let me let me ask you your\n[laughter] God Forbid God Forbid Stacey Abrams gets in God Forbid she gets in as as governor what would that do what would that do to\nAll of the things that you have your you and your group George carry dot org have been able to accomplish over the years ... how\nHow far would that set us back has gone out here in Georgia\nYeah that all depends on who she brings along with her if she can bring enough which I don't believe she can if you bring up people to take over the house no then uh she could stop is\nThe only thing that'll do basically is is if we if we maintain that say we as Republicans not George ... rice although Vincent ... says that we own the general assembly down there and I\nHaven't seen the title of it but [laughter] [noise]\nBut uh as long as as the house of representatives stays in the same uh are similar mix as long as they're in control of the house right or she is not going to be able to do anything really to hurt us because you know you've been pitched both chambers to\nShore pass a bill so as long as we have one or both chambers of which were there in good with boats and brick right now we have those on our side it really doesn't matter the only thing that it would do is it was slowest down for at least four years ...\nUntil the next governor comes along our at possibly eight years\nBut right now she can't really you know she can she can holler gun control all she wants to but she really can't enforce any gun control because she doesn't have the power to do that yeah the only power she has the power to beat the bill that we would put her\nIn a jury I I haven't looked this up and I just think it's just a you know kind of people on\nTop of my head how many how many of the house seats are open this year in the mid term elections [noise]\nI don't know how many there are but I don't know when I understand yeah there were a well my understanding is\nThere's about courteous are that\nAre that are possibly\nIn um\nIn in a close race guy and all those I've been told that they're really and truly only\nFive seats that are uh that are that could possibly flip so uh I I Know that the speaker of the house had been out a working for all those people trying to get them re elected as I Know that\nMany of the representatives have been going around as well and the guy in a while so you see a when a camp when Brian campus making his speeches that most of the time there's going to be a state representative out of state senator exactly to be with the\n... and I just don't think that that a\nProblem when we try to vote people out of the office out of office stitches\nAs representatives or senators is or at least in the state you got to have people you're going to have a majority of people in the district that they're serving in order to get rid of them right in Ninety five percent of people make a gift one representative but it's only ten percent of live in his district is not going to hurt yeah true very true\nSo so you know a lot a whole lot idiosyncrasies them and doing that and I think it's very important to the fact that the Republican or retain control of the house because we're coming up short on redistricting\nUh hair and ... lead that we need to make sure that the that Republicans are still in control or will be back all gerrymandered districts that\nWe can have a black girl minority or whatever\nCriteria they want to say exactly what will be said for that that's why we have one district did have one just looked like we I Wonder if the grants from like when that count county down to a\nAlmost a savannah but when it was just an Arab place known enough votes or if they could get a representative right basically that they wanted and then of course\nOnce that's done is that that are still got to pass a smell test for the\nUh through the uh um proof federal government out make sure that that we haven't done any discrimination so that's a big process but it's a process that's going to work a whole lot better for for me and you do not least if the Republicans are in control exactly\nWhy but it's actually today than it is it is but a home if you have any and everything else going on please please give us a call\nI'll do it and I I hate to tell you this but I cannot make the party down there\nWhat the hell have you know what I'm saying I Am so far you aren't you\nKnow no no no no I'm a I'm going to a large meeting\nAt night or a waiting better but I'm not a A R I or I hate to miss a lot of meetings so well fine unless unless when I get out\nIf they haven't called race in the snow clothes have time to get done on it but it's not to be nine o'clock\nWon't get down there or later\nHopefully hopefully it will will be there long before they call it ... yeah\nIt's normally under like\nThe like they did with it [noise] yeah exactly and the
