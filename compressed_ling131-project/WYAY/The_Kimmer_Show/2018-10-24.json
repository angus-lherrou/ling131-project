... they're going to be looking at a at the makeup of the device that can\nBe has the wires used every all the components that make up the device they're going to be looking for a fingerprint they're going to be looking for any DNA um any any trace evidence that's inside of the package\nYou know I was I was I was I'm going to get your calls yesterday I was telling you about the Unabomber and that he had said a manifesto to the New York times and we thought that you'd be sending one possibly to the Washington Post so my partner on the FBI joint terrorism task force of the time we went down\nTo ah to to talk to 'em the publisher of the Washington Post and uh uh we wanted to talk to his mail room people on what to do if they did receive what they thought could be um a manifesto or any kind of suspicious package\nAnd um we're waiting for the mayor of people to come back and we were down there and it I mean the mail room at the Washington Post building was this huge and I'm I'm looking I'm just kind of looking over everything and I see I see a an envelope but thick envelope\nAnd was it was a label on it are typewritten label and I went wow that looks kind of from it so I put my I put my uh gloves on move some of the bailout of the way and sure enough there was the manifesto\nSo I went out to a went up to the went up to the cruiser went up to my car and we got a little uh it's called the golden X ray portable x-ray machine set it up there with X ray to just to make sure there was no explosive devices or anything inside of it and do it just showed them staples and uh so we asked we asked what was your well\nThis is the first package that we have that has not been open the one in New York said that still has trace evidence and everything inside there that could just be a\nYou know a a a treasure trove of trace evidence so\nWe got one of their attorneys for the Washington Post and at the time the lab was right downtown in the end at the at the FBI ability we went down there they opened up the package underneath a forensic could which captured all traced of all trace evidence anything else\nWe made copies of it for them we gave it back to them didn't care what was in the content of it we just wanted the package for evidence re value\nAnd turn it back over to them and we actually did get some great trace evidence we were able to trace back to the cabin of uh of Ted Kaczynski I'm and with some dog hairs and some fibers from a blanket that he used there and the cabin\nSo that was a that was that was a pretty good find in my part it real happy with that I Would

else trying to blame that\nTrying to blame that on a on you know these packages on Trump\n... not ... to me it is something that I call it in there it is it's like the movie wag the dog that they got

NYPD bomb squad\nThey're dealing with the the package at CNN then they had to deal with the package at a a governor Cuomo's office and uh it it\nIt's interesting during the press or I saw in the background you saw somebody from uh the New York state police in your your you'll see New York state police very often in New York I'm In New York city\nYeah you know around the state because the state house for a New York is in Albany and they're showing 'em a picture of what the\nPackages and one of the packages looks like and it's to John Brennan Time Warner building I'm a ten Columbus Circle what was the return address\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz so that was my turn to dress on that one as well yeah but it's [laughter] it said instead of Florida he put F. L. D. O. R. I. S. 'cause as\nKids next to the ... [laughter] yeah when you get that little red line right and that means just felt something wrong you got to write quake it'll tell you the right way to do it [laughter]\nYeah and and there it is you've got a you've got um six postage stamps and or or you see\nWhere they cut the like you see where they cut the package to get into it see how they got around to see and that's that's that's the way at the X. ray at you you what they did and it shows the envelope it looks like they did they cut it or is that just the frame of\nThose are fun huh that's all the stuff\nThat ... yeah yeah he's not sorry there's no cancellation do cancellation mark on the stamp set\nHuh some something is not making sense now here Blatter Jamie ought to\nCall me any money you know why do sometimes you'll put it on to reverse side of that you know you have to put it on this thing I Know that I Can't use the same thing but I haven't seen him\nBefore on science ... but with those dams they'd put tape over the stances well now but you can ... I Wonder if those are owned or if they're looked stamps or are they self and he's of stamps\nI don't think they make stamps anymore do they I don't think so a damn um but the idea of the cancellation of the stamp is to keep you from being able to cut those off in tape them onto another envelope and reuse postage\nSomething's not adding up here Brooke see there's no way that pipe bomb sit in that little package either\nNow that's a I'm Sorry I was looking up all of a sudden the market today [laughter] hey let me tell you something you're not getting this kind of information and more aware number one brother man ah yeah that was that I Know they had to evacuate the building\nYeah [laughter] but um\nThey ... they ... they had a shelter in place for part of the time Warner center they evacuated other parts that shelter in place has been lifted now as well\nBut um yeah it it that device that they showed that looks like it was it to to detect any kind of looked like one of the sniffer testers that day would put into the into the package\nTo test what's inside before they would go any further\nI what I'm what I'm describing focuses on CNN they were showing a picture of the envelope along with a little device that was long side that looks like one of the a bomb techs or someone may have taken a picture of and it looks like one of the\nYou heard at first here although my Brooke shows the new talk one of six seven\nThat suspicious package was being sent\nTo California a representative Maxine Waters so that's another one no the one cent to representative Maxine Waters so that's a golly day that's\nSoros\nHillary ozone ... bomber holder Brennan\nCNN yeah the un and Maxine Waters closer than Cuomo DOMA that they ate such a\n[noise] twenty three twenty four five six twenty seven\nHang on the ... the days yo yo yo yo [laughter] that that isn't that the truth\nThis reminds me what was\nIt eighties or was it the eighties or nineties when all the anthrax that was the uh that was the nineties and ... I mean there was a tone in one yeah you know\nReal short period of time right yeah\nCause I handled it one time 'cause I was I was one of the uh one of the people that actually was put on the suit and go in and get it when I was assigned\nTo the has mature response unit with the the washing filled all used to handling suspicious packages are yes\nYes sir [laughter] besides my own um\nYeah we had I had at one time we had a five\nSuspected in one day in D.C who just got brought up to the states that has to use a Walker\nA Hillary there\nSome I sit down with the uh the press room at the White House well it's she's up on the platform where Trump's going to be but I don't know who she is\nI let me let me try to take a couple of these calls here before a but if I have to interrupt you and cut you off is because I Want to bring you President Trump he's expected at any moment there at the White House\nTo ah to talk to every one alive I mean this is you know\nEight eight suspicious packages\nAre within the last two days that ah that is in credible notice NICE Road on\nHey yeah I think it's also credible that eight bombs you know smart enough ... wind will get through you know I think the point is I heard somebody I don't think they probably only go work\nWell I I Know ... Dennis I you know there I from what I'm hearing the days were live devices that are that were capable of of of doing damage but uh when you send them to different places that have\nA very very strict protocol when it comes to screen of packages of course the secret service\nThey're going to have off sites for um you know for any former president or any former first lady they're going to have it all sides ... just like the White House does so that's why they do catch him because they they have protocols in place\nWe just got a message on Facebook from one of our listeners that is a retired postal employee who says if any part of the stamp is even partially covered with with tape\nIt is invalid Huh Interesting so I Wonder how that package ended up making it all the way I don't I don't know\nI mean it it why would you why would you to send it to watch the show to get the whole I mean it just it seems like you said more names out there like a slight both old show more targets on one white cat yeah or damage that way\nWell I've seen God I've seen packages sent to\nYou know in care of someone um you know and at a number of different places I Know we had a\nAt one time when I was when I was working we had a number of suspicious packages sent to um abortion clinics at one particular time\nAnd I mean we have and we had another one cent to um the home of or the CIA director and I mean it just you know where it's just it's just crazy we we had saw a number of different places that receive packages during during certain times\nAre they surprised if nobody gets hurt I mean that the you know I don't know I just like it like a more multi profit fact the one with their throat\nYeah well that see that that that okay thank you\nBut um but then it makes a good point I mean even when I had the the letter bomb\nPackages they said five they said by the Ohio at office in D.C I handled I hit her all five but [laughter]\n\nYou know to write that down your little book you bastard I handled five packages\nThat particular day and a yesterday\nHe think he was so funny that you know you just think he's just like\nSo it's like a fire alarm going up in the middle of the debate breath you can make\nThat up [laughter] and the first thing I did with pickup devoted blow you so are you watching this you know yeah I Know\nAnd then you had to fire wearing gloves or shall we shall see if we did what did he was talking to the dumpster fire to head of the head of the Democratic bored [laughter]\nOh what a\nWhere where are we here we yeah okay I just didn't know where OK flyers what up\nAlthough you sound like you're pretty popular folder with all the baggage handling\nA [laughter]\nHandle many phases packet here going to really have to wait at all I could\nYou got a line that you got the nerve to come all radio and tell everybody that that's that's pretty bald [laughter] well look this is this being\nAlone with all along with my Powerball you know if you\nGo to say this is the spin to get to solve the migration thing down there and there's also to draw sympathy for the ballot layoffs\nAnd how they've been pushing me you know going out and getting in people's faces look at who we are seeing the bombs every one of these people were tied to the deep state every one oh oh yeah the ... including CNN because they're just the propaganda or for the deep state\nYeah it's uh I'm waiting to hear a you know another media outlet receiving something it wouldn't it wouldn't surprise me let me just you know tell you what surprised and that's why they say they think\nWe're that stupid or that the whole day we can we'll we don't see what they're really doing yeah long as\nThe ...
