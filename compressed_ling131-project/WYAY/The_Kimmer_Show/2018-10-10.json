expecting our greatest impacts overnight into tomorrow morning I'm so I'm I'm headed into Fox five I'm at one o'clock in the morning to do a hand off\nI'm In between shifts so that we have a meteorologist on site\nUm all night long got passed on information\nSo right now it looks like it said uh they said National Weather service says a land owns edited and so I mean that's at any moment now so as it passes through it looks like it's now category for almost a category five\nAnd a 'cause we were I think originally were the last couple of days we've been talking to me a category three and it looks like and hearing Brock Long give a briefing President Trump and the oval office it sounded as if when it hits Georgia it could be a category one possibly category to what's the latest yeah\nYeah definitely um so what is the latest information I'm literally have the national weather service chat up in front of me and the newest information that we just got a hundred and Nineteen mile per hour wind gusts\nConfirmed that the air force base in between Mexico beach and Panama City now I Am far I'm In one thing that\nUm is going to be um just essential for the information we gather air force bases are equipped\nWith all the weather technology that we need to um\nCollect you know vital information in real time data right so we're going to see\nThe true force of this storm in real time because of where it's making landfall\nWhile in addition to that the eye or editor uh she's made the outer edge of the ... which is the wall yup is has moved on shore in the eye now is moving onshore so we're going to see the when the air force base go from a hundred and twenty plus\nTwo dead calm here any moment as the eye moves on shore wow I'm\nSo we are it's imminent that land fall is going to happen probably when I'm On the phone with you again on a chat will tell me um life here on the air so um that's what I'm looking at as far as the Florida impacts and what's happening there right now but as you mentioned a state of emergency was extended\nAh I think to a hundred and eight counties now right\nUm the tropical storm warning not just to watch a warning was extended into ups and county I'm In out towards Putnam county as well so are far south eastern counties are now included in the tropical storm warning and that means tropical storm force\nWinds are possible uh which was basically what I said yesterday on air you know south right east is where we're anticipating I'm the greatest impacts and I still think that rainfall totals\nThat's probably going to be on the higher side what we were talking about yesterday or because you're um we're going to see the rain move in later this evening a little bit sooner than when I was in just a painting yesterday right that also means is going to exit a little bit sooner as well\nBut it's going to um because it's moving a little bit faster\nThat means that um will get those are the bands will be more organized which can produce those torrential tropical downpours and a little bit stronger wind as well but for the Atlanta area confidence is still very high um that our greatest impact will be the rain\nAnd wind gust between twenty and thirty five miles per hour since we are not included in the tropical storm warning\nWell that's that's good at least that I mean that's you know twenty twenty five miles an hour still significant but not or what it could be\nAnd and you know that that's going to go on for a couple of hours so tonight when everyone is sleeping you might lose some power also makes sure your mobile devices are charged in case you're you do lose power your house\nUm that's still a likely thing from top to bottom across the whole state or a ... yeah I guess that's the whole state I
