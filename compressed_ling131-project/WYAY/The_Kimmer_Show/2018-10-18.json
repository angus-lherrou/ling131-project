yeah yeah a little bit yes yeah I'm not a lot of\n... so maybe it is it still is still out or do that\nThat's better that's better maybe had to yeah go ahead\nYeah I just I just had a question you know uh\nI I Do that for St Louis is acceptable at all but but you know something like I've never really lived in a\n... you know an area where the hits suffers something kind of devastation like that right but I Would think that there's a lot of scavenger type people you know what I mean I mean they come and you know like with thick there's a lot of stuff that they're just going to get rid of it blows insurance is covered in\nA you know as far as you know people that were on ... through other people's you know I don't know if it ... you know but maybe three\nYeah you know if it's on the street if it's you know something got washed down the street and you find a you know some ... a lot of trouble or something like that on the in the middle of the street and you know it does do is ended its maybe if it's perishable yeah you can go and pick it up but if you have a business and you still have a the building still intact\nAnd you come inside that building number one that's a burger you know if you're in a few owners there and you come in there that's a burglary up most places it's a you know burger in first grade and that if you're inside you you have every right to shoot a litter coming in there\nRight yeah I I say that yeah you know as far as as far as the loners do what do they you know I'm a little hills so like they just show up in a truck or something I mean and they just start loan stuff that I mean how does it work\nYes sometimes that's the way it goes I mean you you look I mean during storms during riots anything else yeah that's that's a lot of times what happens you'll see somebody pull up and you know you'll see a mob\nLooting or a dollar store or a a a a shoe store Nike store you know they're running out of there was boxes and stuff yeah I mean that's exactly what\nThey normally reserved her train as they were breaking the windows or the electronic stores and walking through the flood waters you know she has deep water with stolen TVs above their heads for\nAnimals [laughter] wow yeah wow now that's a good at it but it's it's it's still\nI Would just read an article yesterday it's still a problem down in Florida there you know people going stealing other people's stuff and they're bringing relief\nI'm no water not going to make and people are still in that too you know and that's the problem is you stretch your a law enforcement and your first responders so thin that there's not enough even with National Guard troops that have been active and you know that have been activated for this\nThere's not enough to protect all of the assets there and that's why\nI find out why they do it as a there is there's no way I'm going to get caught a goat it whenever I watch yeah here you go yeah yeah that's awful\nSo we're going to come down and joined us on the on the election I\nAlso got a problem right now I live in downtown Atlanta I live in Atlanta bought by I have a post office box where I have all by mail that and I had like that for years yeah and\nThat's where my life that a license to address\nThis like post office box I like you know I Lived in laws will be All right uh residents was well I always voted it was all the time well I think they looked at my age but my I eat it that much I enjoy it\nYou know what I mean yeah we're going as well\nJust go up at our old go up to your old precinct and vote and then get your hands down to big tax at six o'clock that so you know it's I\nI don't know I don't think there's a registration card that said I just stood there or you know just thinking out but like I was like that that that\nDoesn't make any of you got if you got\nOn your voter registration card it'll have the date of a when a voter registration card has issued I was just looking at my uh and my friends the other day she came to her new one came to my house and it's in in the new day yeah all they do is take that new date and if your name and a date of birth match up with that would match up with your rights\nAlong and you know we've got to believe it is three that are that said they would do it plus there's a there's one or two more that I've been doing it on their own without it's a little bit different program\nWithout being angry at home yeah without being sanctioned ... county yeah but then there was a ...\nThere's some private schools to another club in the next to a two or three years you proceed that expand quite a bit a little surprise me if it doesn't\nIt let me let me I mean if you're\n[laughter] God Forbid God Forbid Stacey Abrams gets and\nGod Forbid she gets in as as governor what would that do what would that do to all of the things that you had your you and your group George carry dot org had been able to accomplish over the years ... how\nHow far would that set us back as going on here in Georgia\nYeah that all depends on who she brings along with her if she can bring enough which I don't believe she can if you bring enough people to take over the house now then uh she could stop is\nThe only thing that'll do basically is if we if we maintain and I say we as Republicans not George cure rice although Vincent ... says that we own the general assembly down there and I\nHaven't seen the title of it but [laughter]\nBut uh as long as as the house of representatives they are in the same uh are similar mix as long as they're in control of the house right uh she's not going to be able to do anything really to hurt us because you know you've been pitched both chambers too\nShort pass a bill so as long as we have one or both chambers of which were there and good with both ... now they have those on our side\nIt really doesn't matter the only thing that it would do is it will slow us down for at least four years ... until the next governor comes along our at possibly eight years but right now she can't really\nYou know she can she can holler gun control all she wants to but she really can't enforce any gun control because she doesn't have the power to do that yeah the only power she has the power to beat to build that we would put her\nYou know Jerry I I haven't looked this up and I'm just thinking of just um you know\nKind of spit ball top of my head how many how many of the house seats are open this year in the mid term elections\nI don't know how many there are times when I understand yeah there were a where my understanding is there's about\n... uh that\nUh that are possibly in um\nIn in a close race ... those I've been told that they are really and truly only\nFive states that are are that are that could possibly flip so uh I I Know that the speaker of the house have been out a working through all those people trying to get them re elected I Know that many of the representatives have been going around as well and the guy in a while so you see a\nWhen a camp were burned campus making his speeches but most of the time there's gonna be a state representative out of state senator exactly to be with him and I just don't think that that a\nProblem we were trying to vote people out of the ... changed as representative or senators is but at least in the state you got to have\nPeople you're going to have a majority of people in the district that they're surfing in order to get rid of them right in Ninety five percent of people make your gift oil represented but it's only ten percent of them live in his district is not going to hurt got true very true\nSo so you know a lot of quality audio cinco sees them and doing that and I think it's very important to the fact that the Republican\nOr retain control of the house because we're coming up short on redistricting\nUh ... lead\nThat we need to make sure that the Republicans are still in control or will be back to O. J. mentored a district status\nOr we can have a black girl minority or whatever the\nCriteria they want to sit exact will be said for that that's why we have one desperately needed help on just a ... where one district grants from Michael in ... county down to a almost to savannah but when it was just the mere replace knowing enough votes to get a representative right basically that they want it and\nThen of course once that's done is that that are still got to pass the smell test for the a crew the\nProof federal government out make sure that that we haven't done any discrimination so that's a big process but it's a process that's going to work a whole lot better for for me and you do not least if the Republicans were in control\nExactly oh buddy ... today than it is it is but a home if you have any and everything else going on please please give us a call\nI'll do it and I I hate to tell you this but I cannot make the party down their\nWhat their hail ... party aren't you\nKnow no
