reasonable suspicion that the person has committed is committing or is about to commit a crime and has a reasonable belief\nThat the person may be armed imprisoned leak dangerous that is what the Terry stop is all about\nOkay well I just don't want to give the policemen a bad name because I Love policemen\nHope no but that's what I'm saying though that you that's why that's where the whole
