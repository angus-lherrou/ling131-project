forward to this is well what is it by the time in Washington DC\nWhen it was very very young officer\nI was assigned to a foot beat on a Saturday afternoon working three to eleven downtown DC and uh it was raining so before I left the station I made sure I had my raincoat on and uh instead of might solve tat\nI put on my scooter my my motorcycle helmet because it was supposed to rain harder and when you're walking a foot beat\nIt it's more comfortable with a helmet on in the rain with your long raincoat walking a foot beat three to eleven PM [noise]\nSo I got a ride down with one of the beat officers who uh this got eighty two and drop me off at a sixteenth on K Street my foot beat was fourteen to sixteen [noise]\n\nPennsylvania to el soldier Saturday So there weren't many businesses open so I'm walking down the street\n[noise] well the night before I go into a restaurant this is like an all you can eat seafood restaurant Chesapeake Bay seafood house [laughter] and they serve corn muffins as well\nAs well I guess the corn muffins kind of gave me a little diarrhea\nSo I'm walking down my walking my foot in the military manner and all of a sudden\n... more oil\nThan do my dumb and dumber stomach started growling and so the closest bathroom was about two blocks away two and a half blocks away so I'm walking down picking up my pace a little bit down ... street\nAnd starts again Demick was grumbling that all of a sudden I have two pool and I have to ... now so\nI started to a little bit of a jog [noise]\nGo a little bit faster and got my Sam Brown belt on over my regular belt with my uniform pad so I started on doing my keepers that holds the\nMy gun belt to read my my regular built around my pads so I'm always been a full sprint now I'm going oh God please let\nMe make it please let me make it to the bathroom\nSo running down the street now in pouring down rain\nIn full strike and I get to the hotel which is right [laughter] right into fourteen hundred blocking K Street on the south side and I wrote in and I know the men's room is up on the second floor to keep a lot so I get there\nAnd I and I I think the key said oh no it's open so I run up there the doors locked I run back down [noise] grab the key I'm going back up the steps again as\nI put my parents\nSo I go into the bathroom and I I take\nI take my raincoat off I've got my uniform shirt on my bed at the same rate cut that sitting on the chair that Christians say no no no this was my [laughter] but I use that [noise] so I take my raincoat off and upstate in the bathroom because I very gingerly\nTake my pants often I'm standing there naked from the waist down just my uniform shirt by my my motorcycle helmet and combat boots [noise]\nMy gun ballad hung in a store and I'm taking my underwear down gently to try to throw it away I'm gonna I'm gonna be going commando the rest of the day so I'm clear to myself up in the sink I forgot to lock the door and in walks a man and just said
