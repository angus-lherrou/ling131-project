good at the yeah the Sandy Springs location and when I got there is about ... thirty second early launch yeah as probably about ... people there and then uh um our way out I was ... over a hundred and fifty why\nAre so people are showing up and uh and it was a really nice spot because they had a special seating area for elderly and a disabled so you know that way they are comfortable but one of the lady who was in line with she tried to go Monday and she said the way was almost two hours\nAhead that'd be will be [laughter]\nYeah they are getting out there and uh you know being in Fulton County to really kind of go out there and and make sure your vote\nAbsolutely ... enough to think about it though David the larger that long right now I imagine what they're going to be when election day rolls around\nOh yeah yeah I Know during the presidential election I'm like I said I live downtown and the way there people are saying it was like six hours you could see just wrapping around the block and there was just out of small library location she\nUh uh if you're a ... area is out of church and in and out that one they have the ... so organized a it's it's really nice interest uh so yeah definitely try that one I was there for the presidential one and it was a set up well\nWell well it's good to hear about a British it yeah I Know that you know already\nThere's hope you hope you vote for him that's what I'm saying so I'll tell you about a\nNancy Pelosi well she is\nVery confidence that Democrats are we take the house\nNext month's midterms\nYeah because you know she stands to become the speaker different party captures the or the house and uh she was talking all they're already talking about things they want to do lower in health care costs spearheading a national infrastructure plan\nPushing for changes to campaign finance laws yeah well they may once you make it that uh that you can't campaign outside your own state when you're running for governor\nAnd you can't take it a I'm a you know Kim Zetter campaign rally in D.C today I don't know I Know I mean but see\nThat money I don't care if you get money from your party from the DNC the RMC I'm all for that okay\nBut I'm not I'm Talking about money from George Soros I'm Talking about getting money from San Francisco you don't see Brian Kemp up in uh San Francisco California getting money this is all Republican based\nI don't mind that\nBecause the a GOP they raised a lot of money for different candidates but below sea\nA lot of them begin on the national mall ordeal lips and for people don't know where the ellipse is the ellipse has that little circular\nArea\nBack behind the White House they restricted part of that now but it's you there and also in the mall the mall runs between the Lincoln Memorial to the west and the U.S Capitol to the east with the\nExcuse me with the Washington Monument right dead square in the middle\nAlong with the uh reflecting bull so the ball you know but the mole is considered that whole area there and ah\nI personally I don't think it's a bad idea because the amount of money that the department of interior who oversees all the parts in Washington\nDC and most of the other federal parts around the United states you know you're so many uh need a name of bark and it's run by the United states Park Service which is under the U.S department of interior\nBut the proposed plan\nCould shrink a significant portion of the sidewalk outside the White House that is accessible to protest friends leaving basically a five foot sliver\n[laughter] you know now\nCitizens were allowed to comment on this and they and they closed the comments on the I think this past Monday\nBut they receive thousands of comments because again the Park Service is only exploring the idea of doing this now outside the White House ... people might not real realizes but you've got the White House and many of you who have been there\nYou've got Pennsylvania avenues it runs right down right in front but they\nBlocked off Pennsylvania Avenue from fifteenth street all the way the seventeenth street they closed that to vehicles back into was in Ninety seven I think Nineteen Ninety seven\nYeah I I haven't been there since since it's been closed off yeah Nineteen Ninety seven is when is when they closed that off because I was still\nThere and I read it and you know ... before that\nThe demonstrations you could come right down right down Pennsylvania Avenue and you're right there\nI told you when when we went when I was a kid we were walking around the White House and we saw run an an sink drinking coffee on the balcony yeah and their bathrobes oh yeah you can see that even if you can see it from the sidewalk from eighth street right there and he was just nice it's could be the wave to people yup\nAnd job so\nI mean people don't realize you've got the White House let's say you've got the fence and then the sidewalk in front of the White House that is the jurisdiction\nOf the U.S park police which comes under the department of interior ... us Park Service\nThan the street is the jurisdiction of the D.C police department ... department what about\nWhat about the other side of the wrought iron fence\nWell the other side of the wrought iron fence or the grass or the White House that comes under United States Secret Service\nThat's three jurisdictions in fifty feet yeah but then you across Pennsylvania Avenue and go into Lafayette Park\nThat's back to us park police that's yeah so whenever we have a demonstration we'd all be down there and it always every I at least wants to at least at least once a week\nSo\nI mean if the amount of money in overtime that it takes to work all these demonstrations and and to and again us Park Service they want every one to be able to exercise their First Amendment or that they're not trying to to cut that down\nAt all\nBut it's you know the burdensome fees some people are ... are saying that requiring these burdensome fees will dissuade Americans from demonstrate or the new rule is not reflective of American values or history of people to be peaceful protest\nBut there's there's a couple of other things to consider as well and we're talking about ... I'll be taking your calls and uh\nThere was some black senior citizens well they were ordered off a bus\nYou know to us and it has to do with black votes Matt\nAll that coming up with somebody broke show to talk what else except\nThe humor show\nSomebody noticed through the looking through our door of our studio they saw the Trump than er than we are so offended they took pictures of it and complained about it to our management so\nThey came to us to tell us to take down our sign some people in there weren't even looking for us they weren't even looking at our station so they made us take it down so that visitors to another radio station we're not offended by the name from how about standing up for something once\nAnd new talk one of six seven wearing leather films to talk\nHi I'm David Nicholas president Nicholas wealth management and host of the protecting your retirement radio show which airs Saturdays right here on the new talk one of six seven I think we can all agree that the stock market has done amazing over the past few years but let's say you plan to retire and the next few years you can't imagine living through another stock market crash\nLike two thousand and two thousand ain't all over again so\nHow can you move into the next chapter of your life and make sure that your hard earn retirement money won't be wiped out if the bubble burst and Nicholas wealth management we can help their strategies that can help protect a portion of your retirement money from stock market losses while helping you achieve a reasonable rate of return so give us a call\nFor all for eight nine zero five six zero six or visit Nicholas wealth\nDot com that's Nicholas wells dot com\nSecurities offered through DC and security thing member of finger on S.
