I I don't know if I misunderstood you weren't you talking about the guy Colorado to kill the Stanley earlier yeah what do you yes based you oughta Lola humanely they gave me the needle and let me do it myself\nWell you know they they're saying now that he was having an affair with some girl at work\nAnd ... and apparently he asked his wife for a separation and then we're assuming that's what started some kind of a fight and that's when the police believe me just killed her and it but I I don't understand any I don't I don't know how you can kill a four year old and thirty thirty three year old your own daughters\nStir especially if he strangled others bare hands are I mean I just God I Can't I Can't imagine Colorado\nAnd the death penalty or we know\nI don't you know I'm not sure I I used to they used to have the firing squad Gary ... thank you I got to do if I\nIf I'm not mistaken he wasn't very well maybe that was Utah\nThey might have been Utah to say that I think what is your toe in his firing squad and yeah I don't know where the Colorado has the death penalty I'd\nI don't know but this I mean that's not good enough for this guy I mean to me the woman he was having an affair with only ... family over you know I Believe is reinstated in Nineteen Seventy four\nOkay there you go well good\n'cause he certainly qualifies for death by avalanche and you're right the ski slopes he's he now he's claiming that he came home to find one of his daughters dead and the other one being strangled by his wife and that's why he snapped in a fit of rage and killed his wife\nAnd revenge of the prosecutors aren't buying that but that's a record anyway I mean he just thinking about it I just can't imagine how you could kill your own three and four year old daughter's three thirty one\nUzbek allies coming up hold on here's Ryan on TALK of suggesting home Ryan how's it going\nPretty good so along with I can listen to dream every so often but sometimes to all suffer

scared him I don't think you're in the closet [laughter]\nNot\nNot you're on a big\n... and now than\nIt was like those used to have ... they used to have an old circus act where the guy would get up

at kind of a nasty editor once in a while it was dry drove into the public struck by a parking like the other day and I see this kid pushing like thirty shopping carts and said hey you know somebody else may want to use one of those [laughter]\nFinally [laughter] you know my letters or friend Jamie decided to walk to the end of the world to prove it's flat proven you and me and he came around came around the only thing a flat earth or is that the fear is fear itself fear fear that senator Yee oh\nGod the Oregon we may\nIt's over the camera show when we play [laughter]\nThose dot our most illicit or a replay of of the cameras show or why not what the hell else so I got to do [laughter] we used to give her as a job three to six [laughter] every afternoon Newt talk ...\nThis is the rubber now shock this Bush you know by show is brought you by Democrat attorney general nominee Keith Allison Keyes beat his opponent so badly I figured it had to be a woman that had beer in the show host to Kim an hour hourly tribute\nTo the British show here on the news on one of those seven we know where to butter I've read in your Charles and\nCharles or you\nKnow well they have they have no radio\n\n\nLaw here we\nHad some time we\nDo use music radio or the you know they have\nWhen I\nOh\n\nVote I see you already have\n\nLaw law usually\nOh\nWith me what you mean or anything to\nThe\nBall over\nIn ...\nThe way Mr Mann is your\nTo do so by the fifty seven or the new talk of six seven eight for for ... for ten sixty seven what a sad story this isn't a oh I just I hate to even to talk about eleven year old boy in Iowa named Caleb Hammond\nHas leukemia he's been undergoing painful treatments at a Des Moines hospital for months it's not working other doctors are saying it's not working and we don't really have anything else we can do so the eleven year old kid said you know what screw it I'm going home\nSo he went home and he has a final wish for when he dies he's eleven and he's making final wishes\nEleven year old Caleb Hammond wants people to send him racing stickers\nHe's loved auto racing since he was two years old killed his passion is what prompted the request for stickers\nAnd his uncle says the stickers have been pouring in after social media appeals trying to keep everybody spirits up uh he's been home for about three weeks now and he does what other eleven year old kids do as much as he can but then he gets tired real easily and he's hoping to get some racing stickers to cover his casket when he dies\nThat's what the eleven year old boy says he wants to racing's tickets are stickers to cover his casket when he died from leukemia God what a heartbreaking story that is\nAnd how about some good news it's also a little sad in some ways to have you seen the video of the reunions of families in North and South Korea holy smokes\nA Donald Trump by the way is getting full credit for this\nHe arranged between the presidents of north and South Korea to get together to make a deal so that families who were separated during the Korean War are finally getting a chance to meet relatives who were separated from them fifty sixty years ago\nAnd there was video of of of of families women who were in their Seventy five eighty year old range seeing their brothers and sisters for the first time since they were for\nMe and there I mean it's ... will they now have more than one surname ... [laughter]\nI think the same name still but can you imagine I mean the video is really is it's really astounding there you know they haven't seen family in sixty years Berlin Wall stuff God\nI mean can you ... and ... and here's the here's the kicker they're like the the sad part about it is that apparently they were given a Donald Trump arranged the meeting to have them get the reunion together but apparently the deal is they are they can meet together in the same spot for three days\nBut they're being limited to only talk with each other actually sit together with each other over the three days for a total of eleven hours\nAnd the reason for that is the north Koreans don't want their people to find out too much about how good it is in South Korea for afraid they'll ...\nAfter tried to defect but again there at least you're getting to see the relatives of the first time since Nineteen fifty or even before that when they were separated before the war a point as bell man\nDown on your [laughter] [laughter]\nOh the Justin ... [noise] uh the current level of terrorism threat has announced a required the following announcement from the French government has just announced it has raised the terror alert level from run to hide the only to higher levels in France [laughter]\n\nThe only the only two levels higher than runner hide in France are collaborate surrender arises precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed Frances White flag factory\n[laughter]\nEffectively paralyzing the country's military capability meantime the Spanish or all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy these beautifully designed Spanish subs have glass bottom so [laughter] so that's a new Spanish Davey get really good luck of the oldest\nThere's sneaking out Iraq [laughter]\nFour oh one of the new talk of six seven I'm not making this up at ... when I was there or if you were more than about six pounds over what they thought was your weight your call it a fat body when I went to Paris island\nI weighed I think I weighed something like two ten maybe to all come up by about two ten\nAnd they wanted me my drill instructor a foot in the first day they are the drone structures put me in the fat body platoon or in the ... which meant when you go to the mess all I Would say fat body so the rare squad leader is still the front as well as you go to the front of the ... and the fact that he's had to go to the rear which means you have less time to eat\nBecause you're weak by fast I mean there's no goofing around and Paris island but the key was ... via drill instructors had to look at the food that I Would get on my trade and we're all ... and this is true story we were only I was only allowed to eat for like the first seven or eight weeks\nAnd then it became a squad leader and and they took a lot but anyway and for the first seven or eight weeks all I could eat much meat\nVegetables and water no bread nope potato is no pasta Noll salad dressing no milk no desserts\nKnown and all the other guys are piling on you know ice cream bars isn't like that no no and ... the last one in line you have to eat quickly in order to be in the first one out so he had like you know two minutes eat your food uh meat vegetables and water and that was it and I lost forty pounds\nIn the car for about three hours a three year old child she left in the car outside the grandmother's house now this was in the afternoon eight o'clock that night the woman ... what she had done and called nine one one\nAnd said my God I've left my kid in the car and so the cop showed up and they arrested her\nAnd they took the boy to a physical checkup at the hospital he's in good condition he's fine\nUh but uh miss Juarez was arrested for child cruelty even though she said oh my God my kids in the car called the cops to make sure he was okay for them to the hospital is gonna be fine and now she's arrested she's being cooperative with the police\nBut my God she's charged with second degree cruelty to children\n\nUh she drop your kids off at grandma's house third was had fallen asleep in the car or she went home and realize later it was like eight o'clock you realize that kid was must still be in the car and she called the cops on herself and they arrested her and put her in jail what happens when you were a snitch\nThat's right so do you know your\nSelf snitching a slightly different story\nOr a for for for all for ten sixty seven you know I don't understand how Michael Cohen can be an all this trouble\nAs Trump's lawyer when the only reason he's in trouble is because the FBI broke into his office and is a home and his condo apartment that he said stays and when he's not home with the family and they stole all the stuff including all this tape recordings as a uh conversations with clients including the president United States all his lawyers notes\nAnd then they supposedly are saying well we only looked at the ones that are relevant to our charge uh-huh they took 'em all they took all of it\nIf it's not it's not rocket stop on time yes exactly what they did that's what they did\nAnd the same thing with Manafort wasn't a Manafort they broke into his house at three o'clock in the morning or something if he would have showed up and then he would they would have said hey come on down we're going to rescue now okay I'll be there I mean but no they show up to break into the house Brad plaques and the doors and just to show Donald Trump and by the way Manafort\nOr his trial has nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing and Michael Cohen his pleading guilty today has to do with his tax evasion and his bank fraud has nothing to do with Donald Trump's presidency or a campaign or the Russians\nSo so far Robert Mueller's investigation for millions of dollars over two years has resulted in two trials that have nothing to do with Donald Trump\n\nTower and you know he's not gonna yeah he is not going to ever clear Donald Trump Mohler we'll never clear Donald Trump he'll have a final report that will never said Donald Trump did nothing wrong he will never have report clearing them\nIs it just disgraceful and you know that my mother and call me are best friends\nThey've invested with close friends best friends for Twenty years\nI tell you this whole thing is just a ... it's obviously a conflict of interest in when when Donald Trump talks about the angry Democrats I mean my God the fix was in from the beginning the same people that tried to fix the election for Hillary Rodham ... cabbage or fixing the trials the federal empire out of control it is\nA will and they're still trying to do as a matter for jury is still send a new note we don't know what it is it will if we find out will tell you obviously but holy moly oh oh oh [laughter]\nThat camera show replay whom I this is George sticky and I always listen to do a replay of the camera issue\nBecause you never know what might pop up the cameras on a weekday afternoon live three to six PM on the new talk what six seven\nYears is Christopher Walken at this flashing of ice shelf is brought you by Stormy Daniels storming was now appearing on celebrity big brother yeah yes stormy set you wanted to see just how big the brother wind chill and now here's your host the Kim uh\nWhatever they want you to tell a story here to second little city coming up for twenty six already it's only me it's only the cameras you have a chance to go home go home now because they're not getting any better\nA rain storm in traffic ... ... and this was a day in\nNineteen Ninety five party um sued Hershey foods company claiming that her she exploited its name when her she ran a kitten cat R. E. M. concerts\nSweepstakes and Hershey candy bars eventually settled in ... and you know if I\nAm also in\nThis day in Eighteen thirty one Nat Turner launched a violin slave rebellion in Virginia resulting in that that sort of at least fifty five white people sat Turner was eventually executed [noise]\nNineteen fifty nine mountainous and this was a day President Eisenhower signed an executive order making Hawaii the fiftieth state Nineteen fifty nine and five feet Davis for twenty seven now we've got sports\nComing up but it was a little quickie sports note here early Panthers rookie receiver DJ\nMore the first round draft pick arrested with reckless driving driving a hundred hundred and Thirteen miles per hour and a sixty five miles per hour work zone now before we\nFinish this story there's a word in there that we can't say so we'll just say Frank and staring I oh this is now continue the story with Frank being the optional word that will come in who your true for a jump\nBall taste is summed up in his report how fast more was going and his white Mercedes which first approached Baugh teaches vehicle from behind and I quote Frank that car is moving [laughter]\nBecause\nOne has to do it either but he sure made the hundred and third Damien oh mercy or a for for ... for Ted sixty seven eight for for for all for one zero six seven\nAn image Thirteen gang member\nAn illegal\nCitizen illegal non citizen rather legal criminal alien immigrant\nHas admitted he's a slaughtering butcher gang bangers MS Thirteen gang member has pleaded guilty as one of the three men who butchered and bludgeoned for teenage kids who were in a rival gang Jose pork teal\nA said quote myself and another MS Thirteen member personally murdered Michael Lopez by stabbing him with knives I did this knowingly willfully and without coercion when I was Fifteen Years old I Will forever suffer the pain of knowing how senseless these murders were in that none of the victims deserve to die\nYou'll recall that this may be familiar because it was the victim's family of survivors of his rage\nWho are with Donald Trump at a press conference calling for tougher immigration laws\nOr he was an undocumented the killer and undocumented teenager immigrants from El Salvador known as Sparky or curio so he was in ninth grade when he planned and carried out the quadruple murders\nHe faces white behind bars obviously he admitted he and his buddies had two female MS Thirteen gang girls gang banged girls\nLower five suspected members of a rival street gang to the woods where they were ambushed the he says we trick the victims so they would go into the woods where they would be murdered the uh MS Thirteen gang members including this Fifteen year old a ... a chopped them up with machetes\nKnives sticks and an ax one of the targets got away\nHe's now a federal government witness\nAnd everybody is describing this was one of the most brutal vicious horrific scenes they've ever seen this kid says I Know I Apologize to the families knowing my apology will not be accepted family was in court crying all the way and uh the lawyers are hoping that his me a couple of we'll just wait other kids from joining the gang he was Fifteen when he set up for murders\nA jury reaches or oh boy oh they have a jury in the Manafort trial eight counts on Paul Manafort trial they breached agreement on eight\nSo I assume the tent others therefore will no longer be part of a it won't be part of any kind of a ... trial if uh\nMy understanding was if the jury failed to reach anything on anything then it then you could read try him again or they could forget it but they could reach rhyme again if the jury if there were Eighteen counts and the jury reached has reached a verdict on eight of them then those other ... are going to go by the wayside they can't try and for those other ten\nAfter this court verdict\nOr but they have apparently they breached the verdict on it and it doesn't say guilty or innocent but it says they've reached a verdict on eight\nOf the teen counts and by the way my Manafort has to go through another trial after this one he faces a second trial again for nothing to do with Donald Trump the Robert Mueller investigation or has caught\nPaul Manafort with some banking schemes and not registering as a a a a foreign agent to take money from foreign agents or something and now he's got he's going to have a second trial and the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen is pleading guilty right now in court\nFor the for the crimes he was caught after Robert motors team ...\nKidnapped all this information and stole his a tape recordings with his clients whose conversations all his lawyers notes and found stuff in there to charge him
