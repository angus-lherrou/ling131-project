brother anything you want to talk about\nYeah well I'm Talking about the the bicyclists and use that they make rattled so well right well it's actually against Georgia law and ah so they're not rattled so I'm I'm a I'll do a lot of bicycle riding still yeah I like your show and everything\nBut [laughter] I bought up by the [laughter] but um yeah if you if there was a day at\nNear laying in the road um what do the the motorists do when they see it they just go right around that they don't even that they're at and they own a cyclist is terrorists want to do the same thing but no it's ... like flip the finger up and it's real disrespect but what if that person was your what if she was the first of all the twenty five year old white\nFemale nature of yours who dogs it's your pets every weekend you wouldn't do that too so why would you do that anybody else so we just be respectful for anybody who's not breaking the law that's really all the other parts of breaking the law like running stop signs or whatever you you\nGot to hang up signs and pay no attention to the traffic laws whatsoever and then you're the first one to complain about oh I got run over by a car was that because you ran a red light\nYeah that's not good to be running red lights no yeah that people do they will get mad at you when they do that oh yeah and\nDo a lot of bicycle riding it I always keep the law and there was one time I was in quarter Dale among the speed limit was thirty five yeah I was\nI was doing forty five coming down a hill household and forty five hours suck in the white wine\nAnd an elderly white man came up behind me real slow so I'm ten miles an hour over the speed limit right around me and asked me real slow what a curve for the new parents will do and he's flipping his finger at yeah\nSo he has no reason to be angry at him over the speed limit I'm not hurting anybody I'm not cause me far away and he's flipping his finger at that so\nUm there's a deeper reason why people hate cyclist than simply not breaking the law no I wasn't too\nLong you know I mean I I have a ... a bike myself and I I used to ride all the time but uh I'd stop at a stop sign I\nAlways wore helmet or ... you know and I didn't and I didn't ride on a main artery you know during rush hour and a whole traffic up our and I didn't ride with somebody else two or three abreast taken up the whole lane and hold and try for Gov just because they think that\nIt's their right to hold traffic up during during rush hour you know and I it it\nIs if it's a lot of you know if they they don't like the law then they ought to change\nThe law getting position where he can change it but it is completely legal for bicyclists and motor cyclists threat to\nOur motorcyclists a motorcycle is is a different story altogether that isn't a different class but bicycles because motor cyclists you have to have a tag\nAnd you have to have a registration you know to ride and you have to have insurance to ride on the state on on the streets and the road to the state of Georgia where bicycle is you don't have to\nPay a damn thing but they think that they own the road there yes they do nothing for the upkeep of the road they do not have\nThey ever did either but anyway they ... as if they're keeping the law like I was like I always do and people who have no reason to be angry at them but they won't be angry at him and on top of that people always say why you were a wire you worry about all black people in this\nCategory right here on a lot of people are not bad but then like recall cyclists out and going on like\nA lawyer you do because the majority of them do break the law day that's the problem\nAll right buddy pay appreciates going All right thanks listen [noise]\nNot
