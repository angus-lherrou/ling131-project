Institute and one of their biggest program this tiny house that land than we\nWere having a really good discussion during the break and you know when we were going to ask you will what who would be the ideal resident for a tiny house or micro ...\nLifestyle but you were you were sharing a lot about sort of the stigma behind it says to give it as sort of the answer to both of those if you would you know who who is this for because you mentioned\nA you know not necessarily for everyone but then it could be for folks who may not even see themselves as it and there's lots of misconceptions around it\nCompletely and I'm so just to start off that the definition in the state of Georgia\nWhat constitutes a tiny house on foundation is four hundred square feet or smaller so they have adopted a tiny house appendix which gives building codes to builders to build and more sleep design a\nUnder four hundred square feet that definition of tiny house once you get bigger than that you're talking about cottages bungalows just a small house okay hum the group that is you know people keep pushing not\nTo say that we are are demographic bait and our research shows were not\nUm you know we we had a we've done an online survey from our festivals and are different event we had over fourteen hundred people take this survey and fifty two percent I Believe it was fifty two fifty four percent or salaried employees that are looking to downsize into space between two hundred and fifty square feet\nTo six hundred square feet so that is a huge group that salary\nIndividuals that are in Atlanta and in urban and suburban areas are looking to downsize through much smaller place we also thought oh it's going to be like one age group\nAnd it also came back that every generation from Eighteen to eighty five is really interested in what a smaller square foot print could do for their lives on\nThe issue is is this perception\nSure you get a lot of nimby ism which stands for not in my backyard it's amazing that people are afraid of their property values we have been taught in America that our homes are are basically our bank account for retirement or and that we've been proven time and time again through the stock market\nCrashing and housing market crashing that's not the case\nSo my the what's really fascinating about that is people are wanting to be back into home\nInstead of just second homes or investment and so but there's a the unfortunate stigma of if you build one of these or you live in one of these that you're going to reduce quote unquote my property value so there's a lot of nimby ism and a lot of pushback\nFrom age away or historic preservation or um areas that suddenly your neighbor you thought you knew them and then they turn against you just because you want to put a small stretch your backyard and have your mother living\nMm this\nIs just so interesting and the idea I'm like click here on the website and I'm also looking at bed what my jurisdiction allows which is not much you\nKnow and I think we fell into a corner yeah it's it's so fast I mean we're planning and zoning a ... code like we don't allow that much in any innovative idea we we say no to yeah I mean only basically are allowed to build\nFour types of structures in the city of Atlanta in really any city it's usually like a single family home ... you've got than there are some condos multifamily high rise or multifamily or a low rise you know basically it\nAnd so it's kind of annoys me that we aren't as diverse so we're not encouraging density we are not encouraging\nCreating community we're creating personalized spaces and allowing people not to interact with each other so this movement is also really pursuing wanting to be more involved in the community and that comes back to design we don't realize how much are we don't realize how much architecture\nActually influences our day to day interaction\nAnd so uh again I I Know I'm On a soapbox\nAnd I feel like you are on a roll well but ... but it's good\nMovement is so fascinating and when I got into it I'm like oh you know what I did and I I thought everything and I traveled around the world look at me on a fabulous\nAnd then you realize there are so much more than it is yeah we only have a clip of time on this planet and we're worried about what our neighbors\nDoing and I that's what just annoyed the reading to build to a density great walk ability and we need the bill we can actually be human to each other instead of you know jerks basically\n[laughter] so well you tell us about\nIt because you mentioned they're really only are four types of homes are or dwellings that you know we can we can build in the city of Atlanta and now but micro life Institute is doing some things in the face of advocacy and really working to sort of turn that around\nCan you give us some shed some light on some of the things that you're dealing around zoning ordinance issues and\nTell our audience if they're really excited in have loved to what they're they've been hearing so far how they can get involved in it\nYes first thing that join our meta group or one of the largest meet up groups in the nation I'm doing education advocacy Ron microbe ... micro living and the Chinese ... movement and knock on meat up dot com also joined our newsletter on tiny ... dot com as well as they can visit our new website micro ... Institute dot org\nI'm we're still building that website but um eventually we're going to have up our videos from our innovative housing summit that were just produced in um September as well as more images from our dictator tiny house festival um program we're working on is actually an accessory dwelling unit program\nSo we're looking for the house building small races can help keep people in their homes their dominant home as well as create walkable communities\nUm by adding a fixed rate housing and chew the the most ... areas so imagine putting a bunch of tiny houses on foundation in people's backyards and then um the main homeowner can meant that out at a rent kept\nA cost that we can create more attainable affordable walk ability in high areas that are sought after so thinking of workforce housing as well as just people who don't need that much basically want to live near the outline um we're also looking at a partnering\nWith a number of government and a different organizations create a mobile village so we are talking to yeah this would be the wheel based movement inside where we would have up to twelve tiny houses on wheels\nAnd a movable community center utilizing underdeveloped land or parking lot\nDont it's um it's a ... you know just lack of knowledge of what you do is to throw it away but really thinking about when you purchase something how it's packaged more if it is something you've already knows harmful what are you going to do when you're done with us\nRight well Peggy we'd just like about a minute and a half left this has gone by really quickly so to talk to us a little bit about where people can find you and then they are there limits to what people can bring my quantity wise to what they can bring you\nOkay sure um we're located in the grant park area of the city it's eleven ... street south east for detail list of all the materials we met we take you go to WWW live\nThrive dot org and there's a big charm but I'm the also gives you any sees that may be involved with materials that you bring 'em as far as limitations if you really feel like it you got six hundred cans of paint and you want to just give us a heads up that you're\nComing down with great [laughter] believe me we have people pull up a truck full wow like gold or those kind of think it's nice to give it to hit that but we really try not\nTo hurt anyone away because if you're going to the trouble to bring this material down here to be disposed are properly we really try to to accommodate\nYeah wow well that's really cool and so um we've got about a thirty seconds left or can we find you online and on your website and not a or social media and all those things too\nSure we're on Facebook and it's live thrive Atlanta Facebook page um it it really if you Google charm we come up charm Atlanta we have a Twitter account which is a T o green pages um and we have an Instagram which is also lifts Robin Atlanta\nAll right we'll take it it's been a pleasure talking with you thanks so much for protecting our environment and of course um our health with um opening charm and uh everybody if you've got hard to recycled materials you now know where to take them they get some great Peggy\nThank you you guys have a great day you do by by by well\nThat was great kitchen with Peggy and charm if you've got things around your house like everybody probably has at least something everybody does yeah that is I'm probably not recyclable you know at least not recycling the sense that you should put it out on the ... well\nI'm just thinking like Thanksgiving is coming and with the popularity now lights bright Turkey's like where do you do with five gallons of turkey Greece\nOh I thought you were going to say I'm like the stuff you know boxes that you bought off alone you know Christmas gifts\nBut that's you can't ... well I Know that are hard that's hard to recycle but that\nPlant the plastic bubble stuff from Amazon is that recyclable\nI don't know we should have asked that question see I had my grief question should have\nHad it or not about that bombing and it's not the small boat or the big bubble things that they put in you know Amazon uses them all the time I don't know I Wonder if that it's a it's plastic never really I don't know I just know I don't know much about the plastic uh well\nWe'll have to go on the website and you know so it was live thrive dot org and check it out or\nOr maybe we should send a message on social media and then see if they respond to us and tell us about\nThe whole back that's that's an option you can you recycled air [laughter] as I pictures can we do the other ... other ... with will yes awesome down with the Grio and here's an idea\nSo I saw this on line and I talked to a good friend of mine and she never like this could be a great idea so they're called\nNeighborhoods but they have some kind of shortened name but I don't remember what it is so I'm just going to say for neighborhoods uh-huh so when you get older rather than like moving into like a retirement home or is it living or whatever\nThey have this thing where you like you and some of your other friends you all have like tiny houses so you have your own space but do you live on the same street or like on a cul de sac and then you so you can all live together in your area and share space and whatever but then you have your own space and I'm like that would be really ideal\nYeah God willing you know that that would make sense\nAnd one that I could do that now I couldn't really like to live that close to people like that while you were you ... if yeah I mean yes but I mean he I after a while they're probably not going to be your friend\nWell I'd like but I I Would I be eighty your business and then if they want you to come over here like I don't really want to come over and going somewhere but then they see your car the driveway and how it could be that people that you like he can't either way and the\nPeople you just don't want to hang out with them right then but you have to pick the people you want to hang out when I get it but I I'd have to wait till I was like you know not really opened around that much and you want it and I ain't all those people around me\nAnd the show's over thank you for once again closing out [laughter] in\nThinks everyone will talk to you next week to

have a good plan put together where you know that well here's the plan and this is how much I have the say\nHere's the plan that I have this bucket of money to set up just strictly for income and then you know the money that you have this sort of risk and how much riskier really taken but it's not everything\nAnd so when you have an overall plan that you know what's going to happen in the long run

rather than someone like you who focuses on retirement planning\nThe Dodgers that are out there all they did is they they changed the stockbrokers all they did is they changed their name from stockbroker to your trust a financial advisor ... they they're licensed this didn't change the planning didn't change none of a change all your big brokerage companies whether it's your Wells Fargo or Merrill Lynch's or Edward Jones or Raymond James or Charles Schwab or fidelity\nAll those companies they just during the security is business as though they're all they're going to be talking about is

February a big drop in popular tech stocks put an impact will sell off in motion so\nWhat does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street\nAnd David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah David been out there and teaching America about money for more than two decades he's nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finished rich\nAnd smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of the aim wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze\nDavid wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nThanks Rob manner show let's talk about that an eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked this sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and so the question becomes all is there anything specific going on and I'll give you\nThe first thing is that rates are going and you even heard the president talked about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is\nSad that actually been raising rates really doubt but most recently the fed raises rates on the money that things can call that was fun ... record happening\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the cost of our money goes right so you're going to borrow money for\nIf you're going to refinance or if you're going to buy a car and finance that car or you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where you're our owing money the cost to borrow that money is now going on and\nThat spoke\nAll spokes market right because if you're\nWell maybe people will either by less home they'll refinance so they'll buy less cars are those shop when it costs more to borrow money\nMarket gets loop that consumers will slow down on there and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about the bad and rates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because\nLet's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates well over ten years and\nThose historically the rate that put in place after our great recession we're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now in joint what is the longest bull market in his so you have to put that in perspective um\nAnd they're all some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up\nThe ten year treasury the rates have gone up on that right now and that's the highest rates we've seen on and your treasury unlike seven years so that's also a very [noise] and then there's the fact that check marketed as a way like it's right let me see that we sell often tech stocks\nParticularly tech stocks though\nI'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interests in some data breach\nWith companies like Amazon actually data breach and Facebook had a recent data breach so to soften the X. box but again making putting that in perspective it's been a tech stocks have been driving the market higher company and we called fang companies like Facebook\nAnd Amazon and Netflix and Google named tech companies have been absolutely on fire insurance and they've been the stocks and driving the market in fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising and it was probably about time for us to see tech stocks\nAnd I think the third thing that we know is attempting to marketing is actually the global market that trade wars\nAll this talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact global the global markets\nReally down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been\nAbsolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world\nAnd so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um there's really been\nA lot less like abroad the global markets but down emerging marked down and we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe a little bit of a breather to an almost a recognize things are slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with John\nDavid I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can still trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way it will pay down their debt right which is something\nI've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to\nTo reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you don't have a mortgage you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement and the good news about race going higher\nIs that the rates on your money market and your checking account CDs and again treasuries are going higher and if the most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think they're actually like it is I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries\nOver three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that the tenure treasures could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look at and go wow you know that's pretty good I can I can live off of the income checks and so I think it is\nFor retirees it can actually be a very positive\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David not well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] right it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what what I Know and we've been talking about this maybe you know I've done other interviews on\nUm I Know that we're live we we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hadn't even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today more wealth than you've ever had\nAnd at the same standpoint the last two months I've been telling people don't get it right like don't now it's not time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because\nIf you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can afford to take the time to let the markets recover but if you were retired\nTo find out or or somebody the contact that that does no where everything's at\nWell I think it's so interesting that we we ended up coming to this point in our discussion Patrick because we were focusing so much today on longevity people are living longer but the fact is none of us are promised tomorrow none of us are guaranteed tomorrow so that's why it's so important to go ahead and have the plans in\nPlace either way to me that sounds like a real challenge planning in case we live a long time while also planning in case we only live and how ... how do we do both\nYeah it's a you know so it's a double edged sword there and\nI was actually sitting down with with a a lady this morning and in her concern was OK well she does pass away and for an example her daughter doesn't hair the account she's got she's got a son and she's got a daughter the sons pretty good with this money and the daughter is terrible\nAnd she's got she's got issues he's got you know I'm not sure if this drug issues and things like that going on but she may not good with money so she wanted to make sure that she wasn't just getting this lump some amount of money if she passed away\nAnd so those are things we gotta talk about is kind of protecting the kids from themselves and so we actually have to you know for this particular situation she wants to restrict how much money that her daughter would get if she passes away and make sure that she gets kind of an income each month coming over\nHer lifetime versus her just getting a big lump some amount of money that she knows which is probably just going to blow through\nWell let's talk a little bit about the different types of planning Patrick when it comes to parents and what they're leaving their kids because sometimes you do have a situation where one of the adult children is dealing with something like addiction something tough\nWhere it's best that they don't get everything all at once there are other situations where you have an adult child who has some sort of a developmental issue perhaps they aren't able to live fully\nOn their own they're not able to be independent they will have medical needs it after you're gone you you have levels of\nPlanning for for folks in that situation\nSure and they're specialized planning I mean there's actually one of the families we were working\nWith now where their their son who's disabled and he's probably knows early forties but everything is good now income wise because he's you know living at home with with the parents and you know the parents are now in their late seventies and so they're starting to do this type of playing well if something happens to them housing income how do we make sure the incomes going to continue\nFor the disabled son and making sure that we got that coming in and so there are special needs trust and there are different types of ways that we can structure\nThings to make sure that incomes going to come in and and making sure that\nThere are always going to be taken care of it just takes like we've been talking about all day today putting a a good solid plan together based on those particular circumstances and you know people are like snowflakes every snowflake is different and so everybody's situation is different and so that's why we can't get into specifics strategies over\nThe radio as much as we'd like to sometimes and that's why it actually takes time to be able to sit down and understand\nWhere you're currently yeah what do you really need water the circumstances and what are the things we need to be looking out for in the future and that's why we walked everybody through this this ah five step process to a worry for your retirement the we call the bell retirement formula 'cause there are five areas to retirement planning we got to tune into all those different things and it's all over\nFor over a radio listeners yeah we'd like to invite the next in college that give us a call the scheduled time to come here for a visit and this is something that you've been putting\nOff for a long time and actually putting assault plan together or you just realize that with all the market volatility is just time to get a second opinion and to see what's really going on and we'll help you do this and help you get a second opinion and we'll do a stress test an analysis undercover retirement plan and under current portfolio\nInvestments and within that next market downturn\nMuch would you stand to lose now is a perfect time to understand what that number is you just have to give us a call here will help you figure it out give us a call it's seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one again that seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one and we're going to help you gained clarity on all these important questions that you need to get answered you just got to give us a call here it's seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one\nWe're talking with Patrick Mueller he is the founder of Bella advisors I'm generally jak alongside Patrick would you say just to that every one he's getting close to retirement could\nBenefit from a second opinion if they've started to do some planning if they have some savings that they just have some questions that they're on the right track what do you think most people can benefit from a second opinion on this\nA hundred percent a hundred percent there's never a bad time to get a second opinion and he always wanted to tune into what's going on it and I always go and join a we were talking a little bit earlier but I always go in for physical you know if you know every every year or so usually but I had a\nFriend of mine that I was getting some testosterone replacement therapy and if you're a guy you probably reached the\nThe peak of your testosterone in your early twenties and this starts gradually going down and so now that I'm over forty I decided you know what maybe I should go in and get this tested because you're hormone levels right they affect a lot of different things\nThat are going on with you and makes it a whole lot harder to build over his body fat and and you know get your sleepy during the day and all kinds of different stuff so I went in and out when I got this testing done\nIt turns out that my testosterone was pretty low and um but if you didn't go in and get a second opinion that get that test I I Would have never known this and so now I can take the steps to correct the levels and not only was my testosterone down but my estrogen levels were up so basically my doctor was telling me that I was turning into a woman's gym\nWatch out All right we're\nGoing to happen you know so that's why you know we've got to tune in and we got to we've got to find out you know what is really actually going on with you and then you want to get that second opinion so that way if there is something off that you can start taking the actionable steps to to get things back to where they they should be\nWell Patrick ... just a couple of minutes left ... start to wrap things up a little bad we focused a lot today on longevity understanding that you might need to find your retirement for\nA very long time but of course there are other factors to think about as well and we aren't guaranteed tomorrow is the point we've been making here and this last part of the show any final\nComments you'd like to share with us as it relates to making sure we get the proper planning done for both scenarios living a long life for not letting his among other life\nAnd it all starts with getting clarity on where it is that you're currently are just like well I went through with a different testing that are just on we want to do the same type of testing for you and what is going on with your current investments in your current retirement plan\nSo we'll walk you through the five areas of retirement planning all walk through your current income plant and what does that look like and then we'll we'll talk to you about your investments and we'll find out how much riskier currently taking right now now that the markets are an all time high how much downside risk because really there if we go through another downturn\nAnd then we want to talk about taxes are there ways that we can make things more tax efficient now or some point in the future we want to talk to health care if you have to go into assisted living nursing home care of these these things are skyrocketing\nPrize and how do we take care of those needs and then you've got a legacy planning which we talked a little bit about today wherever the uncertainty where if you do pass away you know how do we now get that to your loved ones the way that you intend to two and so we\nCall this all five of

back to the trading group show this show is about an extraordinary opportunity it's an opportunity to not only make more money and increase what you make but I Believe\nThis is an opportunity to change your life it's an opportunity that you have at your fingertips and I can say that because all you gotta do is called the toll free number\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd you'll have a chance to participate in what I believed to be the best opportunity I've seen I'm forty nine years old that I've seen everything from network marketing on down the line\nBut this is the opportunity and anybody can get involved I've got Michael with me here and he's going to share with you in detail what it is we do a Michael\nHey Jon thanks uh you know first of all I don't want anybody to get scared off or intimidated when I talk about what we do or if you've never experienced trading don't be scared off this is as easy as a one two three process\nUm what we do is we trade one product on the market and again it's an easy one to three process that are mentor instructs and the software instructs\nWe trade one product it's called the e many future it's on the U.S in the five hundred what's nice about the e many future is it's treated in both directions so when the market is moving up we're making trades when the software tells us to and when it's going down we make money\nAnd trade so we actually don't care what the actual result of the day is whether the market is up or down we make money either way we get to capitalize on all types of markets and all types of market conditions\nYou know this week for us was just another typical week uh you know all weeks are good for us but in particular yesterday was very very good and all we do is follow the instructions at the software gives us\nAnd like I said before the software is presented on a very basic level it's color coded and it's only two colors so it's easier than looking at a street light or a street light as three colors right Jill that's right [laughter] right this is only two colors to blue screen\nThe green light is going up and the blue light is going down so it tells us exactly when to get into a trade and when to exit a trade there is no thinking and that's what I Love about this\nThere's no thinking about the trade itself the software it tells you when they get in and when to get out and it's phenomenally accurate it's for all types of people experienced and non experienced we've got people in the group\nThat just heard the radio show several months ago they called us they had never even heard of day trading or the fact that they could make money doing it from home and now they're in the group and they're making more money than they ever thought they would ever make\nIs yeah let me give you a receipt of how I Do share you\n\nGet a while and is better than happy to America and I just I think we do you hear\nWhat happened to my new Twenty one Savage to back to school shootings or you know [noise]\nOh no buses or back to school like\nI'm going to they want to go [laughter]\n\nSix of land [noise]\nMusic is a bridge between the material and spiritual [noise]\nMy name is Harvey lower and I'm eighty two [noise]\nAs a blind person you have to be aware that nobody can tell you what do you can or can't do you really have to try\nMy folks got ... radio in Nineteen forty and that was the best Christmas present I ever got when I was eleven years old when I started to play music\nAnd then the accordion and on the show\nMy wife who's also blind was a good cook when she died that's when I started meals on wheels [noise]\nAmerica let's do\nOne of the newspaper ... gardening millions more drama hot and hearing folks like how\nHow long hair from your meal can you remind Frank and ... on my line of work and I'm Robin ...\nPlayers on the Web talk one oh six seven Atlanta dot com [laughter]\n[noise]\nI'd like to welcome you back to the trading group show this show is about an amazing opportunity we say make five hundred of five thousand dollars a day like Michael said you can make more than that\nBut this is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear this anybody can do it anybody what makes it phenomenal and makes people laugh is my wife has even said that when she sat in a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter] and and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy\nAnd our mentor he monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software and it's nice to have the expertise but to have him there motivating you and telling your stuff and it has analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand\nSo that knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you will walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved\nYou call eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nOr thinks John you know first of all ... just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups is that our mentors providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a software\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on\nIf there is not an active trade developing there's just nothing\nThere is just silence no talking and you can attest this year in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet so between what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to receive\nUtmost level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed this program research this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase stinking Korean so that he simplified it into a process that anybody can do it it's a simple follow along color coded system that he Berkeley describes as well as it's happening\nThere is no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you through it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen so when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded\nAnd then on top of that you're being verbally instructed so it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times\nIt's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software and it signals\nIs unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen and I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself\nWe don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show we want you to see it\nThen you can believe us after\nYou see it you can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because\nIf anything I feel like on the show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not gonna sit here and and talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories when I'd rather see is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of give us a call ... eight eight eight six\nFour six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nReserve you're spot in a couple of our sessions there's no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation we have people right now answering the phone is live\nI'm so give us a call check this out and and see this for yourself see if it's right for you you can witness real people\nAre trading real money our phone lines do get busy during the show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job and get out of their traditional habits you know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like\nYou know my dad had a J. O. B. E. or my mom had a ... and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house all you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income uh but more likely you can far surpass that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said at the beginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred grand and uh and and now you come out with a degree and then you have to pay that back now you have to get a job and pay back\nSo are there are other trading schools but there are two things they don't have our software\nAnd the leadership of our mentors we have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ... it's like a classroom and it'll it literally it'll change the way you think\nUh I don't think the way I used to anymore at all or he reduces the variables in this thing to make it where you can make more money\nBut what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money\nHis passion is also in people keeping it which is so important when I got involved in this I was building my nest and now what I'm doing is building my nest egg and I want a big oil ostrich egg or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week\nBut let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and that's working just two hours a day and I I did I think eleven trades nine were winners and the other two I did wrong I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor\nAnd are the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault you start you start to think you know what you're doing and that kind of when you hit into trouble so where else\nAre you going to find a group like this where you have a mentor like we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you\nAnd only our group has the software program we have to guide you and make this easy like Michael says this is the new age of earning a like you said I was raised to think", "show_name": "The Kimmer Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "20"}
