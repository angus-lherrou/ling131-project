giving them a leg up something that I'm\nA deer and her brother really learned that they could have used when they went off to college but now there is impacting positively the lives of so many others that have come behind them so\nCould there before we took a break we um were alluding to the fact that you have a fabulous new partnership with the national guard foundation and the Atlanta Hawks who um the courses that organization has been on our show a couple of times actually both\nAre have been on our show and talked about the work that they're doing but to bring the three of you together tell us about what that looks like in what the result of that partnership they're\nDealt with at an event it was an it was in Atlanta hopped event and I happened to me the curator of the\nArt curator for the new State Farm arena and we just talked and I'm Amy Perry who was that are taking other um curators that to me yes we've been doing a lot of our has been organizing a lot of artists 'em for\n'em to produce new art work for the state farm arena\nAnd we'd been looking to get can you can be involved\nAnd I said well how have you been successful and she said you know it's been slow but we really want to get the community and ball and I said I Know how you can get the community involved we have three hundred plus kids um every day after school that uh need exposure to the arts\nAnd so from that particular conversation we organized a workshop with ... who is one of the um artists commissioned\nTo produce in our peace in the new State Farm new State Farm arena and then lately and blades along with the national black arts festival got some other artists involved and reproduced 'em and they produce rather\nA great um workshop for our kids to produce art that will then be part of Lillian blades um\nArt piece at the new State Farm arena and from what I understand it is a huge huge vigil piece that will have lots of different um pieces of art from the community do it not only be future foundation kid but I also read that there are some elements students to\nUm contributed to the art peace\nSo it was really important for us to get our kids involved in that because we feel like participating in an activity like that will not\nOnly gave our kid access but it will expose them to the art and something that will be with them for the rest of their lives and staple in the Atlantic community and we feel like that that is very empowering for our students over to bury important for us\nTo get them involved and so would love to thank the hawks Lillian blade\nAnd you carry on and the national black black arts festival for really all coming together to um make that particular product happen for our students and as you both know that's really what I'm\nThis work is about it's about collaboration and ensuring that we're all coming together to make a huge impact and I think that this particular project and all the partners in Bob are I'm just a great example of\nSomething um that's remarkable that can be creative when you all collaborate\nThat's really awesome and it's really great to see how organizations here in the community you know you just wonder I saw I think about you know though arts festival\nYou know in our group and a group for kids and the basketball team figuring out a way that they can work together and create something that's so impactful for the students for the community because everybody will get to see it is now and then the state farmers we all have to get used to think State Farm arena\nAnd I wonder if they felt they knew it was just

E. L. L. A. advisors dot com of course named\nFor Patrick daughter Bella now we've been talking today about what to do when you have no idea what the deal and one of the examples he shared with us earlier Patrick was your home remodeling project I let me ask you are you doing this yourself\nOr are you working to somebody [laughter]\nSo it's kind of a half and\nHalf were them or do some of the stuff myself I'm a painting and some of the painting and things like that\nAnd then I've got a friend of mine that's in the home remodeling business and I can tell you everything you want to know now about hardwood floors and things to look at and\nPaints impact colors and all this different stuff so I've got the wealth of knowledge now if I ever had to go through this again and this relates to how much to retirement because there are so many things we call these the unknown unknowns or just things that you don't know and the first time to do something\nAs typically not the best time that you do it and that's exactly what I'm going through right now with this home remodeling stuff I've never had to go through this before\nAnd the it'd be nice to have somebody that has been through that a number of different times because they they they\nThey they know the mistakes not to make and they know the things to not to go through and and I could give you numerous different examples but we'd be talking more about home remodeling than um than retirement and\nThings like that but um it relate so much to retirement that the first time you do something that's typically are the best time you do it and how many times are you going to retire\nHopefully the one time\nExactly hopefully the one time so that's why it's so important to have a financial ally that that you can trust and that you can bounce things off of because we've been through this hundreds of times June and we said mistakes that people make\nAll the time and we can help you um you know get back on the right direction and make sure that you're not getting into these different pitfalls and things of that we've seen happen to other folks because we've been through this many times that um you know we we see this the same things happen over and over again\nPatrick gets its funny your example and I can laugh because this is my house that we're talking about the sample with your your remodeling project you can afford\nTo learn some some better way to do things ... can make some mistakes along the way because you are still in your working years you can pay for some of these mistakes that might be aggravating it might take up a little time that's I think one of the big differences between us and your retirement planning\nProject so to speak and can you really afford to\nMake mistakes that can you really afford\nTo make all these errors and try to correct them down the road right\nThat's right that's exactly right so you know a few for an example if if I'm paying you know fifty percent more than I thought that I was going to have to pay going through this process because of mistakes and linked to time and all these different things that can be the same thing in your retirement and you're taking risks where if we go through an economic downturn and and we lose fifty\nSome of our money and the and the markets how's that going to affect you can you really afford to be taking that much risk so we got to have a plan put together of what's going to generate that income if we do go through a time like that I always say the hope is not a strategy we don't want to be going forward with our fingers crossed and hoping that things work out\nI think it's interesting that retirement planning is is what you do you all day every day tell me tell me why the interest in this particular area of finance\nIt was just missing you know we have so many different people that are out there that are just trying to tell you how to invest your money\nJen like put your money here put your money there and\nAnd I just heard this morning with a gentleman I was talking about earlier sitting down that you know he was looking for different advisors and he walks in and and they're really quick to tell them how to invest the money but they don't know anything about him so so that's what I Would see is that I Would see that people have the money invested and they have no idea why they have it ends up that way\nAnd there was just a huge um you know you've got for an example you've got you know folks that are on the security side of things that they have a license to buy and sell security so all your money is going to be there and then you've got you know folks that are on the insurance side of things are safety side of things are banks and they want you to put all your money there\nAnd it's a good analogy is with what we do and what I Do what I Do is the difference between going to see the butcher and going to see the dietitian\nOkay so if we walk into the butcher and we say hey we're going to be grilling out this weekend what do you think we should be eating you say you know why we just got these amazing stripped stakes them from Montana\nWe just got these lamb chops and that or to die\nFor but one hundred percent of the time we're going to be walking out with some kind of meet great\nYou know they'd be more than happy to sell as meat for breakfast lunch dinner and it doesn't make the butcher bad I mean that's just what they sell that's the business up there in versus if we go to see the dietitian and we say hey we're going to be growing out this weekend what do you think we should be eating well what do you been doing for the last forty fifty year\nTo your body you know ... where's your height and weight where's your cholesterol where's your blood pressure why don't we do some blood work and find the things which are really deficient in and find out what it is that you actually need to start putting the plan together for what it is that you actually need versus just trying to sell a product that they have to sell\nI like that and allergy and I think that such as an important question what are you ... and where are you lacking where do you need some help\nIt really does seem to be the difference when you look at how these two different um I'll call them sales people would would offer things that they tell me how that translates into what you do how you find where people are deficient wedding out\nExactly I mean can you imagine just going into a doctor's office and saying hey hey doctor you know what you know what a good\nMedications you got today given them crazy yeah yeah\nSo if if people got to look at it you know investments that way or if you went in and the doctor I'm just said hey you know I got I got a couple of great medications for you you know they don't know anything about you you know here you just start taking these medications\nOr you'd you'd freak out a little bit but it's the same thing in this industry as we got to understand you know what ... what are you trying to accomplish where you at the stage of your life when are you looking to retire or maybe you're already retired and we got to take a look at what's going on so that's why we do a stress test in an analysis on your current situation so we can\nFind out where you are currently at what is the current path if you're on\nAnd then we can go through the things the vital signs and say okay well these things are good right here and then we can go through this stuff and take a look for example maybe it's the cholesterol we got to take a look and it's a little high maybe we want to start paying some attention to this and putting together a plan\nYou know for what you're correct that is the same thing with your finances as we want to find out what's going on and give you a clarity on what's happening\nAnd what you're clear on things then you know everybody typically knows\nWhat's important to them they just don't understand how to put all these different pieces together and that's really help them you know helping people with his\nWord that allied are really helped put that overall plan together to make sure that you're always going to be okay and so if you'd like to go through this process with us we'd like to give you the opportunity to come in and see if you're one of the next ten callers just give us a call here at seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one again that seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one and schedule a time to come up for a visit and we're going to help you get clarity on your current situation and I hear feedback all the time\nThat people feel is is the most valuable time that they've ever spent uh when it comes to the things that we are talking about\nAnd so you just got to take the action and give us a call here and schedule your time to come up for a visit and we do as did you say the least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars toward your retirement and we will do this for a free of charge no obligation to give us a call here seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one and I look forward to meeting you\nTalking today with Patrick Mueller he is the founder of that law advisors I'm generally jak alongside him his studio Patrick let's talk about market volatility how does this affect my retirement what can I Do to help protect what I've already saved from an extra market downturn or a correction whatever ends up happening\nYes yeah the ... the markets are we're in uncharted territory right now in August of this year we have hit the longest Bull Run and stock market history right yeah so it's a ... and here are the things when it comes to the markets to say you have hurricanes that\nHappened in the markets and you have tornadoes that happened in the markets so when you've got tornadoes in the market is the problem with tornadoes is that they're extremely unpredictable\nMay happen fast ... you don't see him come in and they're extremely devastating and then you've got hurricanes and you know they they track these hurricanes you can kinda see him coming where we are tracking the hurricanes coming all the way over from Africa across the Atlantic and they're around long enough\nFor us to name them that's [laughter]\nThat's exactly right and so they'll they'll tell you here for the storm's going ahead and then you've got somebody out there you know reporting on it you know where they're in a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds and you know so they can prove that there is a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds I guess to see what's going on and\nIt's the same thing when it comes to the markets we can track that stuff and so we're on the the ninth year of this bull market run and went to the next down turn going to happen\nI mean everybody listening and your crystal ball goes Microsoft bone as good as any of these so called ... on the radio or TV they don't know they're going to give you their best to educate a gas but they don't know and uh so don't be listening to the wrong\nFolks and so it it comes down to having a solid plan if you guys all about planning planning for the next twenty five thirty plus years we're retirement and making sure that you've got a solid income plan if you got a solid income plan where you know you get a paycheck coming in every single month every single year\nFor as long as you live as long as your spouse lives that's what it's all about and most people don't have an income plan most people just think they got a diversified portfolio and there'll be good they're okay you know and they listen to folks wouldn't get the wrong advice and so you want to make sure that you have a solid income planned and this was the first step in a rebel overtime a\nFormula that we walk everybody through as we want to understand how to replace your paycheck when you're retiring so if we go through\nAnother two thousand in a market condition and we got a big market class where it goes down fifty percent against or it's terrible for an extended period of time that we got a plan of place if that happens and making sure that you have things set up right in your portfolio that's going to stay on that\nAnd making sure you got so much money outside of that but it's designed to generate income no matter what and so you just got to give us a call\nAnd we'll help you go through this process and design and complained for you of when you want to retire what do you want your lifestyle to look like what are the different ways to construct this and we hope walking through the process and align with what's important to you you've got to take the action and give us a call here seven seven zero\nFive four or five eighty eight eighty one if you're one of the next ten callers\nWe're going to do it for free of charge seven seven zero five for five eighty eight eighty one\nAnd just give us a call scheduled time to come in\nWe're talking today with Patrick Mueller he's the founder of Bella advisors that phone number one more time seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one Patrick when you talk about the different types of storms we need to be thinking about and you compare tornadoes versus hurricanes the damage that can be done the preparation that can happen ahead of time if if we prepare for\nA hurricane and we ... board up our house and we do all the things you need to do to prepare our property to weather the storm and it misses us mhm\nWe aren't any worse off we we might feel like oh shoot I spent all this time but we aren't harmed in any way would you say the same is true for\nFinancial planning I mean you can you can prepare yourself for the worst certainly you're not going to be\nBad off or worse off if it doesn't happen so that kind of the reason why we prepare\nExactly some people that are not prepared that that get caught off guard right if the people that rain storms where you know the the first responders have to figure out a way and going rescue them because you know they they weren't prepared\nFor it and you hear about that and then every single storm and then you know sometimes you have people complaining because maybe the media over hype different things and the storm wasn't as bad as they thought it was going to be and for\nWhatever reason they're let down by that [laughter]\nI don't really understand a whole lot of great\nUm but they are upset it wasn't as bad as it should have been but ah you know that's the thing is when we're doing good planning you always plan for the worst and then you can hope for the best and where people get into problems as they kind of cross your fingers and they hope that everything is going to work out in the hope is not a strategy and I just see that all day long and then typically for people who were\nOverconfident that um are are typically the ones who are in the ... in the worship and really end up being the most help\nTalking today with Patrick Miller he's the founder of della advisors I'm generally jak alongside Patrick for those who maybe they've done some of the saving they've started to do some of this work is it probably worthwhile for them to get a second opinion to make sure they've done enough\nWhen it comes to saving that they've made the right decisions when it comes to their investment\nA hundred percent because what's the worst case scenario is if if everything is good and then told good news you've got more confidence on your your current plan and her current strategy and maybe the current adviser that you're currently working was so it's never a bad thing to get a second opinion and it's just if you want to make sure you understand that you are on the right path\nFor it and so if you'd like to go through the same planning process of we've helped hundreds of folks go through and have a successful retirement he just has to be one of the next ten collars and give us a call here seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one and we're going to start off by doing a stress test and analysis to give us clarity\nOn where you're currently at what path you currently heading on your retirement what is the stuff that's good what is the stuff that's not so good that we would\nFix if we were you were there were a good fit to work with each other I don't know um but will help you with some different strategies and that helped lead you in the right direction if nothing else you've got to be one of the next ten callers gives us a call here seven seven zero five four or five\nEighty eight eighty one and schedule your time to come in for a visit\nPatrick Mueller is the founder as ballet advisors time generally jak alongside in the studio Patrick can you just tell us a little bit more about some of these other areas as retirement planning estate planning tax\nPlanning health care planning are those things that you handle all in houses is more of a team based approach where there are others you work does that work with the way your business is structured\nSure we handle as much as we can and house here and most things were able to to take care of\nBut sometimes we need to bring in that tax professional so if you have the CPA or an account we like to talk with them and make sure that everybody's on the same page and where we're not estate planning attorneys here and so if you've got an estate planning attorney than we'd like to be talking with them\nAs well to make sure that everybody is on the same page and it's so important because you know usually these folks are not talking to each other your financial advisors not talking to the accountant is not talking to the estate planner and so we like to make sure that we're in contact with\nEverybody so everyone's on the same page and uh so ... so there's no big mishaps that can happen and\nYou hear about these things all the time for an example recently got Aretha Franklin\nYou know they have all didn't have a we'll prince didn't have a will there's all these different famous folks that you would think they would have you know good financial folks helping them and attorneys helping them but it's just that's just not the case of the case\nYeah so important to get things done so you aren't you aren't one of those stories where people talk about oh my goodness it takes so long to sort it all and they found\nA pattern for those who have been listening and ... tons is planning is what they're lacking and they're getting closer to retirement can you just tell us about that process and tell us exactly what to expect what happens when we call that number today from start to many\nSo when when you give us a call and you'll schedule a time to come in for a visit and the first visit is really just to get to know each other and what's going on in your world and what are your goals and objectives in what are you wanting things to look like in your retirement and so we talk through all those different things and\nTypically I don't know at this uh usually at that first visit what I can do to help or what\nKind of value we might be able to add so we're scheduling of time to get back together and it gives us time to be able to do an analysis on everything and do the stress tests that we are talking about and then we will be able to understand where you're currently at and we will talk through the five areas of retirement planning so that we call the bell retirement\nFormula and we will go through the things that we think that are good that you're currently doing and you want to continue to do these things and we're going to go through the stuff is maybe not so great that you want to start paying some attention to a big one you know that we haven't talked about today is taxes than having a good tax plan you know she's got a ... you know most people's biggest asset besides their\nTheir home is there I raise him four one K. money so you got all this tax to for money sitting there and a lot of times you think all that money is yours but it's not if you got a million dollar four\nOne K. a counter IRA account maybe six or seven hundred thousand of those years and the other forces the governments and so how are you going to get that out and the most tax efficient manner so you want to understand the stuff so if you like to go through this process with us then if you're one of the next ten calls you've got to take action and give us a call here it's seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight\nIt'd be one we'll walk you through a process there's no cause no obligation if there is some strategies you want to help with that's great that's not that's OK to gain some clarity on your current situation and just we just ask the juice saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars towards your retirement and if you have give us a call here would be one of the next ten callers to call us at seven seven zero\nFive four or five eighty eight eighty one\nAgain that seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one can't wait to meet you and to look forward to seeing you\nPatrick meal or is the founder of Bella advisors time

A. S. T. F.\nSay stripping a arm weakness or his speech difficulty then tee time time to call nine one one immediately because as soon as they get to the hospital the sooner they'll get treatment and that can make a remarkable difference in their recovering no the sudden sign face\nArm of each time spot a stroke\nFast visit stroke association dot org brought to you by the American stroke association in the\nElection twenty [noise]\nYou can make a difference of voting began seven AM do your part of your balance\nBetween now on a new one it was six seven where Leno comes to talk [noise]\n\n\nI'd like to welcome you back to the trading group show this show is about an amazing opportunity we say make five hundred five thousand dollars a day like Michael said you can make more than that\nBut this is what I Love about this opportunity and I want you to hear that anybody can do it anybody what makes it phenomenal and makes people laugh is my wife has even said that when she sat in a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter] and and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy\nAnd our mentor he monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software\nAnd it's nice to have the expertise but to have him there motivating you and telling your stuff and it has a ... or spot on they make everything so easy to understand\nSo that knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you will walk away with a Harvard degree and making money or how do you get involved you call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nOr thinks John you know first of all just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups is that our mentors providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a software\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on\nIf there is not an active trade developing there's just nothing there is just silence no talking and you can attest that you're in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet so between what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group\nAnd like you said John you're going to receive the utmost level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed this program research this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase stinking Korean so that he simplified it into a process that anybody can do it it's a simple follow along color coded system that he Berkeley describes as well as it's happening\nThere is no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you through it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen so when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then\nOn top of that you're being verbally instructed so it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times\nIt's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software in its signals\nIs unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen and I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself\nWe don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show\nWe want you to see it\nThen you can believe us after you see it you can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio\nI I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because\nIf anything I feel like on the show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not going to sit here and and talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that may twenty thousand dollars in the day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories what I'd rather say that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of\nGive us a call eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nYou're spot in a couple of our sessions there's no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation we have people right now answering the phone to live um so give us a call check this out and and see this for yourself see if it's right for you you can witness real people are trading real money our phone lines do get busy\nDuring the show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job and get out of their traditional habits you know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like\nYou know my dad had a J. O. B. or my mom had a ... and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house all you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income or the more likely you can far surpass that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said at the beginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred grand\nAnd uh and and now you come out with a degree and then you have to pay that back now you have to get a job and pay it back so are there are\nOther trading schools but there are two things they don't have our software\nAnd the leadership of our mentors we have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ... it's like a classroom and it'll it literally it'll change the way you think\nUh I don't think the way I used to anymore at all or he reduces the variables and this thing to make it where you can make more money\nBut what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money his passion is also in people keeping it which is so important\nWhen I got involved in this I was building my nest and now what I'm doing is building my nest egg and I want a big will last or Jake or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week\nBut let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and that's working just two hours a day and I I did I think eleven trades nine were winners and the other two I did wrong I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor\nAnd the the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault you\nStart you start to think you know what you're doing and that kind of when you hit into trouble so where else are you going to find a group like this where you have a mentor like we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you\nAnd only our group has the software program we have to guide you and make this easy\nLike Michael says this is the new age of earning a like you said I was raised to think you get a job and you go to work at seven in the morning and you worked there for thirty plus years and with this with this it was hard to grasp since it's it's two hours a day\nThat you could work literally a couple of hours just click the mouse\nWhy like that you talked about the number of trades you attempted yourself personally you know if we attest to the accuracy of the software a couple of weeks ago or a mentor was in session and he was near rating and describing", "show_name": "The Kimmer Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "27"}
