I\nI don't know if I misunderstood you weren't you talking about the guy Colorado to killed his family earlier yeah what do you yes based ... humanely they gave me the needle and let me do it myself\nWell you know they they're saying now that he was having an affair with some girl at work\nAnd ... and apparently he asked his wife for a separation and then we're assuming that's what started some kind of a fight and that's when the police believe me just killed her and but I\nI don't understand any I don't I don't know how you can kill a four year old and thirty thirty three year old your own daughters monster as nicely if he strangled others bare hands are I mean I just God\nI Can't I Can't imagine Colorado\nAt the death penalty or we know why don't\nYou know I'm not sure I I used to they used to have the firing squad Gary ... thank you appreciate it if I if I'm not mistaken wasn't Gary ... maybe those Utah they might have been Utah to say that I think it was Utah in his firing squad yeah\nI don't know where the Colorado has the death penalty I'd I don't know but this I mean that's not good enough for this guy how do you like to me the woman he was having an affair with only ... family over you know I Believe is reinstated in Nineteen Seventy four okay there you go well good\n'cause he certainly qualifies for death by avalanche and you write ski slopes he's he now he's claiming that he came home to find one of his daughters dead and the other one being strangled by his wife and that's why he snapped\nIn a fit of rage and killed his wife and revenge of the prosecutors aren't buying that but that's a record anyway and he just thinking about it I just can't imagine how you could kill your own three and four year old daughter's three thirty one\nNewspaper

two hundred foot pole\nAnd then they would win with with orange and it was like no way you're in a club\nWell anyway it was part of a natural\nIt was part of a bathroom and I would go into the

you know you're dreaming in your part of it uh it and you you can kind of control to research at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and the Institute in Hawaii\nAre investigating chemicals the cold inhibitors that promote looser dreaming they moderate REM sleep a deep sleep a they had a hundred and twenty participants drugs had in their dreams the more they took the more they hadn't lucid dreams\nUh they would practice their dream induction techniques have the pills and and go back to sleep and it would trigger lucid dreams available to they're trying to see if this was available to a wider population in other to perhaps help people deal with things like nightmares called LSD\nThat's another\nWhole issue retire early on that is the news ... news regular air a good afternoon\nAnd the name of the father of the name of the sun and the holy ghost some action from the pope is what people\nWant long waiting for a narrowly wonderful this\nIs me struck him and I just you know being blasted for waiting so long to speak out against a priest and a leading Pennsylvania a long wait sir yeah\nAnd only delivering a bunch of words that won't be followed by any action [laughter]\nSort of like President Trump when he goes on Twitter and winds about Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein team and Christopher Wray who he is in his power to fire him or at least tell them to do their job so I think you'd want to make action there but the folks here's an idea [laughter]\nI'm Twitter they condemn the pedophile priests like Trump people will be actually think I'm doing something you know and if\nYou don't deal gets ...

[laughter]\n\nSee you already have\n\nLong as oil you\nKnow\nWhen when you need or a ... thing to\nThe\nBall over\nIn ...\nThe way Mr manager\nWay again so by the fifty seven or the new talk what six seven eight for for for all for ten sixty seven what a sad story this is and I don't I just I hate to even to talk about an\nEleven year old boy in Iowa named Caleb Hammond has leukemia\nHe's been undergoing painful treatments at a Des Moines hospital for months it's not working other doctors are saying it's not working and we don't really have anything else we can do so the eleven year old kid said you know what screw it I'm going home\nSo he went home and he has a final wish for when he dies he's eleven and he's making final wishes\nEleven year old Caleb Hammond wants people to send him racing stickers\nHe's loved auto racing since she was two years old healed his passion is what prompted the request for stickers and his uncle says the stickers have been pouring in after social media appeals trying to keep everybody spirits up\nUh he's been home for about three weeks now and he does what other eleven year old kids do as much as you can but then he gets tired released Lee and he's hoping to get some racing stickers to cover his casket when he dies\nThat's what the eleven year old boy says he wants to racing's tickets are stickers to cover his casket when he died from leukemia God what a heartbreaking story that is\nAnd how about some good news it's also a little sad in some ways to have you seen the video of the reunions of families in North and South Korea\nHoly smokes a Donald Trump by the way is getting full credit for this\nHe arranged between the presidents of north and South Korea to get together to make a deal so that families who were separated during the Korean War are finally getting a chance to meet relatives who were separated from them fifty sixty years ago\nAnd there was video of of the ... of families women who were in their Seventy five eighty year old range seeing their brothers and sisters for the first time since they were for\nMe and there I mean that's what will they now have more than one surname ... [laughter]\nWell I think they're all the same name still but can you imagine I mean the video is really is it's really astounding there you know they haven't seen family in sixty years Berlin Wall stuff God\nI mean can you ... and ... and here's the here's the kicker like the the sad part about it is that apparently they were given a Donald Trump arranged the meeting to have them get the reunion together but apparently the deal is they are they can meet together in the same spot for three days\nBut they're being limited to only talk with each other actually sit together with each other over the three days for a total of eleven hours\nAnd the reason for that is the north Koreans don't want their people to find out too much about how good it is in South Korea are afraid they'll defect or try to defect but again there at least getting to see the relatives of the first time since Nineteen fifty\nEven before that when they were separated before the war are pointing to spell\nYou know what to stand on your show [laughter] [laughter]\nOh the Justin yes [noise] uh the current level of terrorism threat has announced a required the following announcement from the French government has just announced that has raised the terror alert level from run to hide the only to higher levels in France [laughter]\n\nThe only the only two levels higher than runner hide in France are collaborate surrender arises precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed Frances White flag factory\n[laughter]\nEffectively paralyzing the country's military capability meantime the Spanish or all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy these beautifully designed Spanish subs have glass bottom so [laughter] so that's a new Spanish maybe get a really good luck of the oldest\nThere's sneaking out Iraq [laughter]\nFour oh one of the new talk of six seven I'm not making this up at ... when I was there or if you were more than about six pounds over what they thought was your weight your call to fat body when I went to Paris island\nI weighed I think I weighed something like two ten maybe to all come up by about two ten\nAnd they wanted me my drill instructor a foot in the first day they are the drone structures put me in the fat body platoon or in the ... which meant when you go to the mess all I Would say fat body so their leaders to the front as well as you go to the front of a child line and the fact that he's had to go to the rear which means you have less time to eat\nBecause you're weak by fast I mean there's no goofing around and Paris island but the key was ... and via drill instructors had to look at the food that I Would get on my trade and we're all ... and this is a true story we were only I was only allowed to eat for like the first seven or eight weeks\nAnd then it became a squad leader and and they took a lot but anyway and for the first seven or eight weeks all I could eat much meat\nVegetables and water no bread no potato is no pasta Noll salad dressing no milk no desserts\nKnown and all the other guys are piling on you know ice cream bars isn't like that no no and ... the last one in line you have to eat quickly in order to be in the first one out so he had like you know two minutes eat your food uh meat vegetables and water and that was it and I lost forty pounds\nI went I I made it to one Seventy five or something she anyway uh but that but they didn't go from now the marine corps has had now has a sports dietitian expert Charlene holiday she file serves the marine corps war fighter and performance dietitian\nSo now it every meal they will have clean protein offerings offerings at every meal in the marine corps the clean protein offerings are chopped eggs yogurt cheese\nSauce a sauce is a protein ... wait a minute\nIt's clean protein offerings at all meals would include shopped eggs yogurt cheese sauce a lagoon this trail mixes and vegetarian options and now the Marines are going to have a color coded system to help you to decide whether you're eating the right stuff for the Marines oh my God this is like kindergarten tomatoes tomatoes that protein\nWell there you are on the protein list\nAnd now they have color code so if you see ... the food has a green coat next door to eat as much as you want a yellow means go with caution and a red you know does sign next to the food means minimal amount only\nAnyway for the marine corps wants minimal yeah I don't know but I'm telling you the same in the Marines man if you like good food good eating in the marine corps you get all you were at least used to be so to hold on here so I think that's a news magazine hold on a on the news ... line there we go ah good afternoon\n...
