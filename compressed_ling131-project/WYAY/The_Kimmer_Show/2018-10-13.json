dressed up this clown does it still is it the same kind of thing or are you guys doing things are a little bit differently with um\nAre more seasoned um society number ... ...\nYeah it it is different um we don't want a present ourselves as clown doctors for the senior programs um I'm getting the the similarities I guess are that both of the programs are about\nBringing the individual person what he or she needs in that given moment with the kids it's often more about fun and play and with the seniors that it's more about giving them reference and respect and creating opportunities for them to be helpful to us and\nProviding for them what we have been talking about as five star treatment so giving them a few moments of absolute fine and wonderful and elegant time with us\nThe clowns for the senior program aren't clown doctors they're more characters\nThat are rooted in iconic fashions of ah the forties fifties and sixties okay okay yeah that's when they still\nWork clown notes um what they are more it's more character driven\nMhm [noise] so that you you mentioned you know the seniors may not have\nUm especially the senior centers they may not have that type of programming and um\nYou know and you're you're bringing a sense of joy and maybe even a little ... to back to that group are there are benefits though that I'm sure there are um in what is it that the humor all adjuster taking from these experiences ... whether they're working with the seniors\nOr with the children because I imagine\nThis is really rewarding in a way that you you're going to have fun and interacting with some really um you know the interesting people and families who could definitely use you but then you're walking away having felt like you can help somebody to tell us about that experience\nYet so I mean this is it's the best job in the world especially the way I feel is that\nFor for an artist to be able to provide\n[noise] joy and help to someone who is really in need of that is a great gift so it's the intersection of\nArt and health care and with at the risk of sounding sort of cheesy about this love or you know person to person I'm appreciation so\nI mean I I take away from it a a bigger heart I think every day that I work and you know with the kids\nAt some of it is also just about them giving nuts perspective mum about what's what's really the most important thing\nIn life and I mean if I'm you know sometimes I'll go to work and I'm worried about\nIt you know having to take down these thirty pine trees in my backyard but then I have an interaction\nWith the kid who's lying in the bed and suddenly stands up and start spots in the clowns around and we have this opportunity to sing and dance and brings life to the child for five minutes and it makes me think okay well\nYou know this is what's important\nYeah absolutely perspective is always good mhm so books I'd be out here listening and saying okay how do we connect with you so what are you do you all for the kids side of the programs are you guys are associated with specific\nUm facilities um how does that work and then how can this similar leads some of the senior facilities connect with you to perhaps be able to bring you in\n[noise] yes so right now we serve three hospitals that are all children's helped your other Atlanta we have a wonderful relationship with children's health care to Atlanta and they are awesome\nI'm with us and with the way they treat their staff and their patients and everything so we're we couldn't be more excited about our relationship with them so we the clowns work at Scottish right I'd go in and use balding [noise]\nFor the senior program we're just starting to get this off the ground so we have started creating the artistry of it and the plan for how it would work modeling off some of our colleagues in other places\nBut um we have not yet launched our pilots for the senior program so we are looking for appropriate facility is who are interested in\nBringing this to their [noise] um [noise] to the the folks that live in their facility so there is anybody out there is like yes this is neat\nCool All right well we'll definitely outlook for some recommendations for you so how can a community though a support your efforts because I imagine that you know maybe there's some things so that the clown doctors could use\nTo make their jobs just a little bit easier or or even when you have to go through some of those special training that the the clown doctors need to be able to work in these facilities than they are may incur some type of a process or even just travel I'm Around so how can the community support those efforts\n[laughter] well um we do sometimes have public events that we would love the community to be a part of 'em will have one in March on march fourteen which is Pi Day so we do pie and that they say that\nSo if anybody wants to come out and the U.S outside of the hospital the environment around the outside of the health care environment we use occasionally have things like that that are going on and information about that is always on our Facebook page or on our website\nUm and uh [noise] so that's great and I would love for people just to connect with us on Facebook we try to post information of stories from the hospital and\nI'm pretty regularly about what we're doing and what's new and what's going on so we'd love for people just to learn more about our program because I think that it's a\n... it's sort of a little known gym in our community right now the people in the hospital know about it but they must you have a kid who's ... and you might not really know that much about the con program and what did it to bring 'em so that also brings me into spreading the word if you uh ... if you are\nAnd what we do talk to us about it or send us a message on Facebook and uh tell your friends about us\nWere fantastic uh Maya thank you so much for coming on the show again real quickly

money you spend in every month and you know if you're not retired and you're looking to retire you know you've got to take a look at what your lifestyle is now and and what do you want it to look like when you retire\nA lot of people think that their expenses are going to come down when they retire maybe pay the mortgage off but then there's a tradeoff because now you got all this free time and you start traveling and getting into different hobbies so there's all kinds of different things to think about but it's because if you've got your Social Security coming in and maybe you have a pension than\n... and you have low expenses to say maybe between you and your spouse your thirty thousand a year coming in from your Social Security you've got another Fifteen thousand coming in from a pension and say your expenses or Seventy thousand each year well you're not going to have to take out that much each year out of your portfolio uh to to keep up with\nThat versus you know the people that I worry about are the folks who you know have\nReally high expenses a hundred and fifty two hundred plus thousand dollars those folks when they retire you know I get much more concerned when I started hearing those numbers then I hear you know sixty eighty thousand dollars you know that is much more doable and so um but we've got to focus more on that then then you know how much somebody has accumulated an asset\nSo really it's more about the strategies for how you're spending is or how you're investing is versus what the final amounted anything\nYeah yeah there are different recipes that you can choose so if we want to bake an apple pie there's going to be different recipes on how to bake that apple pie and and what the best ingredients are going to be to to help you accomplish that so one of the things that where you know people get really focused on the amount of assets that they've accumulated so we'll take a million dollars\nFor an example well there was this rule that came out called the four percent roll back and I don't know the Fort forties or fifties back then to where if you take four\nPercent of your savings out so if you took out forty thousand a year out of the million dollars I'd be four percent so if you take that out each year than if he's got half of that invested in stocks and half of it invested a bond that you should have a very high rate of success of not a living your money in their lifetime\nSo the problem with that is there's different things that are going on longevity you know people are living much much longer today than they were back in the forties and fifties the other thing is the un ah interest rates have been very low and then the other thing is the stock market so a lot of time folks investments are heavily tied to the stock market\nBut people you know this this rule did very well up until the year two thousand so you have the year two thousand two thousand and ten ... which they call the last decade where the markets didn't grow up during that period of time they were down one percent so if there's no growth on the market and or it's going down\nAnd you're having to take that forty thousand a year earlier portfolio every single year than now when you go through a period of time like that you have more of like a fifty five or sixty percent chance of success\nWell nobody wants a I'm Sorry you had a sixty percent chance of success\nYeah how would you like to go on an airplane engine and you're sitting down your old comfy and the pilot comes on and says you know hey you know we've got great great flying weather today um and we've got a sixty percent chance of making a tourist destination\nCash yeah is that is that an airplane that are going to want to stay on\nNo I'm not getting on that plane and I am just so now how do we close that gap then and I'm guessing a lot of people would only have that forty or sixty percent chance of success if they aren't being strategic if they are planning\nA lot of people you know I've heard about that role but a lot of people they don't realize that they're taking a much more than that to some people are taking more like four five six plus percent\nAnd you got to understand how much money as the most important thing when you were retiring is to understand how\nMuch money is going out the door and luckily it's really easy to figure out what that is most people have one or two different checking account\nThat all the bills get paid out of and the banks are really nice to us and they show us on the ledge or how much money comes out each month of the total it all up at the very beginning of each statement that it'll show you\nHere's your beginning balance at the beginning of the month the next one will be the deposits the money that came into the account and then you've got the withdrawals that came out and then you've got your ending balance and all you want to do is just total up those withdrawals told us already told up for you\nTo the website if you'd like to learn more it's Bella advisors dot com that della B. E. L. L. A. advisors dot com\nToday's discussion is all that now worth\n... net income and which way makes more sense to think about when we talk about retirement planning\nSo tell me what are some of the problems with focusing more on your net worth versus income planning\nSo it's good to have a you know a number of a sudden your mind worried you know that you're trying to accumulate towards that you're trying to build towards of you know how much you want to accumulate before you retire but there are so many other questions that are that should be asked the along the way in so many other things that can happen when\nYou do retire and you have that kind of mentality and so a few of them you know you got to be thinking about what your risk tolerance is\nAnd what the right of return is going to be the true diversification and keeping up with inflation over time which a lot of folks typically aren't doing so if you are you using that four percent of role for an example and\nIf we go through another two thousand through two thousand and two or two thousand and they market condition where the market goes down fifty percent and\nEveryone needs to realize that we're all time high is a market history right now and there's a great possibility over the next ten years that we could see another downturn like that so if you had a million bucks and now you are a at a half a million bucks because the markets go down and you're still going to take out the same four percent well now\nYou're having to take out double the amount of money basically you know from your portfolio size when the when the markets are down to the markets are down fifty percent and now you're still need to reach in and pulled out forty thousand a year out then\nThat doesn't work less than ... so you either need to not pull that money out and now you're not going on those vacation this year changing your lifestyle dramatically not pulling money out or you're going to have a really good um chance of running out of the money so that's\nSo that's that's not a great plan for for most folks I don't think\nNo nobody wants to have to make those drastic changes in their lifestyles so Patrick how do we put some playing in place to prevent some of these big law states so many people do have money\nIn four O. one K. than areas where they're similar is\nThe problem is most people are way too aggressive\nWhen it comes to their investment and I was sitting down with a couple of not too long ago where I asked him I said how does your visor help help you and your wrists talking you know figure out what your risk tolerance was and they go oh well he just asked us um you know on a scale\nFrom one to ten you know uh how much risk we were we felt like we could take and so we said seven\nWe said seven and a and so their portfolios really aggressive and so we have ways of being able to stress tests people's portfolios gym\nWhere we can take their current investments and analyze them and we'd go Morningstar analysis for everybody and it tells us if we go through another two thousand and they market condition where the market you down fifty percent\nHow much that you stand to lose in a situation like that and most people just don't really understand how much there is there currently taking their thinking maybe that if we see a downturn maybe their portfolios or be down five percent or ten percent something like that but most of the time\nWe see more people say they're invested conservatively that they're going to be losing thirty forty fifty percent of their life savings and if that's happening early on\nIn your retirement or you're a few years away from retiring than that that can that's a game changer right there\nWell Patrick wish wish situations\nLike that is it more of an issue with an adviser not asking the right questions or is it more of an issue of working with an advisor who specializing in a different area\nYeah this is a really good question because there are over three hundred different financial\nDesignations that are out there were some making call themselves a financial professional in one form or another and you just have to look at the licenses so when you're dealing with your big brokerage firms whether it's a Wells Fargo or Edward Jones or Raymond James or Merrill Lynch these guys are in the business of buying and selling securities\nAll of the recommendation dry like Fisher Investments and all that all the recommendations are going to be based on what the market because that's how they make a living and then you have people that are on the safety side of the things in insurance side of things and banks and things like that where everything that they're going to be talking about is going to be revolving around safety\nAnd why doesn't make sense to to put your money on the market and put it a rest until you got to make sure you're working with an advisor that can deal with everything you want to be working with an independent advisor that\nActually has a fiduciary responsibility to you that actually have the legal responsibility to you\nTo do what is actually in your best interests when we're sitting down with our clients and we're looking at a different ingredients to bake your pie for retirement or we have the whole grocery store we have all the licenses is is what we do and you want to be you know working with somebody who actually specializes in what\nIt is you're trying to accomplish so just kind of going back into um my my rehab nightmare stories of my house you know I had to call and the professional a foreign company\nTo come in and redo the the terrible job that was being done upon my beautiful\nFloors and um so they came in and they were specialized to do exactly that and so that's what we do here is we specialize in helping folks with their retirement plans and and you want to be making sure that when you're working with somebody\nUm that that is what they specialize in when that's what you're needing them for the stage in your life you don't want the folks who are\nUsed to just helping people with accumulating their money in their mind a growing the stock market to think that those are going to be the same people that are going to help you navigate safely through your retirement because of the rules change on you in a retirement so if you're currently working within advisor now and you would like to get a second opinion to make sure that they have all the tools available for\nYou we will do a second opinion for you to show you here's where you're currently and the things that you should be focused on from this point\nForward and is your advisor still the right fit for you at this stage so you just got to give us a call and take the action give us a call here schedule a time to come in there is no obligation whatsoever give us a call here seven seven zero five\nFour or five eighty eight eighty one again the seven seven zero five for five eighty eight eighty one\nWe're talking today with Patrick ... is the founder of Bella advisors I'm generally jak\nAlongside Patrick just gave me the phone number at the website is Bella advisors dot com if you'd like to learn more at B. E. L. L. A. advisors dot com Patrick when you talk about the importance of working with someone who is independent and has access to all the different\nPulled out there and when did you realize that was going to be important for how you were running your own business\nUm so when I when I started becoming an advisor\nI started sitting down with a with folks and I work mainly on the safety side of things I had an insurance agency for a number of years and so I started more on the safety side of things hoping folks protect their money and and I saw very soon when I was sitting down with folks\nThat they needed help with everything because you have folks that are out there may be on the insurance side of things that\nHave their opinions any of the folks that are on the markets are the things doing their thing but nobody was given people real advise everybody was just out there trying to sell them some type of\nProduct and so people nobody was really doing real planning for people and that's what we do here is that we do early retirement planning for folks and making sure that we're thinking of talking through all the things that we\nNeed to talk about and plan for\nAnd so it made sense to me very early on that I needed to have all the the licenses and so for me to be a fiduciary it's not a requirement\nIn my industry for me to be the producer and they have a legal responsibility for my clients and so it's very important to me that we do you do the twenty two years I've been in this business of never received a complaint and so it's very important to me that you're always doing the right thing for\nFolks but we have gone through and we have gotten the licensing and place to make sure that when people do come to if they know that were being held to the stand or even though we know that that's what we do every single day\nPatrick can you talk about some of the other things you do as far as keeping up to date with the latest in this industry because retirement planning is something that is constantly evolving how do you keep up with all of it\nIt's it takes a lot it takes a team of folks\nAnd there there are folks that we partner was across the country that help us Stay on top of all the changing laws and all the things that are changing of the different industries that we we\nGot to pay attention to and then a couple of times a year we were talking\nAbout earlier Jen where there's a group of advisors that get together a lot of top advisors around the country where we share best practices and so we're always making sure that we're always doing the best planning on and given the best advised to our clients and that's something that that\nWe continuously do hear a bell advisors multiple times throughout the year to make sure they're always on top of things and it's just kind of like going to a doctor you you probably wouldn't feel too comfortable\nGoing to a doctor wasn't paid you know any attention to any advancements in the medical industry over the last twenty plus years\nYeah that's that's a really good point so Patrick for those who are interested in getting a second opinion may be learning a little bit more about your process and how that could be a benefit to them what do they need you to get started\nThey just have to take action and give us a call here at the office at seven seven zero five\nThat I could see myself doing either one of those things and so we just want to get very clear on what does she want and then we start building the plant around us so say for an example if we think\nAbout this like baking and you know what you really one retirement as you want an apple pie and and your recipe section a column you've got different recipes on on how to bake different types of apple pies and then you've got the ingredients section and so they're going to be better ingredients depending on the recipe the feels the best you can be different ingredients you're going to want to choose to be able to make that apple pie and\nSo for over your ingredients section you got you just love apples and so you've got all these amazing apples and your ingredients section but if we find end up finding out when we really start talking through what you really want and what you really want is some blueberry pie well it doesn't matter how\nGreat the apples are over in your ingredients section or how great the\nRecipe is they're never going to be able to make that blueberry pie and so we get really clear on that because a lot of times people are just you know one not very clear and what they really want and then they're definitely not clear on the recipes and\nMost people have just accumulated a bunch of different ingredients of budget types of investments but what are these what are these ... you know investments are ingredients designed to do for you\nAnd so that's what we want to get really clear on is what is really important to you and the other stuff is easy and\nWe can walk you through the different recipes that are out there and which one feels the best to you and then as far as the ingredients we got the whole grocery store that we can go shopping through what's the stuff that whether the ingredients that you already have that are good and what are some other ingredients that we might need to pick up you know to make to make 'em you know the best I ever\nPatrick Mueller is the founder of advisers and I'm generally jak align side in a studio at Patrick let's spend a few minutes here at the end of the show\nTalking about that process for those hills realize what they have is a list and different accounts they have a bunch of different statement\nThey essentially have all of the ingredients that they've never had anybody show them how to assemble all of them in to that final recipe how do they get started and what can they expect with your process\nSure well the first step that you got to take just about anything in life you got to take action and a lot of times this is typically a topic that people tend to put off because I mean it's not I mean let's be honest and it's not the most exciting topic and it really is if you think about it you know making sure that you're living in an amazing retirement and and that you're going to have no worries and retirement when you put a plan together but people tend to put it off because\nIt's something they don't want to deal with I Want to you know playing their vacations and things like that that are fun about you got\nTo is the most important thing and this and this is the best time that you're going to spend but you got to take the action to come in and sit down with us\nFor a visit and we'll walk you through our bell retirement formula which is king into the five areas of retirement planning of things we need to be talking about your income planned investment plan tax plan health care plan your legacy plant we got to talk to all five of those different areas and\nSo when you come in for a visit we're going to take a look at and get a snapshot of where are you currently\nAnd what is that going to look like where you're going into the future I hear this all the time that\nPeople feel like it's a fog going into the future and they don't it's not very clear on the current path that they're on and we're going to help clear that up and show you the current path you're on and we're going to show you\nThe things that are good that you're doing that you're going to continue to keep doing those things and we're also going to show you the things that are maybe not so good and the things that are dangerous and the risk that maybe you're taking and then if we can help us some of those strategies that's great but you've got a window of opportunity\nTo take advantage of this and if you're one of the next and colors give us a call here seven seven zero five for five eighty eight eighty one and we will sit down and we'll go through this process with you and help you answer the questions of what's important to you when can you retire is what you've saved throughout your lifetime is it going to be enough\nIs it going to last and how can we make it less and you just got to be

you're going to shake my hand or what I'm having a stroke wow you're not even moving your arm I'm having a stroke are you OK I'm happy a screw your face looks weird too I'm having a stroke or you had an Caesar or something I'm having a stroke\nWhen someone is having a stroke they may not be able to sleep with words but their body language will tell you loud and clear\nHaving a stroke you just need to know the sudden signs look for fast F. A. S. T. F.\nFace driven a weakness or his speech difficulty then tee time time to call nine one one immediately because as soon as they get to the hospital sooner they'll get treatment and that can make a remarkable difference in their recovering no the sudden sign face arm\nSpeech time spot a stroke fast visit stroke association duck or\nBrought to you by the American stroke association in the county [noise]\n\nI like to welcome you back to the trading group show this show is about an amazing opportunity we say make five hundred of five thousand dollars a day like Michael said you can make more than that but this is what I Love about this opportunity\nAnd I want you to hear that anybody can do it anybody what makes it phenomenal and makes people laugh is my wife has even said that when she sat in on a session\nAnd she said John this is so easy I think even you could do it [laughter] and and that is so true I'm not tech savvy I'm not Internet savvy I'm One of those guys who needs a dumb phones I even I struggle with my smartphone every day and even I got this\nIt was absolutely like Michael says really easy\nAnd our mentor he monitors you and the session and and that helps out a lot too because it's nice to have the software and it's nice to have the expertise but to have him there motivating you and telling your stuff and his analogies are spot on they make everything so easy to understand\nSo that knowledge that you get in my opinion is second to none you'll walk away with a Harvard degree in making money or how do you get involved\nYou call eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nAnd someone will answer the phone and get you in the session and Michael and I will go over that now Michael how can you get involved\nA thinks John you know first of all ... just to make sure we're clear you're not technically going to get a Harvard degree or just an analogy there folks but um you are going to get an education and\nThat's what makes us different from other trading groups is that our mentors providing an education most groups you show up and if it's live you're usually just reading a software\nIf it's alive group you're sitting in session and I've been part of this if there's nothing going on\nIf there is not an active trade developing there's just nothing there is just silence no talking and you can attest to this year in the group and um you know our mentor is never quiet so\nBetween what we would call action he's providing an education to everyone in the group and like you said John you're going to receive the\nUtmost level of education from one of the for most people in the industry he wrote this program he developed this program research this program for over twenty six years and he put it all together and then he put it into a format\nHe coined the phrase stinking Korean\nSo that he simplified it into a process that anybody can do it it's a simple follow along color coded system that he verbally describes as well as it's happening there is no panicking needed when you're involved in our mentor actually verbally talks you through it\nThere's a precise entry point and it's clear as day right on the screen so when we say the system is very simple and and it's written on an elementary level it's color coded and then on top of that you're being verbally instructed\nSo it provides a level of mental comfort that you're doing the right thing at the right times it's just reinforcement and on top of that the accuracy of the software and it signals\nIs unprecedented compared to anything else I've ever seen and I've shopped more than twenty different programs if you want to see it here it and witness this for yourself\nWe don't want you to believe what we're saying here on the show\nWe want you to see it\nThen you can believe us after you see it\nYou can call us at our eight hundred number after you've come in and sat in on a session and let's talk about any differences you might have seen between what you saw in the real session and what we talked about on the radio I I'd love to hear if there was anything that you thought was different because\nIf anything I feel like on the show we under state things um we like to be very conservative with our expectations I'm not gonna sit here and and talk about hey you know we had someone in the group that make twenty thousand dollars in a day or is this guy over here routinely makes ten thousand dollars in a day\nI don't like to emphasize those types of stories what I'd rather say is that an average person is going to make five hundred dollars a day maybe a thousand dollars a day and maybe more than that so if this is something that you might want to take advantage of give us a call\nEight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven that eight eight eight six four six eight seven eight seven\nYou're spot in a couple of our sessions there is no cost to you all you have to do is make that reservation we have people right now answering the phone is live\nI'm so give us a call check this out and and see this for yourself see if it's right for you you can witness real people\nAre trading real money our phone lines do get busy during the show this is hugely popular like I said we welcome to a lot of members just within the last month and this really is the new age of income\nIf people can trade in their current job\nAnd get out of their traditional habits you know it's interesting when you think about traditional habits it's like\nYou know my dad had a J. O. B. E. or my mom had a ... and you know they're just used to that and you know back in the day hey if you want to make more money will go out and get another job that pays more\nAnd with this this is completely different you don't even have to leave your house all you need is a computer and Internet service\nSo check us out for yourself I'm at the very least you can probably replace your current income or the more likely you can far surpass that\nAnd uh you know I Want to comment on what I said at the beginning you're right they won't get a Harvard degree because that cost about three hundred grand\nAnd uh and and now you come out with a degree and then you have to pay that back now you have to get a job and pay back\nSo are there other trading schools but there are two things they don't have our software\nAnd the leadership of our mentors we have the software and the leadership of our mentor every morning he he gets as motivated his leadership and personalities and ... it's like a classroom and it'll it literally it'll change the way you think\nUh I don't think the way I used to anymore at all or he reduces the variables in this thing to make it where you can make more money\nBut what's more important is his passion or isn't just getting people to make more money his passion is also in people keeping it which is so important\nWhen I got involved in this I was building my nest and now what I'm doing is building my nest egg and I want a big oil ostrich egg or like you said I don't want to say how much I made last week\nBut let's just say I did better last week than in any job I've ever had and that's working just two hours a day\nAnd I I did I think eleven trades nine were winners and the other two I did wrong I I didn't really I didn't exactly stick to the plan I didn't follow our mentor\nAnd are the two I did wrong I did on my own so that's that was my fault you start you start to think you know what you're doing and that's kind of when you hit into trouble\nSo where else are you going to find a group like this where you have a mentor like we have to guide you only are trading group has mentors like we have to guide you\nAnd only our group has the software program we have to guide you and make this easy like Michael says this is the new age of earning a like you said I was raised to think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Kimmer Show", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "13"}
