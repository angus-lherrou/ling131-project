more my books from the new talk more than six seven\nJust realize you know you're when you're talking about these streets were blocked off in downtown Atlanta\nOn prior streets [noise]\nAtlanta pd led a fire rescue and the FBI\nAre investigating a suspicious package there at the post office that Jay this suspicious packages addressed to the CNN Center\nHere in Atlanta and are just talking with some of my uh so my sources\nAnd it looks like this will now be the fifteenth\nPipe bomb\nThat was set from Florida\nAs you know\nSo he's our our cherry say oc is in custody\nFor fourteen of the devices so I'm sure you'll have another federal charge added on to that you do in court today in federal court in Florida it's not sure if he will love\nIf he will wave extradition back up to New York because the cases being handled the southern district of New York and you ask why it's because that's where the first\nOf the suspicious packages that were address to what George Soros that's where it was found and the FBI when they open up a case\nThe New York field office will be the office of origin for that particular case no matter how many more came up so now with this look like it will be the fifteenth\nSuspicious package slash pipe bomb\nHe will ah I'm sure he's ... he's since he's already in custody\nYou'll just probably add that on at a later date as an additional charge but uh but again the suspicious package that was addressed to CNN Center\nOn centennial Olympic Park drive it looks as if it is the fifteenth\nPipe bomb involved\nIn this particular case out of a out of Florida so we'll keep you advised on that\nBut um that area will probably be shut down for some time as they go through once they find one suspicious packages they'll go and they'll look a for others you know we're talking friday that we didn't know and the FBI didn't know if there were more packages out there\nSo again yeah we've now have\nOne cent to Atlanta could there be could there possibly be sent to other people here in Atlanta in the Atlanta metro absolutely they're good\nHow quickly until those ... charges the new charges would be brought against him would they be able to make today's court\nOr it's or do they have to have men do the pay I mean how did you know that would that will they will they'll wait so go ahead and process this and they only added\nExactly and then uh then you'll have in a new indictment\nOr out of out of here I was a federal court here in Atlanta and then\nIt'll just be tacked on to the to the other charges um you know just just like do he's going to be in court in Florida now I'm going to tell you more about that but let me let me let's get I Want to get back to we're talking about the synagogue going to be taking your calls as well\nThe synagogue attack I was telling you I was listening to it as it was as good as it was happening and I'm telling you folks\nIt was a listening to the the the voices of the officers they did a hell of a job\nThey did a hell of a job they they they really did so the shooter he went in\nShot shut up shut a bunch of people\nThen he was running out when he was confronted by what did the first officers on the scene they got into a gun battle right there in front of the synagogue the shooter ran back inside ran up to the third floor went back into a classroom\nSlash office on the third floor and barricaded himself their snipers were set up around the perimeter notes neighbors you know they're they're looking for a ...\nFor the guy\nLooking for the shooter as well is trying to glean any kind of intelligence you know what they can see and then they will related back to the command post and to the officers on the inside\nAgainst say oc for now the fifteenth\nPipe bomb sent through the mail and and people are saying well they're not really bombs you know they said the FBI said we're in this year\nBut it's still considered a pipe bomb why what did you hear FBI Director re talk about on friday and what ... what have you heard me talking about the last number of days last week when we were dealing with this and talking about a year on a micro show\nAnytime you send any energetic material\nWhether it be powder from fireworks and they're still doing all the\nAnalysis right now whenever you send anything like that through the mail it still even if it didn't have a new share it still could be susceptible to heat shock and friction and he got an energetic material like that so it could be you know whether it be a\nThey took apart fireworks he took fireworks apart dumped them all together\nWhether it was black powder any of that that still considered an explosive device so right now back to I'm Talking about what's going on in Pittsburgh with the shooting at the er at the synagogue up in a squirrel hill area\nWell you know there's a Jewish group now up in Pittsburgh\nThat ah released a letter an open letter signed by more than sixteen thousand people to President Trump saying he is unwelcome in the city unless he denounced as white nationalism\n[laughter]\nHe he had he has denounced white supremacist before a number of times\nSo\nHow can how can they blame this on President Trump I I have no idea\nThere's there's no way that they can blame that on President Trump\n\nA man let me let me most they froze nobody was up ... for the last ...\nWhat are the charges were given the ship the a package of ... was I'm off threaten the life of a former president yes what shows Obama so why are they doing the same thing all the celebrities who are threatened watch all of our actual president\nIn office I get that I mean is it because he's a Republican or [laughter]\nWell you know the um ... ... with the package\nSince he actually sent an explosive device trying to reach the former president that's a reason to charge you know the secret service has gone out and they had spoken to a number you know Kathy Griffin on down they've spoken to a number of people of about uh about some of their rhetoric some things are saying\nUh you know getting Kathy Griffin was one of the very first ones that that uh they went to speak to when she\nHad that uh that that he had that looked like the bloody had\nSevered head that looked like President Trump yeah the secret service has paid a number of these ah these idiots a visit and now you've got that the article in the New York times about a fictional assassination plot what\nPeople people people are idiots there but no that's the reason why because they were dated actually tried to send a package mo thank you for your call but to actually send a package to a former president so that's the reason that the reason he was charged with that particular church\nState that girl nobody what's up\nHey where'd you know when we say to read outside this door you were talking about all\nThe left is trying to paint Trump hasn't being literally Hitler because he said he was a national uh when they totally\nDiscount the fact that the Nazis were national socialists they believe in off the entire socialist part of it yeah it uh\nYeah now do you want to know how I that's why you have a ... started up by George Lincoln Rockwell in Arlington, Virginia back in the late fifties early sixties you know the national socialist white people's party the America which is the American Nazi Party you know but yeah people people forget about it that people forget\nAbout that\nAnd you didn't want to blame him for this mass shooting well are we going to blame Obama for the uh the pulse nightclub shooting aware forty
