tomorrow afternoon FBI special agent in charge Robert Jones said it was the most horrific crime scene he has observed and he was twenty two years with the FBI or\nThe prescription will be different if it is a younger investor\nI'd have a longer time horizon the conversation might be on coaching them on how do you take this volatility in the market instead of becoming busy you use it to your advantage by buying one that's on sale and locking and the games when it's up\nThat is a prudent style of investing now the closer I get to retire\nThis this this could be serious with the stock market you need to have that risk\nControlled to where we're still taking advantage of volatility in the market ups and downs but at the same time we're on the small or roller coaster we don't need to be on the big ride at Six Flags\nOut and on for dear life and our knuckles or white because we can we're we're holding all we got the death grip on the rollercoaster [laughter] we don't need to be there when we're closer to retirement\nVolatility is not our enemy Ron but we'll we got to take advantage of the volatility and we got to control it and the prescription is to have a stress test\nPerformed on your portfolio to really see how much riskier taking and really what kind of return or are you getting for the rest of your taking\nI don't want to be rock and roll and quite a bit hard to like those ride [laughter] give me the game either I'm a grown out of them into a saying that you have another patient who has problems with paralysis in his or her financial decision making process because this person feels that then they have too many investment options to choose one\nOr ... doctor okay so that's called paralysis by analysis sometimes so one thing I think we're really good here at ... and the group is that we'll be explained things in a way Ron but it's so simple\nFolks she'd do not need to have a finance degree to come in here and learn about your portfolio you don't need to have a finance degree to be able to understand what our solution would be to fix your situation I feel like my whole team\nHas been educated on how to explain things in a simple matter you know my my oldest granddaughter is going into middle school next year\nSo she's like what's that sixth grade seventh grade yeah back when she was in the fifth grade I told my team I said you know what I Want to be able to explain things to my clients\nWhere you don't have to be smarter than a fifth grader you know that show that Jeff Foxworthy used to host yes you don't need to be smarter than a fifth grader to understand what we're saying and that's one of the compliments I hear all the time around is that\nI've learned so much in just coming and visiting with you on what my portfolio is doing what retirement is supposed to look like what retirement you know am I able to retire when I Want to retire these are the things I was able to learn by just sitting down and talking to you folks\nAnd you've done it in a way where I understand it that is the best compliment we can hear here in our firm and we hear it all the time I'm just so proud of that\nYeah well that takes care of two patients that you've seen today now already run behind schedule like most doctors do [laughter] so we got other people in the waiting room and here's another one who says that he has high levels of anxiety from watching the news every day what do you tell him\nOh well you've got to understand something that when you're dealing with the news with the media by design they're trying to make you anxious truth anxious means that you're going to stay tuned in the more you're tuned in the more commercials you're watching and listening to\nAnd the more commercials you watch and listen to hopefully you're spending but those people that you're listening and watching the commercials from that's all about ratings and it's all about producing revenue for that TV station and it's like when you know bad storm is on the way we kinda gravitate\nTo the weather channel right well it's the same thing when this bad news in the market would gravitate to to the media to find out what's going on why did the Dow lose five hundred points today\nHere's the bottom line there's nothing wrong with learning something\nBut you've gotta have the right mentality you've got to have the comfort level and this all goes back to really do you know what you're invested in the you know what your risk is\nDo you have the appropriate amount of risk for where you're at in your life and can you sleep at night knowing\nYou know what your portfolio could potentially do not if the market goes down but when the market goes down do you really know what's gonna happen if you don't have the answers to those questions you've got to really learn you really need to take the time to learn\nWe have seen here in twenty Eighteen Ron more and more and more volatility and you don't need to get all anxious and and be worried all the time if you knew the answers to these questions you could in fact\nHave the opportunity to have less stress and more more relaxation and be able to sleep at night and this is all part of knowing being better educated and then again that's what we do here at the white group and would advise are\nFolks we're well known for a long time but mark ... is your financial maestro but you might not have known that he is your financial position as well so\nOkay and Mr rock and roll doctor okay tell us about this poor patient who suffers from high blood pressure resulting from anger about bad financial advice that they got from somebody else in the past\nWell the key word there is in the past ... you know but some of the things you can't cry over spilt milk or water under the bridge or in fact something over the damn yeah water out of there [laughter] I mean you know you you look into its history its history you just don't repeat the same mistakes\nYou know again one thing that we try to point out to our clients is that\nIt's all about transparency it's about having regular meetings and having regular checkups and having regular education a little bit so that you can stay on top and and really have more peace of mind and comfort that you know what's going on you're not sitting here guessing whether or not you're making a mistake or not\nSo part of it is the ongoing relationship that you should be having with your financial advisor\nIf you're a self investor and you're and you're still angry about something you know the bottom line is you know if it's been fixed than just psychologically it it's not healthy to continue to be mad about it yeah don't get ... on the move on and say okay that's in the past\nThere is nothing I can do about it but I learned from that and now we can move forward you know with better decisions\nAnd when you sat there and read that Ron I thought to myself\nHow about all those folks out there through the years who bought variable annuities yes right I mean everybody who's been listening to show for a long period of time those how I feel about variable annuities\nI mean I you know this past week I had a a family that came in\nAnd their broker sold them to variable annuities but a big chunk of their portfolio was into variable annuities and the fees were sky high the money was tied up in the investments really didn't perform because the fees were eating into the returns\nIt just made me sad if anything I got mad I got mad because of\nHow they were taken advantage of but at the end of the day you that was all fixable we were able to fix it for the people and that's what above the bottom line is if you can move forward and let that\nBad baggage just build behind you and not worry about it anymore and look at the bright side look at what the what positive things you've done or what positive things you can do moving forward that's what it's all about\nDon't need no baggage you just get on board here you go you remember this other song called the well it was called tossing and turning I could\nHardly at all I'll ask my body was that Bobby Darin [laughter] and now I live with oh last night as lobby Lewis Bobby Lewis his body\nNow this patient complaints of losing sleep because he or she is retiring soon and worried about not having enough money\nRon that's number one concern we hear about on financial Seventy radio every week is I don't know if I can afford to retire when I Want to retire I don't have a plan in place I'd I don't know how much I'm going to spend I just know what my Social Security is going to be and I may have or may not have a pension that's what I hear every week\nAt the end of the day when we plug the all the numbers in and we sit down and we take a look at what these folks have saved\nHow much is their nest egg worth and then I sit down and I look at how much of their lifestyle expense and I'm not talking about what's all your bills I'm Talking about how much money do you spend on a monthly basis and in a perfect world\nI Would love for you to be able to continue to spend what your use\nRocks because they take them to find just the right notes\nAnd ... my knees are playing ... years together you should try to make sure it's perfect plan for\nHow visible your final term nice to Michael late in the Atlanta area ... eight hundred setting for nine four to eight eight eight hundred seven for nine forty two eighty eight\nMusicians get into\nWithout Palmer gaining the performance will suffer and found\nIt won't be music terriers [noise]\nTuning in the financial world is equally important [noise] make sure your financial planning pitch perfect by calling today committed when your financial my son Michael ... serving the Atlanta area\n... eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight eight hundred Seventy four nine forty two eighty eight [noise]\n\nJohnny Cash at the state was approached by an advertising company gave permission to ease ring of fire on an ad for him right ... ... ... on a similar note here at the financial symphonies we requested that Johnny Cash and the date allow us to use Folsom Prison blues are theme song\nThat requests for South every few but keep listening anyway\nWelcome back to the financial symphonies right sets along with mark Lloyd I get the opportunity to hang out with mark for awhile today on all of our shows is one of my main pleasures in life Marc I'd just like hanging out with you and learning a lot too\nIt's great that you can learn a lot from mark Lloyd as well you might not be on the radio with him but you get an opportunity to learn from all of his expertise when it comes to financial planning eight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight eight hundred seven for nine four to eight at your number to call to make it happen\nNow mark is the founder and the principal at the ... group and Lloyd advisory services also throw in Lloyd learning center locations all over the Atlanta area can certainly help you and all you got to do is reach out with a phone call no obligation no conversation conversation about\nYour financial future and your retirement planning eight hundred seven four nights four to eight eight\nEight hundred seven for nine four to eight eight called that number and get on the counter\nIn lots of times mark dislike any decisions in life making financial decisions would certainly be a lot easier with the benefit of hindsight yeah today I I thought we could talk about some of the things that you might hear from people who wish they had done differently hanging in the rearview mirror\nYeah so what you're saying that like would've could should\nUh [laughter] back and isn't that I left there isn't that a nice reflection on you when you're looking to get [laughter]\nThe first one of my list here is a lot of people and we talked about this so many times and I got scared after two thousand eight I put my money in cash and now I'm kicking myself are missing a great decade and the stock market yeah yeah that's yeah we\nWe we see that situation periodically and I I just my heart just bills for\nYou know I get it because in some cases it's even to this day mark I don't regret that decision because at least I Know I'm not going to lose because I'm In cash\nBut the problem is they're losing money safely Ron and we're starting to see now thanks to the feds are raising interest rates the economy is starting to move faster and that's what the feds do they bump up interest rates when that happens\nBond markets to take a hit when that happens we also see that when that happens inflation rises\nAnd if you're not investing and even if it's in a safe bucket of money where you don't have to worry about market volatility if you're not getting enough interest on your portfolio\nThen you're losing money safely if you're not beating inflation and unfortunately that's what we see I've had many folks\nYou know they they still are just as aggressively in the stock markets that now is they were back then\nAnd they don't even need to be I see the opposite so it's the kind of thing where it's a balance it really needs you need to have you know a diversified portfolio that's blended in many many different kinds of investments so that you're not relying on getting in and getting out\nMarket timing is hard for even the best money managers so I don't expect you to do it yourself or to be able to time the market adult\nSo how do we how do we avoid timing the market\nWell according to many many study that's out here one has it been since Ninety two percent of the of what grows your portfolio in the market is asset allocation how you have the pieces of pie in your portfolio designed\nWhat we do really well here is asset allocation designing a strategy to protect you designing strategy to mitigate the risk designing a strategy for some folks to minimize the risk designed the strategy for most folks that we let the risk work for us\nSo it depends upon your situation and your risk tolerance and if you felt a need to go to cash in two thousand and eight and you still hadn't gotten out\nYou know ... you say well the markets at an all time on the market doesn't notes at an all time high\nAnd the ... well you got to look at the economy and as long as the economy is moving forward there's ways of working around volatility to still make money and you need to be taken advantage of it because we know inflation is rising we've just seen recent reports of that it's rising and your interest rates are keeping up with a\nMark you know we have taught countless times about how most people have no idea what kind of risk there is in their portfolios and I'm sure you have a lot of people come in to meet with you for the first time and they've said gee I Wish we don't have much risk we had before we took this huge loss what do you tell him\nThey never had a stress test I said you know the thing about working with our firm is that our portfolios that we've designed and put together all these years every quarter we stress test them we stress test our own portfolios\nSo that we know it's staying within the guard rails at staying within the fairway staying within the lines to make sure that the risk is what it needs to be for our clients wellbeing for our clients tolerance for our clients happiness for our clients needs\nWere constantly stress testing our own portfolios to see where they're at\nSo if you don't have an advisor stress testing your portfolio on a regular basis the risk of getting higher and higher and higher and they can get out of whack it's like checking your blood pressure if you didn't go and have regular checkups the doctor or if you didn't have your blood pressure checked regularly how do you know if your blood pressure is not I\nWas the same thing with your risk if you're not having your portfolio stress tested how do you know if it's in line of where it needs to be based on your particular situation and I like to say based on your comfort level sometimes I've got a coach people abroad I got to tell them we need to take a little bit more risk\nWith other folks I can sit there and say whoa\nYou don't need all that risk we could actually take less risk and still accomplish their goals\nAnd you know that's what a coach does it coach will coach you and what you need to where you need to be and what you need to do so in this case right here when I see that that could have been avoided you got to work with the people that are managing risk officially for ya\nAnd again we've said there's so many times as well everybody's situation is different there is no generic solution everybody's problems everyone is unique you know here here's a decision that people have to make it at one time on Social Security and there's so many options to consider and I know that folks have come in and they told you gee mark or\nShould have waited to start taking my Social Security later once you do it you can't oh yeah\nYeah I had a married couple of days came and said yeah I I I started my wife's early so when she died she is not going to get on mine is she I said well no it's going to be a pro rated 'em out but\nThat's not the end of the world but what I tried to do is I Try to with all of my clients have not taken Social Security yet\nWe're going to run a complementary Social Security optimization report where we're going to look at the other income that you have coming in and if you have a pension we're going to look at the other income that your portfolio can generate\nAnd we're going to say based on that we feel that it's an optimal time at this time and whenever whenever that time is that you should turn your Social Security on and if you are a married couple\nWe know that when one spouse passes away the other spouse loses it you know one spouse the surviving spouse loses one of the paychecks one of the Social Security check so we know that based on that and especially if there's a gap of age between the husband and the wife or the wife and the husband\nWere going to look at when is the optimal time to turn there's on\nSo by doing that our clients are maximizing their cash flow or maximizing their income and that's what we're trying to do with all the decisions we make with these portfolios so if you don't have an adviser who's doing Social Security optimization I'd be concerned with that if they're just doing investing and they're not they're not looking at a holistic approach\nTo everything that the that affects retirement\nYou need to be possibly going for a second opinion and you're going to have an opportunity here a few minutes to learn how to do that\nIf you're a climate all a group and wine and visors services and you know mark Lloyd the financial maestro then you're up to date on what's happening in your portfolio and and certainly gets adapted from time to time has to be quick sometimes and you can't just assume that your broker who are and that is\nIs taking care of fix there are folks who come in and say mark I should have put more money in a rough\nIRA instead of saving so much in my four oh one K. what's your response to that yeah I had another family we were helping\nYou can put that in where the money is liquid but it's earning higher interest and dividends some of them almost five percent per year of interest and dividends coming in and we can get to the money anytime we need it and it doesn't it doesn't have nowhere near the volatility the stock market\nAnd at the same time that money right there can be working for you instead of losing money safely by earning zero interest of the bank so definitely bad there's options out there\nYou need to come in and we can show you how it all works in the end again one thing where we do our educators\nSo we're going to explain to you the advantages and disadvantages of many different kinds of strategies that would work for that that money sitting there doing nothing\nOur next question comes from Jack in Jasper jak says I counted up all the mutual funds and ... and it appears that I have thirty three different funds is that adequate diversification\nWe don't know I mean the it's a lot of stuff we run what we call an overlap report and what that is jak is that we would literally sit there and break down and dissect those thirty three different funds and see what it's invested in\nI have found many many times many times through the years\nThat it's all invested in the same stuff for the majority of its invested in the same stuff and it just like you got to add One Fund do the whole thing and probably save money\nBut he just didn't know any better and when you have thirty three different funds I bet you don't know how much each one of those funds costs and if and if you are one of the types of investors who read every fine print on that real thin paper called her perspective is and you try to figure out what the cost of that fund is\nDo you know what the turnover cost is what that is the big ass spread that the people on the floor of the stock exchange buying and selling so the more turnover that's inside of that bond is creating a hidden feet that you might not know\nYou know I Know exactly how much my wife is spending at the grocery store for different items if you get a loaf of bread or if you get the gallon of milk and my mom and even knows which grocery stores have the cheapest milk and the cheapest cheapest orange juice at Ninety years old she knows that\nShe does a great job of shopping frugally\nBut you are so many folks out here who have no clue of how much their portfolio is costing them so if you came into our office very complimentary review we would tell you that that's just one thing that we go over we not only go over how much risk you have in your portfolio and are you getting the results for the risk you're taking\nThe risk versus reward but we actually go and look at what kind of income your portfolio should generate we look at the overlap report and see if you're in it get true diversification\nWe look and see if this portfolio is enough saved to be able to retire comfortably and and we do a portfolio stress test on it to see based on many many different scenarios if the portfolio work to lose money in the market\nWhat kind of effect would this have on you we do all of that and we don't charge anything for it\nBut if you do have to invest time\nYou have a requirement to invest some of your time and come in and have a chat with us at one of our
