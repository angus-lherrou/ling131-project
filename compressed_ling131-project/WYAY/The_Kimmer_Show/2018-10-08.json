we've got a storm that could be coming this way [noise]\nThat right now I I think it's a tropical depression\nBut as it moves through the Gulf I think it's supposed to hit\nLand somewhere around Panama City beach somewhere around there and there's so many variables about if we're going to get rain here if we're not\nBut if there's one man that can answer all those questions that is the\nOfficial meteorologist or the Mike broke show actually with Fox five land to meteorologist Ryan ... easily have I'd rather die for joy the show brother ... time\nAbsolutely might my pleasure thanks for having me again so we'll let me answer some of your your statements right up back\nSo we have hurricane Michael ooh yes um you know\nIt rapidly developed in the last twenty four hours so it went from a depression to a tropical storm to a hurricane very quickly much sooner than what we were first\nDating um I guess on friday we'll give that window um and now it's expected to strengthen into a major hurricane or\nWhich is a category three hurricane with a hundred and twenty miles an hour when and make landfall near Panama City\nWow and what is that supposed when approximately when do you think that'll happen right\nWednesday afternoon wow\nOr Wednesday when a Wednesday It's MORNING or Wednesday afternoon and what's interesting\nIs that that's one where anticipating our greatest impact is late Wednesday into Thursday this is going to be a very fast moving storm especially once it gets into the northern Gulf and went after it makes landfall\nSo um it's not going to linger it's not going to sit there it's not a huge flooding threat like Florence was right of course there were still be flooding um you know in locations that it hits\nBut I think that the biggest story with Florence or will be the wind um and how far inland we see tropical storm or even a hurricane force winds\nWith Michael yeah gotcha yeah now why why is the movie so fast 'cause usually when it gets overland doesn't usually slowed down a little bit\nIt depends um lately a lot of them are a lot of storms have gained traction had been the ones that salt stalled out right there is a cold front I'm Out in the mid west right now that spawning tornadoes\nThat same cold front is going is the main staring current of Michael so it's going once it picks up the storm that cold front\nHas a train of um fall error right behind it yeah and it is really pushing that fund pretty quickly so the hurricane is going to merge with that fine and move and it takes\nSo that's why it's going to pick up speed 'cause we know cold front come through pretty quickly right and that's what this one's going to do because it finally has enough for seeing from that cool crusts Canadian air this time of year and we're talking about hides in the seventies all weekend long\nOh well now is that why when it passes it's going to it at the front the cold front is going to be coming in and then pushing the storm yeah it ... it up got yeah from\nIt literally picks it up and what what another important factor or what that steering mechanism is the stronger Michael gets\nThe sooner it's going to feel that cold front to the west a do it or if it was a week it would live there and you know and be able to go farther north before taking its eastern right this stronger Michael is it's going to want to go away from that coal front\nAnd feel those upper level when and it's going to go off to the east which is good news for us because the sooner it takes that right term right the the less likely we will have um great impact will still have some\nBut they won't be as great gotcha hum so there are interesting factors here timing is going to be everything while all the time that it makes that white turned could be the difference between twenty mile an hour wind and one inch of rain versus sixty mile an hour wind and you know four inches of rain\nWow I'm so that's what we're going to be watching very closely I Know it's it's it's unbelievable I was telling our I'm One of our producers this morning twenty miles is going to be just a twenty mile shift could mean such a huge difference for our impacts wow\nThey were working for the most part\nThe uh the organizers were ... were basically given them a heads up so they had enough wagons into had enough personnel there to uh to handle situation except for on Saturday on the steps they had put the barricades up and the people jumped over the barricades and went up the steps of the capital\nAnd uh then that that's when they push back down to locked up a hundred hundred fifty some odd people so\nI thought that was on the Supreme Court visit the capital\nCapital in Supreme Court there was about a hundred and fifty total arrest\nYeah OK okay and that then the capital itself it looks I mean it ... and they needed it looks like they're running around the house of the capital all the times that wrong or I'm just seeing something wrong you\nKnow the they they will allow you to come in and uh go up into the gallery\nBut ah usually they restrict you just certain certain hallways within the capital or the Capitol rotunda those kinds of things are certain areas where you can go and certain areas where you can't go but uh I didn't know that then they also run tours\nYou know after they had the guy who shot up the um the capital and shot and killed to Capitol police officers one of them was a very good friend of mine back in ... in Nineteen Ninety eight then they started and they built that whole capital visitor's center\nOr where do you have to go in and that's where you get signed up for the for the formal tours of the capital ... taken around by tour guide and that kind of thing so\nYep yep drives me crazy scene that's ...\nI'm I'm telling you and and my hat's off to the guys to the men and women of the of the U.S Capitol police they did a I think they did a hell of a job this weekend you know corral and all those animals in the\n... getting keeping them from getting up and it was it takes so much Lisa thanks so much they are thinking and job it was interesting watching some of the ... look watching some of the stuff that live on a on Facebook\nAnd hearing these you get to see one of the Capitol police officers at the top of the steps after they cleared the steps off\nYou saw him standing there with a with a rifle you know with the machine gun well those that that's the I'm a member of the ... team US Capitol police has basically their own SWAT Team as well it's called the search team that containment an emergency response team\nAnd you are and they were Halloween when they couldn't get their way they started hollering at the cops they started holler at the Capitol police F the police F ... almost a deaf were\nAfter police F your gun after police don't to all kinds of stuff\nBut uh yeah they turn their they turned her and just to the police because they weren't letting them on the Capitol Steps so the snowflake started belt and down and turned it all against the police so\nWhat do we know what are you going to do what are you going to do it you can't please
