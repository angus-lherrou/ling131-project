thank you and so does my Thirteen year old son who has an egg and peanut allergy\nReally yes only told\nBy his allergist that the peanut is a very highly genetically modified food\nAnd that's why there's so many kids now ... interesting that you know a long time ago on plantations on farms this was one of the first food they used to give kids they smash up the peanuts and made it to them when they were babies but now it's been so highly modified our bodies react to it\nInteresting did they did the allergist said whether it's um something that they use may be you know in growing the peanut or is it just they just messed with it so much that it's a genetic mutation of a peanut\nThey've messed with it so much [noise] wow\nI Know [laughter] and so now when you talk about like kids have all these other allergies you know lactose um there was a child and my daughter's class she's allergic to Apple's fine you know it it kind of starts to make a little bit of sense I guess because these things had been messed with so much\nWhile it there's so many now cheap allergic to just one variety of Apple's ... a lot of apples\nUm [laughter] I don't know I didn't get a lobster the effects were just for told please don't send apples as a snack like as a class\nNow that we would God I'm it's you know next thing is going to be old they can't can't eat orange is you know I mean my goodness so it it's crazy\nHow did you find out that your child had an egg allergy or a peanut allergy how'd you find that out originally\nWell he was a ... a ... he had some digestive issues early on right and they did some um blood work and they saw the egg allergy in the blood work they did not see the peanut\nI'm In the peanut came about when he was about to I actually was eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I touched his face that peanut butter on my hands and the whole side of his face blew up like a balloon oh my God\nAnd I was like oh okay well you're not going to have that for lunch today [laughter] a while and his peanut allergy is very severe so we were very very fortunate that we actually never fed it to him\nWhile I'm surprised you know you look at a you look at the ingredients on different things and how much you know Peter peanuts and a lot of stuff\n[noise] yes or processed in a facility writing it I honestly think some of that is um to cover\nTheir behinds draw a line [laughter] you know [laughter] yeah definitely so All right came like taking my call and we love your show right thanks for the info thanks for listening preventive care already\nToo that there you go make sense admitted admits that makes total sense White House yeah what's happening\nGuys or did you ever get that student uh or allergies against a repeat\nAgain with no no it's just you know it's my my rear end starts ... no matter what it is [laughter]\nThey let me talk to your survey about and thank God this lady was talking about gee alone and get a lot of ... organisms yeah it's absolutely amazing I I was\nTwo hundred and thirty three pounds I'm now one sixty eight and I did it all of that by getting on its host is an intermittent fasting and going basically organic I've cut out all the\nVegetables and things I eat you know raises naturally and it it's a it's astounding what the federal government allows we ship the tea out of the country they treat their apples with it and ship them back to us\nNow how do you know everything you have no because of good things will have that organic label but how do we really know that is grown organically\nWe're all I Need it you know they they would be really a against lawsuits yeah if\nIt wasn't you know the thing is uh I go I Would ... less than a speech because if you see any videos of what they do these me they just put it this\nYear that a good modified and grain and you're getting that directly and then you know so now if you have allergies ah I think it comes to what she said I think I think the war that stage where\nThe populace has been so fast it's like I feel those corn syrup you realize that most people eat a hundred and thirty six pounds of sugar a year and that learn nets not any table sugar\nOh yeah all ended up products revive\nI think I just said a bunch of it with the with the candy corn I had\nYou know you expect that right and I'm not like I said I don't have a piece of cake you know I'm

weather\nWho do we turn to hear on the ... show a character the visual meteorologist other micro show Ryan Beijing who actually works for a ... but we don't tell anybody Ryan thanks for joining his brother\nAnd my thanks for having me on your show again\nAbsolutely so so I I was listening last night and a divide side and talk about this weather coming our way it doesn't say it sounds like it could be really bad\nI think the world storms will be ...\nOr south which is good good uh but we are still concerned about some severe thunderstorm warning for tomorrow what damaging wins being the highest concern wow I'm In a you know up to sixty miles per hour wind gusts possible embedded in this line\nUh one thing that people kind of let their guard down this is our second most active severe weather season here and I'm\nReally in the Atlanta area yeah huh I have no idea\nI Love people say that and um it's a very common for us to get severe weather around the end of October in the beginning of November because we're in a very proactive weather pattern but we're seeing one coal fun after another change\nIn season on anything you get a change in the ... and the you know on the grand scheme of the atmosphere is concerned you're going to have some sort of disturbance that you know is going to fire up some storms ... and that's what we're going through right now\nYeah 'cause I was I was going to ask you you know is is there are some big front that was moving through but you know it it is so where's this weather where this where they're coming from\n... it's in the architect region right now so we kind of right and the heels of the Mississippi Delta and they actually have um an enhanced with today for severe storms across Louisiana\nA with a pretty I Would call a hatched risk for tornadoes which is usually a pretty clear sign that they're going to have tornadoes in Louisiana today\nOh man um and\nSo you know a lot of people ask me is that the same storm system heading in our direction the answer it yet\nBut thankfully it won't be as strong for us because it's not going to have the same ingredients that they ... the storm system has today for tomorrow all things given were very fortunate as far as where we wind up with this storm\nSee them but it's still something that you know I wanted to text you about yeah hey I think this one's talking about we're talking about heavy rain\nWe're talking about the possibility for some strong to severe thunderstorms and it's one of those days where I wouldn't be surprised if people get caught off guard when this one of them are storm storms roll through\nWhat time are what what timeframe are we looking at right now of the of the worst weather coming through uh Atlanta right\nOr it looks like Thursday early afternoon through the evening\nCommute um love I\nYeah I Know a your morning commute still looks okay there's now some indication we can have some spy showers in the morning but the main lines going to come through in the afternoon Noonan evening and then it's a very slow moving\nAnd we could even have a good amount of lingering showers into friday as well but the severe parts can be right on the leading edge of the cold front\nThat initial line that you get wherever you are that's going to be the worst part of this storm system\nNow you say the worst of it is going to be two hours south how how far south will it be\nSo I mean a areas along I twenty and south are included in a marginal risk which we call a level one of one out of five at Fox five and then down a unfortunately right were you know Michael hit on the Florida Panhandle there are no level to\nUm as far as damaging\nAnd the possibility for some tornadoes but as well to ourselves a down towards the Florida Panhandle\nWow [laughter]
