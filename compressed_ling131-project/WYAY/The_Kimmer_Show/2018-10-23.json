Atlanta\nIt's come out now on a social media on the eve of her first debate\nAnd a\nGuess who released the information I mean that's why it whenever they release something like this in the end they make it sound like some big news story\nWas in New York Times well apparently it was an interview and I didn't know that they they make her out and say oh like she's just a woman who's been social justice warriors for her entire life\nYeah\nI'll tell you what though if you look if you looked at her now and you looked at her then you wouldn't recognize that's for sure no\nBecause there's a photo that appeared in the article and AJC from back in June of Nineteen Ninety two it showed Stacey Abrams\n\nThey've ... they've misspelled her first name a standing with students burning the Georgia

there was a caller called in a couple of months ago a couple of weeks ago is that they like they didn't mind like they like camera but then the other guy was okay to [laughter] you know the other guy\nI don't know [laughter] I guess maybe I Am\nAnyway which are um I I got so can I ask you ah have you ever heard of a thing called the October surprise\nYou know there's always an October surprise that comes up you know and uh and different elections in a different election cycles\nSo in a lot of people are thinking this is you know this might be that the October surprise you know or is this uh this thing for Stacey Abrams in ... in ... raises that the October surprise I you know who knows\nBut yeah I've heard October surprise there have been ... in different elections urban October surprise\nThat's pretty much what I was getting at I Believe you know I wasn't really I didn't really believe in a hurry to so many times from so many others\nThat are considered coops or conspiracy theorists whatnot right but you know I'm ... I'm beginning to believe in it because uh you know when they when they uh they pinch Trump for what he said on the hog Mike that was in October right a lot of things are going on\nBecause October ... and the nice strategic time right before these elections shorter it'd be the Senate or whether it be you know and and it's like a nice time to come at the very last final hour yup the thrown out on something like this or create some kind of a scenario and I think what they're trying to do is make Trump forced him to uh\nTo take military action against innocent people yeah uh at the at the border which he has every right to do\nShort on your ... hearing yep that's right\nIn the military is there to protect our country our sovereign nation and that's not necessarily in another land but especially in our own land and are these people can be considered invaders and they need to be told that\nHave the only than what they're actually doing\nYeah 'cause yesterday I was talking to Adam I'm just talking about this being an invasion and it is when you got how God Knows how many more people they are going to gather as they moved up as they move up through Mexico but\nThere's always hope that the hurricane Wilma L law will separate the ... the wheat from the chaff with these people you know ah I mean that that that hurricanes move gonna move be moving\nPretty close to their pass and or\nIt could affect them will we will see but uh and\nAnd and for and to think that they can go that far in this short amount of time\n... you know without a lot of financial help um without the trucks and gasoline preview provided for the trucks to move here I ... ... it's just it's it's ridiculous but\nYou know a ... you had more who called just admitted to go and uh he was trying to get me to say yeah oh yeah yeah I Believe this could help Trump because people I think are getting tired of\nThe antics of the Democrats are in a lot of them a lot of folks have been talking to who uh Leno a little bit on the left side they are tired of the tactics and the antics of a of of the Democrats right now they really are\nBecause you know it's it's it's been a ...\nYou look at the Capitol hearing and all that crap that they pulled then that was they thought that was the September surprise going into October but I think that backfired on them\nI really do Adam\nHe did it did I agree and the right to like a bunch of children who are not getting their way cetera and there'll be honest with you no matter who you are what you\nBelieve in you know ... if you call yourself a grown man a grown woman you don't act like children and these people are acting like children and I don't think they're being liberal is a bad thing or a Democrat I think no bad people have taken the name liberal and Democrat and and you don't need a bad name the liberals and Democrats are not like this\n... completely different animal these are communist or socialist or whatever you want to call their evil they're bad people and they've taken the name of liberalism\nAnd you know what you used to have made what I was trying to think you you sound like you sound like someone I Know that I had this almost the same exact discussion with 'em over the last week a couple of times and this person is more would consider themselves probably more liberal than they would uh\nYou know I'm a conservative\nBut they you know kind of right down the middle but but they're fed up with it to their age don't totally fed up with the antics of of the Democrats right now totally so\nI'll take it to your gum how'd you get good or they could backfire on them I really do and this whole blue wave that they're talking about you know I was reading your the numbers are from NBC News of of what a from NBC\nI'm so far in early voting it looks like the majority of the voters fifty two percent of the voters in so far in Georgia have are in affiliation with the Republican Party so\nBut you still need to get out there and vote that's for sure\nThey get a ... on our bodies\nThat you that you don't you can't you can't get complacent you just can't get complacent Tonya thanks for joined the\nMark how are you today it's Mike pretty good just good to talk to you Mike I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that's OK Mike yes ma'am I'm\nFirst of all I got to say something don't hang up on me [laughter]\nDo you see\n'em on wait a minute wait a minute here we go All right so this is the first thing mark ...\nWe're all a bunch of hypocrites okay cause\nWe go to church on Sundays and we claimed to love everybody\nEvery one that believes in Jesus in this country\nAnd then I don't I don't love every body but go [laughter]\nBut anyway I don't you don't love me I I've never met you how can I Love you but I as a religion as as a you know as he can give you a blood transfusion I'm only negative ... positive so that yeah it's pretty close [laughter] okay so here's my other point of you know what else\nUm let me see ... you know you keep on going to uh keep writing stuff\nThat's okay but don't make it you know come on okay okay okay even move uh [laughter] it makes me nervous and I don't know why okay and I don't know okay\nUh I got that part and let\nMe see oh jak go ahead [laughter] okay uh who benefits oh okay about the benefits from the the\nPeople I'm coming from South is it South America ...\nNo it's a from Honduras they started the doors then they've come through Guatemala they picked up some al Salvadorans and are there now into Mexico headed to the U.S border\nNow let me ask you this short this just your question yes your answer so now don't get the wrong way I'm just being like my own honesty\nGo ahead I'm a black person huh and we came out of slavery right All right so\nWhy wouldn't they benefit this country when we have the tendency\nTo pay people the least amount of money to get the work done and those people say well we can make more than five dollars a week we can now make thirty dollars a day or something like that but do you think about it\n... ... what what is your whole what is your point\nMy point is that it that it's like I'm just let the people that want to come to this country right are saying that well we don't want to be in I guess what they would call modern day slavery and then they're coming to this country to make more money so they can make a living\nWhat to do is what you know a lot of what the a lot of folks who have come here to the United states legally and that's the key word here tone you they've come here legally from central and South America and
