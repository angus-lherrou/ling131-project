it's just funny it's I think it's just pure projection because they haven't shown any civility are shown a complete lack of values\nOn their part the whole time so she just trying to get ahead of it and uh they just play to our sense of civility\nAnd they push and push and push and push until like they they old saying goes you know the battle I Am into a corner at will bite yeah it's just a matter of time before conservatives finally get fired\nBut you're right I agree there is you're right there is a ... and I think we're ... we're reaching that point but you know when when that type of Paul come from Maxine Waters we ... we we we do we kind of taken seriously but most of his brush it off because she's kind of a crazy old ... anyway you know what she is getting their faces at the
