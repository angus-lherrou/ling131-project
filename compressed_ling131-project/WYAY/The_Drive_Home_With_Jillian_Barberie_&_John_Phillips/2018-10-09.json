I I don't know if I misunderstood you weren't you talking about the guy Colorado to killed his family earlier yeah what do you yes fish oil Lola humanely they gave me the needle and let me do it myself\nWell you know they they're saying now that he was having an affair with some girl at work\nAnd yeah ... and apparently he asked his wife for a separation and then we're assuming that's what started some kind of a fight and that's when the police believe me just killed her and it but I I don't understand any I don't I don't know how you can kill a four year old in thirty thirty three year old your own daughters\nStir especially if he strangled others bare hands are I mean that just God I Can't I Can't imagine Colorado\nHad the death penalty or we know I don't\nYou know I'm not sure I\nI used to they used to have the firing squad Gary ... thank you I appreciate it if I if I'm not mistaken he wasn't very\nWell maybe that was Utah they might have been Utah to say that I think what is your toe in his firing squad yeah uh I don't know where the Colorado has the death penalty I'd I don't\nKnow but this I mean that's not good enough for this guy I mean to me the woman he was having an affair with only ... family over you know I Believe is reinstated in Nineteen Seventy four\nOkay there you go well good\n'cause he certainly qualifies for death by avalanche and you're right the ski slopes he's he now he's claiming that he came home to find one of his daughters dead and the other one being strangled by his wife and that's why he snapped in a fit of rage and killed his wife\nAnd revenge of the prosecutors aren't buying that but that's a record anyway I mean he just thinking about it I just can't imagine how you could fill your own three and four year old daughter's three thirty one\nNews recognized coming up hold on here's Ryan on the new talk one of those six seven hundred Ryan how's it going\nPretty good so along with I can listen you're in every so often it's

and I was so scared him I don't think you're in the closet [laughter]\nNot to\nNot vote here on a bad\nGuy and now and then\nIt was like do they use that they used to have an old circus act where the guy would get up in a like a two hundred foot pole\nAnd then they would win with orange and it was like now you're in a little\nWell it was part of a natural\nIt was part of a bathroom and I would go in the bathroom and we've got so scared frozen stiff I couldn't [laughter]\nWith the gay super let's not read everything ended as your mind is kind of in one area they're paid I'm willing to come out

signed up for a subscription to get a magazine I guess he's gay magazines [laughter] you know I don't mean to some\nGuy who was ... was doing the thing with them so you can get a a for for ... for a century so by the way I mentioned the reason I mentioned this lucid dreams is now there is a way to try to have you trigger a loose a dream where you know you're dreaming in your part of it uh it and you you can kind of control to\nResearch at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and the Institute in Hawaii\nAre investigating chemicals recalled inhibitors that promote looser dreaming they moderate Rehman sleep the deep sleep a they had a hundred and twenty participants drugs had and their dreams the more they took the more they had lucid dreams\nAh they would practice your dream induction techniques have the pill to then go back to sleep and it would trigger lucid dreams are available to they're trying to see if this was available to a wider population in other to perhaps help people deal with things like nightmares called LSD\nThat's another whole issue tired holding out here and it was very ... let's use audio news ... a good afternoon\nIn the name of the father of the name of the sun and the holy do see some action from the pope is what people\nWant to go to ... and early wonderful ...\nSpeed cameras are being blasted for waiting so long to speak out against decrease handling Pennsylvania a long wait sir yeah and then only delivering a bunch of words that will be followed by any action [laughter]\nSort of like President Trump when he goes on Twitter and clients about Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein team and Christopher Wray who he is in his power to fire there or at least tell him to do their job so\nYeah keep him on normal function of the government we we we uh nominate the president nominates and by the way they are as as a we'll hear a Lindsey Graham say letter if you want to nominate your own judge you got to win the presidency than you that's how it works\nIt's like now the way the government function for the last two hundred and forty to whatever the ... years\nIs now but it's it's wrong it's broken system broken God it's it's wrong we can't look at and as these people are trying to we're trying to do we must shut it down we have approved confirmed\nAnother Supreme Court judge justice he uh an ass he's getting confirmed deep inside the Supreme Court building they're literally\nHundreds of thousands where thousands perhaps of a liberal\nBeating on the door wanting to shut down the Hundred Years' old tradition of that because the guy they can find is the guy that I like what am I they ... it looks like a bunch of Fifteen year old boys as young boys the lady that was trying to pull the or doors open looked like a middle aged woman otherwise completely normal\nUh [laughter]\nAnd it's it's you know I think the the ... the the worst thing\nThat we're sufferer will suffer out of this confirmation of Kavanaugh is that people will now be and this this is I listen to Scott legal scholars all weekend long some of them surprisingly or get it wrong\nBut the end of due process to where if someone says something you must believe it and and and perhaps the most damning way possible which is to accuse somebody of sexual assault ... right now there's me to move it it's the worst crime a man can combat right\nIt's terrible period accused your life is over you got to give up your company going to drop out of acting gotta quit being a comedian you gotta you gotta you know all these horrible things happen to you

of these famous cases wind steam ah Cosby um\nThere's no proof just it's simply\nA word and that's the most\nDangerous thing of all and I was I read that Twitter there's lawyers legal scholars a respected ... legal scholars that that say that said that she should've been belief I mean how can use a lawyer I mean you never in your entire career walk up to a judge to present a case without with zero\nProof just decrying emotional or a a a a plane if you would never do it you'd be laughed out of business yet that's what they want you to believe\n\nThat's the worst ah best the worst thing ever

there's ... annual real feminist standing up there with Amy Schumer as a woman who talked about the great paid maternity leave in Saudi Arabia inferred [laughter] the good stuff there from the Democratic party President Trump is correct that the Democrats have indeed turned into an angry mob\nAnd you can see how much in every month they've turned into when we get to what policies they're proposing because it's pretty astonishing but here's President Trump hitting the nail on the head as I've said before the president is hammer sometimes you hit the nail sometimes he has a baby well\nYesterday it unveiled and it was satisfied because he said what is correct here the the only thing Democrats had to do honestly when Trump was elected all Democrats had to do was not be crazy\nThat's all they had to do they have failed dramatically and that task of not being crazy instead they've decided to go full blown crazy here as President Trump pointing that out\nThere was for power the radical Democrats after you do an angry mob you saw that today were screaming and shouting not from the two wandered people more or less\nThat weren't you know what those people they could fit in the front row with what we have here [noise]\n[noise] okay Trump is exactly right about all this now what are the less what what is the similar floods you about this well they want to do two things one they want to come up with systemic ways to change the system and\nDo they want to try it out a war on women narrative born women narrative is there a great hope that they can start a war of the sexes they tried this and twenty sixteen they said that there was a war on women and Hillary Clinton was a representative of women in this fight they're hoping that because President Trump is alienating too a lot of particularly suburban women that they can go on to that and then they can combine that with\nFor the me too movement and use that to a club Republicans into submission on a political level will get to the one woman narrative and a second but first what they want to do is they want you radically changed system of American government\nThey're full blown members of the medium talking about Washington Post reporters today or shocked shocked to discover that the Senate of the United states is not represented by population\nThey're shocked to discover that in fact each state has two senators and then they realized that weight Montana has fewer people in the New York which means the Senate isn't representative oh my God they literally ... and it's like right now\nIs it [laughter] I don't know what were they been for the past three hundred years in this country but yeah I mean this is actually a case that they are making\nRight now we'll get to all of that in just

okay so the media have discovered a few things that they are upset about do after twenty sixteen they discovered they didn't like the electoral college very much because Hillary lost and now they've discovered that there is such a thing called the United States Senate\nAnd that the United States Senate believe it or not actually represented different population than the house of representatives now originally the constitution said that the Senate was not even to be selected by popular vote within the states originally the state legislature selected their own senators which was\nThe correct movie that's the way it should have worked because that meant that there was even another layer between the population and the Senate he the founders were actually quite worried about mob rule they're white worried about the idea of pure democracy because they figured that demagoguery could win over broad swaths of the population and that would enable\nAll sorts of bad things to happen to minorities inside the United states\nIs what they're worried about and so they set up a system of checks and balances to provide for the rights of state while ensuring that if there was overwhelming support for a measure that all of that will be able to happen anyway but Aaron Blake over the Washington Post in shocking news breaking news you the senior political reporter at the Washington Post this is breaking news guys hot off the wires quote\nPeople are suddenly deciding the population disparities render the Senate undemocratic upon ratification Virginia had twelve times many people's Delaware\nDisparities are bigger now but they very much exist in our founders decided on the system so Aaron Blake is a ... and Blake is is obviously\nYou know actually saying the truth here but there are a bunch of people in the media who have been suddenly calling on folks to get rid of this and I'm not kidding theirs but I'm I'm looking for all this week right now but basically they're making the case that the Senate needs to go away\nOr alternatively there making the case instead that the that the Supreme Court ought to be packed so my favorite is Democrats suggesting that Republicans on democratically got Brett Kavanaugh through the Senate when Republicans had the votes in the Senate\nSomehow it's undemocratic and now they're saying they're solution to the ... democratic nature of the movement of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court requires them to add more justices to the Supreme Court in violation of the constitution\nIs from New York Times today the bitter partisan theory that engulfed justice Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation was the fiercest battle in a political war over the your guest Cheri that has been steadily intensifying since the Senate rejected judge Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven but\nAn even greater conflagration maybe coming this confirmation but well not necessarily be the last word on Brett Kavanaugh serving the lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court said Brian Fallon executive director of the liberal group demand justice and the top spokesman\nEr Hillary's twenty sixteen campaign so what exactly are they talking about some have gone as far as proposing if Democrats were to retake control of Congress and the White House and twenty twenty or after expanding the number of justice on the court\nTo packet with liberals or trying to impeach room and replace Brett Kavanaugh\nSo it was so good news Democrats are taking this all extraordinarily well they just want to change the system of government completely they want to get rid of the Senate and they also want to and they also want to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court because they couldn't win the election so well done two Democrats that that's that's kind of tactic\nNumber one in just a moment we'll talk about the second tactics that Democrats are using as long as you've brought out a war\nOn women narrative and it's going to be

the Democratic nature of representation in the Senate is unlikely to be remedied anytime soon\nThe job everybody okay so back to the war on women narrative that that do this ... this is best exemplified by women and Alexis Cornell she's written on gender in politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets that she was a professional useless person and she writes a piece today that is titled white women come get your people\nThey will defend their privilege to the death so but I like about that is that now the ... is not just attacking me now just war between women and men now to war between intersection analogy groups so it's black women versus white women in Spanish verses women versus white when because it turns out\nWhite women largely sided with Brett Kavanaugh white women vote Republican more often because it turns out a lot of women actually think individually\nWomen don't always think like the left wants them to say which is fine and good I thought the whole point of feminism as you get what you want to think but not according to the feminine your is this insane the I mean this is fully crazy this is like get the butterfly net and straight jackets up\nHere is what here's what Alexis Grinnell right now in keeping with the the\nModerate tone of the Democrats lately after a confirmation process where women all with their wrists letting their story just sexual trauma run like rumors of broad\nThrough the capital the Senate still voted to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court with the exception of Senator Lisa

trauma run like rivers of Malacca through the capital I wasn't aware that screaming at people was\nA ... factor in them agreeing with you and if he's screaming people about your experiences that have nothing to do with red cabinet Brett Kavanaugh is guilty but life is going to drop the hammer these ...\nAnd our gender freighters to borrow a turtle from the dystopian TV series The Handmaid's tale first of all I think we ought to have a new role now there's a rule on the Internet\nUh and uh about using Hitler and prime member of the the rule about using Hitler on the Internet or what what's it called um there there's an actual name for it that the ... law so it's called God ones while they're basically the longer and Internet argument goes on the more likely somebody is going to drop Hitler in the middle of the arguments well\nThe same thing now holds true for The Handmaid's tale called Shapiro's law the longer any argument goes on with the left\nThe the more of an opportunity left is going to have to drop a reference to Handmaid's Tale you most overrated bulk of last half century and a series that has become popular largely because the media have decided\nThat it is deeply important for women to believe that they are on the verge of being sexually enslaved by men in a society where fewer women than ever in American history are getting married in which women are waiting longer to get married having fewer children and having a job and having more and more income from jobs than any time in American history but women are disclosed\nTheir disclosed and Mike Pence has his way we're gonna stick those women in those red brick ... and we're going to just going to send and we're going to force them to reproduce with us that's what we're going to do it if Mike Pence has his way that evil evil Mike Pence\nSo here's an electrician or no rights these women are gender for tourists to borrow a term from the ... series The Handmaid's tale they've made standing by the patriarchy a full time job the women who support them show up at the Capitol where women for cabinet T shirt but also probably tell their daughters to put on less revealing clothes when they go out\nWho they tell their daughters not to address all skimpy you\nKnew that means that they're bad mom the best mom still their daughters to go out in the streets naked that's the best moms do I love that first of all I I just have to stop right there\nThis notion that if you tell your daughter not to dress simply because you should respect herself more than that at this makes you a bad parents or restrictive parents is utterly insane it's utterly insane\nOnly somebody who has never really raise children in any serious capacity could thinks this or\nMaybe if you think there's a like a maybe a different strategy may maybe I don't know about about electric grid also tried to maybe she has maybe she has get maybe maybe\nI Will say that it is a bad strategy to send your teenage girl to a high school and her brand panties they just going to just going to say it's a bad idea\nAnd it doesn't make you a bad parents ... means they're trying to protect your daughter from the fact that there are dangerous people in the world and also because maybe your daughter doesn't want to look like a sex object all the time and she doesn't want to portray herself to sex object I like how the feminist movement move from the correct opinion about pornography that pornography was a justification of women for the pleasure of men do\nPornography is empowerment of women yeah I'm sure that all those men who\nAre in their basements right now watching Stormy Daniels all tapes are thinking about the empowerment of women they're all feminists that's what they're thinking right now\nBut I Love his women who show up at the Capitol or limit for cabinet T shirts probably tell their daughters but unless revealing closer though that as I say I also like the equation put unless revealing clothes the same
