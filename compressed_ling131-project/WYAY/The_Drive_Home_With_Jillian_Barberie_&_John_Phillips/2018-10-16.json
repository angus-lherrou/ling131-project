that at that she was in sixth generation Native American\nAt worst at worst it's ten which would mean that she had an ancestor her great great great great great great great great great grandparents who was Native American\nAnd ... the best part of the Boston Globe story\nIt's really really spectacular so it says the inherent in a position of the six page DNA Analysis could provide fodder for its critics yeah thank you for great great great grandmother was Native American that puts her one thirty second the American Indian\nBut knowing that she's one thirty second the minimum raise the minimum is that she is one that I think it was won five hundred and twelve or something\nYou're not ... like one thirty seconds is not actually a sixth generation Native American that's that's like a fourth generation Native American\nIn any case the report includes the possibility that she is just one one thousand twenty fourth Native American if the ancestor is ten generations back\nOne one thousand twenty fourth I loved it so here here's the even better part to make up for the doors of Native American ancestry\nDNA bustamante samples from Mexico Peru and Colombia to stand in for Native American and it was going to use like Cherokee DNA to match up huge Mexican Peruvian and Colombian DNA to match up to what it really shows is that she's one one thousand twenty four Mexican Peruvian are Columbian\nSo awesome awesome I Love this\nMean says Warren has four times more Native American blood than a white person from Great Britain and ten times more than a white person from Utah the report found well\nThere's only one problem with that with the actual study shows that the average American in the United states of any re the average American in the United states is point one eight per se is point one eight percent Native American and that that is what and by the way you're not accepted as a Native American Native American tribes much or at least one sixteenth Native American made him he had a great grandparents who was Native American\nSo we're now going back ten generation strength plan that she's a Native American because she claimed I guess the University of Pennsylvania Native American heritage and all the rest\nHe she is point zero zero nine percent Native American and she was bragging about this right this is her claim and the media are saying well they should put this thing about\nThe should put it's bad that is not that is not what she said that's not what she said at all at all it's spectacular she's Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent white met\nWhile she was a good read about this is after finding out that war and as a staggering Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent white Richard Spencer is expected to endorse or for president\n[laughter] oh I Love it so much\nI Love it so much so by the way according to science just to get this straight according to science if you are one one thousand twenty fourth Native American that is strong evidence of Native American ancestry if you have to X chromosomes this doesn't mean you're a woman\nBecause that's according to the media this is science maple\nBecause in politics is fire and so I have suggested publicly as others have done I'm not the only one or probably the first person who is the\nPresident Trump should not give one million dollars to Elizabeth lord you should give her one one thousand twenty four of a million dollars is your sign during nine hundred dollar check because that's how Native American cheetah\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] it's so good and he should put he should printed out a giant publishers clearinghouse check\nAnd you should sign a deal is with war and then the subject line ... dating to indeed windy can pay\nIs just big technicolor if just picked Jack Taylor so I Love the ... and ... again you have to love the media bias here\nIf if anybody claim this on the right are you kidding me if I claimed that I'd Native American ancestry and that people will go up and you're pretty Jewish as well you know if I take a twenty three and meet test and it shows that ten generations ago maybe someone with some ... in common with a Colombian person\nWithin my ancestry would that make you Native American also I I Do love that\nYeah the the I get the idea that she was Native American based on a an ancestor can get a rations ago that's insane\nThere's not even the greatest race it like the greatest racist on earth would not call her Native American people will hate Native Americans would not call her Native American based on that ancestry or not he's not real fond uh Jews\nThey cut off Jewish ancestry at second generation after generation they said if you have for German grandparents than you are considered and fully German okay and those people were super giant racist But West is no even more racist than the biggest racist because they're saying that if you have one\nTiny drop of Native American ancestry from four hundred years ago now you're Native American order of Native Americans feel about that you can't be great it can't be great really really astonishing\nSo [laughter] oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I oh it's so good we'll have more on the ... I I Love it so I Love it so it's so great I'm more than just one second but first\nLet's talk about your bathroom habits how'd you get ready to go out shower to wash the work that way you style your

club dot coms Watchmen\nA dollar shave club dot com black men so spectacular so Elizabeth Warren just making a mockery of herself and not even knowing it in the media playing on the question is what motivated her to do this\nAnd what what made her do this wasn't made Elizabeth Warren think this is a great idea the answer is well made her that by like how they have great ideas she thinks this was she went home and she filmed the video with a bunch of her family members complaining about how Trump was mean for suggesting she didn't have Native American ancestry\nUh-huh she obviously has prepping for a presidential run but this is so\nMy ... you know how you know white Elizabeth Warren is look at the back of this paper [noise] okay this paper right here is less white than than Elizabeth boarded because you can still see me through it a little bit and we live Warren is more white than this piece of paper\nAnd yet you proclaim it just made American it's so good it's just it's so good okay so I Love it\nBut why did you did she did this because you know the media would cover for anyway so the\nSo the the media wrote a bunch of headline saying that now she had been now she had been justified she'd been justified in her accusations she'd been justified in her claim and she is calling on President Trump's to find her a million dollar check because she is possibly point zero nine percent Native American\nSolid solid stuff there but she's right because the media do better play no matter what she does the media will back or play and\nThat's obvious from the weekends media coverage and the media\nYou know it's funny folks on the left adjust that the people in the Arabic language we cling to God and we cling to guns and we cling to cling to our American status we cling to our borders and we cling to our language frequent to all sorts of terrible things remember rock Obama blamed evil Republican his mundane gutter cleaners\nElizabeth Warren is bitterly clinging on to the narrative in the media are bitterly clinging on along with her and then there are clinging on to a bunch of other false narrative that they're putting out\nAll they have to do I've said this on CNN all that the media have to do in order to undermine President Trump is just try to stick to the truth they can't do it there's nothing that they can do that and that will force them to stick the troops coming up the president of the United\nStates routinely maligned the fake news sometimes he's right sometimes you want low over the weekend yet a few good reasons to be quite upset he turns

[noise]\nOK so on the good Trump died I have to acknowledge that the president did quote me this morning which is kind of fun that he watch my final Sunday special on Fox News and he pointed out the only way to shut down the Democrat new map of the strategy stopped him cold that it by the fight for their cause you to never other\nThan Japan executives are present and I appreciate that good from\nOther good Trump he said he said the interesting thing on sixty minutes and when he talked about the Democrats not wanting the country to heal that obviously was brought here as President Trump going after the Democrats is not wrong about that is considering the Elizabeth Warren today is doing the everybody hates you Mr Trump in my Native American ancestry Israel and Hillary thing\nThe ability for Republicans and all the rest here as President Trump talking about Democrats wanting to divide the country\nWe need to be healed we need I don't think they want deal yet I'll be ... made a really nasty say but I don't think they want to be you I Do want to you\nKnow so I agree that the Democrats don't want the country to hill I'm not sure that President Trump is most healing president but we will campus in the category of good Trump\nIn the category of ads from pure as President Trump talking about Saudi Arabia so he has made a couple of comments when he got on sixty minutes was up at but Saudi Arabia is in ... in a massive scandal right now because there's this guy named ... and ... was a person who wrote op ed for the Washington Post\nHe was a longtime retainer of the Saudi royal family and a critic of the regime he entered the Saudi conflict and assembled turkey on October second seeking documents relevance with a horse the Turkish government claims that they have proof that Saudi hit squad murdered him inside the consulate chopped his body up and then dispatched domains and a black man to a private plane headed for Saudi Arabia\nAnd there's not a lot of how the shot he's dead at this point is it created worldwide consternation against the Saudi Government and in particular against prince Mohammed bin ... who's considered the new leader of Saudi Arabia in Decatur of Saudi Arabia\n... a few comments are necessary on this to to understand what's going on exactly or number one Saudi Arabia is a tyrannical dictatorship led by people who are radical dictators\nIs monarchy they chop people's hands off regularly\nThey imprisoned dissident they're not age human rights friendly country mama been full time was supposed to be a reformer but even as a reformer\nHe's still the dictator of Saudi Arabia there's not a supremely shocking story on any level other than we know the name of the guy who was disappeared as opposed to presumably many other people whose name we don't know who have been disappeared second the Turkish government has a pretty strong interest in trying to humiliate the Saudis because the Turkish government\nHas basically been anti Saudi for years that are in bed with the Iranian government at this point\nAnd to a certain extent in bed with the Syrian Government as well\nAll of that said the Turkish government releasing evidence in an attempt to make it look like they are our friends\nAired on his leader of turkey also an Islamic thug who has imprisoned dissident and killed dissident too so there are no good guys in this part of the world or at least not in a leadership position in any case the call for the United states to distance itself from the Saudi Arabian government after all that I think is appropriate\nBut I think it's also appropriate to note that the outsized consternation with regard to cars shaggy which was outside so I don't mean that it's inappropriate totally appropriate but when compared to the amount of consternation over turkey imprisoning thousands of people and and told a minute ago when president a youth pastor\nOr Syria murdering ... half million people or Ron pursuing terrorism across the region\nIt's it is amazing how the human brain has the capacity to hone in on a single incident of evil in a way that it doesn't on", "show_name": "The Drive Home With Jillian Barberie & John Phillips", "year": "2018", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "16"}
