let's talk about Donald Trump what is up with this new calm confident cool Donald Trump\nI've always I've always criticized him when I thought he deserve criticism and I've always praise the one I thought he deserved praise but the one thing that I've noticed is how incredibly cool is being in this Kavanaugh fight I mean ... is ... he's ... and and look what let's face it\nCool is not the word I usually use to describe Donald Trump right cool is easy usually very hot tempered he usually is flying off the handle these got tweets going that maybe shouldn't be doing\nHe is playing this cabinet thing like ... has got it showed up and the reason that's important is you cannot deny you cannot deny whatever you think of Donald Trump you cannot deny his pen lasting political instincts knows what is going on with his base knows what's going on with the country and he's got the press\nIn his pocket he has gotten bouncing them down the street like a basketball no matter every time they called him it's like you think it's all this time they got them and then he's just like you know ... wish they're gone you know to the basement so he gave a press conference and we we have to talk about this too\nHe goes out and gives a press conference when he wants to talk about his new NAFTA deal with now is Rene negotiated NAFTA as he promised to do\nAnd it's now called the something like the U.S Mexico Canada agreement the U.S and the CIA or something like this and I remember\nRemember the panic and the hysteria from both right and left on this the New York times of this bogus because he made the deal with Mexico and said if you don't give Canada doesn't want to renegotiate\nFine I'll just read do it with Mexico and it was like oh this is awful there's an old a trade war the death the love the condom either crashing the wall Street Journal I mean people were actually popping out of the newspaper weeping as looking like juniors the train the go free trade has gone\nAnd suddenly at the deadline Canada says uh we'd like the iPad and after two please this is an incredible incredible redemption of Donald Trump and the ... and\n... you know Walter Russell Mead who was one of the best columnist at the wall Street Journal he says even the administration's fiercest critics are calling the visuals to NAFTA significant U.S Mexico Canada agreement requires the cars made was Seventy\nA present North American components to escape tariffs forty percent of each car must be also be manufacturing facilities where workers are sixteen bucks an hour or more on average and crucially Canada has also cracked open the door to his dairy market for American farmers and this is a big deal\nAnd and it has China worried okay and this is the thing the big target here is China because that's a big market those training is unfairly\nAnd suddenly suddenly the list of topics that China's censors want new sources to treat sensitively because it's a censorship society right\nIs revealing one recent instructions 'til editors in China to be careful with economic data that suggests China is being hurt by the trade war that its economy is slowing the local government debt is growing or the consumer confidence is falling that means all those things are happening in China which\nIs what somebody said what happened guess who Donald Trump and then you will remember that when this whole trade things started what I said was I'm not going to call this because I I\nThink Trump is a good negotiator negotiation is a motion negotiation is movement from one place to another and with the press does is take snapshots of each place that he is and gets hysterical about that place where Trump is thinking no I'm just trying to get to the end of this negotiation\nMellow this thing can be voted down especially if the GOP loses in the midterms they can just throw this new agreement away but it's obviously a good agreement it obviously justifies\nTrump's strategies in his tactics in fact in fact I think this calls for the Trump happiness montage that's got it\nSo much we gonna win at every level\nWe going to win economically we're going to win when the economy where are you going to win with military we get a win without scary for our veterans where are you going to win with every single faceted [noise]\n\nThe mom bought one\nWe going to win so much you get tired of winning\nYou said please please it's too much warning we can't take it anymore I Do\nNeed to be the end we we have to keep learning\n\nSo Trump or out in front of the press and he just he\nJust ... silly he comes out ... let's just play ... ... number five\nI think the press is treated me unbelievably unfairly\nIn fact when I Won I spent a good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse and worse now than ever below do but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico", "show_name": "The Drive Home
