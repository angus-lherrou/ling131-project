massacre begin today services being held on the same day President Trump and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to visit the city of course one of the jury boat blend the reports\nThe president is coming today even though the mayor asked him to wait until all the dead have been buried funerals are scheduled for each day this week with three being held today White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says the president wants to express the support of the American people and grief with the community\nIs a is called highest and he tweeted highest likes to bringing invaders they kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get water screw your optics I'm going in those last week that he sent before he went and murdered a bunch of Jews most of them over the age fifty including a Holocaust survivor\nHe also had a particular dislike for President Trump he just met President Trump as a global less rather than ... national as you said there is no matter as long as there is a hike infestation 'em to use the word here because I think it's imperative noble languished at these these monsters use evil evil people\nSo that the media take on all of that has I think\nQuite simplistic and foolish\nOr they have of course ingested that President Trump is responsible for everything President Trump is responsible for the shooting specifically because President Trump in two thousand six hundred thousand Seventy Lincoln not at the alt right\nNow I was highly critical of President Trump for doing that I Am highly critical of President Trump for doing that I was the number one target of outright anti Semitism on line two thousand sixteen with bullet was not close forty percent ball anti Semitic tweets by the alt right into thousands of humor directed at me personally\nIt's I'm well acquainted with the folks that President Trump pointed not at this guy was not right he was a white supremacist there is a slight difference is not a member of the modern alt right movement which is discussing an evil and anti Semitic another itself but he\nIs a white supremacist with with a longer standing pet\nBecause of the complex topic I'm gonna try to parse it I'm gonna try to parse it because they bunch of things can be true all at once\nNumber one just I said last week with regard to the attempted bombing against democratic targets as I said that you cannot connect a politician's rhetoric they violent action almost be politician actually calls for the violent action President Trump has engaged in nothing remotely approaching incitement against you\nKnow one can him a single comment that he's ever made that looks like incitement against Jews in fact is president of the United states has been extraordinarily pro Israel and pro Jewish\nAnd the president comment in response to this particular anti Semitic attacks were far stronger than his predecessors were sponsored similar and medical ... for example here's what the president of the United states had to say in the after this clip Fifteen is what the president had to stay in the aftermath of the attack\nThe scores of anti Semitism and not for you to not be tolerated and it could not be allowed to continue with general lower chicken and [noise]\nIt must be confronted engines damned everywhere it rears its very ugly head [noise]\nWe're motion with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat and ...\nAnd very for the forces of hey that's what it is\nOkay so his his statement that anti Semitism eradicated it was a far stronger statement the rock Obama sweet to here's a rock Obama sweet and I want to show you the contrast between this because\nAgain if we're going to talk about standing with the Jews and we have to talk about who's response to this has happened actually better President Trump's but it was better than Obama's ... here was Obama's response on Twitter we agree for the Americans murdered and Pittsburgh all of us have to fight the rise in anti Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those look lover pray differently and we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocence to get their hands on a gun\nPresident Trump took on anti Semitism why point he's an anti Semitism is evil and must be eradicated\nHe didn't try to like in a hatred against any other group you didn't try to make about gun control rock Obama did both of those things the west has a tendency to obscure anti Semitism with a broad brush of bigotry simply saying that anti Semitism is like any other hatred it is not like any other hatred every hatred has its own diagnosis every hatred has its own symptoms\nAnti black racism is not the same as anti white racism anti black racism is not the same thing as anti Semitism and say well gee BP homophobia is not the same thing as anti Semitism rock Obama simply wants to push a progressive agenda and to keep lumps in anti Semitism with all other forms of hatred\nThat an inaccurate and it is true and it does have some consequences when it comes to policy\nNow let's go through some of the elements here that I think are important personal as I say\nPresident Trump in two thousand sixteen two thousand Seventeen did wink and nod at the alt right okay again I said there's a thousand times I wrote editorials about it I was extraordinarily vocal about it\nFrom his own willingness to condemn David Duke on CNN does unwillingness to condemn outright attack on July ... D GQ journalist will get you on a second\nTo bringing on Steve Bannon who called himself the progenitor of the Web site that was that became a a gathering place for the alt right President Trump Lincoln not that I Know this because I think in the target of the alt right from statements in the aftermath Charlottesville providing aid and comfort to white supremacist I don't see any way around that but\nFrom his not a white supremacist than he is not an anti Semite yeah they'd pathological\nAversion to criticizing anyone who says anything nice about him point number two there's a bunch of things that are true at the same time and if you want to understand what's going on we need to recognize that point number two white supremacist them is not All right mad that\nThey are not the same category of people white supremacist long predated President Trump they're not a new development those people were going to shoot Jews regardless of what anybody had to say because they have been shooting Jews\nSince long before I was born in Nineteen Ninety nine as I mentioned it white supremacist shut up our local Jaycee said that same year six words that are Jews were shot in Chicago along with a black man and several Asians by white supremacist the sort of stuff has been happening for a very long time has nothing to do with President Trump third President Trump has separate from the ... right and dramatic way\nTo say the president from is still associated with the alt right in the ignorance of President Trump's administration or what he has done the alt right is enraged with him if you go look at Richard Spencer if you go look\nAt at some of the other members will be All right they are angry at him they believe that he has been hijacked by the global it had the same way that the shooter about that President Trump was standing up too much for the hikes\nAnd so that is the way that that that that is just a basic truth President Trump has been extraordinarily pro Jewish and pro Israel in his actual presidency\nThat as a basic foundational than if you fail to acknowledge it your lying by omission\nHanging a second I'm gonna get to a few more points we have to keep in mind that we'll get to the media's response which again I think it's simplistic despicable and partisan but first let's talk about your underwear so do you follow this year as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade or restock your drawers with drawers with all move all colors and prints from Tommy John\nTommy John obsesses over every little detail

don't wear out easily they don't\nWrite up on ya that Tommy John dot com you could have been for twenty percent off\nOkay a few more points that we have to keep in mind with regard to the shooting in Pennsylvania and what it has to do with President Trump which is to say very little\nPresident Trump they say that separated from the alt right dramatically to the first three point that I've made here President Trump did wake and not be All right for two years to white supremacist not that they was All right Matt three President Trump has separated from the ... right in dramatic way than they are pissed at him over it hey that is true the shooter too was anti Trump\nPork if we're gonna talk about how flirting with anti Semite and anti Semitic rhetoric and just making things let's say for Jews unless you actually talk about that\nWho do you think has made the world let's say for Jews President Trump and his winking and nodding at the alt right\nOr the left which mainstream was Farrah Khan which mainstream when that's our store which mainstream media movement which mainstream wildly anti Israel in anti Semitic policy which one do you think is more damaging to Jews all across the world and in the United states\nDo you think the party that might have removed and Jerusalem tried to remove Jerusalem and twenty twelve from their platform or is it the party that move us embassy to Jerusalem in Israel you think that if the party standing up for religious freedom or do you think that if the party looking to obliterate a religious freedom in the name of so called anti discrimination\nDo you think that if the party that mainline Keith Ellison and tries to make and head of the DNC after he refuses and it's been years backing with their account or do you think that might be the party that opposes that\nMainstream members in the Democratic party routinely hobnobbing with anti Semite she for the Jewish community really for for Jews really care about being Jewish there's not a ... of difference between a Jew being murder for being a Jew in Jerusalem a Jew being more for for being Jewish in France or dripping murder for being Jewish and Pittsburgh it's all of the peace\nIs ever going to talk about anti Semitic rhetoric and who's to blame for riding Jewish that the world over a rise in hate crimes world over the look actually talk about I don't think alike wants to talk about that I think what they want to partisan happy or media are happy to talk about President Trump winking and nodding at the alt right in two thousand sixteen\nThousand Seventeen
