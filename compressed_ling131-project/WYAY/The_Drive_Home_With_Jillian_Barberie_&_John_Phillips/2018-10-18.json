most literate audiences and radio is the ... job because of the strength of his affiliates and the and the reach of these is intellect and we have caused all over the country including San Francisco and Chris in San Francisco welcome to the mark limited show and Chris please go ahead\nOn high or you are incredibly articulate and it's a joy to listen to you you get all the ... and very quickly thank you thank you think\nAbout what I'd like to say is you know I keep hearing about that the media lying and that's all we get is there information they yeah they're dominating the news service or all liars well why don't we get more stations than Fox and get a budget competing\nConservative stations because I keep hearing people call in and say well I don't have the concerted station where I live well we'll\nSee are you going to go on how about the art TV you\nChecked she our TV you can check Newsmax dot com one American network out to check with your cable company I think see our TV does a great job Fox I Can't watch Shepard Smith in the afternoon if I Want to watch that crap all watch MSNBC so I Can't watch Shepard Smith there's parts of Fox that I Can't watch\nI Love Hannity I'll watch him Laura no problem Carlson no problem I Love watching mark on Sunday night but there's there's parts of Fox that that I Can't watch and it's because if I Wanna watch Shepard Smith crap I'll watch MSNBC instead I'm also get the true thing but but I and I worry about Fox long term\nBecause of the drift of what it's doing and it concerns me but I I I like more information not less than ... when I I tell you what I Do Chris I get up\nAnd I check out the Drudge Report news match dot com I check mark ... website I go to the Daily Caller I go to daily wire\nI checked out Fox and I go to those six or red state dot com is pretty good I certainly do seven or eight and I feel\nFairly well informed to start my day and then throughout the day I check those websites for information I Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there is information out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI agree except without referring to is the mainstream media where people don't have the intelligence and meet they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the fence they don't want to offer conservatism is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen money controls everything if CBS or ABC said\nFrom top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system\nWe're going to have conservative viewpoints on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings skyrocketing said CBS News if they determine they're going to do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV\nIt CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively moderate\nTo the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars because you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news casts every night at six thirty\nIf one of them would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once and the whims and the wishes of the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off and when they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get into the mainstream these radio shows and needs TV because they're picking to the choir we need to change minds like starting to go out and go on these mainstream media because I don't know\nIt's got to go there yes and and it's okay to come and be all with me it's okay to do Fox or do my friend Sean Hannity now mark ... may get them on on a Sunday night on Fox on the radio\nBut buddy he needs to go out and this guy

in his presence\nYou know it's like ... it's like being with Elvis and Nineteen sixty eight in a while it's like the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show it's like beyond said metlife stadium this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump is like the messiah it's it's unbelievable and I've never seen this in politics I wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes I Want to Reagan rally in Nineteen eighty four pretty good but there's nothing in politics that equals\nTrump rally and that's why you can go to Montana Iowa Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati Georgia Florida he'd go anywhere and draw one hell of a crowd I Wonder what would happen if the Trump stir one to Central Park in New York City I Wonder what that would be like\nYeah I Wonder if I asked them he took that stall apart\nYou know she she was just wondering why the ad stupid you know and this is off the subject that I said well irony in the end is because they're starting to accusing him of going after young prosecute is its competitor and boy as he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me up\nI tell I tell you what's unfair Chris is when you picture our first lady has a stripper engaging in sex acts in the oval office and the mainstream media doesn't care about it and the other floated says don't gather around my lawyer to protect her can you imagine if Michelle Obama was pictured in a a

do and they went ... bananas and ever since the late ... way that they deserve the grain disagreeing with the outcome\nThey really like ... you to\n\nA ...\nThere is no pot fill fill out my buddy good man how are you I'm doing well\nIn Cara I Love you know you don't want their animals are about ... [laughter] a that is what about this election you know a total fraud and everything I think this is one of the biggest reason we should have the paper ballot you know brought back\nKnow computer and everything it can be you know click of a button that can be either deleted or you know ... or manipulated\nBut you know with paper at least you have you know a thousand dollars with the same hand rotten on them or you have a you know like a power rashes in somebody's backyard right there yeah you know you you ... you know evidence so that was one of the court\nThat matter the only three point five million more registered voters been alive adults\nYeah and Hillary go through your ID said almost three million or you know I could hear about is the popular vote I'm ...\nI'm absolutely convinced that everything was fraudulent every damn one of them when I met Trump actually did win the popular vote\nI think he did in a landslide and I think this was that was just like they're they're you know claim to a ... it's just you're on you know John ... pulling all the stops Alfred Hillary I'll tell you what it was and I still think you know that a bunch of legal you know voted in California as well\nOh well not only that I mean you've got you've lived there there's you know a several hundred thousand of\nFake voters there goes new owners\nAre dead voters I hadn't voted since like Nineteen eighty so [laughter] are they like you'll have a good way to accent\nYeah\nSan Diego county is the biggest the they have a hundred and thirty eight percent registration that means that that are are there are thirty eight percent more registered voters and there are adults in the county of age to develop state by state\nIt's a massive problem I don't know how you do and what what do you do how do you fix it\nId nice show ID yeah that's it\nIf they could probably ah you know absentee ballot can be ... but it would be a whole lot laugh if he had to show your ID you know what I mean oh yeah\nDon't understand I don't know about you know people think Boehner ideas as a racist or whatever\nI mean that's racist to say that it's very yeah\nBecause you're saying that black people are in order to dumb to figure out how to get to do you get an id\nAre you saying they don't have transportation or it's just not right\nOr they can't they can't get there this is impossible for them so you are racist well look at these people that I had to buy if you can't get down to get an idea how to how they're going to get done only place factly that's unbelievable I'm\nUh-huh uh-huh no\nAid for for for all for one of six seven is the telephone number here is a bumper sticker Rick Iraq\nWas a good um I just was going to point out you know there's a couple of articles that I read recently about Generation Z becoming a one of the most conservative generation set the baby boomers not to mention on\nTop of that with social media and having people like even crowd or mark they prepare oh here are educating young people are or how just how toxic it left there I feel like a you know having that\nOr to see this mentality of you know you just gotta suck up everything that's just the way the country's going I think it's quite the contrary I honestly think at a time they're going to be turning you see how the west more and more ... more knocking heads exploding\nRidiculous at ... I guess in a positive manner but you know know what I'm going to fight ever won without having a sacrifice but I think we're going\nWell I Hope so I Know well we are with this president you know in in this uh this administration and I will be completely shocked if he doesn't win reelection twenty twenty\nI I'm a predictable he'll win it again\nI agree entirely and I really don't think that we're going to go to the house or the Senate during the best serves I think it's just trying to you know flash a smokescreen there with the only way of crap all that but you know what I think we're about to kick it or I I really like\nAll right but what I hear it thanks Rick alright alright I forget what\nI like the media to talk more about the way\nYou do why because you had to come on to talk about the ... or the left to go out and vote\nThere like Ali got that's in the back don't need to go out oh assuming yeah a lot of people thought that about Georgia I think that's why Hillary did a lot better in Georgia then they thought she was going to because people are like I don't have to stay at home ... yeah George I got a Republican in Cobb County went Hillary level that's obscene yeah\nA for for ... for one oh six seven three point five million cars that ... that's the God Knows how long it's\nBeen going on that's probably why Obama was elected Maddow now\nHere we had terrible candidate that's true they were just as bad as Hillary yeah there is a John John you're on the air\n[noise] hey Shannon oh you're talking about three or four or five million extra voters there's a way that we can take care of that I mean there's two ... two things one way or the voter id and you remember when Iraq had its first election\nEverybody that went to get voted after they voted yeah they died their fingers purple\nYellow died a wonder fingers they had been some ache and stay permanently died purple for four months yeah that's how they actually you don't vote twice there that is a there you go that's the simplest thing ever\nYeah I mean if they stick your finger in in in blue dye purple die or whatever you you can't go vote again you're done voted\nYeah and you don't you don't need a sticker anymore [laughter] you know [laughter]\nYou know would figure you that you don't want to be picking it up there [laughter] bag of joggers yet it you're going to die of\nFinger you ever see that as a bomb or something they they stick it in some ... and ... the color of their ... that's\nJust that's genius of probably cheaper than stickers all hell of a lot cheaper now that are that you can't watch that all for taking forever to get it off your thumb you know I like it I like it too I'm willing to have a blue down for a month\nI mean the fact that we ... we we were talking about how precious aren't voting rights on heads of the cornerstone about democracy if it's so damn important why don't we protected with voter id\nFor the love of God but it's racist\nWe all do that black people to do the good vi deep or polar\nRight far too stupid to figure it out all the ... they are they all immigrants yeah stupid\nAll I'm not I don't even I don't know a soul that does not have ID\nI don't think you have to have an id to vote in New York so we know how that went right and also go after the ... or you got to buy their own that Markey guy you know what I'm Talking about
