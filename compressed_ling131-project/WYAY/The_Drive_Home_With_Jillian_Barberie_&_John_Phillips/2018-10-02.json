Janesville option station where\nSleep and quick Indonesian death toll rises I'm Elliot friends says give Republican senators have called the White House the stress that they expect a complete investigation as the FBI reviews on vacations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh or both window reports comprehensive\nBut quick that's what the president wants from the FBI investigation during a news conference in the rose garden the president indicated he's fine with the sexual assault investigation following whatever leads are turned up\nI think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer\nSupreme Court picks or anything if they get the Senate they'll stop him from doing anything\nSo he ...\nHe says All right we've got to have an FBI investigation Irish FBI investigations nonsense that doesn't mean anything\nThe most telling\nThat the FBI investigation doesn't mean anything was an article in the op ed written by your old friend James call me in the New York times former newspaper former head of the FBI and a former newspaper writing\nAn op ed that says the FBI can do this and he starts out with this long self serving power grab about how impartial he is\nPeople kept calling impartial people kept saying that he was for the Democrats and not for the Republicans the rest of the op ed is an attack on the Republicans he says we live in a world where the president routinely attacks the FBI because he fears is work\nHe calls for his enemies to be prosecuted and his friends free we live in a world where the president is accused cereal abuser women who was caught on tape bragging about his ability to assault women\nThat by the way is not true he was caught on tape saying that women would allow you to do things if you were a celebrity and as an assault as women allowed that's why I I think that's why when it got so angry at\nMost disturbingly we live in a world where millions of Republicans and their representatives think everything I just said is okay so we age the Republicans and he says the FBI's up for this it's not as hard as Republicans\nIt will be Republicans hope they can't find the truth so he's already telling you what he thinks he's already telling you what he thinks the FBI is going to find this is a shameful disgraceful thing for a former Trump was show right to fire the sky you should have fired him and then kick them you know I was like don't let the door hit you on the way out to kick them in the back side as he was leaving\nHe says listen to this was his dreams combing there's got to lead the FBI\nFBI agents no time has very little to do with memory\nThey [laughter] they know remarried person remembers the weather on their wedding day no matter how long ago significance drives memory they also know that little lives point to be or watch all of that is an for all of that as an for people you know they do this to guys in court all the times has guy says I saw a murder\nThat I saw this I saw Mr ... murder mystery why and they should you rely on your resume in Nineteen eighty two guesses yeah obviously didn't neither job see well if you live then you would lie now for everything he says is wrong if it is not true it is not true that ... the time doesn't affect memory time there's all kinds of crazy things with memory\nTen minutes can affect your memory and make you think you saw something that you didn't see\nAny really turned out to be an intellectual about this guy the guy who just uses his pretense of honor and dignity to uh to bully other people meanwhile Rachel Mitchell the prosecutor that the Republicans brought into question\nAh Christine Blasey Ford sheen gave a report to the Republicans now they brought her in to get the truth they didn't bring her in she didn't say this in public they brought her into get at the truth and she said of of Christine Blasey Ford she said she said remember this was a woman train in prosecuting the sexual cases\nHe said she said case was incredibly difficult to prove this case\nIs even even weaker than that Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted relegate Asians will fail to corroborate them\nFor the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard which means you don't even have to prove beyond a shadow of the doubt and you just have to bring a lot of evidence\nDoesn't matter Jeff Flake caves listened to Jeff Flake and listen to what the women say is Jeff Flake gets into the elevator and these women it cost and listen to what they say\nThey didn't tell me what I tell my daughter [laughter]\n\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nSo what is what is just Brett Kavanaugh will have to do with this woman why is Jeff Flake telling this woman anything about herself\nShe's saying I was assaulted and therefore if you let somebody else who's been accused of assault and parents according to the prosecutor number incredibly\nWho's been accused of ... you were saying something about me and this is the left wing why not just to you know that was Anna Maria ... and Maggie Gallagher the two women and according to John Fund was an excellent reporter la ... or ... is an executive director of the center for popular democracy she spent the previous week in Washington engaged in protest against Kavanaugh\nShe's a Gallagher's at twenty three year old activist with the group the center is a left wing group but as heavily funded by yes who George Soros and these are short rose operatives doing what Soros wants them to do and I mean I think that that's important to know as an actor and what's the tactic\nThat tactic is to make Brett Kavanaugh the symbol of oil rape is not an individual accused of a certain crime\nMore button just a second but first you know this radio show

I should have called me now is not even don't Clinton you had the Senate Judiciary committee member ... built in different office at the oral sex in the oval office and write about it to a grand jury as part of the United states\nThat ...\nIs ridiculous and if not one Senate Judiciary committee member changes his or her vote\nBecause of what they learned from the ... that tells you all you need to know about what the president and judge Kavanaugh has had a history and that should be on if it's for all partisan politics are women can't you know I Want those women who\nShow everyone covered the fact that she was sexually assaulted she hadn't told that before the real story there she said I'm an individual and an individual attacked me that individual is responsible we're all responsible for our own actions that was what shape of our doesn't want you to know that is what the left doesn't want you to believe coming up we'll be talking about why I Am\nSo suspicious of the people ...

tough\nBeautiful blonde bright you would think that's the heroes of the movie but when when the left me say smart talking tough beautiful blonde and real like what do they do they run for the hills they hate or they ... you wrote a piece called no more Mr White guy because this is another way this is another way which the left is trying to organize us\nInto gangs they start attacking white people she begins I played this on the air last week she begins like just reciting all the things that people have said\nUh they know the optics of Lebanon white men questioning Dr Ford will be so harmful says uh CNN legal analysts are they understand they have all these white men would be questioning his words as Gloria borders another seeing an analyst\nOr a ... a congressman says women across this nation should be outrage at what these white men are doing and she goes on and on and she says you know\nAnd then answers as the Supreme\nCourt confirmation hearing resumes as we protect Brett Kavanaugh it's clear that the Republicans are simply too white to get the job done\nI suggest the Republican sign up some outside help the way baseball teams make leap season acquisitions of pitchers in designated hitter for the playoffs they can get some black men and then she starts listening all the black men who've been accused and convicted of of hurting women the Reverend Al Sharpton Bill Cosby Keith Ellison story by the way he's accused of beating\nHis wife and beating his girlfriend and they're just like completely bearing that story\nBut she says what is the thinking behind snickering white men judging that accusation sexual assault\nThe Chuck Grassley as a rapist you can be for rape or against it she says I happened to be against it but the idea that alleged sexual assault survivors need the loving care a black Indian her Spanish men to judge their stories wise and the base of crime statistics from around the glow\nIn the history of the world she says there has never been more Pacific less ruby creature than the white male of Western European descent\n... but the thing is they set the rules if the less sits with rules that they can be racist they can attack white people and his right she can respond in kind and they're certainly studying the rules of dividing us certainly male and female well let's talk about that with one of our uh\nNominal males I think he's a male is Michael and Michael ... you you identify as male don't you\nI identify as it depends when I'm On my MSNBC show I identify as Obama but now identify as a male or a citizen of the sexual universe I [laughter]\nAnd also the host of the Michael ... show which show you know it is for men and women both I think\n[laughter] it depends on the day when I have I\nSo I mean one of the reasons I have a preview or a video out today called who needs feminism and its attack on feminism I'm an anti feminist and one of the reasons I hate feminism is because it blames man for things that are just part of nature and it blames men for the\nJourney of women to the place that they are now it's only happened because of men because men invented things because men had ideas that basically liberated women when the technology was available and yet they hate us as as it is it fair to say the feminism is selling an anti male story\nHow dare you know what happened and I just like young man I met him or God that you identify as something I didn't you didn't know what I Know [laughter] it's a\nIt is now true to say feminism is in the mail not just the anti this guy or not just anti that guy in the mail\nAnd this was always the ... we would always say oh feminism they seem to be so angry and against men and whatever [noise] um and they would say well that's not true feminism is this evidence that they now it is now common among feminist Twitter in feminist a articles\nJust say hash tag men are trash isn't really yeah or hash tag hate man yeah these ... these are very common it's true at every level it's from the activists level it's true in the media it's run academia it's for politics and it's true and the government\nYou have all of these examples so I think the most\nBlatant one comes from the media came out from the Washington Post ... fairly recently from Susanna ... until Walters a professor of sociology and director of women's gender and sexuality studies at Northeastern University uh she had a piece out that asked why can't we ate men\nThat on the headline not why not ... by the way just in case you want to blame\nThe editor of that pie since I was a ... a headline she writes in the article what we have every right to hate you you've done is wrong hashtags because patriarchy is long past time to play hard fourteen feminism and two went\nWell not just the Washington Post the New York times recently hired Sarah Jong the up to their editorial board Sarah Jong I Can't read ah everything that she wrote on Twitter because this is a family program by that she did say white men or bowl\nOr she said oh man it's sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men about those are some of the more polite things that she said
