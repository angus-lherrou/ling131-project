in southern Mexico Monday meanwhile President Trump is threatening to cut off aid to their home countries from Lawrence reporting\nA series of tweets Monday President Trump said he would declare a national emergency over the Margaret caravans we gotta stop 'em at the border Mr Trump is also threatening to cut more funds toward several Central American countries in response to the migrants Republican Senator Jeff flake says that money benefits both sides of\nBut the blue wave is now running into a rip tide of uncertainty according to some certain pulled a certain posters although Democrats are preferred and the national poll overall\nHere's the key their advantage has vanished in the house districts that matter most and district rated as most competitive by the nonpartisan cook Political Report the parties are dead even on the question of which ones should control Congress\nThat means that in California Democrats are really fired up in New York Democrats are really fired up in Ohio\nNot quite as much or at least Republicans are justice fired up as Democrats are in Ohio and last month Paul is an amazing thing in last month's poll Democrats led by Thirteen percentage points among registered voters and six points among likely voters\nInterest in the election has jumped among many groups that tend to favor Democrats Latino African American young people more than two thirds of black voters showed high interest in the election that's up from fifty seven percent than the average of polls taken from January through September\nBut you're also seeing a massive increase a massive increase among white voters among Republican voters\nAmong older voters it's consistent so we do not know what cases you're but there is a massive gender gap in this massive gender gap is again the result of two things President Trump the tactics women and Democrats are toxic summit\nThere's gender gap is not one factor it's not that Republican ... it's not that men love Republicans and love President Trump because they hate women\nThe thing like that it's that President Trump is uniquely off putting to many women particularly suburban moms and the Democrats are supremely off putting demand and this is why you're seeing the polls close\nThe gender gap that is actually opened up wide in the last month is not between women\nAnd kind of a normal electric in men and the normal electorate men are now favoring Republicans in heavy numbers this pulled down Democrats with a lopsided advantage among female voters for the second month in a row women in the survey said they prefer a Democrat controlled Congress by twenty five percentage points fifty seven thirty to which they massive yeah\nMale voters however what Republicans to lead Congress by fourteen point margin fifty two percent Republican thirty eight percent Democrats\nIn competitive swing districts are mostly in suburban areas\nUrban voters favor a democratic controlled Congress by thirty six percent margin rural voters favored the GOP by thirty one points\nAmong suburban residents the parties are virtually tied forty four percent favorite GOP control forty five percent favor a Democratic Congress\nNow why because voters continue to trust the Republicans on the economy on trade issues Republicans are preferred by Seventeen point margin that's up from eight percent in August the issue has been in the spotlight because President Trump was actually able to closing after deals all of the talk about tariffs in trade wars but it's basically receded into the background\nSo all of this is good news for public does that mean Republicans hold the house\nIs still more unlikely than not by\nThis upsurge is is pretty amazing stuff for Republicans in the lead up\nTo image from election and again a lot of that has to do with the fact that the Democrats are just terrible at everything ready they're terrible at everything I mean they're completely off putting on the most basic basic issues and that's what we are seeing none of the story of today's politics is is how off putting the Democrats are\nAnd Mitch McConnell for example like cocaine Mitch as we're fond of calling it OK Mitch was eating at a restaurant who is confronted by protesters if this thing becomes consistent\nIs not good for the country and it is certainly not good for the Democratic party which seems to be embracing it in a way the Republican Party is not Nancy Pelosi was also confronted over the weekend and protesters shouted it hurt the differences high level Republicans condemned that\nI Love all Democrats are not doing a great job of condemning what's going on here look at these protesters confront cocaine mission Elaine Chao they're eating at a restaurant and I mean frankly there just lucky that cocaine Michigan go ballistic on them and tell them to say hello to his little friends\nMany I don't know why you'd want to go up against cocaine ... they will ... out your eyes and feed use the ravens but\nThis is what these protesters decided to do [laughter]\n\nAnd all the papers I get the hell out of here nobody likes you leave\nAnd this is why it's so funny I I've been asked before if anybody has ever confronted me at a restaurant or tried to make trouble the restaurant and like no I eat kosher those are all my friends are you coming to a kosher restaurant and you tried to confront me these are all my buddies much security or the June grew and so we're all real fight you off but cocaine Mitch basically have that in Kentucky\nAs well so he just activated his his goons to basically fight back against these guys by sitting there the cool collected turtle got all of it and meanwhile Democrats determined to show that they are just as many as you think they are in other ways as well\nThey've decided that they don't work is most important person on planet earth he's deeply important why they decided to bail rocket important I have no idea they're trying to say that you sort of like rock Obama except without half the charm or the racial appeal but they're still trying to manufacture this this kind of quasi enthusiasm for me to or\nAre they there was a report from ABC News

apparently there are a lot of folks in the media unless you don't want the United states and for the worst President Trump is a great so President Trump has responded to the rolling caravan of migrants that have left Latin America that are moving up through Mexico let in Central America and moving up electrical\nAnd toward the United states border\nHe's responded I think properly by pointing out a couple of things one we need more security to the countries that are allowing them to do that\nAre doing so with the intent of creating a pressure situation on our southern border why should we continue funding governments that are going to continue creating the situation if the hunter and government is going to allow folks to simply walk over the border to Mexico with the intention belong to the United states why exactly would we be funding that government\nSame thing as the Mexican government same things for the top of Dorian government there is no reason for us to back governments that are going to create pressures on our southern border without actively working with us on the immigration issue\nPresident Trump is full efforts are being made stop beyond what illegal aliens were crossing our southern border people have to apply for asylum and Mexico first and if they fail to do that the U.S will turn them away the courts are asking us to do things that are not doable that's correct that's correct we do have procedures one of the problems here is that you can actually show up\nAt a point to that and you can apply for asylum ... a legal way to do that that's not what these turbines are doing some of these surveys are simply finding places that are open in the United states for and crossing their\nFrom says the ... the Democrat Party changed the immigration laws now\nNow I'm not sure what immigration laws you want to change that typically we actually just have to enforce the laws that are already on the books are not allowed to illegally enter the country we are allowed to the poor people\nWe can streamline that process maybe those large wants change but it is true that the Democratic party has been using the immigration issue with the clause against Republican suggesting the Republicans don't care about what you know because they want to defend America's forests\nThat argument isn't working very well but typically because a lot of Latinos in the United states are also interested in living in a country with border they're not interested in living in the country or anyone can go and come as they see fit one of the great lies with the media is that everyone agrees with an open borders agenda virtually no one in the United states actually agree with an open borders agenda\nAnd it's pretty obvious that there is an actual agenda to the Caribbean it's organized not only that organizes organ\nFor the cameras ... report hundreds of migrants apply for refugee status in Mexico in the southern city of should that has all go by Sunday evening the Interior Department reported it had received more than a thousand requests but\nMost of them are not doing it they far bigger reported the sushi river from Guatemala to the Mexican side individually and dozens at a time and resume the truck at first light marching ten abreast on the highway\nHe said boy do they chanted in Spanish yes we did\nWell we don't have to let those people cross the border the throng grew even larger when the migrants arrived at the border British flowing overnight to five thousand it was not immediately clear where the additional travelers came from and it's about two thousand had been gathered on the Mexican side Saturday Night\nPresumably some of those folks are from Mexico they're not necessarily from countries to the south of Mexico their destination on Sunday with the city of ... in the ... state under a blazing sun small groups of twenty thirty plus arresting the shade of trees on the side of the road by afternoon the caravan had evolved into long lines walkers traveling for miles\nBasically what this looks very much like is the middle eastern migration that has swam a lot of Europe that's what this looks like just visually now the numbers are not the same obviously as you're seeing from immigration from North Africa and the middle east into\nIslands off the coast of Italy but the image the injuries the same it's it's a group of folks are trying to escape a worse life and simply cross the border illegally into the United states again the United states they sovereign nation we can't afford to simply taking everybody that we would want to take in\nOut of economic necessity or out of out of some sort of of sympathy for the folks crossing the border you cannot have a country that is the strongest economy on planet earth\nTaking in thousands and thousands of people illegally without letting them know without any sort of skill set that does not make for a good economy this is one of the reasons why it's so funny open the less they love Norway they loved Denmark unless we in\nThe immigration restriction is have been winning in Norway Denmark and in Sweden\nYou cannot actually have it on social estate in terms of redistribution of wealth when you have an underclass that it's coming that does not have a skill set\nAnd one of one of the things about about those ... the northern countries Scandinavian countries is that they basically banned immigration\nWill the United states the left in the United states wants it both ways they want on open immigration at the same time that they want to raise social spending you heights never before seen in human history that is not a recipe for victory\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win on that even Lindsey Graham was a real job on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously one of the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration from even he said listen this is not something we can do Nancy Pelosi would welcome these ... I don't know what happened Lindsey Graham\nHe bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham to point out the ... is really good and here's Lindsey Graham senator from South Carolina saying Nancy Pelosi will welcome these caravans\nYou want to be the country of people that run you up and down the hall and spit on your ... or do you want to be a country\nOf a of of of Republicans who can actually deliver for working families out there that will foot good judges on the court that will stand up to to the enemies of this country Nancy Pelosi will welcome to care of and fear a Donald Trump and the rest of us will stop", "show_name": "The Drive Home With Jillian Barberie & John Phillips", "year": "2018", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "23"}
