new report\nAnd the key quote says there's high agreements across various lines of evidence that's in the report that the remaining carbon budget for one point five degrees Celsius or two degrees Celsius would be larger than the estimate the time of the ... they are probably the last big study they did that was back in I Believe twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen\nWhat that means you know in in non science the is that\nIt turns out that our carbon emissions have been lower than they thought they were when they first made their estimate which means that the climate is warming it slightly lower rate than they thought it would be at this point so the estimated date for hitting one point five degrees Celsius of of global warming\nIs actually it's been pushed out further now they were saying that we're going to hit that three four years now they're saying we're going to hit that in ten years they keep pushing that down the line\nThe reason that this great skepticism among folks is not because people don't necessarily believe in climate change at all as the climate is not changing\nIt does raise questions as to the sensitivity of the climate to human produced carbon emissions Cuban produce greenhouse gases skepticism I think is warranted with regard to some of the more outrageous claims that are being made by un members and radical leftists who\nIndeed many of them have an alternative agenda and not just saying they have an alternative gender they're basically saying so there's going to be ... who is a meteorologist and a visiting scholar at um at us and Ireland and I'm not sure what the University of Minnesota I suppose\nI and he he actually calls for an end to capitalism in order to fight climate change\nNow there are a lot of folks on the right who have been suggesting for a long time that was actually the agenda here that all of the worry the extreme worry about climate change was really designed to hamper America's economy in the world and the evidence for this\nWas actually presence right there was evidence that for example the Paris accords which were demands on the United states that we were supposed to radically shift how we did business while other countries made empty promises about how they did business\nBy China suggested for example that they were committed to reducing greenhouse gases after peaking in twenty thirty\nWell American studies already showed that China was planning on peeking it's greenhouse gases in twenty thirty they promise to do something or already going to do\nIndia promised that they were going to gradually lower greenhouse gas emissions at some point in the future that promise didn't mean anything there's a lot of folks in the United states were saying well why are we committed ourselves to attempts and targets when the world's greatest emitters and polluters are not actually time themselves to anything\nOf substance here no Eric Auld house he says that if you're wondering what you can do about climate change the world's top scientists just gave rigorous backing to systemically dismantled capitalism as a key requirements maintaining civilization and a habitable planet I mean if you're looking for something to do\nSo the idea is that we have to get rid of capitalism completely where is he getting this from in the report well there's a section in chapter four of the un report that says increasing evidence suggests that climate sensitive realignment of savings in expenditure toward low emission climate resilience infrastructure and services requires an evolution of global international financial system\nEstimate suggests that in addition to climate friendly allocation of public investments that'd be like building levees and ensuring that there's infrastructure\nA potential re direction of five to ten percent annual capital revenues is necessary so basically the entire profit margin should be redirected as the un suggest that it should be read directed\nNow there are several problems with this report the first problem is the way that it's actually reported by mainstream media so the way the New York times reports this that the landmark report from the un scientific panel on climate change painting a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought\nExcept that's not really not much change between the twenty Thirteen report and this particular part they are five in this report not much changed at all\nIn fact the only thing it really changes that they said that their forecast for doom has actually been pushed out a few more years but the way the New York times covered this that everyone is going to die at one point five degrees Celsius changed by twenty forty as opposed to two degrees Celsius\nChange by twenty forty the report issued on Monday by the answer a governmental panel on climate change\nSays that a world where it describes the world the worsening food shortages and wildfires amassed die off of coral reefs as soon as twenty forty a period well within the lifetime of much of a global population when\nThe New York times says that what they want you to picture the day after tomorrow that movie with Dennis Quaid where suddenly giants nominee just washes through New York city and set the whole place under ice for a thousand years\nAnd global warming is responsible for the rising sea levels and everyone dies and catastrophic it's deep impact except with climate\nThe problem is that that's not really true all this climate change is going to happen over the course of the next century human beings are pretty good and adaptable when it comes to adapting overtime to threat to the present themselves overtime climate has been changing across the world for the last century and a half to listen to Eighteen Eighteen Seventy\nAnd human beings have been migrating and moving and developing new technologies to deal with all of that and the same will hold true in the future as well\nNow to talk a little bit more about the un report in just a second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like usa why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nHe'll actually built to sleep when she takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference is the perfect

your preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty and you get to try it out for a hundred and ... she got nothing to lose\nRight now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all ... get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he like sleep dot com slash a bureau\nThat's hugely dot com slash a bureau for a hundred and twenty five dollars off your mattress or he looks like dot com slash a pure I Love my ... my wife and I have one we ordered it we did the sleep quiz you came in the mail we impact it put it on the bed was good to go\nSo comfortable we got one from my sister for her wedding as well check it out he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nSo according to bill hare who's author of previous IPC she reports\nAnd ... it's just a climate analytics a nonprofit organization they're a left leaning one\nWe're not aware of this just a few years ago it's quite a shock and white concerning that this is the first report commissioned by world leaders under the Paris Agreement which again is that two thousand Fifteen pack that people supposedly sign but really made no real commitment to keep and Trump said this is a waste of time and pulled us\nOut of it to the author ... found that of greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate the atmosphere will warm up by as much as two point seven degrees Fahrenheit one point five degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels by twenty forty inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts\nAnd poverty there are significant problems I should mention in climate change modeling none of the models have been put forth so far actually\nReflect the level of climate change it's been occurring virtually all of them over shoot the mark and that's because climate is actually very difficult to predict there are a lot of factors that are involved in climate now how much of climate change is caused by human activity certainly some the PC she says eighty percent\nFolks like Roy Spencer who I'm sure you've heard on the other talk radio or my Rush Limbaugh Roy Spencer\nHe said that he thinks about fifty percent but certainly our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions leads to climate change the question is really not whether that's happening it's what extent and also what the economic damage is from such climate change what the human damages from such climate change\nSo than New York times just playing this up as much as humanly possible\nAvoiding the most serious damages requires transforming the world economy than just a few years debut authors who estimate that the damage would come at a cost you fifty four trillion dollars while they conclude that it it's technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid to point seven degrees of warming they concluded maybe politically unlikely\nFor example the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions perhaps as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton by Twenty one hundred would be required that say forty dollar per gallon tax on carbon\nThat's what you're talking about every time you go to the ... and you buy ten gallons of gas ... four hundred dollars in tax in order to meet that twenty seven thousand dollars per ton number\nThe Obama administration had suggested fifty dollars per ton and that was considered high at the time and all of this is to say that these estimates are are wildly overstated in terms of the amount of damage that they are likely to do the reason that I say that it's because of the report itself\nThe way that these these things get report in the media is that there is virtual certainty and the scientific community that this stuff is going to happen the problem is that virtual scientific consensus doesn't actually exist a lot of key issues\nComing up there is another point that folks aren't really making about this high PCC report that's a little bit of boarding namely that I'd be even more has some very specific production about bad things that are going to happen but they don't quite sure of those production I was waiting to hear [noise]\n\nSo how do you get ready to go out to shower and you brush your teeth or even a human
