Elizabeth Warren only belongs one purported victim group she's a white woman\nClaiming minority status allows her to say that she's part of the victimized minority in the United states even though she's lead a pretty easy life was born with Rutgers law school\nAnd then she became a lawyer and that to me I'm a law professor University of Texas at Austin than University of Pennsylvania that Harvard law school\nShe puts in houses she made money wasn't the board is not a person who is in ... for men to suffering at the hands of evil American patriarchy hierarchy just to come up with some story that can put\nIn the easiest way to do that as you try and connect to\nYour relatives the same routine that Hillary Clinton did she used to talk about her parents all the time and our parents suffered a lot her mom particularly was was fraught upon it's a woman in the United states because Elizabeth because it turns out Hillary didn't have a good victimization story in the Democratic party you need the conversation story in or something you can try to lead the charge on behalf\nOf all the ... Elizabeth Warren knew that you needed to lead that charge but you can only do that if she identified as some form of minority and the way they treated that is by saying that she had Native American ancestry and what group in America and more put upon the Native American\nAnd so she wouldn't let it go she wouldn't let it go no backfired on her because you can imagine how the Democratic debates we're gonna go you're going to see people like Kamala Harris turned to a bunch of turned to Elizabeth Warren is he developed Patrick Cory Booker returns will Elizabeth Warren\nAnd suggest that Elizabeth Warren basically traded on fake\nMinority heritage in order to try and score points with minority be\nIt's going to hurt her pretty badly Elizabeth lord actually damage herself pretty significantly but that was basically inevitable because you're stuck between a rock and a hard place you just a white woman running at a party that doesn't care about white women and thinks the white women are part of the patriarchy and she also can't claim minority\nBecause if she does she's one does with Lauren shot herself in the foot in a pretty significant way here and I'm not sure that your recovers because honesty was not a priority meanwhile she's not the only Democrat in turmoil story out today President Trump has raised already for his reelection one hundred million dollars in fundraising for his reelection\nIt's only twenty Eighteen according to run which times the British times President Trump has tapped a hundred million dollars in fundraising for his twenty twenty reelection bid an enormous hall for president barely two years into his first term according to new figures reported by his twenty twenty campaign\nCrumpled in more than Eighteen million dollars last quarter through his campaign committee and to joint fundraising committees with the orange ... for a total of at least a hundred and six million since January Seventeen twenty Seventeen according to his campaign and federal filing\nSo that's bad news for Democrats you thought that Trump would have collapsed at this point that it would have destroyed themself by this point from Kansas points out because\nNothing you can destroy a man who has no character character in American politics is no longer a major concern obviously and so Trump can raise as much money as he want meanwhile Democrats in Senate races across the country\nAre having trouble do they don't all Rourke\nActing on the best ideals of his Democratic spread the wealth around campaign he announced on Monday he is not going to share any of his thirty eight million dollar war chest even the Democratic bosses want the cash for more competitive states obeyed or rocket will lose to Ted Cruz in Texas in the Senate race the latest polls have him down almost double digit after\nThe media have been falling over him the same way they found over Wendy Davis\nThe former state senator in Texas who then lost by something like twenty points to Greg Abbott\nAnd now they're for governor in Texas they're doing the same thing with Iraq the Texas Democrat told reporters after a campaign rally will not there any it's spent in his own re he plans we've all the money he has raised out on the field the head of election day\nO'Rourke raised from July to September thirty eight point one million dollars\nHe says that he's going to he's not going to contribute any of that money to other candidates which is kind of amazing because honestly if he wants to ensure his future in the Democratic party you really should become a patron of yards right he should be taking that money and distributing it more hotly contested races he's not going to do any of that so that's a bad story for Democrats meaning meanwhile\nClaire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri and James O'Keefe the kind of\nUndercover journalist\nThey is they were shocked or list over a project ... you've done some good work before he sent his workers ... some of his folks into Claire McCaskill's office and he got Claire McCaskill people to acknowledge that she is campaigning parts of the right where she actually is on the issues here some of what that sounded like\nYou I can show them because she does is familiar with that term [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Drive Home With Jillian Barberie & John Phillips", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "17"}
