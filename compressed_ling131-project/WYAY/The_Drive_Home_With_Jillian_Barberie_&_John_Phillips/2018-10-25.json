N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nAlright Claudio Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nGreat and then how are you okay thank you I'm a ... a lot of a lot of the topics and twice that\nYou make our our typical ingredients of what\nIs taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh that what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they called them you know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria ban and all these regions that are going through wars and\nUh we have the media that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe that you which is people that are wearing youth but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on mhm and I find very interesting I fight and I don't know if I can share on the\nAir with you while let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement or reaches to its philosopher kings in your Russo and Hagel and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your ... to skew in Sydney and in others but also of course Irish style and says real but\nBut the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity one looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value\nIndividuals have worth their God given God given God created and then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community and if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and obstructions\nIn which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society\nAnd to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual\nIs willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state\nConformity and uniformity our priorities their primary now are viewed as in view it that way conformity and you're\nMe that's not the priority as much liberty for an individual as possible and in order to society and immoral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and they will that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal on the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party and leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel date in Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determination\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happened here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are progeny of uh of haggling marks in angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant\nThe embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process Oreo way of agreeing with you I write Claudio thank you for your
