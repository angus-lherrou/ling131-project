I mean it will get Ted Cruz a perfect example with his bedroom race if all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done\nWell absolutely absolutely and and you could argue and read that there there there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never going to win California well if you can turn\nTexas to them for the Dems those three states\n... ... it virtually impossible to do math that makes it were a Republican to win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just skip the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you got it the same way that you have it in California\nThe same exact way by the way we've got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentator she was just on MSNBC deadline White House and she had some\nVery um insightful words and commentary and analysis about the two thousand mid term to make the midterms elections here is Rosie O'Donnell the liberal of the day which some great advice that analysis for this upcoming election listen to this\nMeans doing that the scare of journalists here who equals enemy of the people as we all know he's doing that right here's a guy who was tortured and killed a journalist who was making badly of cats and and\nHe doesn't respond why I'm sure that's just what three to think what could he possibly do to their journalist from not printing bad news about him which is also equivalent to the truth about him\nSo now Donald Trump wants to kill American journalists\nPer Rosie o'donald\nAnd doesn't want to stay and wants to scare journalists are Donald says he's doing that to scare every journalist here who recalls enemy of the people as we all know he's\nDoing that here's a guy who was who was tortured and killed a journalist and this is Donald Trump sweat dream to scare all journalists the same way\nThat inspire you tonight I I don't know what I can do I'm done Marco then we'll be back with you on Monday it's always great to spend some time with you if you want to follow me on Facebook and Twitter bent Ferguson show have a great night [noise]\nWomen Linda combs to talk your FM home of the Atlanta Braves the new talk one of those six siblings\nHi I'm dead walk in and I want to thank you Metra Atlanta for making my company all four seasons garage in a tree doors your top choice for almost Twenty years\nYou've chosen from the best selection of beautiful garage doors enjoyed on surpassed service but I Want to remind you of the beautiful entry doors as well whether you want to would steal or fiber glass door will make sure your home is the envy of the neighborhood\nCome visit our gallery at all four seasons garages dot com and remember when trust matters contact us twenty four hours a day seven days a week for all your door\nKnees across the Atlantic and there are impressive leaders in organizations making a positive impact\nThe good work show is our effort that good will of north Georgia to highlight the good\nThat make the Atlanta work every Saturday at noon will bring you stories of leaders nonprofits and people making a difference if you know an area leader or organization you want to be on the show email us at good works at G.

anthem pale treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced via Twitter that he's pulling out of the future investment initiatives done it in Saudi Arabia no other government official is expected to attend next week summit and then you can play him all the administration\nTo that you are the owner of your own labor and your own time it does it you are the owner of the product of your own hands\nBut according to Kim Kelly at teen vogue are great economic clear thinking source she says the capitalism places a heavy focus on private property economic growth freedom of choice and limited government intervention all which is true generally these tend to be toward the right of the political spectrum\nAnd then she says how does capitalism impact people well it depends on whether you're a worker or a boss if you own a company or employer the workers capitalism may make sense but if you are not then it's bad for you that's a bunch of nonsense that capitalism again has raised the globe from abject poverty the reason why you have cool stuff today\nSo why do people opposed capitalism well anti capitalist capitalism it's inhuman anti democratic unsustainable deeply at like ... and they must be dismantled they see it as inherently at odds with democracy because of how capitalist bosses hold power over workers in the workplace and the fact that the more capital what a cruise more power they have\nAgain on through richer people do not have more power over other individual human being and poor people do because they can't compel you to do anything it's when regulatory capture takes place that they have more power power is not just\nPower is not just being rich power is argue pointing a gun at somebody power does issue from the the Muslim world on it\nThe issue is simply by ... by bases are being rich how many times has has a rich person asked you to do something just in your life and he said no\nProbably fairly often I'm not even talking about things that are offering to hire you to do if they offer you ... if they offered to have something that is not power that is I'm offering you a consensual exchange and you're saying yes\nIn any case the the enthusiasm for capitalism is falling away because everybody gets to be the product of the capitalist system we'll get to live extraordinarily wealthy long healthy wise because of capitalism that gives us the ability of crap all over it\nThe same way that spoiled brats yell at their parents will to boil them we are yelling at the free market that have spoiled us to\nWait a seven and visit also Pope Francis talking with Michael Moore during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square at the Vatican\nThe current pope is not a friend's capitalism he's a liberation theology is he believes that that progressive economic ought to be wedded to the gospel and therefore he is constantly talked about the shortcomings of free markets\nAs though the alternative government controlled distribution of resources is going to be superior even though it has not been and even the social supposedly socialist countries that folks on the left let's talk about the Nordic countries Norway and Denmark and and all of a Scandinavian countries Sweden\nThose are all capitalist countries with socialist redistribution systems piled on top of them the question for those countries is how long you can keep piling elephants on top of stills and hope that the still continue to support that weight the filter capitalism the elephants are socialism\nIs not that the entire system is socialism\nBut the pope meeting with Michael Moore is pretty indicative of where we are and then we have a much bally hoos proposal from Kamala Harris the senator from California who was just awful I Know she's my senator\nShe is she is proposing a what they call a Trump size tax plan of her own the Atlantic doing humans work to try and suggest that a tax plan is basically just redistribution of resources here's the Atlantic reporting on Kamala Harris his new tax plan and this is the way Democrats are going to run here the way the Democrats are going to run\nIs in a way that that undercuts capitalism and this is an example of it scares her proposal according to the Atlantic Harris is offering that kind of fun house mirror and version of the sweeping Republican tacked initiative\nOne that would instead of slashing rates on high income household and corporations push huge credit out to middle income and poor families the lift the middle class act would provide monthly cash payments up to five hundred dollars to lower income families on top of the tax credits in public benefits they already received\nLast year Congress gave a trillion dollars in tax breaks to corporations\nHarris told me that money should have gone to American taxpayers when do we need it instead of handing it over to corporations\nAnd the top one percent now the fact is that the people at the bottom of the spectrum the people at the bottom of the spectrum are not actually paying any taxes\nRight now they're receiving net tax benefits okay the people who are paying all of the taxes and I mean literally all of the taxes in the United states all of the ... taxes in the United states are the wealthy in the United states\nAnd the wealthy in the United states are paying far more than their fair share\nIt is just a why the people at the bottom of the economic spectrum are paying the tax burden in the United states we have the most progressive tax system on planet earth and yet that includes the Scandinavian countries\nThe light at the Scandinavian countries is that they are progressive in their tax structure there or not they heavily tax people at the bottom of the lower end of the economic spectrum as well because you have to pay for stuff\nThe Democrats don't want to pay for stuff and as we'll see as we examined Kamala Harris as opposed to tax plan she's not talking about paying for stuff instead what she's talking about is\nEssentially forcing Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy or forcing us to take out inordinate amount of debt that will never happen to be paid for either through inflation\nOr through higher taxes not just some people who are rich\nBut on everyone on everyone as well it will talk about all of that in just one second but first let's talk about your online

to people who don't actually pay taxes this is the great lie that Democrats in the media are constantly telling about things like the Trump tax cut when they suggest that it's skewed towards the wealthy\nThe only reason tax cuts are skewed towards the wealthy is because the wealthy are the only people paying taxes in the United states\nPeople at the lower end of the economic spectrum are not paying income taxes they're not paying income taxes again the net taxes that are paid by the wealthy and they pay for Ninety seven percent of all government expenditures\nHated those in the top half of the income bracket are paying virtually everything virtually everything\nAs of two thousand fifty and this was the case the top ten percent of Americans pay two thirds of the income tax the bottom fifty percent of all Americans with an income below the median pay three percent three percent of the total income tax\nAnd one of the progressive most progressive tax systems in the world\nSo let's just say why that people who are rich or not paying their fair share a Kamala Harris really just wants to pass a bunch of poor people to vote for her that's that's basically are playing her proposal joins a growing number of aggressive plans coming from Democrat\nConcerned with economic stagnation competing to win over younger and more progressive voters and emboldened by the success of President Trump is different in their mechanisms cost and in fact they all point to the same Robin Hood goal not just raising taxes on the rich but shutting vastly more money to the working classes and the poor\nAnd Harris case I mean something like two hundred billion dollars a year more\nNow than it is important to notice that in the United states the amount of benefits that are being received by people at the low end of the economic spectrum tens of thousands of dollars in very many cases I mean there there have been a lot of studies that are done that have been done on this particular issue\nBenefits received by people who are lower income in the United states it's\nThan the numbers are pretty astonishing to people who need the folks who receive benefits forty nine percent of the population as a two thousand eleven lives in a household where at least one member received a direct benefit from the federal government the number of households receiving government benefits has steadily risen overtime\nAnd those benefits are almost entirely going to people who are in the lower half of the economic spectrum\nSo that those are the entitlements including Social Security

the wealth route as President Obama was found a thing a member of the world everybody will be better off\nWell turned out not everyone is better off when the American people lose their entrepreneurial spirit\nHere's one of the nice things about charity as opposed to the way that it works on the governmental level the government makes it seem as though the government and heading into money the government has no money of its own government is taking from me and giving to you or taking from you and getting to me or take them from the future and getting a top now\nThe government is not a repository of magical money treat there is no money for us but the government present you with the idea that there is so when the government send you a check you don't have to feel guilty about anything it's just receiving free money after all\nHowever when it comes to charity and their folks in my community by Jewish community who received charity they feel terrible about it you can see that you can see they feel terrible about it\nAnd I think that's a good thing\nI think it's a good thing I think you should feel bad about taking charity as long as you because that that's what's going to encourage you to not stay on the door it's going to encourage you to get out there and more it's going to encourage you to make a move toward prosperity can pay all those people back if you see the money that you are receiving\nAs a as a step toward getting your feet under you once again you can pay people back it's a much better way of viewing money and money is growing for free and that you can just take it no matter at anytime anyplace\n... it's a just a lack of entrepreneurial spirit and and unfortunately I think that that's the way that that we're going in the United states that example number one example number two there's a lot of talk these days when for him at all I did this exist\nAs well in places like Norway Norway which is which is prized love by folks on the American left\nAnd they ignore the fact that Norway actually has become a place where the work ethic and starting to collapse the economist wrote in two thousand hits the Norwegians have ... to ... minutes to get money from any of the state Senate the agency\nAnd you see the you actually see this happening where people believe that they are entitled to things that need the very fact that we call these benefits entitlement as opposed to benefit just to get them at the ... that's my number one point number two\nThe idea of picking up and moving we are the most mobile society in the history of mankind is easier to get from one place to another on planet earth faster than anytime in the history of humankind when we talk about our ancestors in the United states were things that people and covered wagon taking six months to cross the country\nCan do it in six hours now on a plane and for significantly less cost\nAnd yet we're now less mobile right ... fewer Americans are actually leaving their home town I mean which is which is not a good thing we actually want people to go out there and seek adventure\nRight now Americans are are moving less often than they were right there's an article from the New York times\nThe typical adult lives Eighteen miles from his or her mother according to an upshot analysis of data from a comprehensive survey of older Americans over the last few decades Americans have become less mobile most adults do not venture far from their home town\nWell part of that is because of family I live very close to my parents but if I were to move my parents would probably follow may not the other way around if it if I Want to live close to my family you know you have to follow prosperity you have to follow adventure you have to follow the call you have to move\nBut Americans don't feel that way anymore Americans feel like they're entitled to a job in their hometown where they grew up at the factory where their parents were\nThat is not\nThe way the human beings have worked for literally all of human ... in for literally all human history and yet now we believe that in order to facilitate people being able to stay where they were originally base we have to shift the way that the free market works\nWell that's not that's not correct\nAnd again this is not coming out of a place of a lack of sympathy this is coming from a place where I sympathize with people's plight and the question is what can you do to make your life better Democrats books on the left they want to talk about what can we do to make your life better and the answer is very little the real question is what\nCan you do to make your life better because every successful ... person on planet earth is a person who at some point said to themselves what can I Do to help myself\nAmerica is a country of people saying to themselves what can I Do to help my ... in life what can I Do to be more ambitious what can I Do to stretch my wings and why\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of your way what can we do to remove the barriers that's the American way is not the American way say listen you know ... it's uncomfortable to stretch your wings and may be difficult to leave home it may be harder to do this\nBut it so so we're just going to make sure you know you never have to\nWe're going to Cato you we're going to make sure that your swab in the warm blanket of government benefits\nWe're going to ensure that you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy this is coming from a place of you can't innovate your children you can't innovate your communities and you can intervene your country on the basis of empathy alone\nAnd that is the best case interpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here the worst case interpretation is something much more cynical the purposeful innovation of an entire sector of the population

Disneyland short Cinderella she loves bell she was all of them but apparently there are certain princesses off limits according to certain actresses and Hollywood here nightly says that she is not going to allow her daughter to watch the Little Mermaid or Cinderella\nWhich makes perfect sense because\nShe played in pirates of the Caribbean a woman who had to be saved by a man by here she is in here she is talking about she's not going to let her kids watch Disney movies I Love that pop sugar covered the Karen ... district parents in the world that Disney movie and the reason is spot on and what is her reason let's hear it from Karen I like\nAnd I she's banned from seeing certain a children's movies right yeah what are they Cinderella mhm and ah it because you know she ... she writes around for rich ... ... ... okay say right [noise]\nI ... a night about the case I really liked the sound of a nickel night I mean there's some great in fact do not give you a voice stop for a law [laughter]\nOkay to lure made is immoral but for other reasons the Little Mermaid is about a girl who decides to disobey her father leave her culture and go gallop dancing around even though she knows that her father is going to be turned into like an ...\nSo she said that that that Little Mermaid heads to some some serious problems with it but Cinderella really the message of Cinderella is wait around the hey by now first of all have you seen a modern version modern version is great\nBecause you have you guys you know modern version of Cinderella like Justin and send you the the the one directed by kind of brought up it's terrific terrific terrific film it's really good and if you think that Cinderella is supposed to be some sort of shrinking violet having watched the original Cinderella the original Cinderella to kind of happy if you go back and you watch it it's actually true but\nThis idea of ... women can be saved by men women have your samples that\nWomen should be independent women should save themselves also there are situations in which women need men\nIt's called all of human history and there are situations in which many with it also called all of human history but need each other in different ways one of the great annoyances that I have with some of the modern Disney film is it every single Disney film is now concerned with this idea\nThat women are deeply independent and they do not need a man and one of the reasons why frozen is much more popular with critics entangled was even though tangled is by far the superior movie because tangled is is about yes an independent ... but also about the guy she falls in love with who have to actually perform relative each in order to help her\nThat's okay that's good for a boy and guess what doesn't mean that girls can always count I should say that but when evil is a foot in the world they just simply men who are going out there to me the evil with a sword or a done\nThat is what what's not pretend that all gender roles are the same now I'm going to say something deeply controversial men and women are different I Know very controversial and fairytale tend to embed these ideas and men and women are different that women\nAre largely composed by evolution to help build and men are largely built by evolution to help protect and defend or this is this is a difference between men and women\nMen are built to destroy things they can do things too but only when they are doing so for the purpose of cultivating a family or cultivating civilization which is where women come it by women help build civilization by helping to pay men and also by basically\nChanging their destructive tendencies toward toward growth\nReinforcing those things is not a terrible thing and Christian bell came out and she said something very similar Christian ... said that that Snow White and to the wrong message she says it Snow White sends kids a bad life lesson she says every time\nShe says Everytime we close no way I look at my girls don't you think it's weird that you know like in the old witch why she needed to eat the apple where she got the apple I would say I would never take much ranger when you make heads or like no and I'm like okay I'm doing something right\nWell you don't actually have to teach your kids that that sort of the theme of the story is it an idiot\nRight the theme of histories and Snow White shouldn't be taking apples from strangers and then she also said don't you think it's weird the print kitchen Snow White without her permission because you can not piss someone if they are sleeping the whole point of that very tail end Sleeping Beauty is that\nThe it only works because it's true loves cats that she's met the prince before and he and the idea is that love overcome even death that is the actual theme of the fairy tales but I guess we're gonna rip all this stuff away in favor of surface messages about me too and women's empowerment really

principal sent out an email to parents because\nA student was at a local Starbucks and told the principal later on that a a black man was staring at her and followed her\nAnd she was scared because it looked like he was stalking her\nSo the principal from San Diego name is Don a trip he hit a low ... elementary school now she warned parents about 'em and she described quote as an African American male about Thirty years old about six one six to dressed in all black and who did sweat shirt she advised parents to call the police quote if you see something that doesn't feel right\nWell some parents went nuts how dare you say that they were looking for a book on the lookout for a black man\nOkay my first thought if there is someone who's scaring your students and your warning the parents to keep a lookout if you were going to describe that person wouldn't it be fairly important to describe what\nThey look like [laughter] well his both say a male was following this girl you see and I tell ya callers [laughter] hell man over there you\nCan't not said black or white [laughter] I mean how could you describe the guy who were worried about being a danger the students are not mentioned

she's she send an apology while it is critical to keep our school's family safe the way I communicated did not provide enough specifics to a dentist by the individual but could easily lead to unnecessary and harmful reactions against other members of our community\nAfrican American males continue to face discrimination in our society everyday the thought that I unintentionally contributed to that climate with a vague email is something for which I owe our community and apology\nThe school is going to hold\nA forum on Monday to talk about [laughter]\nShe said she it was too much it was a mistake to send a description relying on stereotypes are let's see attention to that with this with ... ... email it wasn't vague six one six two Thirty Years' old black wearing a black ... all
