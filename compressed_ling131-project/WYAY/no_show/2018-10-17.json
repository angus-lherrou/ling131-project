blonde Heidi on the couch and the Russian don't you talk to me about those met that woman uh she said she had a line once again this is a TV show some writer wrote it but it occurred to me that is truly probably a lot of truth and\nShe wants told Tony she said you know it's incredible she's from Russia and lived in you know who you know dirt floors and no electricity or somebody okay so she says you Americans\nAre the only country in the world where you expect to be happy\nAmericans are the only people in the world who go through life expecting that they should be happy that you deserve happiness and that you know if the if you don't have a great cars because so much stop you from getting it and if you don't have a great job is because you were held down by somebody made the machines that Americans are the only people expect to be happy\nI'm not sure if that's true or not but check this out a woman named ...

seven weather traffic drop it off with red Borneo and fully\nRelate your\nThe way we want to\nWelcome back to\nThe bench bureau show so Carter Page remember that guy that's the guy who advised the war it was filed against by the FBI because he was supposedly a go between for the Trump campaign and Russia and all the rest\nWell he is now suing the Nancy Drew according to the Daily Caller\nFormer Trump campaign associate Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit Monday against the DNC and the law firm which commissioned the infamous Steele dossier\nHave filed a lawsuit in federal court in Oklahoma against the DNC the ... and two of his partners mark Elias and Michael ... now you'll remember what happened in ... the accusation from the Republican the Carter page was low level foreign policy aide for President Trump was\nBasically hamstrung by that yes he he was targeted for destruction by the DNC working hand in glove with law enforcement members of the FBI and the Obama administration\nThe goal being to get a buys a war against him and that would somehow damaged the Trump campaign that's basically the accusation and to to support that accusation there a couple of pieces of evidence one Carter Page still has not been arrested so maybe this was all set up\nPoint number two is that there are heavy ties between the the fusion GPS\nFrom that was hired by the DNC to do opposition research which included some Carter Page material and ... and the DNC and the FBI\nAnd those ties have been revealed overtime and they are bothersome they're quite bothers and they're quite troubling\nPage is is he filed a lawsuit in Perkins coy is the from the higher fusion GPS the opposition researcher that investigated down from ... to Russia Uighurs who is one of the lawyers will Republicans quite was perfectly main contact you fusion GPS it was founded by three former Wall Street journal reporters\nAs part of its one million dollar project using GPS hired Christopher Steele to conduct the investigation now what's fascinating about this lawsuit is that lawsuit sometimes are designed for victory and sometimes lawsuits are designed for discovery in other words\nIn the process of doing it lawsuit\nYou can ask bunch it a lot of questions to the person the your ceiling and they are forced to give up documents on this topic so Carter Page obviously wants to dig deep into what the DNC was doing what Perkins clay what they were doing the fusion GPS it also opens him up to discovery as well so in response you couldn't see the DNC\nAsking for materials on her pages relationship with the from the ministry in Russia for ... unless it's really ill founded suggests that Carter Page doesn't have a lot to hide but I think yes he does have a lot to high\nAgain Carter Page has been sort of the the main Lynch paying a lot of democratic effort to paint collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian government and twenty sixteen and so far no hard evidence has been brought out\nTo prove any of that stuff so that is a story that we're gonna watch as it unfolds now in other news that I think is not as good the budget deficit is the highest that it's been in years we've heard for a lot of years the Republicans care about budget deficits we kept hearing\nThat Rocco Palmo is blowing out the debt which he was up to what Twenty one trillion dollars now it's unsustainable and that's only the the debt that we\nKnow about basically a bunch of unfunded liability that put our actual total debt and many multiples of twenty trillion dollars unfunded liabilities for which will have to raise taxes but us budget deficit and expanding according to CNBC\nThe federal budget deficit Rosen fiscal year twenty Eighteen the highest level in six years that spending climb the Trump Administration said Monday ... seven hundred and Seventy nine billion a hundred and Thirteen million dollars or Seventeen percent higher\nThan the previous fiscal period according to a statement from treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is larger than any year since twenty twelve when it top one trillion dollars the budget shortfall Rosa three point nine percent of us gross domestic product that despite the fact we are now taking in more money than any time in American history from income tax Americans liked the idea of spending less\nUntil you actually ask them what sorts of programs they wish to seek out\nAt which point they get quite skittish federal revenues rose slightly by fourteen billion dollars app Republicans ... tax rates were corporation\nAnd individuals outlays climbed by one hundred and twenty seven billion dollars including a spike in defense spending as well as increases Medicaid Social security and disaster relief so that is not exactly fiscal discipline we have no party in the United states the chance for fiscal discipline\nThat needs to stop we need to get that under control if President Trump\nWants to win a second term I Would suggest that we started talking in serious fashion about those deft at some point that the the burden comes do we'll be back\nHere tomorrow with all of the latest I Can't imagine where the news cycle goes

I'm\nWonderful market Carmen\nKnew that good at just at two points on I wanted to make you asked about living longer or\nLiving a short amount of shorter amount of time and being happier uh-huh and you know they did the old saying is you know stop the um life in your you know it went up using your life at the life and your years yes ma'am exactly\nThat I Believe that and I believe that\nSo I Believe that you you know you make the decisions in life that you know or you know not only going to make you happy but you know I think that\nPart of our um happiness in life comes from giving whether it's our time\nOur our resources whatever it is that we have what is your kindness anything and it enhances someone else's life I Do believe that that ... is our own lives and but the second point I wanted to make is in regards to the young man that will um had\nThe end of the issue where he was selling his music\nUh-huh at the ... and then ... came in and gave me the more facts so you know I I I I understand now with the police officer was doing I just wish we can\nHandle these things better every place I Know the police officer had no choice at a certain point but I just wish people could learn to do better and handling these situations especially if you believe the police round forget you you know but go ahead or going right sorry\nWell known exactly I think I I you what you said is tied is going to tie in with what I was going to say is escalation on you know there's a sense if you have any right now in this country with law enforcement and um you know and individuals and I believe that um\n[noise] it could have been um it could have been handled Abby for escalation it\nJust sounds like it could have been to ... ...\nYes the unmanned asking you why are you you know you don't touch my arm or you know\nI'm not sure why you would talk to a police officer at twelve years old like\nThat or on at anybody any any uh don't like that why would just want any adult yes that you're absolutely right I I I understand what\nYou're you're absolutely right you're absolutely correct why would a twelve year old and talked to anybody like that and that's a great point that's why you're smart kid calm and have a wonderful day my sister\nAges say shall I Wanna I Want to hit this here Iran and can we hit this right here\n[noise] and [noise]\n\nGo see the welcome Shelley one showing the new talk one oh six\nSeven Shelley Shelly thanks for taking my call Yes sir thank you for calling just hey so to say hey I'm a smart kid by the way\nYou got to tell Brett that he he's got to write that oh I oh what I call in I got no yeah 'cause I don't see it written up here and then I don't go to you\n[laughter] [noise]\nHey that last call was awesome that's ... that's exactly she's exactly correct so so my thing that I Want to tell everybody is uh or or close to you it's not it it's related but but I Hope it creates a conversation is that is it everything the government aside from the people we elect\nShould be privatized everything\nAnd so um for instance\nYou think you'd think policing would be better\nI don't think it's bad I don't think it's bad but we really rough terrain we better well I don't I don't think it's bad I'm just saying better relative are you at right now to um do you think policing would be better if it was privatized\nNothing the government does is more efficient or effective then\nBut don't you probably have been the private sector but do you think don't you think that the ... if it policing were privatize don't you think there'd be even more of a rush to um incentivize incentivize the private corporations to make money off of frivolous stops the drought ... no no absolutely\nNot it it's the police it get in trouble most time like for instance a downtown Atlanta uh-huh city of Atlanta they rated a a gay club member that one\nYeah yeah or the bulldogs I think it was not the only thing about it [laughter] it's like well yeah they were paying out [laughter] ...\nEnded up paying a lot of money right away so caught right but I bet you if they were part of ties that rain would have never have happened\nOr happened differently I think is is that you hear that you're ... but what don't you think you'd be privatized ... six\nYear contracts six year contract so every six years your contracts up and they and the city council has got to\nDecide whether or not I don't think I don't I don't know I Wish\nI I understand I understand it is a thought provoking question 'cause I ... I didn't\nGovernors and mayors should be to the ... should be paid a paid very very well ... do well\nYeah I I I I got to think hard about that law enforcement thing because I think if you privatize it based on your argument I think you put law enforcement in a position to ... not the law enforcement anymore anymore and just taking a you know they\nStill have their job under contract\nThat job that I mean the way the the way they\nTheir job I got to go work as the great call and I will think about that I got to go to war with Brett Barnett thank you for your calls the great ... what do you think about\nThe guy who's signs the contracts for the privatized company would be definitely above the law in that area\nOh well I'm not going to sign you guys back right right with me right right on the job yeah yeah he would be no I just\nI just don't think like you see now what they call the focus in effect mhm where when you you know in Baltimore it's happening in in St Louis it's happening where when when you when you try and punish the police will will you know even for frivolous things which is ridiculous these guys put their lives and on\nThis rock him I don't care what you say I don't care who's listening I don't care who wants to argue the greatest lyricist and hip hop history is rock him\nHe's my number one he will always be my number one the greatest opening line of hip

to tell you all about it and then Brett ran in here and eat you know breathless William\nAll out of breath and everything [laughter] 'cause he ran around the corner and this is the story this story and it is really a great story\nCalifornia police say they will not charge a boy who was sixteen years old who shot and killed his drunk father\nWhen he started choking his mother\nBecause he was protecting her from abuse and saved her life I'm going to say right There God bless the California police may God Bless them for not charging this young man he shot his father was drunk father while he was strangling his mother\nAnd he shot in the boy was sixteen years old needless to say this boy probably needs to have some psychological help for the next four or five years to get them through this period unless the father was also abusive to him so with which case he probably feels good about himself right now but\nI'm sure I'm I should not make light of the situation I Apologize for doing that it's not a funny situation but I applaud the California police force they said they refused to arrest them good for them let's go to the phones would you do you would you take a long life\nBut
