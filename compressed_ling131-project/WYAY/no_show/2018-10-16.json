so first Portland so there was a a march called the Patriot ... patriot pride I Believe um and it happened in Portland over the weekend\nAnd it was and it got ugly because ... showed up and people basically started beating the crap out of each other here's a little bit of the brawl\n[laughter] lighting where they're coming in on the other morning or they're on a demonstration bill\nMaher for law and order in the streets of Portland descent into chaos his rival political factions broke into bloody brawls downtown\nSaturday Night members of the right wing group patriot prayer and they're black ... black clad adversaries noticed antifa used bears spray ... baton ... each other outside Kelly's Olympian popular bar on south west Washington street mainly which lasted more than ... ended when riot cops rushed in and fire pepper balls in the street fighters now as I say\nWhat's happening here is that group patriot prayer which I are being kept his white nationalist and I'm not being strong enough evidence to say that this is a white nationalist groups\nOr in any case and then this coming from a guy who was happy to to say what I think people are white nationalist rented to episode after Charlottesville talking about white nationalism and the evils of the alt right\nPatriot prayer was doing a march in Portland specifically because they wanted to show that anti with violent and people showed up and it looked like antifa instigating violence and the folks at patriot prayer then got into it with that including some of the Proud Boys from Gavin began his his group um and it got violent now as I say\nI think that is perfectly worthwhile to publicly march against violent\nAnd I think it's okay to defend yourself too but there's a difference between being willing to defend yourself and spoiling for a fight to the point where you are looking to beat the crap out of somebody because number one you shouldn't be looking to be living crap out of people and aggressive fashioned like one of the guys down the guys down now it's time for law enforcement to come in and number two\nIs perfectly obvious that the media are going to play it as though it is right wing group instigating violence as opposed to when he put which has been ... every single place it goes instigating violence or a little bit more video from that Raul in Portland\nIn the front people hitting each other on each other [noise] people shouting at each other\nAnd then there was also a separate Raul in New York so in New York there was a an event at the New York metropolitan club that had been defaced by allegedly antifa or over the past couple of days\nAnd there was an event for yeah making it to the leader of the Proud Boys now again the media have labeled the Proud Boys white nationalist groups there members of the Proud Boys who are white nationalist Yemen is not a white nationalist and Gavin Gavin is not only nationally Gavin\nI think it should be more strict about who he involves friends but to suggest the Gavin is white nationalist ignores any part of his rhetoric or that that's just not accurate now that said\nDo the Proud Boys spoiled for a fight yeah they do and you can see that in this particular video in New York now and he was claiming that the problem isn't getting the ...\nThe ... boys are climate and the fighting to get into violence barely after the event they walk out there's many members somehow the violent gets instigated and you end up with basically twenty members of the Proud Boys picking living crap outta remembers ...\n[laughter] and then they will get on either picking them and then eventually you'll see some members of sort of surrounding\nCrowd actually pulling people off of these guys [noise] um because they don't want them you know getting arrested or telling somebody on the street\nBrawls fought in public street this is not ... it's not simply nation and if the police won't do their job is going to get worse and worse and mayors aren't gonna do their jobs is going to get worse and worse your governor Andrew Cuomo called on the FBI to investigate violent clashes connected the Proud Boys and he blamed President Trump for the hatred and violence he tied the altercation\nIsn't the stations is not a federal issue\nIn the state and city should investigate every one of these incidents and the people who instigate violence you go to jail if the city was doing that in the first place in Brussels would not be breaking out we've seen them now in New York City is all ugly stuff\nYes you're ready to defend yourself don't go to events are spoiling for a fight be there in coordination with the police if you're on the side of law enforcement you're doing something right and if the less refuses to allow law enforcement you a job this sort of stuff is going to become more and more prevalent and it's horrible for the country truly truly awful for the country\nWell we'll be back here tomorrow with all the

into September and you're going to the store and the Halloween stuff is all rubbing up against the Christmas like seriously oh now little space of distance not necessary not yet right\nCan we not get through the mid term election before it's about twenty twenty I mean seriously because you have really did twenty twenty election that started during the Kavanaugh hearings because\nRemember the only

might be a rallying call\nBut because all this is going on and you even have the president of the United states being asked about twenty twenty on a near daily basis I feel the need to tell you this president Donald Trump will likely be reelected\nMayor Bill de Blasio Trump odds are he's reelected now\nBefore you just said they're going after it was pretty baseless no it's not even anything to do with the economy is not anything to do with all the record improvements that we've been saying\nHere's the first reason why the odds are in his favor he's an incumbent president running for reelection so let's start their sixty five percent of president who run for reelection when\nAnd in order not to when you have to be as lame is kept in the not the aforementioned Jimmy Carter or you have to do something like read my lips\nNo new taxes and then raise taxes they get yourself a Ross Perot and it splits about coming up\nI Will give you a little bit of the background about that sixty five

Saudi Arabia over a missing journalist telling the Associated Press that it's another case of guilty until proven innocent corresponded are with daemon reports on new details about the person behind the alleged murder of democracy energy\nFrom three sources a little bit more about the man who reportedly\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be reelected I mean people already see the mistake to me like you you really just do not get it the\nFirst thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at what it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and from info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes a Ford did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nAt\nSince the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida over the past two years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independents that have registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people going out registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology last hour\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen other places too and so don't be surprised that part of the story but\nBeyond that you got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst he is you take a look at the economy we have the best economy and the generation I never voted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better\nThey went through school here in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and do yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go well I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you've got some eyes are open\nTo gun in the in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justice is tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white\nMen yeah remember al is all about the white men white men and Asian man the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out oh by the way\nBut you also have the biggest increase in that take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there it is a little math\nAnd it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year\nWhen you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employee person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated two sides histories one side the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I I haven't seen a benefit for this tax cut well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably did anything about it which by the way Russia like thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments so if you're not saying that it will be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because of well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just wanted\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably has attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often we're we talk about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem\nTake a look at not having Tea Party and and white people specifically all of these are angry white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one folks on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile for potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically\nUnder the Trump Administration gets what does it make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot and be foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've released cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is has been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped toward the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade\nYou'll that had been worked out this bar to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration say that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation whether hey we got this journalist too by the way you know has a interesting history of his own\nThat goes into a conflict in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter and a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bugs bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who and what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring it back
