Confederate symbols surfaces on even debate sea surfaces on the eve of debate\nI think this is a plan by her because it plays for her doesn't necessarily play for camp I don't think this actual incident\nFires up the base of the brain camp abroad and kept the base of bright campus fired up ready\nI don't think this does it I think this can fire a moderate on her team but let's go to the

you know how to use Shelley you got to lose [laughter] I'm Down here you're keeping me entertained you know this is so\nI I ... and the other point I wanted to make is I I think you're right about who released it I don't think it came from the camp campaign because we haven't seen a whole lot out of the way\nUm but you know I I I just want him to use this debate\nTo points across um you know doing a great job is to educate or you rent a great campaign during the primary right but now he's he settled back and I've always had a lot to do and busy with you know everything that happened in South Georgia and\nAnd doing his real job but at the same time yeah in a campaign for the Georgians white you know like as soon as you know I ... left on certain things the Stacey Abrams is so far the wealth that I couldn't even get on board whether we asked you a quarter of the things that she has\nYou know how to sew so again because that's one of the other questions I have\nUm you know we ask a question every day now the question I have is what are you looking for tonight in the debate and you kind of touched on is the what are you looking for I Know you said you want Kim the kind of give deliberate issues but what what what are you looking for for whether you're voting for Stacey Abrams are voting for Brian Kemp what are you looking for in this debate tonight\nI think he has to come out of the the date on what he would do\nTo the issues that she's bringing up we need healthcare reform not socialistic healthcare and then you and your wife for some kind of health care reform in Georgia\nTo maybe show the fed that there may be a different way for health care\nAnd then I came here I\nHave a different idea we we we need you know a lot of reform and hey I'm all for social you know a lot of social issues out there I thought\nWhen it comes to welfare and you know um when it comes to food stamps and things like that I Do want people drug test I I Do want people to have to show that they're looking for work looking better themselves because I got so much work out here right now that you know there's nobody there should be not meeting the job gotcha I'm right here I I I Want to hear a lot of things from him on what you were to\nOppose the to the things that she coming out on that that's really what\nI Would you say you don't want to hear back and forth you want to hear when she comes out on some of the you know what she's four when she comes out talking about that in a debate you want somebody who's going to stand there and say this is what we would do as Republicans not that's a bad idea\nAnd and as much as I Love the Trump what eight people in and you can actually let himself be paid it into you know just\nOutlandish ... right I Want kids to stay away from that yeah like I Want him to every time she tries to pay him into you know something that is a non issue I Would like to see him fired back where policy\nI Would say you're sorry or ... or

most biased slanted thing I've ever seen ever in my life\nHow did it feel to have to you know she's forced to leave her children behind no she's not nobody forced her out\nThis is just ... this is so disgraceful and then NBC last night they are two different stories about cops who had to take down people who are fighting them\nAnd one of the videos a woman top another ... we're we're taking down this guy and they were and they were a struggle like crazy when these fight 'em like crazy so the cops are ... are pushing his head into the sidewalk trying to get his arms behind his back it was
