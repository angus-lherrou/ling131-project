think they were aware that they were doing that and I disagree I think they know what they're doing always and they just know that people listen to whatever the last oh\nNo I but I honestly don't think at times and I get this by the way from not my opinion it actually was when I read Bernard Goldberg book by us and he said they were in the media they really don't know\nThey really don't think that they're biased they really don't and and he was in the end he worked there right he'd worked for Denver he just thinks that they're right on everything but they never even missed the obvious things like the obvious irony that as they're calling for the end the divisiveness they're putting out the most divisive statement\nThat they themselves are not conscious that they're doing it that\nThey don't even believe that they just think they're they are so just driven by tunnel vision that they don't even know that they're doing it and I so that really that that really didn't come from you that came from Bernard Goldberg who worked for Dan Rather and wrote the book bias and talked about the media at large and the mindset\nActually have they don't walk around thinking that were Democrats and Republicans are thinking there's Democrats or Republicans on his way that we think and we're always right and they never questioned the way that they think they actually don't analyze what they're saying that the time that they're doing it\nAnd I just believe and again we don't know because you know ... whether it's soccer or whatever I Can't read his mind ... but it's such an obvious it's such an obvious devise a statement that once you explain to people go oh yeah they claim they're against divisiveness but they're actually\nObviously for divisiveness well especially

Can't be wrong I write yeah you're you're you're making a point there that they were analyzing that statement and knew the hypocrisy was there and but nobody will notice it no I don't think they knew the hypocrisy was aired they just they were so tunnel vision this is our statement we're right right [noise]\nI mean why don't we know who the targets were of these devices that were said what if they

that but I Do think that we're going to have to start\nTrying to attribute to people perhaps a less\nUh less vicious motive and we have been attributing to them so far because people hate each other not because of what they do but because of what they think they are and they think the other person is thinking that's where we are in American society\nIs one thing to hate another person because of something that they do or they they somebody murders your father you're allowed to hate them but what we have come to in society is actions that can be interpreted in a couple of ways and we've decided to interpret them in the least flattering most nasty way about somebody else\nTo take an example there's a religious Baker in Colorado He says listen I don't want to bake a cake for\nBecause I Believe that homosexuality is simple we immediately attribute that to mail is we immediately attribute that to that because the Baker is a mean man who hates gay people never mind that the bigger than serving gay couples for years in his cabinet and he's just saying I don't want to be\nRoped or hamstrung into violating my own religious precepts no we have to attribute him hatred we have to attribute team viciousness and we see that\nOn the other side as well and there are folks on the left will say things like well I won't nationalized healthcare\nInstead of a thing on the right well maybe they won't nationalized healthcare because they don't understand the issue or because they misunderstand how nationalized healthcare works or because they have a good faith argument about how we should redistribute resources instead we go do it because they won't control\nIs because they won't control once you start explaining people's motives without reference to the actual behavior you're going to get yourself into hot water politically entered into divide the country on a more significant among laughing level and yet this is also there's a problem\nThis is also the stuff that wins elections the stuff that wins elections in today's society\nIs castigate in your opponent is morally somehow deficient\nSaying that your opponent is not just wrong but evil Ronald Reagan was famous for saying that if it isn't that Democrats are are just are evil that they know so much that isn't so in other words he attributed to ignorance what he could not attribute to mail it\nAnd it's it's a it's a rule that I've had on the program tries to attribute to stupidity what you can't distributes malice\nBut when it comes to political fight the easiest thing to do is a tribute malice to the other side\nAnd you're saying as a matter of fact in a couple of different ways let's take for example the way that the left has decided to read President Trump's comments about nationalism for the president of the United states give a speech a couple of days ago and when she was talking about illegal immigration\nAnd President Trump is no stranger to character attacks or uses them on a fairly frequent basis against is political opponents whether they're former opponents like Ted Cruz or whether they are opponents in the Democratic party why because effective it's a lot more effective to attack somebody character than to attack their ideas because\nWe tend to vote based on whether we think somebody is a good person or not not based on whether we believe their ideas are good\nShe evaluating ideas takes time and effort evaluating ideas requires you to actually sit there and determine whether you think that the evidence is there to support particular idea but evaluating human being you can do like that\nAnd science tends to show that that's exactly how we deal with other human beings and our daily life and the politics more broadly when you meet somebody\nYou tend to make a judgment about that person within the first five seconds of meeting them whether you think there's a good person or a bad person the nice person or a mean person a person who you think is going to benefit your wife or a person who's gonna be a detriment you like to make that decision and second there's a lot easier and a lot more instinctive human brain is built for that\nRather than thinking through okay what are the policies and just politician that suggesting\nWe as a society need to start thinking about the policy is a lot more and stop attributing motives so much but\nAgain it is easier and more ... lucrative to suggest evil motive on the part of people the face down character attacks are deeply effective I wrote an entire book about that in two thousand Thirteen called bullies and the entire premise was book that basically left to decided to leave\nIdeal arguments outside the realm of the norm and instead have decided to attack on a character basis everybody on the right to Boise sampled here's President Trump a couple of days ago saying that he's a national is not a global now even implicit in that comment by President Trump\nIs a character attack on what the character attack on the left or the people in the United states you disagree with him about immigration actually don't care about the United states for that sort of implicit in what President Trump is saying but\nThe real point that he's making is that his priorities are the protection of the American people above all else and other priorities\nSuch as for example kindness or human rights those take second priority to protection of the nation's borders maybe for human rights reasons maybe for charitable reasons but that's the way he thinks that things were going to see in a second what President Trump that\nBut first let's talk about your underwear dudes fault is here and as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect her underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade a restock your drawers with drawers\nAlmost all colors prints from Tommy John Tommy John obsesses over every little detail in such by using proprietary fabric to perform like nothing you've ever worn before as a

John no just needed again Tommy John dot com used ... Ben\nYou get twenty percent off I Love my Tommy John underwear you will to Tommy John dot com\nHere's President Trump talking about nationalism and then look at the Democratic response because this is driving up the temperature again it's not unique to inside I keep repeating that is I think it's important there is a chart I talked about on this program I think a couple of weeks ago\nWhen we were in when we were in Memphis that showed the level of hatred within each party for the other party has been rising consistently for years but it is sky rocketed among Republican and it and it could here's President Trump talking about nationalism then you're going to see the sort of failure of that\nGeorge Burns was talk out down the cops who who's the the idea of trying to think of people that's possible that you're gonna see how Democrats responded by like that precepts here's President Trump\nThat wants to love to do well\nFrankly not caring about our country so much [noise]\nAnd you know what we can have the\nYou know the word is sort of became old fashion disclose a nationalist and I say really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist\nHere are the sort of implicit character attack President Trump is no leveling at folks on the left there\nBut he's not actually saying something race it you know what I'm saying something patches or making it here he is saying that some people have a priority which is to uplift places in the world they're not the United states that's not my priority now you can say that President Trump is from Anne in his opposition I think that's a fair critique\nThe way Democrats reacted was by doubling down on the line and do they say that when President Trump says nationalist what he really means is that he's a racist or here's Joe Biden\nRemember Joe Biden that guy who was John McCain's funeral calling for a new better politics\nJoe Biden the guys and the John McCain and I we got along we're best friends because we never questioned one another's motive here was Joe Biden at a rally last night suggesting that Donald Trump is like George Wallace an actual segregationist go by the way it was a Democrat and therefore it's probably closer to Joe Biden and Donald Trump in any case there is Joe Biden\nSaying that Trump is like George Wallace thanks to the nationalism common\nNew ... should remove [laughter] we can ... ... like George George where she's\nOkay I mean that is about as ... statement you can make about another human being as possible and then they said that he wants a new kind of politics and then he maligned the president of the United states has George Wallace an active segregation and he sort of character attacks have been happening since long before Trump and they continue unabated\nOn the part of people on both sides but the west really has ramped it up there is no question of the lessons wrapped it up I think the right has ramped it up and reactionary response\nComing up more democratic response to President Trump's comments on nationalism suffice to say Democrats are not abiding by the\nBasic moral precept you ought to attribute the best possible motive for someone who was the worst possible motive and that means or sanctions pretty awful things about President Trump is a ... year old [laughter]\n\nFolks life insurance is really important but one third

NBC News and she got into a conversation about Halloween know full disclosure I'm friends make in LA I think to making Kelly is really nice lady I was I used to be a regular guest on her ... new show when she was on Fox News and I wish her nothing but the\nMegan got herself into hot water because she was on yesterday an NBC News and they were doing saw\nAnd what was the chopped up they were doing it was he was the NBC morning show while the stuff that they were doing was they were talking about Halloween costumes\nWell there's always gets into dicey areas because as soon as you start talking about limits on Halloween costumes and what should be allowed and what shouldn't be allowed people get very easily offended by Halloween costumes to the point where people on the left have been suggesting in recent years the white girl shouldn't be able to dress up as Milan up for Halloween\nThey talked about last Halloween it's just idiocy it's just the idiocy my daughter is going to dress up any Disney Princess she chosen\nBy making stuff in a pretty broad territory here because she's talking about the use\nOf a dressing up as black folks for Halloween and whether you can put on black makeup dressed up as a black person for Halloween you here's what make and have to say and this goes to the central contention I making today which is that people are jumping the worst possible conclusion about people's motives without actually analyzing what the motives are so here's making talking about\nHalloween costumes involving putting on black makeup or darkening your skin for a costume and the blowback was just in order\nTo ensure that you do get in trouble if you are a white person who was on last week or a black person who puts on white Halloween like I ... back when I was a kid that was okay as long as you were dressing up as a character\nOkay so she gotten all sorts of trouble because then when I was a kid was okay to dress up as Diana Ross because the guy in a rock band and my neighborhood if somebody darken skins what what Diana Ross because if you just put on the right way uh you know to look like the Enron people still don't know who you are the dark and you're getting or whatever so\nPeople are nuts over this this is Megan Kelly being ignorant\nAnd bigoted and races and so making Kelly actually had to issue an apology here's what you said\nYour friends and he made one of the wonderful things about my job is that I get the chance to express and hear a lot of opinion\nToday is one of those days were listening carefully to other points of view including from friends and colleagues wading me to rethink my own view when we had the roundtable discussion earlier today about the controversy of making her face looked like a different race is part of a Halloween costume I suggested that the team to okay if done as part of the holiday or people have the chance to make them\nIt looked like others the iconic Diana Ross came up as an example I mean I thought why would it be controversial for someone dressing up is Diana Ross\nMakers of looked like this amazing woman as a way of honoring and respecting her I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong and I'm Sorry the history of blackface in our culture is important the wounds Judy I've never been a PC kind of person but I understand that we do need to be more sensitive in this day and age\nParticularly on race and ethnicity issues which are from being held have been exacerbated in our politics over the past year is it time for more understanding loves sensitivity and on her and I want to be part of that I look forward to continuing that discussion\nI'm honored to work with all of you every day making so\nI think in her apology is perfectly appropriate by the way but the outsized reactions were original comment is pretty astonishing so here is Kirsten Powers we supposedly is in favor of people say what they want freedom of speech here's what she tweeted you're white people who are upset that you can dress up as another race or culture for Halloween your feelings don't matter\nThe only feeling that matter are those who feel disrespected or mosque by you appropriating their culture for entertainment show some common decency\nSo basically the feeling that people are non white matter more than that people are the feelings that people are white\nNow I think that there is some actual nuance to this issue here is the nuance of this issue\n... has a long terrible history in the United states\nHad people actually dressing up as black folks in order to mock them was something that happened on a frequent basis all the way up till the Nineteen fifties Nineteen sixties in the United states\nAnd you can go back and you can watch old videos on YouTube of people dressing up at ... doing black putting making their faces black and giving themselves big lead in really really racist fashion and then singing Miami songs in order to mock laptops\nAnd it's very much the same thing as in anti Semitic cultures for centuries where people would put on a hook knows I and they and they put on a big belly and currently sidewalks and then they would suggest that they were Jewish right I mean it it's the same sort of thing like dressing up and they called her to mock that culture is disgusting unacceptable actually races\nNow is that what Megan Kelly what's interesting\nThis is what we're getting to the issue of assuming people's motives\nHere's my opinion on people darkening their face for costumes like that I agree that it's inappropriate specifically because of the past and I think that it is fair for people to look at this sort of thing and be sensitive about it but I think it would also be worthwhile to recognize there's a difference between being ignorant slash racially insensitive and being racist\nNowhere was making Kelly suggesting that black people should be ...\nKnow or was making Kelly suggesting that black people are in your in any way in fact are making Kelly was suggesting is and maybe why people want to dress up as some famous black people because they admire those famous black people that is not the same thing as people dressing up in blackface now again that doesn't mean that it's okay to go to a frat party dressed as a black person with black makeup on\nMe that's insensitive and you should take into account black people's feelings about historic use of this sort of costuming for mockery\nBut I also think there's a difference between even a frat boy going to a party and a little girl who decides that she wants to dress up as Michelle Obama and so she puts on dark make up\nBecause I think that you can pretty easily tell the difference and motive the attempt to miss it from the motives in our society is really gross Megan Kelly is not a racist and making it was not attempting to be racist by that statement at best and worst at worst Megan Kelly was being ignorant of the history of blackface and the impact that still has on black folks in the United states\nOr judge we release resort released it it is\nReally going to be dating three oh it just you know I'm fifty five or

anything's gonna happen I don't think there's going to be an if they the for those who actually get to the border and they're dropping like flies now they're down thousands or are leaving so some are just staying in Mexico asking for asylum there which they'll probably get\nSo it's definitely it it's kind of Peter out a little bit and I even if they all they're all the rest of them get to the

I'm not trying to make anything of this\nI'm just saying\nThe coverage was different the coverage of what happened is Susan Collins was different wasn't a Mr producing\nThere was no panic mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump Fort incidentally 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of\nThese things the president was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\n\nSo there's something odd about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said\n\nI told you yesterday that I could see and together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's fully open\nIt's fully open\nThat Trump's words and Trump's rallies and Trump's\nTweets are encouraging this sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first out of the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things in the president does than any politician does\n\nNational Public radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I were to submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute anyway I just spent an hour talking about it\nYou can download it so you can do your little cherry picking in your set up job and I don't really know why there is a National Public radio it's unnecessary we have thousands of radio stations scores of radio companies why do we need a government run radio company where the hosts are overpaid and they have no ratings\nThey don't live by ratings or die by ratings like anybody else you know competition for them it's government radio what do you have a government radio and a free society for but anyway\n\nSo we have these rice and attacks against Republican senators Susan Collins right after she voted for cabinet other threats\nPositive for rice and sent to Madison the or the the chief for the navy center the president of the United states white powder set the members of the president's family I really do not remember CNN getting all worked up about white powder being sent to the president's family does anybody else\nNow\nWhy does all this matter it matters because the media are out there trying to determine\nWho politically should benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damage thing it's the most grotesque thing\n\nAnd of course it's Trump Trump's to blame about Trump's not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything now I Want to um play a montage for you on this\nPathetic program on MSL as the the morning show and Mr ... you're going to hear and make a but you're also going to hear a never Trump or probably denies he's the never Trump or John ...\n\nYou're going to hear him a couple of times you also hear Steve Rattner Susan do her CEO whoever the hell that is John Heilemann Hi Adam in high to hire them in any way a\n\nAnd I want you to listen to this because it is it is really appalling what takes place on this so called network cut five go\nBut I Do now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that late it almost inevitable that top Democrats in the navy I wouldn't be targeted this is an unusual so the ...\nGo ahead\nOf the reasons that it is fair to blame him home so the president's rhetoric ...\nSo it's fair in some sense what sense ...\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot\nOr like Jay moron in some sense it's key you know let me ask you Jay pod of you guys over commentary read much about the repeated references to the president and Hitler I Would think that would offend you does that offend you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner go ahead\nOh I think causes I think what you have a right or if it were kind of rhetoric we've had this guy over and over again this\nIs a price on that his call the navy or the enemy of his people and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten\nBombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned and that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot in the federal judge was murdered I remember those ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings have kids in elementary schools and there's the media\nAnd then you recall is the enemy of the people of course we're not the enemy of the people well what the hell are you really I what are you what are you doing tonight what did you do this morning what did you do yesterday\nIt's appalling go ahead\nOr whatever ... is a part of this and is being treated as an enemy is going to act like\n[laughter] just to see me so I ordered she will be complicit\nIn ... oh so\nHe is complicit what follows what a disgraceful for really to get face time on MSNBC they'll do anything what a disgrace what a disgraceful group of clowns\nHere we have this going on in the country and its Trump and Trump\nThey're obsessed ... make and Joe ...

his allies they need to dial down the political rhetoric and they are making people less safe they are making journalists last day\nIs the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks waiting in the mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nMeeting up on the media and also just sort of violent rhetoric calling Democrats and law that saying that they support and that Thirteen and criminal um um\nIn danger as it's such a staple on the way they talk about on his opponents

when ... was shot in the middle of a baseball field did you hear any of this any of these recriminations about the Democrats and Bernie Sanders and the left and and\nHow they're just too aggressive any recriminations about lack black lives matter or or antifa or even going back to the Obama holder administration where they were trashing the cops on what took place in Baltimore and other cities and so forth any of it\nEver so why are they doing this now\nFor the reason I said the media or not the ... the Democrat Party the Democratic party is the manager of the media go ahead\nOn the weather it's about Maxine Waters are praising gene forte or calling him a media the enemy of the people on CNN fake news constantly ah people some of that mostly is fake\nNews you're doing it right now\nNot he calls you fake news I Would say you're full of crap news quite frankly I think the president really let you off the hook he calls you fake news it's a passive term it's a relatively nice to have you know your fake fake effective if he doesn't call you align pack rats\nYou could do that but he hasn't done that and the irony is even while you're attacking him your proving his point aren't you

a dissent is there have mongers\n\nRhonda said this probably the leading member of Congress supporting Israel supporting recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel supporting holding hearings on moving the American embassy to Jerusalem his Democratic opponent\nClaims that he supported by neo Nazis his Democratic opponent who supports the boycott effort and they they divest men effort against the state of Israel he's part of these radical left element that Bernie Sanders radical left element\nHe claims that just said this is supported by neo Nazis and the media have no problem with it none

your real world effects evidence and the wisdom of everyday experience here's what you know you hear a barn burner of his speech maybe get your riled up maybe you are moved to work harder to feature political opponents\nBut people do not leave a political rally sang to themselves what he said about those bastards really ticked me off I think I'm going to commit a mass murder attack\nPlease don't get me wrong he says\nA lot of the speech we're hearing from politicians as reprehensible it's a sign of the time by the way from the media to anti it's a sign of the times a reflection of the questioning of our culture an indicator of how we've lost respect for ourselves and the civility a good manners that go with it\nHas more over long been a category of speech usually referred to as

palpable incitement could ever be actionable\nPoliticians explicitly call for violence and violence results they should be held politically accountable regardless whether the circumstances\nAllow for the prosecution my point is simply this no one goes on a bombing spree because of something heard at a political rally no normal person has moved a murder because he hears an ideological firebrand
