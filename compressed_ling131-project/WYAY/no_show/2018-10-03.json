I dislike them like a play the video 'cause that's not what I Want to talk about but it please go on and watch it it's telling why I think feminism is a low stupid small minded meaning\nTheory a philosophy that degrades people\nAnd we don't need it turns men and women against each other and and look for me I think for most of us for most of us the relationship between men and women\nAre part of the joys of life right in the ... most for most people the relationship between the romantic relationship the erotic relationship just the interplay between male and female is part of the chief\nConstellations of life right and this is just a feminism has just turned us against each other and made people angry at each other it promotes anger\nAnd it doesn't help women and as I point out in the video that it's the constitution and classical liberalism take care of the rights of women I women guaranteed their rights they should be guaranteeing the rights\nThey should I Want women to do whatever they want to do I think feminism degrades their femininity and tells them that their feminine desires are bad and that they should have masculine desires masculine desires are the only good thing and men have stolen them for themselves that's basically what feminism says\nSo I've been obviously getting all this hate mail and what is fascinating to me about the shape now is all of it accuses me\nOf shame that women shouldn't have whatever job they won or shouldn't have whatever job they can do wish is nowhere in the video so why did why do people say this why why are they change\nIt has to be because they have conflated feminism with the rights of women and this is something the press and the left has organized it's brainwashing thing where they would say if you would say I'm at that time as I said why against women ... against women I saw him as I found in the Seattle that's against women\nSo they just conflate they've conflated these two things they've conflated a philosophy feminism as a philosophy and and by the way I you know you cannot say oh well it's not all feminist it doesn't matter the philosophy leads to a certain place\nA professor at Georgetown

take a position politically if you're if you're rock or one of these other stations that we have is you're probably best not to take a position ... politically here we do that is not there and meet that's right that's not what they do we have we do take us position politically\nSo our social media is going to reflect that try social media before I even got to the station\nI was a black

we're media outlet we're radio station of course writer so we're a little bit different\nBut the point is is that um if we have told the football wait I'm using the football players specifically you

saying about you know that that was kind of a you know\nYou know non manage what they were doing yesterday but the problem is I don't think you're the only problem I have with it is that I don't think you're seeing the big picture [laughter] I don't think that it was just that on an issue I think the fact is is that it was it's like uh\nThe last straw that broke the camel's back you know what they see as a person on the upper management when they're doing exactly doing making the same kind of comment and all their social media there you know I go in us that I go to the all the John are supposed to be doing\nRight I agree with you Shaun what's this memo doesn't say anything about getting off your social media it doesn't say anything about that and and but I think that's the first thing and you're right it is the way it is it can be the final straw but my point is Sean and I don't disagree with anything you set\nMy point is we're conservatives were not victims we've never victims so Missouri when things like this happened to conservatives or march from our our our central tenant as conservative as we do for South we will fix it\nWe won't last right we don't ask the government I e management to come in and save us that's not it's not what we do\nAnd I agree with you this this could be the final straw of a bunch of straw I haven't been here long enough to see all the straw so I have a different perspective you know what I'm saying well\nYeah and you know what your other things like you know I've been with this station since since day one writer I saw it advertised you know and it but it seems like since the ... the initial um advertisement of this of this station that ah the upper management has just been sitting this station up for failure because\nThey don't do the kind of you know they don't do what traditional radio stations do I mean you are a conservative station which if there's not a single liberal on the entire station right and so\nThey everything that ... that is there you know should be marketed to conservative people and a ... but the problem is you know if you know you're not going to a liberal person is not going to it's not going to go out and sell a conservative market because they wanted they wanted to fail because you know\nAbsolutely and that's the point I'm trying to me so so that being said again I can take what you just said if I replace conservative with African American you sound well African Americans for the last fifty years\nOh I agree I think my only point thanks for your call oh Gees more attacks or oh gee I like to oh
