Germany orcas\nAnd folks do you hate buying a car do you hate it when it comes time to purchase a vehicle I Know I Do and I tell you that's why we have here today\nRichard Davis from classic southern cars for sale given us tips and advice and sharing the secrets of the car industry Richard I'm you know we were talking during the break a little bit what is the game what people need to know but when ... when they go a purchase a car from a dealership or a car lot\nWell the ...\nWhen I was in the retail business it used to run in ten days cycles um with the computers and the electronic say have today it doesn't work that way anymore but what happens is is the factory will come to the dealer and say okay what are you gonna sail next month\nI'm it runs in cycles and depends supply demand how the market is\nBut like for example with us if the uh cougars were really hot and we were selling all of them they say okay we're going to give you forty cougars next month but you got to take ten monitor race and you've got to take Fifteen comments in order to get them\nSo what happens is is the dealer or the general manager of general sales manager they will commit to the factory to sell so many cars this is where the pressure comes and and in one of these big dealerships says that you could have a new car manager a used car manager a general sales manager a general manager and a dealer\nAnd everybody is looking down on you how many did you sell today how much profit per car did you make so it's an incredible pressure cooker really is\nSo my advice is\nIn the very beginning of the month most people are going for gross because your sales managers get paid the more profit they make them more money they make so they're more gross conscious but when they find out that there are four or five days of the month to go they've committed to sell two hundred cars and they're sitting there with a hundred and ten out that's not good\nOkay um that's how that there is a big turnover in the car business because of that stuff keeps up the sales manager so I find themselves out of jobs so they've got to keep cranking this up and they got to keep the numbers up some I suggested it would be kind of do your homework decide what kind of car it is that you want and we'll discuss this in a minute talking about a new car versus used car\nUm but if new cars going to be your route walk into the dealership and see where the new car sales manager is asked to see him directly\nChances are he'll turn you over to one of the salesmen but you want to walk in there and say hey how much can I buy this is what I Want for and hit him with how much under in boys will you sell me this car for ... remember they have all kinds of incentives and things that they can do to\nYou know to to dip into this and um this how you're going to get their attention I'm ready to buy a car right now\nAlso when you walk in so many of these dealerships\nSalesmen of kind of program to try to find out really what they're dealing with are you a tire kick or are you ready to buy a car today are you out shopping if you're going out shopping I Can't give you a price because no matter what I gave you somebody else was going to beat it they're going to cut it fifty dollars a hundred dollars\nI mean I can remember we had people come in order cars we went out of town to get them and they go someplace else and and sell us out twenty five dollars and here we go get a car but again it was a matter of units we had to get so many units out we were the biggest dealer and six days we wanted to stay that way gave us a a bigger allotment of cars so anyway\nYou go into the sales manager's office to try to talk to him\nAnd I'll just tell you quickly have this thing works let's take a car that costs thirty thousand dollars I'm doing this just try to be simplistic today most cars are going to be a lot more than this and that's the case these numbers are going to change but the Raleigh on and really only going to go up\nSo let's take a thirty thousand dollar car so they're going to sell you the car for a hundred dollars over next thing you're going to get hit with his adopt the and by the way they don't really want to talk about any of this until you meet the business manager whose job is to go over the paperwork\nThat's really not is jobs jobs the what else that they can sell you they certainly want to convert you to the financing and anything else and extended warranties\nBy so anyway you now you got a five hundred adopt the that's on there and they're not going to move that doctors say if you're going to get her off at all has to come out of the out of the deal itself that can't it's not something that's selective you can't sell it to one not sell to another\nNow they have a three percent roughly hold back on the back of the car\nNow how that works that used to be it was an automatic and charge to the deal is parts account that he got quarterly today some of the matter of fact you throw a bunch of ... it's it's based on service in the exits is person based on several different things but for the most part the dealers are going to get it so if he gets that he's got a nine hundred dollar back and\nNow if they financed the car for you they are now allowed to get to present it used to be brutal it used to be the deal is to pay like a quarter over prime at the time or half over prime and could charge up to twenty four percent\nSo I mean if the customer went forward it it was absolutely brutal in there or the government has changed that today they're limited to a two percent spread but again we're talking about a thirty thousand dollar car roughly they'll make about Thirteen hundred dollars on that now\nHere's another cue trick they're going to take the salesman will take your trade and when you walk in the door I Would just say to them I Want to buy outright don't mentioned the trade let's see put them against the wall first and give them and let them give you the price if they think there's a trade they want to start you for a list so they can over allow on the trade make it look a lot better [noise]\nSo what you want to do is start out on a guy like I'm buying a car for cash even though you may or may not I want to know your best price than say All right well what would you give me for this here's how that game works in a lot of stores and this is something you can't catch them at the only thing you can do is to do your homework on this\nThey take your car over to somebody like me as a sales manager\nAnd I walk out and I look at the car and I write an appraisal slip on the car I say ten thousand dollars it's good to ten days\nSalesman comes back over and he comes back to you and he'll say hey look the used car manager luxury car he thinks it's great he thinks he can sell it I got a thousand dollars for your car it's a lot more money than I thought it was worth I thought it was only gonna bring six but he really likes it and he's willing to give you eight\nSo I I mean we should let's go when you're ready to do business now if you go ahead and you go along with that as soon as you leave they do a thing called a CD which is actual cash value of your car and they will change and on their paperwork to ten thousand dollars picking up another two thousand dollars on your trait\nNow um extended warranties [noise]\nSome cars I Would say yes some I Would say no a lot of the Japanese cars no Toyota Lexus um uh\nHonda ah is is really a waste of money is like these insurance companies to build these are huge skyscrapers you know they're not in business for their health and the war and people are are betting that you're not going to have much problems with the car and with a lot of these ... cars are they're pretty foolproof\nUh probably thirty thousand dollar thirty five thousand dollar truck for eighty five hundred dollars kid calls them guys will tell you what I'll do is give you a wire me the money right now our ship it to you free he goes back and ... five hundred dollars you know you're looking at a probably Fifteen hundred dollar trait to ship that car from California\nAnd ah I mean it was just too ludicrous but he just sat there he acted like he didn't care about us he's lost eighty five hundred dollars he's tried to call him back now no answer phones gone but they were out there they're doing this stuff you see something that huge things too good to be true it probably is\nSo be real careful and especially when they say to you yeah I'm In the military and I'm Out on a ... on on maneuvers in Guam but to cars all packed up and shipped in Omaha Nebraska ready to go just wire the money but you want a wire them as a dial tone stay away from this okay\nI'm a ...\nAnother thing real quick you were talking about a ... maybe talk a little bit also about the um what's\nChanged for the title feet now that that's a little\nBit okay well [noise] the the dealers um the problem before was that people would go in and they've been to individuals because they don't wanna pay sales tax\nOkay well today there is no more sales tax so the deal is love this oh the playing field leveled whether you go to an individual or you go buy it from a dealer today it's called a a TV taxes they titled transfer attacks\nAnd just to give you a quick example if I have a car sitting outside then you want to buy and sell it to you you go to the DMV you're going to have to pay the tax and two days later Jim wanting you sell to him Jim's going to have to pay that tax\nUm where it benefits you is if you're keeping the car if you're going to keep the car two and a half three years you're way ahead of the game because tags only twenty dollars a year\nAnd where you can get caught in this is let's say you go to a deal you bought you pay the seven percent sales tax back then or a depending on where you are and um your birthdays ten months later on that rolls around and you could get hit for the abalone tax this encompasses all that there is no more abalone tax and there is no more sales tax is the TV\nTeach which benefits you by holding on to the vehicle if you call your your\nMind or an hour ride back to real quick about should you buy the year and year old car two year old car remember nobody drives a new car the minute you go across the curb so few by last year's model you have an instant one year old car and and it's going to be looked at that way even though it's a low mileage car you're going to get a big hit 'em so is it really worth the price not to me\nAren't defense right I I Would have had with him I guess in the end of the month you want to sell if you don't there's plenty of the deal as to\nHow much over you're going to sell me the car or on what will you do and if you can keep them close to end voice also another thing always check with your bank a credit union see what they'll do so then you'll know you'll have an intelligent answer as to what the loan is what your interest rate will be before you walk in there\nAnd and like I said I Would weigh this warranty a a very closely I see so many people it they they they come out of there they're just shaking their head thinking they're going to have at three fifty payment and it's six hundred dollars time you get through with all these other things that you're you're buying\nAnd remember even when you're looking at these numbers the T. V. T. tax has to be paid for so if they're going to finance that as well as the warranty you know it it runs up quick\nWell you know when I was wondering Richard when we when you when you go to a dealership where do they get their used cars where do they come from\nOkay here's the deal but we used to do um we had a big rental fleet but on a daily rental fleet you don't see quite as much of that today and the dealers because it's too competitive everybody has to loan your car\nUm what I Would do when I was short I would either go to other dealers or go to the auctions things have changed a lot today a lot and especially when you big chains the used car managers a lot of them are not allowed to wholesale cars\nMultitude of reasons and again we're getting off her another tangent but a used car manage it can make or break a dealership\nIf he doesn't put enough money in the car you can't trade it if he puts too much money in the car they call it water in your inventory you turn around Ninety Days later you got a whole bunch of cars sitting out in the back and you got a tremendous amount of water because he didn't have praised him right I've seen many a dealership\nOr when they used car manager quits gets fired he'll hand somebody a little black book which is our our main Bible back then and he'll say hey this guy's been here six months good fella you're the used car manager here's the book and it's very dangerous thing to do\nBecause first base in an all out of your franchises you could have six eight ten competitors out there\nBut something else it's interesting if you take your trade and go to six or eight ten different dealers you're going to get six or eight ten different figures on your car because it's strictly an opinion and while the book may have extra clean clean averaging rough you have to be able to identify which category that car really ... falls into\nWhen I go to a dealership I'm Talking about a reputable dealership not one of these used car lot but when I go to a new car dealership and on their used car lot I see that they have certain ... a used cars that are certified and certainly used cars are not certified what's that all about and doesn't mean anything\n[noise] again at dealing with the car if it's a low mileage car was that means they pull it in the shop\nUh like for example on a Lexus I Believe it's around thirty five hundred dollars is what it cost they put new tires they put new brakes they go over the car from front to back you get an extended warranty so there is something to that\n[noise] yeah but I'd rather have the thirty five hundred dollars and and you know as long as you're buying a low mileage car 'cause that's such a bulletproof car you know you you just keep a service regularly and you'll probably never have trouble with that car\nSo I mean there was some other way for them to make some extra money yeah they're going to market up of course over what it costs to to do that\nUm another thing you mentioned age I don't like daily rental cars if you've ever gone to any one of these companies you rent a car you know if that cars got thirty forty thousand miles out of a time they turn it it could have three hundred owners you know hey I Want to see how transmission weren't so see how the corners of see how fast it stops you know there's all kinds of real negative reasons personally I wouldn't buy one of those\nI also given the choice between the two I Would buy a two year old used car a three year old used car that's had a a significant amount of depreciation still in factory warranty\nAnd and you're not going to get murdered when you go to sell it now there are some people that say oh no I Want the factory warranty I Want that free warranty there is no such thing as a free lunch and the warranty is not free\nThey take this is the way they used to work and I can't imagine it's changed they take the number of cars that they sold their number and divide by the number of expense they had called maintenance and policy warranty in policy they divided up it was like seven hundred and some dollars I Believe back in the late seventies and that's in there is built into the costs of the car\nSo you're really not getting anything for free you pay for\nDanny you had a you had an interesting question here during the break the other half of well\nListed I and I I feel like we still need to get a little more into the by first but but then I Want to get into selling a used car but when buying it again\nAnd the other things that we should be looking for to to buy a used car what are you what are you going to do when you're looking I Know you've you've you've bought funny for me ridge well [noise]\nFirst by so I'll go to the some of the dealers that I Know that I have confidence in and some of them will work a lot closer than others some of them are greedy and want big profit summer happy make few hundred dollars and flip the car your independence most of their cars are all bought they go to the auctions guy and here's where the big flag comes in\nWhatever you do folks when you buy a used car and I don't care where you get it from look under the car you don't have to be a mechanic you don't have to be an expert but you need to take a look under the back of the car if you're somebody like Jim\nGet somebody to help you crawl under it but you need to see if that cars got rushed because a lot of dealers go up north because the cars are a lot cheaper up their Chicago Detroit I'm coming out of New Jersey New York\nAnd it's not the same color you are not comparing apples to apples at all they're not worth anything near what a southern car with no rest under I hate to use the term but it's like a cancer and you can't fix it another thing to watch out for its old booth with under coding or you can see down there is it's got that somebody is attempting to cover it up\nAnd run I don't care how cheap they offered to you you don't want a car like that well that's crucial [noise] ah what\nWell what I mean we only have a little bit more time rich but maybe just talk a little bit more about uh buying the used car and then on after the break we'll get into selling a used\nCar okay or\n\nYou want to try to do is check as many things as you possibly can um I like the fact if you find a one on her car\nOkay it's a reverse cycle when you're selling and I'll go get into that and the minute I Would prefer to go to somebody's house not to talk to them a while\nAnd and kind of get a feeling for especially if somebody older I've had the car six years blah blah blah but what do you do what do you do for a living and just you know get a little report going with them to where you feel comfortable if you don't need them in a public place\nBut I Want to know as much about that cars I possibly can a service records a car facts\nCar facts can be defeated and I'll tell you how if let's say you've had for accents last five years and you go take it to a body shop and pay for it it may very well not get reported\nWe're up against the break I'm Sorry to interrupt you we'll be right back Richard ... classic southern cars for sale dot

I don't I don't know how to explain that I mean I'd I don't I don't understand this when's the last time you talk conservative run into a Democrat out of the restaurant never ever in my life it would be everywhere see me written the Hillary or a or an Obama office somebody never it'll never ever have it doesn't happen because we're not out of our minds\nI mean it's it's it's\nIt's sad it is sad what is it sad or is it yeah it is I guess I kind of sad and pedophile oh\nYeah I some argue with some ... who kept saying\nYou keep all leaving this president had not all the BS he's feeding you I'm like wait a second what ... what do you even talk about because you know I mean the be all the BS\nI said I I I started to think of what you know if he's talking about a one of Trump's exaggerating\nShe was just something like that [noise] and then I I I came to the solution that you can't you you could tell\nPeople that Trump pulled the U.S all you want\nBut you'll never be able to convince somebody hard working Americans the extra money in his paycheck or his four oh one K. his BS or that the the uh the highest the record highest median household income is BS you can't take those things away by saying Trump's full of crap but he's a liar\nSide of the ... all real estate in the United states pre foreclosures are down six this was September the latest or the end of September down sixteen point five percent of the previous month six point two percent of the previous year\nA ... a\nForeclosures are down fifty percent of the previous month and thirty one ... for the one point nine percent of the previous year\nI mean I don't know if the guy I think pretty good news to me right\nIn total foreclosures are down one in a\nOne in every twenty four hundred or a or or are in foreclosure\nThere's an average uh and here's something that that may have something to do with it and I think I think that's what we'll Duane how most of the loans that are in for a home through foreclosure now we're\nWe're a mortgages that were uh originally there between foreign away those are the ones that are in trouble those are the ones that are being there in foreclosure now real Duane how I rather\nYou're exactly right channel um it has to do with that have program that how will affordable mortgage program right a lot of black folks were in laws\nYou know they were bad low subprime low and they were unable to refinance those low so people will only decided not to continue to pay in housing that they were upside down in that they had lost their ... right\nIn because the system is so broken so bad you had people living in holes or long periods of time without making mortgage payments at all this right um\nBut you know it had to deal with the bankruptcy court and that the way that the judges were instructed to handle bankruptcy and the banks that were in charge of those low all the way that they got incentives to be able to have your house go into foreclosure versus workloads out but to some extent the guy is right\nAnd that was the lower income neighborhoods people are still losing their host a foreclosure because of bad laws\nBut to me that's a separate reflection of the economy right now right\nBecause the there's a little bit or weren't originated under this in this economy they were originated under ... you know ... right after the the for between ... those are the majority of the loans that are being recalls right now\nYeah that affordable mortgage program that was instituted by Obama was just a bad deal and I don't want to read but Obama you know ... you know like I Want to make it his fault [noise] but um that was a difficult time you know and I said it'd be for like a couple of weeks ago those alone in a way that that\n... that we we structural of those ... was just a bad deal for right a black folks low income folks it was already in a bad deal gone bad laws are high interest rate in sub prime bill so in in in to a certain extent he's right\nUm but that's a separate issue from\nWhat I Do yeah I don't see the guy is is wrong I I just want an odd that someone's trying to find a something bad in this economy going way out of their way\nHuh here's a full circle for you\nKnow Georgia was one of the last eight that during the war right now Georgia has probably more of a black owned businesses than any other state\nOh well

where\nA lot of these foreclosures probably happen and I don't understand why people can't get roommates help pay the rent check the mortgage\nOr you know I think has a lot to do with the way they

election special and it was a lot of fun and it's great to be able to do it right before the election we'll see what you know what what comes we'll we'll find out will find it shall be tests\nAnd what do you do when you have a turn my problem as an American Jew it's typical not feel threatened by the growing anti Semitism coming from the extreme liberal left of course a reference to Louis Farrakhan calling for the extermination of Jews and saying that that he's not an anti Semite he's anti termite\nWhich is weird because every time I tried to fumigate my house for termites\nWhat they do is they then proceed to build happy and mentioned in human history create the basic morality of the west and create the only successful stay in the middle east every time I tried to get the term I that's what happens\nIs ... it's an astonishing thing he hasn't been banned from Twitter of course because he's Louis Farrakhan and Democrats loving according shall be my materials that are of course in ... brand was supposed to represent one of the most Jewish areas in the world is being cheered on stage by openly ask ... like when it's our store where do you see this ending answer is nowhere to go ahead because\nI mean let's look at history and ever and all that well for the ... the different at this time number one America I Do believe they different country I Do believe that in America steeped in Judeo Christian values\nThat believes in the the biblical truth\nOf the of the Jewish mission and the Christian mission is very friendly to Jews in historically been so and there is a state of Israel and the state of Israel does have the capacity to defend itself and that changes the very nature of the history which we live\nCharles says you're ... a large city seemed to always voted Democrat and more rural areas Republican answer is because in rural areas you tend to be a lot more self reliant and there's a lot less conflict at the people who live around if you have a big ... part of the space and you have big piece of land\nYour neighbor even bother you that much so you don't feel the necessity to regulate your neighbor all that much because there are no extra nowadays to what your neighbors dealing when you live in a city extra allergies are everywhere and when you live in a city the guy next door is playing his music to out\nIt bothers you and that means that you need a regulation about how much noise is allowed and a particular residential building if the guy next door to decide to keep a messy apartment\nAnd the smells emanating from our problem need regulations if the streets are not clean and we all share the same street woman that requires regulation to an all this requires tax dollars\nSpillover effect and highly populated areas more significant this is the reason why cities tend to be more highly regulated and more top down for that now does that mean that's how they should be run economically speaking no because I mean that's how they should be run in terms of regulatory policy no but that's the reason why you get a lot of people together in a very small area it does generally\nDrive people toward the idea that we have to\nHeavily locked down how we live in a way they wouldn't have you were out in the middle of nowhere where you're not bothering anybody and nobody is bothering you read that have been much like you I was viciously believe middle school and high school I feel like a stronger person for it but I also avoid thinking about the times have you been able to forgive the bullies from your youth if yes how so well\nI think forgiveness requires in Judaism forgiveness requires somebody to ask for forgiveness on I think one of the guys who did this ask for forgiveness at one point I even it wasn't actually one of the guy just one of the guys who was there and didn't do anything yet for forgiveness that I had no problem getting if somebody came to ask for forgiveness now\nI think I Would do it just because we're all kids were young and people act like idiots when they're young that terribly when they go\nFrom but I don't think you have to forgive to move beyond\nIt as long as you're not spending your your entire life focusing on how you were wrong and letting it get your brain then you can just move on with your life and sure when I see those guys is there a pang of like God that guy was just the worst\nAbsolutely but is that something that I spend an awful lot of time thinking about no and I think that made me stronger yeah I Do I think that when you go to reverse and he and you come out the other side determined to succeed I think that does make you stronger\nJohn has morning given that Democrats have moved there are still moving further and further to less than twenty twenty what do you think will be the most significant almost ridiculous change the official democratic ... party platform from twenty sixteen\nI Would not be surprised if the Democratic party embrace the idea of gender neutrality meaning that it would be that they are in favor of anti discrimination laws that prevent\nAny sort of difference in outcome between men and women are and even reflect the idea that

a snack\nThis past weekend I was at the Halloween I was talking to some of our listeners and the whole family in a little girl or the mother said that all ... they're all walking around and trick or treating at each of the hot air balloons\nAnd they're giving out snacks so asked a little daughter she's about five six maybe I said oh what's your favorite snack and she said and before she can answer the mom said scandals and I and before I can get it out of my little girl looked up and look at my mom said scandals artist isn't a snack so I Want to ask today\nIs candy or snack\nThat's where I Want to know as can be a snack so arid region to search sound aid for for for for one of six seven you just search sound from this past weekend so the there's a great game eagles Panthers close game Panthers one scored seven out Twenty one on the answer points is in the fourth quarter\nI mean a camera and I know a lot of people around here in Atlanta or area because if falcon fans hate Cam Newton but I can tell your hands down can't move look just like Superman yesterday really did\nBut\nEver greed plays for the Pampers play safety Malcolm Janet jak Jenkins play safety for the eagles they both said these Reid played with colon cabinet\nOf the forty nine or when they were both with the forty niners air agreed stands with cabinet Malcolm Jenkins stands what's happening this is an internal fight between Kevin ... supporters they both Neal they both protest\nThey both are trying to showcase or highlight police brutality which I think\nThe wrong time to do it is or national anthem of the football game let's be honest baseball they call our national pastime football is really our national path pastime and tied into football is standing up and sing along or put your hand over your your right hand over your chest\nAnd singing along humming along but paying homage to the national anthem and is where we do we were raised doing and we saw it done all the time you go to an event you got an important dinner they\nDo it there it is what it is however these two guys were includes meeting they were they agreed with each other\nWell you know the NFL met with the players the players coalition they called themselves and so Reed evergreen called Malcolm Jennings Emile colonialists and sleeping with the enemy now the enemy in this case is the NFL that employs Eric read\nNow we've had our issues with management around here all four shows I've never heard anybody call management that the enemy\nI mean there's been disagreements there's been harsh rhetoric but no one's ever said they were the enemy\nThis guy actually called ... employers the people that pay millions of dollars he sued them for collusion he's just back and league that is why Malcolm Jennings quote was I'm Glad he's back in the league because he got caught he wasn't in the lead for like two years or maybe a year and a half\nAnd he had to sue the owners for collusion for not letting me and he tied into the national anthem protests anyway\nThe NFL agreed to give a hundred million dollars to a\nNon profits or issues that the players of foundations nonprofits but they worked with important to the players any issues in the African American community that report to the players the NFL it agreed to give a hundred million dollars to a hundred million dollars\n... good deal let's cut this deal however the NFL nothing was written down but it was kind of a verbal agreement that you'll stop kneeling and taking a knee so then it fell so a hundred million dollars that's kind of a a a a a a payoff\nMight give these guys a hundred billion dollars for their foundations and everyone wants to weigh heavy will evergreens position was much like the Malcolm X is there any protest movement you have people who are approached to be paid to go away essentially it said come on gay\nIt happens all the time Jesse Jackson would protest Budweiser and Budweiser would open up a black owned brewery in Philadelphia\nAnd the protests just ended Toyota Jesse Jackson would protest Toyota you're not doing a business with black owned businesses okay Toyota open or does someone somebody who knows Jesse Jackson Jesse Jackson himself opens up a parts distributor\nAnd now the guys in business this one\nThe whole point of these protests is not to open up one they're there to let people do that you need to do business with a lot of large range of people\nSo angry took the position that we're not going to take a hundred million dollars give it to our favorite causes and stop nearly because we believe in it and so that's why he and Malcolm Jenkins had an issue at half time I mean at the start of the game on Sunday and the game from London\nCalling cabinet ... posted a tweet saying I'm with Neal\n\nMeaning he's with I I mean I'm I'm with Eric\nAnd that's letting him letting everyone know that he certainly agrees and the other reason that a air agree didn't doesn't like Malcolm Jennings anymore is because Malcolm Jennings did not invite calling cabinet to the meeting\nAnd that was a big deal amongst people that was following that we're following this story they all felt the same way why didn't cabinet at this meeting he's a football player he started the whole thing\nAnd a lot of people felt like he should have been there but that is the fight between ... and Malcolm Jenkins I completely understand ... position\nYou can't just you don't have a revolution if you're able to be paid off and walk away from your own revolution which\nKind of is what kind of the cabinet did when he signed up with Nike sports with Brad I mean a brat [laughter] with rats or ... I Know a fence that is offensive I Apologize [laughter] it's funny though [laughter] [laughter] United I Apologize goggles fired and it's like Paul and me Eric [laughter]\nBreads a bad name for people

yes okay well the donation pitch\nSo I Want to play for my listeners right now so why we have you on the show is an ad ran a on urban radio in Arkansas\nFor a French Hill whose representative our congressional he's eight incumbent on and these ads run that when we say ... when we say urban radio this country radio this Hispanic radio all this talk radio um\nThere's rock radio when we say urban radio that means there's both black people I don't know why don't just say black radio but they it's urban radio I don't know what that means I never understood that word urban um but it's it is what it is so this ad ran on black radio stations in it and often so am I right to explain everything this way\nYeah\nSo this that was designed to get support for French Hill who was an election official a ... a congressional representative in Congress already and he's a Republican All right let's play the at\nWhat do you think about what's happening in Washington\nCongress may bring change and the Republican no that is dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black mean Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend said it didn't happen\nWhen white girl lives on them girl white Democrats will be electing black folk again turnout always told my son don't be messing around with that if you get caught she will crime rate\nI'm voting to keep Congress my ... and the Republican because we have to protect me envoys we can't afford to name white Democrat take us back to the bad old days of rain the verdict like set does is Adam ... white girl screens right paid for by black Americans for the president's agenda\n[laughter]\nMurdered first of all can I say to see this is a genius marketing it I I Know friendship what can you tell us before we go any further told us what French Hill said about that\n[noise] he was horrified I\nWas horrified he denounced the uh [noise] and and they had the uh well I don't know if he had and put the Republican Party filed a bogus false ... ethics charges against sort of what the Alabama ethics commission and I called the director\nAnd he said we regulate the federal\nSuperPACs making a expenditures in federal racial that's ridiculous right that's not there and it's not their job and so that what the uh especially the Arkansas Republican Party did\nWas once again they attacked a conservative a step in and they had on their desk when the Democrats are burning a cars breaking\nWindows attacking a Republican candidates and in a staffers beaten up little ladies and old man at the Trump rallies\nOr exit or they're not dealing with that they're attacking a conservative and a and doing a very poor attack I might add because young man who signed that a complaint did so\nA on a penalty or perjury or there or at least to\nA full of lives and the complaint and he's going to have to be held to account if he doesn't [noise] yuck I called him and said a veteran to veteran I'm giving you an opportunity to withdraw this can paint apologize right but if he doesn't do that I'll be talking to the magistrate and the the district attorney to file perjury charges against young man which would be unfortunate\nSo okay um so what have you heard back from memory going to pull it\n\nI'm a I have not heard from the Arkansas are important\nRight okay so that's so let me let me explain what's happening here what's happening here is that for decades and decades and decades white Republicans I've been called racist\nThey've been called demons they've been called everything but pedophiles essentially right we know that we're conservative were black we heard it all before we've heard it a tax on ourselves well we've also heard it a tax on the Republican Party and conservatives white\nIn general so we've heard of these attacks but they're uncomfortable now they're very uncomfortable using the same tactics the Democrats have used against them for the last ... years\nAnd this is why this why so many of us support Trump because he's not afraid to go there with anybody and you went there with this ad I Want to play it again for our listeners and then I'm going to go to a break and then we'll be back and we'll break down the sixty seconds which I think is so powerful on so many levels I just\nAbsolutely have to explain it all to you next on the show he went to a show on the next on a new talk one oh six seven\nDo you think about what's happening in Washington\nCongress may French and the Republican notice dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black men that Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no operation and witnesses including her best spring say it didn't happen\nFathers are when white girl lives on them now why Democrats will be electing black folk again turnout always told my son don't be messing around with that\nShe will crime rate I voted to keep Congress my chair and the Republican because we have to protect me and boy we\nCan't afford to the white Democrat take us back to the bad old days of rain the verdict life said just this last year when a white girl springs right paid for by black Americans for the president's agenda\n\nDuring nine\nWith the Atlanta that we don't

the Republican\nBecause we have to protect me envoys we can't afford to name white Democrats can't go back to the bad old days of rain but he said to live in a white girl screens right paid for by black Americans for the president's agenda ... winter\nHere we are we're on the phone with burning Robinson one of the co founders of black America's like Americans for the president's agenda um so we're obviously talking about capital I think is a genius at I've said that I Want to talk about the criticism you're getting because we don't list oh go ahead waiver\nWe we have to the last caller said that the Dixiecrats for burning crossers added a using the Klan as a political\nParamilitary armed suppressed by people would be supporting Republicans today that ... that is absolutely outraged outrageous Republican or Republican this\nToday and in the critical times in the fifties or sixties uh made it possible for a black children to a\nIntegrate Little Rock because President Eisenhower set or the army down there to enforce the court ordered desegregation\nAbsolutely but I don't want to go down that route I don't want to go down the rabbit hole we talking about\nAnd it just you know since the caller raised the issue a Republican this past all the civil rights legislation over the objections of the Dixiecrats if you had the vote today Republicans would support legislation again except\nThey wouldn't be voting for the voting rights Act Section is on having elections in foreign languages right that it's disastrous\nWhat what what about you know so I mean for for you know asked isn't giggles I can also make the argument that many Republican voters of today would have voted against the civil rights act back then I'm not talking about politicians I'm Talking about voters just normally voters I can make that argument so I don't want to go down a rabbit hole but I Do I Do want to discuss I Do want to discuss that\nYou are being attacked by the media for this ad and what they're saying is they're not saying anything about the content they're talking solely\nAbout the fact that you all are being funded by rich white Republicans can you talk to me about that [noise]\nUm I'm are being funded by\nA well first of all I don't know the race of the fifty five hundred ... ... you know it's not like a voter file where you can look up a white black green red purple or brown I Do know that\nUh the voters voted I mean the voters or the the citizens who sent checks did so because they wanted I'm the president's agenda\nPromoted among black voters right that agenda is that we need to stop killing black babies with a Planned Parenthood which was\nDesigned to exterminate black people before divide by Margaret Sanger the founder\nRight up the point is the point I'm trying to make is that they're targeting you for your funding right which I Know you don't notice the color of the people's races of people scan or whatever and then you know that's all neither here nor there because if someone donate saying well it's ... no I understand that\nWell what I find interesting is the fact that they're targeting you for who's funding you but they never said anything about the funding for\nLiberal black groups like end up ...\nIn in in a ... and and other Urban League are funded by\nWhite people ... and and in fact almost every black organization sponsored by wealthy ... but but you know I have a huge number of of donations under a two hundred dollars and those are definitely not wealthy individuals right again the the reason\nA couple of hundred year\nFor a lot of
