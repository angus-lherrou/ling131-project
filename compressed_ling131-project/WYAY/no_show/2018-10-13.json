P. Morgan announced earnings on friday beat earnings expectations Citigroup beat earnings Wells Fargo came in a little bit below expectations but over all these are positive signs\nFor the financial the bank and even really the economic uh sector as a whole\nSo where are the concern so you know the IMF came out this week and actually the international Monetary Fund the cut its global growth forecasts and why they cut global growth forecasts that they sided really to trade tensions between the U.S and the rest of the world\nSo sort of if there's one area of concern right now it's it's the geo political issues especially when it focuses on trade so two major trade trade agreements are kind of hanging in the balance NAFTA where we just got a new try lateral agreement\nThat awaits legislative approval and the European Union while it's still negotiating the extra terms of breakfast\nSo NAFTA and Brexit or to trade agreements that we're still waiting to see exactly what happens us tariffs on China and more broadly specifically on auto an auto parts imports\nThat what may disrupt the already established supply chains that we have to the impacts of trade policy\nAnd the uncertainty that brings that is what we're seeing as a eight unsettled issue in many nations across the globe\nSo the growth that we're seeing here in the U.S I guess what we're really alone in that the rest of the world is not experiencing what the us is experiencing right now when we look at our windows in in our forecast everything looks great but the worst of the world is is not experiencing\nSo the issue becomes will there be spillover can the U.S carry the economic might and burden for the rest of the world or when we start to see spillover\nWhereas the rest of these world economies if they spin into recession will that affect us here at home and I think the volatility this week was a great reminder that the market doesn't just go straight up I Wish it did\nBut unfortunately there's periods of volatility in the market it was a great reminder this week\nThat when you saw how in the craziness and the market and how that made you feel just imagine how much worse it will be if we actually have

C. H. O. L. A. as well W. E. A. L. T. H. dot com that was a clip of me on Fox News or here recently and you know the host asked you know what is what is the probability of recession\nAnd the report that she read it said look probability recession is at Eighteen percent close to old high blows in the hopes that I was on what she said she was an analyst from affirmed she said well even if we have a recession you know it's only going to be a twenty to twenty five percent laws well\nAnd I ... I said look that may be one thing if you're an analyst but if you're a retiree losing twenty to twenty five percent of of your money hurts\nAnd so this is why so we just got to be proactive we got to make sure that our portfolios aligned in such a way that we will not take a major loss if the market goes down so one of the things that I think\nAre from does really well\nIs we monitor as best as we can one we think the next recession will happen\nSo there's something that we look at which is the business cycle so the business cycle you know the free market I'm the one of the biggest proponents of the free market but the free market doesn't always continually go straight up like a rocket ship okay there's periods of gross in a free market those periods of contraction which leads to a recession\nSo\nIn my opinion if you're approaching retirement you should have an investment strategy that is designed to help protect your portfolio from the next recession so our business cycle index\nThat we use is a tool that can help gauge what is our current recession risk\nAnd so what other things that we look at is is obviously no one can exactly predict the arrival due to the next recession but using economic data that's available to us and look at this isn't rocket science I I'm not sure why more advisors don't use this for their clients but using freely available economic data\nWe can derive a reliable signal that helps warn of an oncoming recession so we use our business cycle index tell signal when we may\nYou seen the beginning of a recession then I'll ... I'll tell you it's great\nWhen we look back over history we can see forty six years of history that includes the seven last recessions our recession indicators managed to signal all seven recessions\nAnd how many weeks we're leading into the recession [noise]\nSo if you look at the recession during Nineteen Seventy our recession indicator gave us a self signal Thirteen weeks before that Nineteen Seventy not obviously this is back data that we're back casting using the economic data that we're using today\nBut the economic data that we're using today back in Nineteen seventies when we had a recession we're to signal that was Thirteen weeks before saying that a recession was pending if you look at the recession or Nineteen Seventy four to Nineteen Seventy five we had a ... well we signal before the recession\nIf you look at the recession of Nineteen eighty we'd another twelve Rick signal the recession of eighty three to five weeks signal here is the big one two thousand recession two thousand one recession another twelve week\nSignal here's the big one two thousand and seven\nTwo dozen eight when the U.S and the drug fifty percent\nOkay we had a nine week lead time going to the recession our data would have had a nine week leak time going to the recession\nSo this is where we said look in my opinion\nIf you're approaching retirement or inner tire your advisor\nShould be watching when the next recession\nAnd how close we are to that next recession because that's really all that matters as long as we're staying at a recession there's going to be normal volatility in the market\nBut it's the recessions that causes the most damage and investment portfolios\nSo I look back at you know I I look at these numbers so so where are we at right now when it when I look at these numbers are business cycle index is telling us right now that the economy is performing\nAt the best that we've seen in a very long time\nSo our risk for recession right now is a very low\nSo we're not at risk of a pending recession so that's a that's good news for your portfolio so maybe\nYou're one of those people as a David I'm sitting with my money on the sidelines 'cause you know I'm worried about what's going on I don't want to invest right now well I'll tell you based on our numbers\nThere's really no current risk for such and not obviously that can change but we're really not seeing a risk of recession at All right now right now the economy is firing on all cylinders what are some of the dead you know I'm having a shared\nSome of the data that we use we look at the tenure yields compared to three months fields were looking at the daily charged the U.S and the five\nThe goal of the hedge equity portfolio is to get about Seventy to eighty percent of the upside of the market but help protect our downside when the markets go down so I'll give an example [noise]\nOn on average or going to set our heads up about ... percent out of the money\nWould that means is we're going to start the protection is going to kick him\nAround the market being down around ten percent\nSo if the market jobs four percent are we trying to protect against that no\nThe market jobs five percent are we trying to protect against that no market jobs six percent and we're trying to protect against that know where we are trying to protect against is a drop of more than about ten percent and the one year\nAnd why is that because we can recover from a ten percent drop that recovery time could be less than a year\nBut when you take a forty percent drop fifty percent drop sixty percent drop God Forbid\nThat can take years to recover six seven eight years to recover from a major type of recession type law so this is why right now to me it's important\nThat we had Hedges inside the portfolio\nHedges are there to help protect tacked portfolios from major market decline\nWell David you know I Want to make sure I don't lose any money well that is tough to do in the stock market if you're gonna be in the stock market you're going to have to accept some loss but as we get closer to retirement or in retirement\nThe losses that significantly hurt the portfolio or when we get the major twenty twenty five thirty forty percent losses to the portfolio and guess what\nI was looking at our charge here for average recessions ready for this the average recession lasted about a year and a half if we look from Nineteen twenty seven I'm Sorry Nineteen twenty six to two thousand Seventeen the average bear market recession asked lasted about one and a half years\nWith an average cumulative loss ready for this of forty one percent I Want to put that into context okay\nLet's just say you the million dollar portfolio the average loss during a bear market has been around forty one percent\nSo a million dollars on average will lose four hundred thousand dollars based on the last barrel mark it drops four hundred thousand dollars\nCan you imagine if you've built up your time or ... you get to a million dollars you hit the magic number that you've been waiting for\nAnd then God Forbid we get into a recession you're first four or five years of retirement and you lose four hundred thousand dollars\nWhat do you do\nLet's just say you've got up to two million dollars in your portfolio we had a couple in our office early this week they had been saving they ... they hit the two million dollar mark and their portfolio there were so happy there so far the accidents\nQuestion if we have another recession and the next five years\n\nOr are you comfortable taking a forty percent drop on your investments an eight hundred thousand dollar drop\nThey looked at me to do ...\nAnd this is why I don't want to some morbid here but you just you have to prepare your portfolios your retirement proposed for the worst case scenario why is that because in retirement there are no do over\nThere or not\nThis is why it's important to have a plan in place and what a proper financial plan does is going to show you wear your income is coming from\nHow much risk is in your portfolio what are the things that you need to do now to make sure that you can retire with out having this fear\nThat if the market takes a big drop\nYou can lose a lot of principle [noise]\nSo I Want to give up the offer for morning star analysis where more than ... ... it's an in depth break down your portfolio it shows you where the weaknesses are it shows you God Forbid we have another year like oh wait where the market dropped almost forty percent\nHow your current portfolio were perform it's a thousand dollar value\nBut we'll wave that thousand dollars for the cause of the more than two hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio you

you heard the new Democratic Party that is what Eric Holder that's what Eric Holder told you\nHe's one of the Democratic mouth mouth pieces out there and he was air support and Stacey Abrams all I got to say\n[noise] Roger go ahead buddy what's up hey my real quick I had a question about the other day or your parents do not leave if they're asked to leave an area that's going to get blood or whatever and they don't you're not leave with\nTheir children is there some way that they can be charged with a crime for endangering the life a lot of a minor\nYou know I I [noise] I I think by law they could but unless there's a mandatory evacuation most likely not you know now it's mandatory you\nKnow they always say look or the first responders and say look we might that might not be able to get to the go ahead and put your Social Security number with a sharp you on your arm so we can identify your body if we find you know now if their children were harmed his children were uh I'm injured in some way\nMaybe maybe they could but uh I've not heard of any cases where parents have been charged with ah with neglect or any ... any other you know criminal charges for not evacuating I I haven't heard of it it may have happened\nIf someone's hurt is that please let me know but I've never heard of that the Roger ...\nOkay I just wondered but anyway I was calling because Joe kept asking you what have you done water you\nDo or what have you done and it's Joe what have you done\nWhere I'd like to call back tomorrow can't call back they're not going to tell me what you they're not always for America or to be doing surveys for black people in America do it in your liquor or in a way to\nSay it really if you're a crisis you need to get over to Africa and find those people that actually sold you into slavery\nAnd and I also would be willing to pay reparations for the cost is that you have to get an airline ticket were fair and you've got your United States will pay you or do you go river in another country\nBut Roger I didn't I've never owned any slaves or I don't think Roger has ever been in slaves I don't think uh you know there's many people in the United states right now that have been slaves you know and go look yeah it was it was terrible slavery was horrible\nAnd you know and we had the civil war and but to to now be talking about reparations I mean come on really\nThey're the people are going to do a demand reparations I mean it's been for ... to even say anything because the definition\nHe was a liberal [noise] okay but what party was what he was a Republican is right and who free Disney might Nineteen\nNineteen sixty two when JFK\nCame out in favor of the civil rights act that's when all the Democrats the southern conservative Democrats the Dixiecrats they all left the Republican they all left the Democratic party and they became a Republican and that's why the Republicans over to the party then Iran conservative and the arts\nAnd he launched a similar how much how much reparations should we be paying a former slaves or descendents\nWell I Would just say thank God that people in North getting down to the crap out of the southerners and meet their ... and got rid of slavery I don't think we should be paying reparations but said\nWell what about the northern ... what about the northerners it also had slaves like general ... this is the northern the northern nor they had slaves after this up that after the civil war they still had slaves\nThey pass the thirteenth amendment or after the civil war and outlawing slavery across all of America\nI Know but they still had slaves in the north so it's not like the ... you know the north where the squeaky clean\nBang man I'm going to say they were squeaky clean up a lot of it was they didn't want they they didn't want a slave taking jobs away but nonetheless they were fighting to get rid of slavery and the south was fighting to keep the slavery and you can tell\nSomebody's people some of your callers they are too far removed from a\nYou know that that lady Debbie said the blacks should be thankful they were slaves but\nHey Doug marine who who talks like that\nWhat she was trying to say was that from the life that they probably had across the other side of the world and coming here the day\nThat maybe maybe that's some people's opinion is that ah they were\nHad a better life here than they did back there when they were sold by their own people that's what she was trying to say you know some people think that some people do\n\nI body thanks very appreciate you let me go to Jeremy\nHey buddy uh watch the more if the Democrats or Republicans switched over JFK and why the hell oh no the governor governor Wallace from the state of Alabama run for president as a Democrat in the eighties\nYup you moron [laughter] he was a\nDemocrat they tried to stop black from getting into my alma mater at Alabama so sucking the more you're an idiot bank some\nOf them that don't that none of them for them that are saying\nWell you know kill or am I yeah that's what what what did you go to the guy that is right there you go during the idiot man I Know\nWhat you might see just drop them face drop this thing\nIs that that northern\nA terrible terrible is there a bomb\nThat growing up by the way up\nHey man pretty good I just wanted a light nothing about the the thing about slavery air for a little while to say oh you just want to pick on your badge or you're George orange commercial you know I Love them shoot a lot of their MO but I'm

out have you ever been out there have been out George arms\nI hadn't been to that but I go to the gun shows all the time and I see them there but forty five ACP is still a different round and forty five long cold\nYet but that's that well\n... just pick it are you already appreciate your eye and be safe I I I\nI just read what they put it on the paper if you go that's that's what they want to badger that grew nobody wants to take\nClasses have passed hey guys yeah\nWhich one is your brother on um on first and last\nAh Benjamin\n'cause he's the one that or did he call you on the phone and they have it on the the one child support\nSee I have is yeah yeah I've seen it yet I don't have cable\nI told Brooks is it's on Netflix I told Brooks yeah like I figured out which one is Patrick brother because he caught him on the phone and I know that voice [laughter] and you know the voice\n[laughter] yeah I mean now he was in a really bad place you know a lot better now so you know\nDon't don't hold it against the I Know he was he was he was in rough shape but at the time I don't want that reflects\nNecessarily on me or or or no no no no not at all brother not at all [laughter] so yeah my good that's\nGood news man is he he's he's actually uh doing really well right now so that's that's what a happy ending on that yet so you had to call yesterday uh it said something about Democrat made some sort\nOf a a thing\nAbout the Democrats in the Muslims Democrats are starting to behave like Muslims or want people to do anyway yeah whatever\nSomething along the lines um but actually trying to make sense to me I was thinking about our science because it's this level of fanaticism that that the Democrats are starting to take on and you know you can't you can't argue with a fanatic\nNo no ... and these have you know when it comes down to ah fanatics or some people call and true believers um you know but you look at the you'd look at the actions I'm ... I'm going to talk more about Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton\nI mean Hillary Clinton she's getting a lot of backlash now are saying that uh that we could do the Democrats can't be civil any more towards the Republicans\nYeah and that was the association and it was ... yeah the he was making her or something along those lines but the the you know and then you start getting getting you know inciting violence\nAnd the only problem the real problem on your hands yeah\nI agree with Patrick and then that's what that's what the Eric Holder's doing\nWhen you're down you can't go that's the new Democratic Party that's the new Democrats man oh man so\nI it's just uh I I just don't want to think\nThey that is what you look at look at when President Trump or the dog or all day\nOn January ... what did you have you had riots in DC by by what group antifa that's right the anti fascist groups and and they were fighting with D.C police they were breaking windows\nAnd you had a mountain Portland just the other day as well take a listen to this crap [noise]\nYeah that's that's it cheaper out in Portland as police though to buy\nBecause their liberal mayor said that well they had their First Amendment right to demonstrate as well\nWhen did the D.C mirror that said that she said um when when they were writing there she said no we got to give them their space to to\nDo this and no no that was a Baltimore Baltimore and then a couple of days later said no I never said that that was Baltimore after the after the Freddie gray yeah that's what he has no is the demand D.C Met would
