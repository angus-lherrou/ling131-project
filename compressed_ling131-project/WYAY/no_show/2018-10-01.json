I don't know whether to leave for it but I require corroborating evidence because I don't know whether to believe forward it turns out that testimony regarding memories regardless of whether you believe they are true do not necessarily match up the reality that it's not just me that a science science\nOne report from the U.S national Research Council explain that I witnessed his are notoriously unreliable unknown the individual memories I've forgotten reconstructed updated and distorted\nFalse memories are quote constructed by combining actual memories of the content of suggestions received by others research does not back the idea that if you experience the trauma your memory is better there was no research to suggest any of that\nSo yeah but at the door and this will be all they're all going Leon I'm sure it'll take like one question if we can right before the end of the show so that's why the new ...
