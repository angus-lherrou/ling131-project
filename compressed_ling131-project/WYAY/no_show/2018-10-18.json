stuff on a lot of subject but not on this particular subject or the ... and in this in this particular camp I count\nA bunch of folks who have made big names for themselves\nBased on the idea that America's economy is bound to fail that that there's too much income inequality is from the right people supposedly from the right\nI mean there's too much income inequality the manufacturing jobs are dying that small towns are dying and therefore the government has to step in and regulate we need terrorists need regulations we need redistribution we need heavier unionization\nAnd this comes from a value system that doesn't actually see the morality and the free markets per se\nNow listen there's nothing that is necessarily moral and how people use free markets but the basis of a free market system private property ownership in control of your own labor that is a deep moral good there is something moral about free markets that is not moral about restricted market\nThat can only hold true when there is no exploitation that can only hold true when the government prevents forced use of labor for example\nBut when the government steps in and start trumping on free market principles on individual property rights and individual use of labor\nThen you get into trouble and the problem is that there is a widespread perception among a lot of people in the populist right than America's economy even when it's going great guns is still unfair this is where the Trump being right meets the Bernie Sanders left\nTucker Carlson has a new book out called ship a fool's are going to have Tucker on Sunday special sometime in the near future and soccer is sort of an economic economic populist very talented guy obviously and Tucker's economic populism borders on sort of a Bernie Sanders perspective\nHow the economy ought to work he talks a lot in his book about the sort of suffering middle class that was left behind and one of the things he says in the book is that I was reading it last night and it's really well written it's again Tucker's deeply channels and got\nOne of the things that it does it just says that well the rich have gotten richer in the United states the poor have gotten poor now he acknowledges that the poor getting poorer in the United states is not actually a thing that's happening at the poor and the United states are still extraordinarily rich by any sort of global standard they are richer than they were in Nineteen Seventy nine by any standard they have better stuff\nBut that's not enough because he says that they're still envy between the rich and the poor and as long as that exists the government has to step in to help prevent that envy from overtaking the political system\nThat's a perspective that probably Bernie Sanders supporters hole and you know some of this during the election cycle when President Trump was trying to appeal to Bernie Sanders supporters with the same sort of language\nThe free markets were flawed that globalization was a bad thing this is the stands and by the way for free market the dirty word that people use instead of free market these days is globalization now they're significant\nProblems with globalization on the local level in certain areas so for example you're getting out competed by business in China and your business goes out of business that hurts for you for globalization is just another word for free markets because if you were getting out competed by a farm and California and you're in Ohio\nThat wouldn't be globalization that would just be the free market at work their moral questions as to whether we should be doing free market stuff with dictatorships like China\nBut there was no economic question than it is beneficial economically to consumers in the United states and you producers use influence in the United states to have free trade\nAnd yet by suggesting that capitalism in free markets are not enough suggesting globalization is a bad thing well we needed economic nationalism more government intervention\nPresident Trump is actually under cutting the cause of his own economy which is not based on anti globalization it's actually they deeply on a global free market and on less regulation President Trump's economic system is based on less government intervention in the economy the President Trump has been preaching more economic intervention in the economy\nSuggesting that the economy is leaving people behind well that's a term that that is he talking point that can be used against him it's a talking point that can be used against him an election\nAnd it's also a talking point that it's not particularly conservative which I'm going to explain in just one second but first let's talk about whether you're sleeping at night there was nobody on the planet like usa why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nHe would sleep built asleep with it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers metro body type and sweet preferences for the perfect mattress with your side sleep or a hot sleeper whether you like a pleasure from but he like there's no more guessing and there's no more confusion just got a huge leap dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes ... they will match you to a map for that will give you the best leap of your life\nFor couples you can even split that mattress down the middle providing individual support Nathan Deal preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders\nTo a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro this is a luxury mattress any non luxury price that she would sleep dot com slash up here over a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or my wife and I love our he looks like a mattress we took that two minutes sleep was we got her mattress in the mail we unwrap that\nPut it right on the bed because in place right in front of you it's really cool and it's really comfortable it's so good I got my sister one for her wedding go check it out he would sleep dot com slash a bureau for a hundred and twenty five bucks off okay so\nIt's not just took her I don't wanna pick on Tucker there there are a bunch of folks again why I really admire intellectually Tucker is one of\nAnother person who I admire intellectually is a guy named Oren Cass legend book out that I recommend it on the show called the once and future worker and in that book or and talked about this kind of new populist economic\nHe says is basically capitalism is designed to provide you the cheapest products and\nThe best products at the most available opportunity and there's no question that this is what capitalism is cheap this globalization and issued we live in times with us down any human being from even fifty years ago\nWe live in a time economically where legitimately you can have any product on planet earth delivered to you within days\nMade in ten different countries assemble in a factory overseas shipped directly to your house and you have to leave your house while he was push push a button and these things arrive at a very famous economic essay called I pencil o that help no one on planet earth actually knows how to make a pencil beginning to end\nWhy because there is a graphite factory and then there's what factory and then there's a paint factory there is a metal factory there is a rubber factory all of those places have to generate small pieces of the pencil and then it has all assembled and then it's brought to you for pennies that's the magic of capitalism that's the magic of globalization and free market that when people say globalization again\nBecause people think that globalization means that we're giving up control to people who are outside America\nThey don't understand the globalization really just means remark is we just had free markets folks would be on board the globalization is an easy way to do it it's kind of a ... left liberal term for free markets has been used just like trickle down economics and the left liberal term that has been used instead of supply side economics\nOrange cats in his book he talks about capitalism is great at generating all sorts of consumer good\nWhat he says is that we may be living in a time very soon where people can't find fulfillment in consumerism and then they find the woman in jobs now there's no question\nThat a guy making twenty thousand dollars a year and working is probably happier than a guy making twenty thousand dollars a year from welfare and not working but the real question is how much economic wherewithal do have to sacrifice how much free market you have to sacrifice to give that guy a job at twenty thousand dollars as opposed to just redistributing and this is really a fascinating and economic debate\nThat is breaking out I think it's premature but it's fascinating\nComing up we'll talk about the new debate on the right and left on where our economy should go from here a lot of concern about automation job loss about whether we changed the fundamentals of our economy I'm not quite so sure and I think it's kind of profit venture [laughter]\n\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's pretty hard not to worry about what

bench Shapiro show so President Trump yeah he's very close with the Saudi regime\nAnd there's a reason for that because right now the Saudis are one of our partners in naming off uranium threat in the middle east\nThe fact that the president and the United states has close with the ... though has created a problem for him because the Saudi crown prince is apparently responsible for the murder of a chatty dissidents there is a position they put them in\nThe ... time what's considered the new reformer in Saudi Arabia and indeed ... look as though he was a guy who's going to help lead the anti Iranian coalition that continues to be his alley all the talk about the Saudi regime modernizing\nAnd moving toward liberalism like classical liberalism\nAll that was overstated it is what it is an Islamic dictatorship and which people still have their hands chopped off with that is not exactly a modern country\nBut we're all very shocked and appalled as we should be when Saudi operatives decide they're willing to murder a dissident at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul so here's the wall Street Journal with the latest reporting\nSaudi operative meets drug killed and dismembered a dissident Saudi journalist in the presence of the kingdom top diplomat and assemble Turkish officials had Tuesday as Washington or ... provide answers President Trump cautioned that Saudi Arabia should be considered an innocent until proven guilty\nAnd secretary of state Mike Pompeo on a visit to the kingdom and Saudi leaders and strongly denied involvement or conducting a curious credible investigation but\nTurkey is now suggesting that they have tape of the entire thing happening at least audio tape the entire thing happening which can be very pleasant I mean that that sort of audio\nWould be it's almost hard to listen to his Lady Gaga recording an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday Mr from compared the allegations daddy agency and tell them to start to ... and the accusations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nThis is where President Trump gets himself in trouble this is not particularly smart now here there are several possible responses to the Saudi situation\nNumber one this is really that we should put some sanctions on Saudi Arabia at least temporarily until they provide some sort of answers on all that and until they punish the people responsible and until they reform their conduct\nThat possibility number one possibility number two as you say yes this is really bad also every country in that region is basically a garbage ... or is run like a garbage\nAnd then the countries themselves but the people are I'm sure wonderful in many countries by the administrations of turkey Iran\nIraq certainly Syria certainly certainly Lebanon Jordan like none of the universe rations are great western democracies and these are all garbage administration\nSo well he could say is yeah this is really bad also for geopolitical realist reasons like Henry Kissinger\nWe still need to work with the Saudis to contain the Iranians by this possibility number two and then there's possibility number three which is from telling the Associated Press quote here we go again with you know you're guilty until proven innocent we just went through that the justice cabinet and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned\nSomewhere justice Kavanaugh screams and silence add any as his compared to Saudi dictators murder people in conflict and then look what by their body\nThat is just it's like when Trump said during the Kavanaugh hearings that he'd been accused of things to a cabinet just must have been snacking himself on the forehead ... card style double faced palm it just it makes\nKnow the ... because the president sees things in black and white terms on average score\nHe says this sort of stuff but equating Brett Kavanaugh where there was no evidence other than the allegation alone against him with the Saudis murdering a human who has disappeared and where there is apparently audio evidence an audio recording shared with both the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nComparing that to Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh it can't be happy camper right now come that how on I mean really apparently on the recording a voice can be heard inviting the constants leaves the room the voice of a man Turkish ... identified as Saudi forensic specialist a lot of time beekeeper\nCan be heard recommending other people president listen to music while he does members Mr ... body according to the according to the tape shaggy was not interrogated instead he was beaten up drug and killed by Saudi operatives would flown in from Riyadh apparently he was dismembered while he was still alive show things that real well\nOver there all of us again is deeply deeply ugly of course that doesn't actually answered the question as to what President Trump should do however\nAnd this is where President Trump best claim is that he's basically just a real is trying to make deal as far as possible and well he appreciates the human rights violations or bad he's not going to stay up nights worrying about the Saudi Government\nCommitting human rights violations that we all know they've been committing for years on it I mean the same Saudi administration that has been quite friendly with radical Muslims for decades on and\nThe vast majority of the of the ... of the nine eleven hijackers were Saudi so devices to say the Saudi regime is not exactly a wonderful wonderful regime but\nDoesn't mean the United states doesn't have interests with regard to Saudi Arabia\nAs an example of President Trump saying this sort of thing repeatedly he was asked about Helsinki or do you remember he had that meaning and helping he was letting reporting where he was very complimentary up food and it was not his mind is our first Reagan who has a brand new show on Fox Business which is well worth watching sheep press

we're talking about Texas schools are question of the day is in Texas or the state legislature passed\nAn act called the community safety education that it was written by a Dallas city of Dallas Democrat Royce senator Royce West the kids have to before graduating watch a sixty minute video and the school systems are working on putting together a class\nWith kids would have to take in order to graduate and the class in the video is all on how do you ... how to properly interact with police during a police stop or traffic stop which would usually be a stop or some kind of police interaction\nAnd it also talks about the proper way it also video tells you about what the police should uh what people should expect out of the police have been carrying out the stop and I agree with it I think this is something that Brian Kemp should roll out right now here in Georgia I think it's a good idea\nNow there was a part of me because I'm a small government conservative there's a part of me that says I don't this is supposed to be taught at home\nJust like sex education I didn't like that either just like teaching pregnancy I didn't like that either but I understand this in this case just like the sex education\nThe parents aren't teaching this at home as a matter of fact you're up against several communities particularly in poor communities where the parents are teaching almost completely the opposite\nBasically saying you know have\nF the police you know and and don't listen to that we have a story it was twelve year old was telling the police get his hands off\nSo what do you guys think it's market Kristen\nGood market moaning gentleman thing for writing sat down with me again yes ma'am I kind of a than what they thought there at ...\nAnd our life and raise my children\nAre from my college roommate a phrase oh look at what point that\nGuilt there the police the police are there to protect and serve and I raise my children under that environment they are there that help you you do your mail it and that the response ... thoughts of all that is and and you will ...\nYou'll have no problem with the interaction respect them they respect you respect from what they've appropriately ah\nThat what I taught in my home and again I that's what police out there doesn't count [laughter]\nSo because of your son or shut up\nShut because not all\nRight I mean how do you want but I Know what\nI'd like to watch the show\nTo make it better to combination for myself I'm only going about what you're telling me right for whatever maybe that will not be appropriate place because\nI I'd like to it well a little bit smaller government things need to be we need to return to the family unit and whatnot that taught at home\nBut that that's part of driver education not ... not to wake up at five or ...\nBut not everybody takes driver's education a lot of people are just driver's education a requirement in high school I don't know no it's not so I think it's settled shouldn't just be something that's required um yes or no\nWhat it is a traffic stop is that what I'm hearing on your on your ...\nBut a police interaction with the the same traffic stop but ... ... that's more the traffic stop is the more innocent\nPolice interaction of course if you're running from the police\nAnd for committing a felony there is no real teaching them how to interact with trying to get away with a traffic stop is where you usually have because it's such a distrust\nSo yes you're right it should be taught in the home just like sex ed should be taught in the home however you have homes that are not doing that or maybe teach in the opposite so that's why I agree that maybe this is something that should be mandatory\nFight the airport so again but I have to look at the video\nTo the well I Would have felt fine\nThanks for your call market Christian get get to work safely and and no sitting outside listening for a couple of minutes longer and being lane okay\n[laughter] well I just thought that that lane closer to a fight with that though it's not clear failing from their thank you ... or ... or ... thank you\nDay you go mad dog I kind of offended when you said Brett thanks Kristin ...\nThat I think that I ...\nGod Bless you a hit that a hit that sound Christian this is kind of partially partially what the videos doing\nOver the last ... welcome to citizens law enforcement and election training program about whether the communities that the education that goal of the I was to fire behavior expectations of citizens as long as we're traveling interactions we know that there are some communities there's an\nIssue of trust\nLaw enforcement and the community is particularly legislation is designed to ensure\nThat we address the issues are dressing that issue training in the cat is a law enforcement academies sues in our driver's education programs or specifically schools are having to design a cause that if I went to ... your\nExpectations are as soon as the good students when they're scoop secondly we're making sure that every person digs a driver's licenses\nSees content that's designed to define the\nExpectations of the citizen when driving the vehicle and stuff by law has been in Europe particularly sitting there gathering or making sure that you understand what your responsibilities are in our expectations of of you when gauge than solving a citizen on a traffic stop\n[noise] so that's partially you know of course it's sixteen minute video but that's the\nThat's a senator Royce West the Dallas Democrat who authored the bill and got it passed K yeah\nHey hey good morning welcome to Shelley went to show in the new talk one of six seven\n[noise] [noise] yes um I think rather than have the school to take care of that why not have the department of drivers services\nHandle a video of the schools have too much mandate already\nThat's a good idea K I I don't I don't disagree with that um what do we but the department of motor vehicle\nAs I understand it is probably as a governmental agency at any level worse than the post office\n[noise] oh my goodness\n[laughter] you know what I mean in terms of just movement and and and being a fish into an affective I and I'm not you know it's nothing to do I probably got B.\nAnd B. listeners but it just you guys know you're you guys are not just the most fast moving in a fish and folks but just not a bad idea that well they do talk about it because they say we're going to get your driver's license it will be a part\nOf that training too so it it may be already a part of it\nI think it should be around it but yes\nThank you for your call Kay have a wonderful day my darling\nYou know simple solution would be you have to watch it on line than print off the certificate\nAnd bring that with you they do that in corporate America never works 'cause you're not watching it you just play it and wait to the you know they've got the technology now that it won't let you do that yeah yeah and and and I think was the ... when he had to watch these training videos right on ... we push play\nAnd go to the coffee room and sit down and Chile whenever

I'm sure your mom is sitting somewhere that Shelly he's so night do don't put it this way my dad was a senior in college where my mom was a freshman in high school that is that when they met\nThe right way to run right right right right but that's all that way they live in right Deborah thought ride they'll never thought that\nDuring that during the beef between ... the head at at LL Cool J they did not know each other okay that's a stabbed was rather [laughter] let's go to the falls bad let's go to for the love that kid man [laughter]\n[laughter] so before we go to falls right I Want to talk about these stories I just want to\nKnock 'em out not knock him out but you know what I mean tell people battle so\nThere's a lotta people I told them want to see a you\nRally get out and vote rally told you what the guy said right\nWell these kids were all excited right and a couple of people spoke a city councilman Andre Dickens spoken killer Mike spoiled and they all spoke but they can't tell me who to vote for but they dropped hints and stuff my speech was very powerful because he said there's a line in his speech where he said\nAnd even if the person looks like you asked them what you are going to get out of giving your boat\nWhich is very powerful statement I think it was lost a lot of those younger kids you know what I mean but it was very good if you're an adult you're listening to that the saying yeah you're right then because he based his message was tell the kids be selfish would you vote when these politicians were right or left come to you and say hey\nWell for me the first question you should ask is what do I get out of it and he made people repeat that what do I get out of it and that's a perfect Republicans do that all the time the problem is they keep many of them keep lying to us\nAnd we're getting fed up and the first sign of are fed up and this was voting for Donald Trump [laughter] that was the first indication that Republican conservative voters were fed up with the law is coming out of Republican candidates for office\nWant to go to traffic going to have an expressive transfer\nFrom the handling express loop traffic center eighty five pounds turning into quite the massive salt tractor trailer out on the top in front of the ... free ... boulevard yes that's affecting Ninety five to a lot of folks trying to get back across the top down and got thirty minute ride leaving three sixty\nFour hundred turning into your forty five minute ride so usual stuff they're leaving Alpharetta Seventy five still pretty clean and green at least that you get into the south part of marrying a runner in the south one twenty loop then you've got some third gear stuff that's going to finally get back inside the predator to west paces fairy I back door next door to door traffic\nSo does despite voter enthusiasm and they said this yesterday at the rally they are now your wall bumped up on social media but will you come out and vote and a lotta people say no we're not enthusiastic about voting\nI didn't know this Georgia was born in the states with the lowest percentage turnout across the country\nAnd I find it interesting that said more than three thousand counties in two thousand sixteen election they found those are the lowest rates of participation as measured by those eligible to vote will count concentrated in West Virginia Texas Georgia Tennessee Kentucky\nIn Arizona and the reason being is not because people don't know they're eligible to vote is that most people don't don't know they had to register to vote as I was telling the lady uh miss ... from the New Georgia project now is people just don't see them getting in getting anything out of it\nYou guys made promises on both sides that you can't keep your promise things you can't keep poor people tend to vote less than a college educated people you don't want people vote less than everybody else because their lives on changing now there's an argument to be made\nThat may be allies not changing because you're not doing anything to change it that's probably Ninety nine percent of it\nBut when a Republican say that the call people don't like that uncaring and races Democrats come along and tell poor people well I'm going to help you if you vote for me they vote for them and they're still poor so\nBecause they're not they don't they're not willing to tell the truth there are still on the plantation Rona plantation but I don't know it ... it was you know they they do know that's why I did not participate you think\nOkay they know what they don't apply patients they just filled plantation that doesn't work for me so I'm not going to participate I'm not going to participate by voting for my own enslavement\nMhm I'm just not going to vote so\nTechnically they're not on anybody's plantation it out on a Republican plantation been out on the Democratic plantation that just wandering the forest\nDoing for South but they just happen to be poor and under educated no high school graduates you know college education that's probably why you're poor or you probably had children early you're probably not married that's probably why you're poor but those people will not voting and out intending the boat\nAnd the Democrats are largely relying on that group of people take advantage of them once again\nTo turn out and vote\nYes more Honduran immigrants on their way let's go to our somebody wants to talk about that I guess they hung up let's go to ... let's go to a ... and ... and ... and welcome to show he went to showing the new talk one of six seven\nShelley Shelly pay and good morning It's MORNING assure enjoy your show every morning\nOh thank you and I appreciate you saying that\nI Would I just kind of want to hear your

that is a Georgia was on his watch and say let's just over two for one to five summers for three or four\nDollars on the dot com studios why why\nSaudi consequences predator pre either because that\nFor the first time President Trump is warning there could be consequences of a connection is found between Saudi Arabia and the presumed murder of journalists democracy ... who wrote for the Washington Post\nPresident Trump acknowledging that Jim ... is most likely did\nIt certainly looks that way to me is or is that after\nHearing from secretary of state that the Saudis need more time the president agrees however if the Saudis and perhaps the royal family are implicated in ... the president going farther than before and that there will have to be consequences\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing is protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\n\nNow all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from work before or many of you know me I I play tennis and college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation\nOne of my other best friend just from a nother nation they both came to this country is a student with a student\nVisa legally they didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country\nIn fact our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way I have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break in your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate for a civilized nation sets\nYou you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation\nIn Saudi Arabia again he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out there will be a very strong\nResponse from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust somebody actions not words when it comes to stuff and of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump\nIt's one of the most irritating things about all of this story\nWith with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\n\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's on hands and he's a terrible person a should calm down it should\nBe loving which one is it to the media which one is if you want to present the defenses country and fights this country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants campaigning to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing its thing he's on hands these crazy and his main and evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come and defend and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure did they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited driving Saudi Arabia's because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they are like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\n\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they will they will literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut our feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government may have been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights\nMy point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and it's taken a life of its own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him but his ... but the media who's acting like this is something we must\n... where I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know\nWhy we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do we also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we\nAlso have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they've all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush trades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees with Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald trumps the villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they said this is too strong it's there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective although I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your whole life\nMost journalists are self important I Can't use the word I Want to use a\nI Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they're better for example didn't even talk shows were commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hate it that it's happened I hate to this journalist was killed\nBut make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over this demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president it's America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant Caribbean are illegal immigrants heading nights it's America is what the president should do\nRegardless of party you don't welcome all breakers you don't you know I mean what what what is the media wants Donald Trump to do what does it and I know what the left one Sunday but I'm saying this directly the media do they want Donald Trump to go down to the border and and and make a ... a great sense\nWith big doors open those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America\nAnd break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps\nAnd have no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump hug\n\nOne eight seven seven three one\nThirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one
