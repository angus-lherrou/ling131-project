white supremacists who killed a woman in Charlottesville killed killed the people who are voicing their opinion about something that they don't believe in or that they think is bad for them\nIs how the government how the country work that's not a mob\nWell I Love that the only scanner for mob is they killed someone now there's never been a model outside of Moscow that they kill somebody and by the way it's important to note that in Charlottesville the person who killed somebody\nDid so when he got in his car and drove away from his own mob and then rent rammed into somebody so it's like a modeling crazy ran over a bunch of gates and then started destroying people they did that but that didn't result in the death so even by his own logical scanner doesn't make sense Charlottesville was ... that's the point is that the only mob\nAnd yet folks on CNN are very very strong in their belief that the only sort of mob that's real\nIs right when my Maxine Waters also trotting out this talking point Maxine Waters the same woman who said in front of a crowd that people should confront and get in the face of people at gas stations and restaurants and they should harass spoke in public places now she says well the only real type of mom and my dad has to do with President Trump that's the only real kind of out there trying\nOr to change the description of protests and call it a mob well this president is the poster boy of for what a mob a protest so it looks like\nOkay so from is the definition of a poster boy for a mob you're changing the definition of a mob in order to actual label actually label mobs not makes perfect sense to me\nSenator Mike Lee is a friend of mine and also I think a very solid citizen and he came out and he said listen we got he got docks last week there meaning that there was a staffer for a Democrat who revealed his personal information he says that sort of unsafe that seems sort of like a mob tactic Matty\nIt's terrible it's at least is feeling um area I said my my wife has had to be followed you for at least that none of the\n... the the fact that the Democrats are now suggesting they are not involved in these sorts of mount tactics is really kind of astonishing especially because there is a long history of Democrats using the mobs political tool\n... there is the strategy ... it's called the Fred Segal was it an author of a a great book called the future was once a year\nAbout major American cities destroyed by democratic liberalism\nHe calls it riot ideology right ideology according Fred Segal is this belief that riots are reflection of deep underlying social ills that can only be cured by more government and what you would see from the Democrat is an attempt to actually forward mob politics to forward them out to feed the ... to make them out of a larger to encourage riots and then turn around and look at this\nJust ride is happening because the people are angry the only way to cure this is to give the people what they want a more government or dollars or something else this is a tactic of the Democrats had has been an actual tactic of Democrats for generations Marion Barry who ended up being mayor of Washington DC\nHe said regarding the black Panthers were violent actual terrorists groups just I Know for a fact that white people get scared of the Panthers and they might look at somebody a little bit more moderate and say well let's give the money\nIt's a very is supporting him up\nNew York Mayor John Lindsay who is a very very liberal Republican\nHe said that mass unrest can be the sports more leftist policies you said quote our experiences that some good can come of confrontation politics you remember when the left fully embrace the Occupy Wall Street movement despite their crime and violence despite the fact that they were occupying public places\nAnd turning them into ... Jay Carney the White House press secretary under Obama said of Occupy Wall street quote one man's mob is another man's democracy\nYou remember when Iraq Obama expressed sympathy for riders in cities ranging from Baltimore to Ferguson he said this\nAbout the situation and burgers and he's at those who are only interested in focusing on the violence and just one of the problem to go away need to recognize that we have work to do here and we shouldn't try to paper it over whatever we do that the anger may momentarily some side but over time it builds up in America isn't everything that it could be\nIn other words riots are always an expression of public anger so long as the public anger moves us in the direction of more government liberalism\nIn fact rock Obama was not afraid to use them up as a catalyst for his policy preferences basically throughout his entire career\nRight after the two thousand a financial crisis President Obama takes off it is a big meeting with a bunch of bank CEOs\nAnd at that meeting he turns to them and he says you basically bought you caved my entire agenda because if you don't I Will let them I've got you this is a direct quote from Morocco bomber reporter by political quote my administration is the only thing between you and the pitch for\nThat that is demagoguery sure demagoguery and of course when it comes to sort of\nCasually by lowering which President Obama is no exception he uses language too it was Jim Messina his White House deputy chief of staff said the Democrats should punch back twice as hard it was rock Obama who said if they bring a knife to fight we bring a gun and told people to get in their face\nAs Brock Obama saying that all the talk about Trump is unique in American politics because of the way he talked and that's what's causing all of that's just not true you have to be historically ignorant to think that and it has been a longstanding part of the Democratic agenda to use mobs in order to achieve

familiar with this because they've been doing this on college campuses they're basically incentivize violence on college campuses\nBy saying that if things get too violent well then we'll just ban conservatives very convenient and if there's violence over at Berkeley and so the administration will say well we've got a band conservative speakers until we can get a hold of the situation which is basically the rioters veto we experienced is at DePaul University last year\nWhen students suggested that they might get riots and violence over me visiting campus and so the poll simply bands me\nAnd then they threatened to arrest me if I showed up\nThere's tape of me standing in front of a security guy their head of security there who's telling me that if I take one step forward you will arrest me\nI mean it's truly amazing stuff\nDemocrats engaged in this sort of stuff for very long time and it's always rich to hear what they're willing to blow up folks on the left were perfectly willing to label not only Trump supporters mother go back a few years before that I'm old enough to remember the Tea Party\nWhich was in large part a bunch of people standing around carrying don't tread on me flags and reading the declaration of independence at rallies\nI went to a bunch of the party event I spoke at a bunch of the party but as I was a charter member of the Tea Party\nThe less called them mobs lifted that the tea partiers were ... they said occupy which was involved in actual criminal activity many many many literally dozens and dozens maybe hundreds of arrest across the country of occupy protestors that was not him up but the Tea Party was mob\nFor Democrats any form of Republican speech is demagoguery\nAnd being a mob anytime you get more than two Republicans in an area together it's mob but Democrats were actually charging the steps of the Supreme Court and bashing on the thirteenth on doors and chanting stop Brett Kavanaugh those people are not um up people who are running for the Senate Hart building\nTrying to button whole senators in elevators without security protocols those people are not um up it's not um up when folks go to\nWashington DC find conservatives and then rip up their son that's not a mob it's not a mob when you have Occupy Wall street occupy large swaths of land and the ... the filing into facing and not um up the only mob in Charlottesville is the only thing we've ever seen\nAnd we keep hearing this from the media that of course is not true and more than that it is obviously politically motivated in the media are part of this whole routine coming up but let's continue to make the\nClaim that they are not in fact engaged in mob justice no it's just that the white people out there are a few sensitive this isn't just mom

not the Democrats are acting like a mob if they're white people are just too sensitive about that he says that NPR Dominique ... a month to narrow pointed out in August that since Trump announced he was running for president he has used the word an unfair sixty nine times we and since becoming president\nForty times and then he says Trump sense of fairness or unfairness really has driven him his rise in politics and his priorities for the country\nHas capitalized on grievance especially that a white American shaping at the cultural demographically changing country and has expressed his you know what is unfair everything from trade and immigration to the court system now on the show I've set that I don't like the conversation culture I don't like a white folks and like ... like the idea that you believe that you are a victim in a free society\nWould that set the left has been saying for years on end the day of the white man is over the day of white in this country is over demographic shifts are going to completely changed the way the culture is done and white men it's time for you to sit down and shut up that is a form of discrimination\nYou actually want to make an argument in favor of a cultural shift in America ... argument in favor of the cultural shift but don't do it predicated on the color of the people that you're talking about that's what the lessons done it's driving an awful lot of backlash and I think to a certain extent appropriate backlash\nIf you say to a group of people you know longer matter in American Life what do you think they're going to do\nWhat do you think they're going to do\nSo Charles Blow concludes through it all Trump's monitoring mission remain clear to bind together toxic masculinity and racial performance anxiety into a weapon that can repel change any perceived diminution of white male pregnancy hump is on a campaign to make America as white men feel great again\nWell maybe President Trump is on a mission to point out that discriminatory politics in any form is bad or if he's not he should be if he's not he certainly should be\nYou know that he really biased take on what's going on in American politics that Trump wants to bind to get a toxic masculinity and racial performance anxiety is a gesture and being the only people who are angry right now the only people who are upset with the left are toxic males water right people and whites were underperforming\nNonsense nonsense I Am angry at lack of due process and I am out as ... as it is possible to be with regard to what women should be allowed to do\nStates they should have every right that men have and I've said that one million times on this program it'd be very difficult to label me toxic we masculine and ask for racial performance anxiety is idea that when I'm really upset about is that white people are under performing\nI don't really have that that's not a thing that I'm I'm not concerned about the color of people were underperforming\nAnd I certainly am not one of the the these folks who is supposedly underperforming generally that'd be hard to make that case as well I Am angry however an angry at a left which seeks to divide us based on color and then the minute you say listen stopped dividing us based on color left as on us because you're a patriarchal discriminatory white man\nThat's the logic being used right now now this will backlash this will backlash in the back Russia's not just going to come from white folks the great live less is it political correctness has been embraced by all night Ortiz and political correctness is only opposed by the white majority\nThat's alive less well there is a new study out from Josh among he's a lecture on government at Harvard University and here's what he signs he says that Americans across cultural and ethnic lines don't like PC culture in Illinois them they are sick of left trying to shut down debate I simply shouting that you are of a particular

over at the Atlantic\nAs seller Steven Hawkins Daniel you got to marry in one tours and Tim Dixon argue in a report published Wednesday hidden tribes study of America's polarized landscape most

bureau show so we're in the middle of analyzing a Google memo that was leaked to Breitbart News talking about how they wanted you substitute civility for free speech here's what it's at first it says in the report that users are asking if the openness of the Internet should be celebrated after all and they say that free speech has become a social economic and political weapon\nThey say that the early free speech ideals of the Internet where utopian\nThey even pointed out that maybe they shouldn't be considered a platform anymore except it's on the program before ... essentially admitting they might in fact be a publisher not a platform\nThe briefing from Google identified several factors that allegedly eroded faith in free speech the election of Donald Trump any alleged Russian involvement is identified as one such backers basically Democrats brow big browbeat at Google into believing that they are responsible for allowing free speech in Donald Trump being president\nBut the most important thing appears on the age of sixty six through sixty eight they're racing argues that Google Facebook YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible position first the unmet it'd be an mediated marketplace of ideas\nThat that would be the free speech protection of the United states and second you well ordered spaces for safety instability which would be\nThe publisher space right this would be them determining what sort of conversations we ought to have they say at the American tradition prioritizes free speech for democracy not civilly the second tradition is described as the European tradition which favors dignity of liberty and civility over freedom and then the briefing conclude\nAll tech platforms are now moving toward the European tradition\nThat's scary stuff that's very scary stuff and that is political correctness come to life\nThat is all your social media companies siding with the woke let that most Americans don't like saying we should shut down ideas we should redirect people's eyeballs we should move people turn of civility that we want and we will defined civility civility may not include your viewpoint\nIs this dangerous dangerous stuff and it's one of the reasons why we should all be very wary of these massive social media companies that seemed to be targeting specific political points of view now I Do want to talk a little bit about the situation\nWith regard to ... he's a columnist or was a columnist for the Washington Post who's been missing since entering the Saudi conflict assemble last week\nThe Turkish police allege that he went into the consulate and that he was then murdered by ... by members of the Saudi constantly the basically the Saudis brought in Fifteen people like ... to go into the consulate kill this guy just remember him and then bury him the Saudi Government is still denying foul play\nThe Turkish government has provided specific evidence there's video of shaggy entering the conflict and they provided the names of getting Saudi agents and it's just flew to assemble in pursuit of him the Saudis have issued a blanket denials but this is raising some very serious issues for the United states because the United the Trump Administration has been very close to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nAnd that's because Solomon has been treated as a reformer he's somebody who's supposedly wants to move away from some of the fundamentalism Saudi Arabia he's been involved in the creation of an anti Iranian alliance in the middle east United States is heavily funded the Saudi Government in their fight in Yemen because the Saudis are basically having a proxy war with Iran in Yemen\nAnd so this has raised questions because ... was a legal resident in the United states this has raised questions about whether the United states ought to punish the Saudis by withdrawing support for their for their arms stopped selling the weaponry for example\nThe reason that this is the day the issue is not because we should keep providing them arms on a more level the reason is ... is because there is another party at the table Mediterranean government which is an actual terrorists government and the Turkish government is much more warm with uranium and they are with the Saudis the Turkish government right now is holding a U.S pastor and presidents and none of these regimes are great\nBut it does provide the Trump Administration with a choice choice number one is basically slapped the Saudis on the rest pretend to nothing bad happened twice number two is to basically downgrade the Saudi relationship with the United states over all of that\nTo suggest that the choice doesn't have ramifications or that it's easy if you missed read the nature of global politics\nMy tendency is to say that if this happened\nYou have to downgrade the shouting there's no way around it you\nHave to withdraw armed support for the ... and they have to be punished because this cannot be allowed to go on by him might American ally it's just awful the Saudis put the United states in this position geopolitically and also obviously a lot more awful but it sounds like a murder to guy

did call and crazy and and Sarah Palin called a crazy and I'm sure many of us called the crazy me I didn't care 'cause I was actually a common fan but still am sorry I just separate people's opinions policy public political opinions from their art\nI've just kind of one of those people I Hope you are too\nSo but the difference is the right went after common and\nHis lyrics for being at the White House they didn't call them crazy they didn't call in sick they didn't call them stupid\nThey didn't call them anything like that they just went after politically the president the United states allowing this rapid perform\nAt the White House that's a political attack we understand it is Republican versus Democrat I completely understand that game I could play that game all day long and so

time getting things Kanye West said during the bizarre Trump just listen to how to describe this during the bizarre Trump bizarre trumped meeting before lunch with kid rock\nSo I Want to tell everybody why kid rock was there and I have some sound I Want to\nAh ah\nLet's play this is the beach boys Mike Love who was also at this event yesterday\nMuch for your support for music\nHistorically or remember you've tried your best to help get Whitney Houston in some kind of shape and he's talking to Donald Trump I remember being at mar a Lago was this guy right here\nHe had Ron Perlman come down here and he tried your best to help with a name and she's not the only one you use benefited and\nTried and the people and say what they once you've always been a big supporter of some of the best music that America is every man\nThat's Mike level the beach boys OK talking to Donald Trump the president United States who's supposed to be the most hated man the most racist man who doesn't care about anybody but white men that's my love talking to him\nTelling Donald Trump\nHe cared about and he tried to stay Whitney Houston did you ever hear that now did you guys know that Donald Trump put Jennifer Hudson up at Trump Tower for as long as she wanted to stay rent free when she lost her family so violent crimes that you know that\nNo raise this don't do that people man I [noise] man I'm anyway the reason why kid rock was there because Trump signed the music modernization act which is the biggest change the copyright law in decades\nThe bill which received unanimous bipartisan

couple of days but an interesting week and a well the more things change the more they stay the same which is the hostility and the most pervasive form a bias in the media which happens to be old mission\nNow they're talking about the ... effect throughout the course of this first that we're all with a sliding scale morality here's something else that you probably don't hear about too often\nNow we have had according to the media Research Center\n... news busters now Ninety two percent of the coverage Ninety two percent of the coverage of the Trump Administration by news media the negative Ninety two percent and you you compare it to ... go bomb at the same point about forty six percent negative\nAnd you know where we were in the economy you know where we were in this country a couple of years into the Obama administration\nHere's something that you also don't here again the omission\nYou'll have the media media\nIs always happy to say oh here is a poll that shows Donald Trump bad whatever approval\nRating but there's been a truism pretty much the entire Trump presidency the more informed and engage a person is the more likely they are to approve a President Trump\nAnd that remains the gate says we're a little more than three weeks away from the general election if you take a look at an average of various different pulling out there you'll see that among adult only samples President Trump's approval rating about forty three\nThat among registered voters at pretty much around the same but among likely voters we've continued to see it rise\nYou'll see some polling rats was at one point as we got to fifty one percent and an average of all likely voters the president's been averaging around forty six forty seven percent now that might not sound great but let me put things in perspective for for a moment\nDonald Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency compared to ... bombers among likely voters his approval rating happens to me right now three points higher than ... three points higher\nNow imagine this for about a president with Ninety two percent negative coverage impair job resident with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet the one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\nIt it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is or isn't in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll the lives that were thrown out there were perpetuated while that whole deal was going down\nIt was guaranteed not Dorothy was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay so Obama Care is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that we know about the you know if you like your doctor and keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo people understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage lot folks get upset about the way things are portrayed but remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence\nThat we think they have if they\nHad the type of impact in elections\nThat many will still assume they have there is no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nThey you know middle they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better these are all things that are facts and it's why the most informed and engaged are more likely to approve of President Trump\nIs why we might actually be one of those inflection point in American political history the kind that might actually lead and Republicans that not losing\nIn this presidential election cycle these are all the things that are on the table something else [noise] but you can't lie to people about [noise]\nYou can't lie to people about financial fraud and we're going to talk about that and Medicare for all coming up next because Medicare for all is the

suffered greatly from\nMr Trump fans Brunson will visit him in the oval office sometime Saturday afternoon about\nCost and teeny Washington\nCorrespondent nic Robertson reports that turkey pro government newspapers is audio with a missing journalist alleged murder was transmitted by his apple watch\nTo pick up on a couple of points real quickly and here's the first one if\nAlready are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal corn into the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in your one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare\nSee and it gets worse every year from there\nApparently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it you got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\n[laughter] I mean it is financial fraud that's is bigger than Bernie made off yeah\nYou have a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it financial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud and by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to board has given the joy of race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist wins\nWhere we've got much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you\nOne of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this and this was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott who was term limited in running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians ... no\nYou won't have the most liberal in less just governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and you go well that sucks to be you and for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats and our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode the wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination would just thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is they now consolidated around him of course\nDemocrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg just came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check to a ... year Michael Bloomberg felt like he is the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who was a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this ... is critical and again there is one platform piece of particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic when you're talking about the governor's race because we'll Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter\nAndrew Gillum has also run on impeach him President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate\nIt's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got Fifteen Percent on it it is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out dishonest is that you could put everybody on it and it's going to get better\nThere is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've gotten much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the white also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting I'm not exaggerating I'm not making it up it's according to federal defender a has a basic financial literacy test\nAnd right now more than sixty percent of adults bail it a basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have with conversations and concepts like this\nDoesn't matter how educated one is\nGenerally if there are financially illiterate than these concepts might be bought and sold kind of like hope and change and Obamacare\nSo having these conversations making sure that your financial informed to making sure your kids are financially informed pretty important not only for their everyday life but when it comes to concepts like this because ultimately it's not complicated\nBut it is brought its financial fraud is dishonest and it's guaranteed to fail\nWe'll come back and talk about another\nBig time fraud perpetuated on us the minimum wage who earns it pretty much nobody and that's the dirty little secret talking about that next I'm Brian mud in for the great one month\nHim

percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational here but here's something else that is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person that take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody why haven't seen any benefit from it\nWell that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't put the tax cuts\nSo it's all going to be reconciled when they file their taxes but they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had to actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody that I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything now\nThe next part that fraud comes in with companies\nYou hear how awful the tax cuts are because evil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back home their stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy you know that that stuff except that\nThat's a fraud as well is dishonest to its ally the a C B say you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] they have the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC with their CFO council\nHave found that a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way who has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not ... percent of the corporate tax cuts\nThis year buybacks right this horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone through a combination of bonuses and employee raises\nThirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should pay it off that helps the company become more stable lessons their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of sheer about buybacks in dividend payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that\nIs not perpetuated informational lead by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary\nIs you the employee but [noise] you know\nI I guess conveniently that that message has just been missed you know I I'm sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will
