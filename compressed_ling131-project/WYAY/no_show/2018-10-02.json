little wheels is maybe a soldier [noise]\nSo it means basically it's kind of half wrapping half talking he says I Want to cry right now a black man in America is supposed to keep what you feel inside right now he says he says the blacks all want always Democrats she says\nYou know it's like the plan they did to take the fathers out of the home and promote welfare does anybody know about that that's a democratic plan that's not around that is actually a kind of the troops to what he's talking about is back in the sixties and seventies when they were designing welfare\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan said you know if you do this you were basically promoting the dissolution of the family because you're going to pay people they they they were repeatedly warned that your pain essentially people to have children out of wedlock and if the fathers there they lose their welfare\nAnd in fact worked out that way the black family has been virtually destroyed they are now more\nBlack children being raised in a single parent homes than there were when the Democrats were the slave owners back in the day when the Democrats were actually breaking up families intentionally people booed\nAnd people were applauded and he's and and he said in the county where should they bullied me backstage they said don't go out there with that had on the bully me backstage they bullied me and then they say I'm In a system in place\nHere here's the thing why is this why isn't even knew the Kanye West supports Donald Trump why is that even knew first of all\nFrom his improve the lives of black people in this country economically is certainly true it's news because the left insist on monopolizing the culture is not the things that they think like oh you know we're really good at culture so we're going to it is that they insist on monopolizing it every single comedian on TV\nIs left wing every single one every late night comedian there's not one show and if there were a show if there were show that had a comedian who was pro Trump\nIt would drive everybody crazy when Fox News came along Fox News has like one tenth I think of the ratings of the ... networks with the networks have like ten times the ratings of Fox why of Spock stuck and people had\nPeople's heads it's because the only people they're the only people saying what they're saying that the only place you can go to here Sean Hannity's point of view and the only place you can go to watch it the Bret Baer news program which is the most honest program on TV it doesn't have a right wing or slim and the the point\nThe point here is that on the white\nI don't want right wing culture I don't want every comedian to be right winger I don't want comedians me right when he was laughing because I think you can laugh at everybody in politics you really can cause they're all what they what we see in front of us are all pretty funny\nBut they want monopoly they want only one side to speak they weren't silence on the other side and we had let them get away with it and it really really has been a mistake the ... the ... because of that it's because of that that they can sell this\nHave a narrative because of that

people and have the same result as nine hundred okay differences um\nIt's it's ... ... ... that those are the talkline numbers the reason we call larger numbers sometimes like a thousand is so that we get larger samples of smaller groups so that we were then able to identify for example you might only have a three we had three hundred and four African Americans dissipated\nThe survey how many other line sixty four three hundred and four so almost a third thirty yes thirty one percent and and when you were then able to break that up yes\nNow when you pull African Americans Ninety percent of them are Democrats or\nIt's that's pretty much right okay um do they want necessarily use the term the poll do as a Democrat or African Americans don't necessarily use the term that they are a\nDemocrat Ninety percent of the time of course historically the behavioral voting is that maybe Ninety five percent of African Americans do vote democratic\nGotcha okay yeah\nSo where are we now ... what's the turnout I mean what's the final results of this recent poll on Sunday\nOf course we have a Brian Kemp leads with two percent or just under two percent of the vote a he has forty eight percent and Stacey Abrams has forty six percent\nThen I'll be rounding off these numbers ten match there is a libertarian in the race and people sometimes forget that this is not just a two person race this is a three person writes\nThe libertarian and the on the ballot is going to be there to match and he carries two percent of the vote itself\nSo that side of that three percent so according to your polls there's definitely a runoff\nWell no I'm not necessarily because of course number one this is a month before the election what six days out from the election if the election were held today\nUm and then you also have the factor of undecided voters undecided voters eventually there don't vote or they just fall in line somewhere so with three percent\nIt's it's I'm today I'd say it's\nA there'd be a better chance and not that there would be a runoff\nMet a chance to not they weren't always will be a runoff yeah I think we'll be right on okay like like\nWhat are your cross tabs on a first of all let me ask this question then I'm gonna go to traffic really quickly but what are your cross tabs on do you have thirty percent African American what are some of the other break down some percentage of women versus men things like that 'cause we know that is going to determine the outcome\nTrump supporters tend to skew mail on Abrams supporters tend to skew a female so what are your cross tabs in this particular poll well before you answer that let me go to handling stress the front and center with Matt who door\nStill got trouble in the south side Shelley Seventy five southbound at the Hampton macdonald wrote exit now looks like\nThey reopen a center lame but still got a ride shut down there trying to get everything move back around and moved back over to the right shoulder\nBut Seventy five I continued to stack behind it as you make your way back into the south side of get back down to the racetrack ... farmers insurance the twenties continue thinking on either side of the metro and now the ... to ... just starting to show some red actually coming to highlight a pass the Stone Mountain freeway\nFrom a bear messing up your car interior to a deer damaging a poll liner they've covered it talked to farmers insurance we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two I met during this door to door traffic\nSo I'm On the phone with mark round free of landmark communications and they just recently released a poll in a camp Abrams race that has the uh Brian Kemp forty eight percent and say see I'm forty six percent and walk before we went to traffic I ask a question about your cross tabs a percentage of women versus men so forth\n[noise] yes that's right I'm One of the reasons that the landmark communications poll is often more accurate\nThan any other polls are out there is that we also have a very extensive database of Georgia voters so we look back in history and determined\nThat first of all the historical turnout for various kinds of elections so we know for example in two thousand fourteen the demographic turn out of the race of the election those at at that point male female black white Hispanic\nWhat have you so we then can extrapolate that Shelly to 'em what it will probably be watching for example we take into account that\nThis was a historical campaign rice Stacey Abrams me on the ballot we're going to have a larger African American turnout than we did to dust fourteenth right so we have accommodated I'm that so we actually have the the the turnout at thirty one and a half percent African American\nUm instead of the twenty eight point seven percent that it was in the previous ... so we take these things into account and that helps us to be more accurate maybe than\nSome of the nominee of arms for example what a breakout of male to female\n[noise] uh fifty five percent of voters and little more than that about a just under fifty six percent of the voters and alcohol um we're waiting it does the term used and uh fifty six percent of the voters nearly will be female and that is historical troop people don't recognize a lot of times they don't know\n'cause they don't dig around and you know databases the way we do a for a for campaigns um that usually well\nSo to speak historically females have been a majority of the vote in Georgia elections\nIt usually is fifty six percent of all the presidential years five and give it a ...\nSo so here's the thing that could begs the question you got a female on a ballot you've got an unpopular president with\nMany women particularly I keep reading about in suburban women are suburban white women um in particular and you have an unpopular president with a lot of African American women who are really vote Democrat you have an African American on a ballot\nThat scary to me based on because you can that fifty six percent could be sixty percent because of those factors right or no\n[noise] it's gonna be a very hard to get a total of six to ... percent of your voters banks you know I don't I don't really see that happening\nBut I'll kind of see a scenario where it's you know argues higher activity historically high for women to Troy year as well as fifty sects\nAnd and that's what Stacy kept counting on Stacey Abrams is counting on\nStacey Abrams as her modeling is going on to determine how she can win this election she needs a thirty two or thirty three or four thirty four percent African American vote total in other words\nMaybe thirty three percent of all voters would have to be a African American if they if the historical model holds of Ninety five percent of African\nAmericans voting Democrat democratic system as a mathematical equation how you get their ... we\nWe all support the lieutenant governor's race uh\nF Duncan leach by interestingly enough nearly the exact same margin or headache forty sex and that and we in fact\nThe Republicans were carrying about forty eight percent of the vote across the board for non incumbents got ... ... it's kind of the reason for this this level of partisanship you don't have a big differential between the different um governor lieutenant governor insurance commissioner you didn't have a lot of differences and these things\nAre ... and that is because our theory is that the Kavanaugh nomination hearings have resulted in a artist and I sort of make partisanship premature at this level of a campaign usually you get really artist and in the last two weekly everybody and I'd just joins your own party in this case\nIt's happening because of the cabinet Harrison in Georgia

banner in here and I think all said was Trump twenty twenty\nThis this is a different when right this is a whole new thing that might be the same one because technically that's it's got maybe what he folded or maybe it was folding I couldn't anyway with side was might have been ... says it says Trump twenty twenty keep America great so it's a it's an American flag type banter with Trump twenty twenty keep America great so it's a political ... typed side\nAnyway uh last week it disappeared\nAnd apparently somebody complained somebody was going around to all the department said gee somebody ought to complain about the Trump signed an air will finally somebody did so it allegedly to people and I think they always have to say that but there that somebody said that there were two people that went to HR and HR had to go to court for it to see what the policy was about hanging a political science in the studio\nBut not exactly in public view at the front of the building but it's in the building it's in our office ah so anyway so that that was a few days ago and now we have the policy that they come up up up released this morning\nWhich is not really a policy to I'm not going to be all of it it's a a I Would describe it as a sort of a heart felt to plead to start being nicer\nWould you repeat would you agree with that kind of ... it's a it's a heartfelt ... there'd be a little more closer to be a little nicer and watch would just say in social media in particular are we are\nTeam in this environment is a struggle being a team is the only way we are in business where we fighting every day for audience an ad dollars\nComplicating things our job is to inform entertain engaged and even distract our listeners on those issues each of our personalities bring their perspectives are experiencing their opinions to bears so every day around her teams are walking a tightrope\nInsight on that up so he says I have a civil asking as funny there's a grammatical error and Harris says please take care and read should be said please take care and what you post on social media knowing many of your friends and followers work here in the office\nSo first thing is please be careful what you take care what you post on social media\nWell\nOn social media I wouldn't use the name but there and we have a ... a big time Charlie management team here hater one in hate or to God and what you are but there are big time Charlie management team and our big time surely management team a and I will use this as a generic or not one person about representing what the what they stand for and the top management\nOr here's a here's a like where the this ... our top bosses amen when Republicans vote for cabinet today it won't be because they think she was lying it'll be because they don't care that she was telling the truth\nAnd he said a man okay bashing\nKavanaugh and Donald Trump in the same sentence or here's another one from our top boss a boss team fake news Trump's obsession is now a control for strong men via the New York times and sadly the president does the fake news purveyor in cheap\nThat's where my top blasting okay it goes on and on and on and by the way uh\nI and I hate to see if we could find some of the ones from during the election because they were vicious there were the our top team management team here was was either agreeing with or tweeting and sending along a following tweets that Donald Trump as a Nazi a dead heat and you know just viciously attacking him as a womanizer in a wire\nOr the most vicious things you've been the same kind of stuff that Brian Joyce was tweeting a privately on his Facebook pages from the same people who hired Brian Joyce did exactly what they're trying to do in this memo is that is to make us all to be a little bit nicer\nMaybe a little bit nicer well which ... and ... and what a bunch of hypocrites\nI I you have no idea that kinda vicious filth that came out of our top management team and now they're telling us to be nice on social media we're supposed to be something by raising a little something are on TALK radio and maybe if you guys up in the top officers would spend a little money on promotion and marketing maybe somebody around town and find out that hey what\nYou know we got stuff on the radio that might be interesting to listen to once in awhile\nBut they're not going to do that to live the way we can make waves on our own if you're not going to help us you know I Can't complain we're doing it all by ourselves\nAway my God yeah move over your freak and blocking us God\nKnow they throw under the bus and you know they they said back beep or something I didn't do ... and made me sign up sheet of why did the same thing to hang\nUp and threw him under the bus the cover the rats and now somebody complained HR incorporate so he said oh God I've got to come up with a policy to show that I've handled this you guys I've really handled this and so they come up with is non policy policy\nPlease take care of what you hang in your studio your cubicle or your office to the extent possible let's keep our opposite environment that is free of heart held stance is an advocacy on issues more than anything let you appreciate each other let's welcome different opinions but always always do it with love and respect\nShe that doesn't sound like governor we spread calling Donald Trump of Nazi and a womanizer in a liar and stupid that same Republicans over cabin up because they don't care that the girls telling the truth\nThat's our top team entered telling us to be\nIce\nTelling us to be nice it's exactly the opposite we should be saying who the hell do you think you are when these women are quite and by the way a senator Purdue from Georgia is going to cost to the other ... yesterday by women you know is that don't you turn your back on me and how could you not respect women and so and so forth it's time to say shut up lady you're on the line\nI mean it's just outrageous\nTo hell do you think you were going backwards we don't want to be you know we don't want to be nicer and sweet or an inclusive my God that's where you tried for two hours and ... I've heard two years in the afternoon and it was a disaster\nAnd the thing there you know yeah it\nAlways surprised that were there any really well I I think that that there really is a a a just a to a concerted effort to silence conservative voices I'll just like a other technique looks like a Facebook and apple that Google was political concern is I Believe that our companies actually signed up to the same thing\nWith me I was what what else do that\nYeah I wouldn't be the right and which makes it worse in my opinion is not that they would be trying to silence us but they're trying to silence is because they're afraid to take on the heat they're afraid to ask please stand up the people are like the uh like like the one person in a in a market that did just done something that causes a problem\nInstead of standing up for the people to the radio station they're afraid to take on anybody who has a criticism above someone and or in a in a controversial talk show which is by God by definition what we do and God Forbid somebody react negatively to it and you're afraid to take it and they won't support is they won't back us up they're afraid of the controversy they're afraid of somebody saying something bad\nSo the cowardly out the chicken out and say let's hope the little sweeter nicer and so that's going to work and my God I mean it's just it is the\nYou know the fact that the response grew up here to\nPut a stop sign up for their response to that I'm a bit of a southern accent in the studio yeah and they and they say okay let's see if it was what is it a giants\nYou know I\nKnow is it a is a butterfly fellow so there's lots of ... no no just outside just grow my friend but yeah yeah\nYeah go ahead down the halls and go back to your office in stopped bothering us that the answer here and I believe I Love your show ... and I are in the morning are is simply the best it's not God Bless America ... ... thing right three thirty\nTwo I mean say you know I mean I don't mean sorry about ranting and raving but this is bull crap and they're coming out you know you come out with a public policy nude in front of change your stuff I'm going to react to it especially when you show that you might you know you you were the exactly the opposite of what you're trying to make us\nThe vicious haters vicious haters by the hour top management team against Donald Trump since day one\nSo you can do this or this non ... thank God this policy doesn't say anything\nIt says try to take it you're says so uh that would lead to appreciate each other and take care and what you post on social media I don't use social media so it doesn't apply to me and be a beach take care of what you hang in the studio and ... and a village appreciate each other okay well there's there's your non policy policy\nAnd why don't you why did you how how about this how about ... boys how 'bout you release all those emails to chew hidden now how about how about all the tweets you heading for the last year and a half when you were backing Donald Trump is not seen as gun bag let's let's read a few of those Jesus I being honest\nTo God hold on the news make a line and let's
