Bush was going up against score and it was at night that uh the election night yeah came out Gore won and the next day was Bush I didn't vote that time and the next day all of my college friends are talking about this\nAnd I couldn't say anything because I didn't put my voice out I I didn't make a stand right um after that I was like dedicated to I'm going to make my voice heard and then it was a time where Bush was there and I\nDidn't I like him I didn't like the politics and sometimes you know I just know what the the pundits tell me All right but I didn't like him resolve made it a point and then I think Senator Kerry or just you know he was going against um Bush and his\nThat that that speech this Obama's first time getting on the platform you know he did that a ... speech for Kerry right and it was like oh\nAnd some told me then he's going to be the first black president ... yeah and that I Am I fell in love with the Daily Show with John Stewart John air just because he may politics humorous and they have an entertaining assuming so then it made me start reading up on you know more and then\nWhen I started seeing so much stuff go on\nIn the cities and in politics and like you know what we got to vote and\nThey got in hurricane ourselves we got a fairly uncomfortable voting because honestly I don't even know what the heck were voted no on voting for right that's why it's important let me think some\nIf you can ... if you can look at the latest ... video on YouTube you can look up information about your candidate Al Franken look at what's going on in the community and educate yourself right and and I know this is hard for us in our society which you or\nYou can vote early I Know we don't have to think that really we don't like to go to Ernie girlie tags early right a lot of things we all like you know some of us are going to be ...\nYou know goes come on and we do not like to be on time but we can't vote early versus waiting for an hour in the rye and all around\nGo ahead and all the time right bus right we've got to vote no that's what we don't you know we got to vote gotta than I Do have our voices be heard and you know what I'm

approved there are no cheap dental implant only less expensive options dental specialist train extra so this bargain extra special especially for your wallet\nYou know I mean you know obviously you get the word out to to so many people and we're totally grateful for that um you know every time we're at a location you know wherever will will ask for donations um you know just just mostly word of mouth 'cause obviously we do I'll have full time job since we can't commit one\nHundred percent to this but um but it's just getting out there and talking to people and you know put it on our website ... you know that they can donate and see what happened\nDuring the early start ramping up for the Christmas season\nOh we are already ramped up already read we are already read though rodeo already\nGo yeah so we we had the warehouse um it's stocked with toys now you know were lining up to the agencies yeah we're yeah we're ready to roll come October first\nAnd when the boxer started going out like you could see boxes everywhere for Jewish\nDie he can go on line people can go on line now in request them um some people have already requested him and that's probably another you know a few weeks out but but now it'll start then the next month for sure\nAnd once again or anybody listening if you have anything anything you can donate spot\nSir uh money website once again Atlanta toys were taught that work and that's where you go to find how you can do that how you can volunteer because things like this they don't go off without volunteers\nNo it really doesn't run without volunteers a you know we need\nThat um\nThat executive branch to kind of run things and you know uh and kind of coordinate the volunteers and uh the saving of the toys and things like that so yeah we can run without volunteers for\nSure so last year we had over four thousand volunteers were thousand\nFour thousand volunteers and this is people from a pile up to ... from media coordinator to driving the truck\nThis is for this I mean this includes I mean the board is only made up about Fifteen people said that for the board is very small that were out on tears but\nYou know the to go into the warehouse to drive in the trucks to picking up totally to you know if it's all done on a volunteer basis so yeah so it's like um four thousand dollars\nA share your John ... the head of all this and and the fact that you know you're organizing and so what are what are other people like that aren't in this room right now what are they doing right now\nOh my goodness um they they probably aren't the warehouse there's they're setting the box up there still sorting the toys out from last year to get ready um they're coordinating events I mean that's one of the huge thinks that that helps drive you know helps to express that we have\nAnywhere between three and six hundred events every year\nAnd and it's all done by individual has not coordinated by choice for not that it's done by people you know ... having kids birthday parties and they instead of getting to lease they want to do an item to toys for cats or it's golf tournament\nFrisbee golf [laughter] Dina ultimate Frisbee\nAnd it was so there's there's an event next I think it's either this weekend in Mexican innocence Stockbridge and it's the rise of money in and toys for toys were not um you ... so it's it's it's different things on different levels I mean we have people who will donate food\nTo the volunteers are working in the warehouse we have people who will donate you know or volunteer to go pick a toys they'll they'll\n[noise] um I'm trying to think anything you can think of it's it's all donated all volunteered um drive trucks drive forklifts sort toys bag delays drop off boxes ... anything you know it's it's all driven by volunteers\nSo ... so you're not just taken toys on a day to day basis you also have really cool events so would have been some really good successful events that are ...\nYou know one one of my favorite events is is actually hosted by the Atlanta Falcons\nAnd um I don't really know that it has a title or if it has a name but this'll be the third year that they've done it and what they do is they bring in children from under privileged families\nAnd they have a whole event with him at actually at ... stadium which is really kind of cool um and so what they do is they they get a wish list of as the children and it's usually\nI don't know I'm going to say like forty five fifty kids um we supply the toys I'm the wives of the falcons rap the toys\nAnd they put the name of each child on her locker in the in the locker room and the kids get to go in and they get to find their locker and they get to to get their their toys and one one year it was just so heartbreaking because um when mobile he must spend five or six and he opened him he goes\nTo I get to keep these aren't they all mind he does have never had a Christmas\nYou know and and you'd that just breaks your heart and and you asked why we do it that's why we do it\nAnd that once again as a huge reason the towards your thoughts needs money they need sponsors there it's not like you're keeping any of the money you get all the money is going back to giving kids a Christmas that they otherwise wouldn't have and I shared with you many times ... a share that I was extremely privileged\nGrowing up in a you know never wanted for anything a wealthy family and but every time we were given something we were made sure of our parents are they always reminded us you remember that when we give you this you better be grateful because you know their kids would would never get this kind of stuff and I take that\nInto my adult life now and that's why I Love doing this and getting to talk to all these nonprofits and all these people that are doing such amazing things because you're out there given up your time uh and do do it with a lot of stress on the same time to make sure kids have a good Christmas\nIt's you know it's absolutely worth well I mean you know and I know in my heart of hearts that they can replace me tomorrow\nBut I don't think so yeah well thank you but but I you know I Do what I can and and I hope everyone else says what they can you know one of the biggest things that I Am courage people to do is like you know that Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving when everybody's out shopping you just grab another Barbier grab another football or whatever it is you know and start that process now\nAnd that again and again uh most kids today want our paths they want the newest iPhone and they want these crazy gadgets\nThese kids are happy like you said you know football ... be a new T shirt you know ... and that just blows my mind a happy you can make a kid that you know has never had a Christmas before going back to the falcons story kid looking into a Walker and say I get to keep all of these\nAnd and then it makes me feel awful from my privileged upbringing where I got what I wanted to more that's why I Love doing this and you know given people I was taught a platform to you know say what they need what you know because they are\nDoing you know and that's and that's a big mission of the the marine reserves I mean is to give a child a toy that that is they are that they can show ownership that they can take pride in that they you know to help them you'll feel confident about themselves and you know not envious of somebody who gets everything I mean 'cause it's like I've got something if my own\nAnd towards your thoughts has some amazing current sponsors right\nNow yes um you know public says obviously a big sponsor Mars every year but some that don't always get mentioned quite as much as cutie they are huge sponsor for us I'm looking forward to working with him again this year hopefully we can drive more toy drops to their location there is also a group here in Atlanta called um\nM. A. I. D. A. which is the metro Atlanta auto Dealers Association they're huge supporter of toys rights and I think they have like a hundred and twenty nine dealers and each dealer is a drop site\nAnd they not only are they a drops out but they also pick up the toys and deliver into the warehouse for us so they do it for us but just huge you know because we don't you know obviously where we're working with all the tears so anything that we can help you know there are the companies can help us that's huge\nAnd it's an amazing thing about a city like Atlanta we have so many people that are willing to help you know you're looking for a permanent space that you know you don't have to pay for it because like I said going back to the beginning for every ten dollars that torture ties has to spend\nThat's one child that might not have a Christmas ... and we're we're always like you said the goal was always a million every year to reach and it's sad that I always say this as well twenty Eighteen we shouldn't have a society where kids all over the next Christmas is coming from where kids they'll know where their next meal is coming from\nOr they don't even know what Christmas is because they've never experienced\nIt never woken up on Christmas morning and ran into a tree and seen presidents under a tree or how to Christmas meal as a family\nMhm and that's it yeah and again you know Atlanta's a great city you'd say and I know everyone has a big heart and it's just getting the word out and getting people to understand this is what we may\nWell once again push thoughts needs money they need sponsors and website once again this year\nAtlanta twice the cat's dot org\nThat's how you give that's how you request to box will tell you volunteer that's all you become a sponsor a Sherry Carney ... assistant coordinator for toys were taught and dynamic was out of a media coordinator now for toys for toss thank you so much for taking the time coming in speaking with me again thank you so much\nWhen he was thinking about replacing any door on your home\nAll the pros and all four seasons garage doors biology and a lot of my company is metro Atlanta's home locally owned and operated by my family for the last Twenty years whether it's repair or new insulation and free door for garage door\nAll four seasons as you've covered we've scored home run with Andrew with us do home reports

submission to glass door and your job goes to over a hundred different jobs ... plus glass door candidates are twice as likely to be higher than those from traditional sang and they're thirty percent more likely to say\nA residential home fires in America today but again the up up tick in those fires were because of those heating appliances\nUm and again as we said those decorations when it comes to the holiday decorations um a lot of improper wiring overloaded electrical circuits um you know Christmas lights and other holiday decorations that are just in poor poor shape and need repairing ... you've had her ... years and years and you know the fireplaces this is the time is the winter season is\nAnd and and and ... season is coming upon us to all local chimney sweep and and get your kidneys inspected and clean prior to burn in the woods this year to prevent a dangerous Gemini fire\nAnd another thing people that you know whether it's warm or cold outside you're always doing this how are we talking about ashes from grills ... how they they say\nAshes from grills and fireplaces for that matter a lot of people will you know scoop out the charcoal lash or\nUm the ashes from the wood and and put it in a container on that usually not fire safe you know people put it in you know clean it out the oh I had a fire four or five days ago and people don't realize that there is embers that can be insulated inside that asked for days upon days upon days\nAnd once it gets outside gets a little went to it um we seen devastating fires from people put him in thinking that they're cold ashes putting them in a um a paper bag a plastic bucket we've seen people put them on their backs porches index that are made out of wood\nUm and then a wind gets to it and now we have their deck on fire catches the exterior of the house on fire and\nAnd and there goes the rest of the building so again if you're going to clean it out use always use an ash can non combustible you can purchase some you know most hardware stores out there again that's designed for to for getting rid of ash\nAnd and uh you know from your fireplace or your or your ... or your uh your charcoal grill\nI'm really et cetera the citizen fire academy\nYeah so I'm the one thing that we want to promote or as a lot of metro Atlanta fire departments are offering different programs I'm here in Sandy Springs for one\nI'm ... and a lot of these places you don't have to necessarily be a citizen or you can just be an employee that works inside the city limits but if you've ever had an interest in fire and emergency services profession and wanting to just learn about it more or even become more involved in it through volunteering\nThrough different programs like the ... team the community emergency response team in any event of a disaster or something like that we mobilize\nThe citizen volunteers to help out um what the central tasks of a basic life safety and rescue and search and rescue and things of that nature um again as I said many metro departments have we have a ways to learn more and and by the profession just contact your local fire department\nThe city the county um\nUh again many are offering these citizens fire academies are certain programs here in Sandy Springs we offer a couple of classes a year on what the next one starting September the twentieth every Thursday evening from six to eight pm for eight consecutive weeks\nI'm In the program you learn all the phases of fire and emergency services profession as well as becoming search team certified\nAgain as I said this is open to any resident or anyone who works within the city limits of Sandy Springs or anybody who's interested or let me give you a couple of ways you can find out more information you can call 'em the community affairs department at Sandy Springs fire department at seven seven zero two zero six\nOne five one eight or simply just go to the city of Sandy Springs website at W. W. W. dot Sandy Springs Ga dot Gov and once you get\nTo the website up on the tool bar on I'm On the right hand side you just click on the public safety tab\nUnder the ... under the public safety tab you'll see another tab for the fire department you click on that tab\nAnd you'll see an option for citizen volunteer programs you click that and there'll be a link to the syllabus of the program um there'll be a link to the application to fill out to to join the the the free this is all free training as well I'm In a few\nFurther or want to you know become a part of the citizen volunteer portion of it um you'll be given uniforms and everything is free of charge\nOn there is no cost to you whatsoever no obligation\nI'm so again if you're interested in if you don't live in Sandy Springs anywhere in the metro Atlanta area a most county and city agencies have similar programs on these are nationwide programs the ... program and citizen fire academies and again just contact your local agency um if you have more interest than it\nEver got fire prevention week coming up in October right\nYeah um and and again as I said that week is is what I talked about the beginning is um the the message of look listen and then learn 'em and again the number one thing in terms of that ... that week of October seventh through the thirteenth\nBut the whole month we we asked the general public to um take time to um learn more about ways they can um you know emergency preparedness planning is the key to survival\nFor any crisis or critical of it and their life and it doesn't have to be complicated training or excuse me complicated planning um simple things I'm\nJust simple steps that you discuss with yourself you discuss with your loved ones in your family\nWhere you discuss with your co workers at work\nBecause um people ... you don't believe it or not people think they're the safest at home um versus work where you're actually Ninety percent more likely to die in a fire from at home than you are ever at work but that the key to survive I mean again is that preparedness that emergency preparedness you can't live with your head in the sand thinking it'll never happen to me\nI'm I'm Andrea will do and most people most people do and you know they think oh it's never happened and never will\nUm but again um we like to kind of compare the emergency preparedness thing is um you know great industry that does this all the time if you think about it it does it thousands of times a day and it's a very simple message that they get out as the airline industry Everytime an ... an airplane leaves are brown that flight attendant will get up there\nOn that flight crew will stand up there and give a two minute what public safety admitted message about this is what we do in case there is of a fire in the cabin this what we're going to do if we lose\nCabin pressure recession this we're going to do if we have to make a water landing and they go through these simple emergency steps without ever the benefit of having anybody practice it but it's a simple message it's educated it's just it's given out to the\nTo the people on an event of an emergency\nThey follow these steps and most people walk away unscathed from this and that's the simple message of emergency preparedness having a plan is the key to survival it doesn't take a devastating fire for you didn't need to plant it can be something like an\nShooter it can be a simple gas leak or hazardous materials incident it could be a bombing 'em but having a plan and you know people don't think of you know when when we start hearing gunshots coming from down the hall or in in a in a place of business we're gone to a movie you don't want to stop them and think oh my gosh what am I going to do\nOne message we like to get out is that personal situational awareness wherever you go to a movie this weekend out to dinner tonight to a show to a concert take five\nSeconds to familiarize yourself with an alternative exit on because that's so important\nReal quick one thing as many times if as we've talked as much as I think about fire safety now so I'm about to move into a condo and it's nine four and a high rise and that freaks me out of our solar below me living on the stove or whatever ... oh man it just freaks\nMe out of the one thing that you can rest assured that eat again most people are in terms of the common um citizens out there don't realize that you're in a modern story Honda high rise that is going to be fully sprinkled\nI'm In sprinklers I've we have never we very rarely pull a dead body of a sprinkler building um sprinklers are worth their weight in gold day save more lives than any other fire service\nUm modern invention of the ... of all time sprinklers are truly lifesavers again fully um integrated fire alarm system know what that fire alarm system sounds like and also know that you you live in a non combustible building I'm again I'm most modern high rises anything built in the last\nTwenty five thirty years again non combustible a construction that you know prevent fires spread in a red rapidly you know\nWell once again are always love having them

when you get about three points on your driver's license it gets really serious and I am told that insurance companies are taking these ah citations very very seriously they are warning their customers\nAbout being cited for a violation of this law they saw this will offer a lot of reasons one because Georgia had had the highest increase in automobile rights\nAnd a lot of that was due to\nA distraction and so a lot of a lot of companies are saying okay you've gotten one you need to be careful you know ah we're taking this very seriously uh they're not necessarily the castle but the but you could make your rates go up\nOr it's amazing the amount of people that I've talked to that thing oh you know government or you know police just trying to be tougher on us this is an amazing thing that's going to reduce the amount of accidents we have in Georgia\nYeah when we were already down now eleven percent for the year that's great news for your job that makes your child\nOh absolutely you know we're a hundred and a fourteen people there are a hundred and fourteen people who are alive today\nUh that that that if this was last year they they ... they might have been killed in the crash or were trying to make sure people understand that this is\n... first of all it is serious business when you're driving a car you've got two tons of steel and a lot of horse power under the hood and handled properly it's a great thing it's a it's something to get from point a to point in in a city like Atlanta where we're working on our ah\nOur a rapid transit and so forth are are expansion a martyr and all of that but\nUntil that happens it's a city that requires a lot of driving and if you want to go from point a to point in the city and we want you to get there safely that's all we're trying to do you know and let me see if it's about raising revenue or let me assure you that that's not what it's about um and we're trying to make\nSure people behave properly\nThe one way we could enforce texting is to get the the phone out of the hands of the driver\nOr you know you can also you you were able to adjust your a navigation and this sort of thing but if electronic communications you can send and receive for example\nIf you have the ability on your phone to sin verbal or you could say I want to send jak send a text messaging and what do you want to say to Jackson and you dictate it um\nYou know into the than the Bluetooth device and you know you can still do that you can have it read your last\n... used to you you know most of the the modern phones will read your last four or five on your read me my on red text messages and would tell you what what what is being said a and you can respond and as long as you're not\nTouching that phone and your hands are on the wheel you're ... you're fine\nIt's uh it's amazing because what they're growing technologies you ought to just creates more destruction and when you're on the road and rush hour traffic on Seventy five or to eighty five and you got your phone your hand you're putting yourself in every other car rounds you at risk\nActually you know if you're going sixty miles an hour and you have a phone in your hand your eyes are on the phone\nIn five seconds you go to the length of a football field and I would not think about navigating a football field with my eyes closed vet if your eyes are on that phone and you're not looking at the road that's exactly what you're doing\nIf you're going sixty miles an hour down a highway and then\nCar or on a road show in South in front of you and you don't see a new look up a from your phone was forty feet left not much going to be done\nYou know we we had the one thing we have seen unfortunately is a lot of crashes where people will run into the back of the car and the brakes were never applied sometimes going forty fifty miles an hour and sometimes it results in significant injury to the person in the current front\nYou don't have to be going very fast to do damage to your self or others\nYou know and and I will tell you or the other thing that the insurance companies tell me is is you know the the ... the damage to the vehicles is much worse uh\nI I was on my way up here and I saw somebody in the rear end another\nAnd it I Would dare say that car probably ... total just by looking at what I saw there and uh it is you know\nIt's expensive and uh you know there's not many two or three hundred dollar repairs on on body work you know uh when you have a car it could cost ... five six seven thousand dollars a year like significant a you damage on the front or rear\nAnd real quick as we always say uh living in a place like Atlanta you go out you have fun you got that as you always say every time as soon as that second drink touches your lips think about how you're going to get home\nYeah you ... ... by then you've almost waited too long do we want we want you to we want you to think about it you know\nEverybody when they go out and they think about where they're going they think about what they're going to wear and\nUh maybe some folks how they're gonna style the hair and what they're going to you know how long we've got to be gone\n[noise] think about how you got to get home and they're too many safe ride the ride services and uh we're we're getting such great cooperation from people like lifting Hooper and a ... even the traditional taxi cabs they're not that much different than the cost of a taxi cab lot folks ...\nHad an aversion to it for some reason or another but um ... you know they're there and are designated driver and you know\nThere's some places a designated driver and they'll make sure he has a a coke or something like that a a you know in some some snacks throughout the night um\nDon't don't beat up somebody because they're being the designated driver you ought to be thinking though because they may be saving your life\nOr our stuff to to watch out for

haven't seen or heard much from FEMA or any government official\nAnd and so that's really the reason we're doing the show today there have been relatively recently some changes in law and so it's important that we revisit it so that listeners when they start to educate themselves they are actually thinking about things\nBased on the current state of the law right and they're using the right tool and applying the right you know\nAnd laws and we are publishing the YouTube after this goes live\nUm where like never mind [laughter] moving along we probably should\nUh make it clear that the law is constantly changing and child support so you may watch this or if you're not listening to it why we're playing it on the air and you're listening to it some time after the ...\nThe law may have changed since we've already day a change while we're doing the show [laughter] that's how they're raising would that be actually had a case where that the judge made a ruling and I want to know the way back to my office I emailed order where he changed his ruling cause the case it come out in the middle of our trial\nAnd so um and that resulted in him having to wasn't he was trying to be mean or you think the ... literally the new case changed the law\nDidn't follow most for no takes you back these [laughter] I'm Sorry judge you [laughter] know he did and I read about that somewhere [laughter] but I was a Latin term to act as a feedback America it is\nLet a so child support 'em I think a good way to start let's let's explain again Georgia child support and the reason I think this is important and why a refresher is is a good way to start even though we've done these shows even though there's a lot of content on line\nI Can't tell you how many times people call and I'll start talking to them and they'll say okay child support have you given that some thought and they're like oh yeah\nI've already won some calculations I applied twenty percent of the gross income of the father ah you know to it so I have a child or number and I have to say no hold on a pump the brakes a little bit because what you're doing is applying the law that really hasn't been in effect since two thousand seven\nUh there has been a major change we now have a a calculator and it's a whole new way hold new method of calculating child support so let's spend this first segment or at least some portion of it explaining the law you know generally speaking\nSo the law here in Georgia and there's many states that have converted to this how they calculate like this um where they it's a income sharing approach and that they what they do is they take the income of both parties\nThey combine that to a combined gross income now there's some states that do net income would that's not what we do here in Georgia we do a combined gross income and then that yields numbers self mom makes five thousand dollars a month and dad makes five thousand dollars a month is is gross\nOr before taxes [noise] and\nYou plug that it it makes ten thousand then you take it to what's called the basic child support guidelines and um and so the BCS so and that's actually in the work she where we want to that's where we don't have any more as the worksheet we've been doing that is one of the changes\nIn past there was a an excel spreadsheet and and so it would take that ten thousand dollars and I would say I don't remember what the number is off the top of my head 'cause that she does massive\nWho did not memorize it and so it might say well for ten thousand dollars combined grossing combined gross income with two children would be\nFifteen hundred dollars a month I don't know if it's ... it's I don't think it's that high so then you would take that and so since it was fifty fifty meaning as far as mom and dad made the same amount the dad would pay half of that to mom\nYeah that'd be hungry you're talking about the ... percentage and rival rabid percentages let's assume using your example fit you know five thousand five thousand ... combined that ten thousand\nEach party's percent you know portion of the combine growth is in that case fifty percent or if it was let's say six thousand and four thousand it would be a sixty percent forty percent and not pro rabbit percentage carries along in the child support worksheet and in and it applies to the guidelines\nAnd becomes very important so when we're taking the combined income and looking at each person's share what percentage that percentage it becomes incredibly important so yeah that's what you're talking about what the the pro rather share\nYes so and we'll say it was a thousand dollars a month and\nYou would split it he would be responsible for fifty percent direct line of rather ... fifty percent of the ... of the total number and how that changes I mean so that can go up and down from there so there is like\nThat sort of the basic level and then it can go it changes based on who's paying health insurance and dental insurance and some of these are mandatory changes some are more at the discretion of the court and so you also have\nWhat's the other um gosh there's so\nMany low income deviations high income deviation\nOne other mandatory one is in childcare so al ... childcare related to work yes\nAnd so that goes in that's mandatory yep so that goes in there now or\nYou may not have so let's say there isn't childcare but you've got extra curricular activities best discretionary so meaning the court does not have to put it in there and there's a portion of the child support that is presumed to go towards\nThe extracurricular activities and it's something like ... percent\nSomeday it's seven it's about seven percent you're right yeah I yeah and so what that means just to clarify a little bit\nBecause we'll have people do call and they'll say well hold on one second yes I'm getting the general child support but\nWhat about activity costs what about you know the soccer or what about you know whatever it might be\nAnd what we have to explain is that there's already built into that child support number mhm about seven point something percent of that number is supposed to be used by the custodial parent the one who is receiving child support to pay for some of those expenses now if the expenses exceed\nThen that's one thing that can be brought to the court's attention and a an additional deviation upwards could be requested in order to help pay the costs of those expenses\nAnd then there's also upper deviations because that BCS so the the child support chart should ah it stops at thirty thousand dollars yeah\nAs once you hit that that doesn't keep going but then the court can make a discretionary a call and award more child support for someone that makes more than whenever situation with a combined gross income is more than thirty thousand dollars a month right\nAnd we had a show talking about that where\nPeople were asking for a ridiculous amount fifty thousand dollars on a hundred thousand a young child I'm among among [noise] yeah that makes you want to go out and have a child with somebody\nVery well [laughter] I I Love you honey by where the ... yeah\nUm yeah so so look child support the income share model very different than what it used to be ...\nAnd the good thing about it is it's very formulaic the old way of calculating it there was eight percent range and you would apply to the gross income here everything it's it's a big formula you take gross income gross income plug it in plug in some other data\nAnd it's going to spit out a a a number is going to tell you what child support should be yes and actually it's not what it should be\nIf there's not a valid discretionary or or reason wired deviation mhm than the court must follow the guidelines that the court must accept that number and will demand\nThat the numbers are correct or not ever as if it says shops where it's a thousand dollars and you and your spouse look at each other and you're like well just in the eight hundred\nNo ports gonna look at you and say unless there is a valid deviation yeah\nIt's a thousand dollars okay that's that's the legal requirement\nThat I've seen judge I ... I've been in court when judges rejected a settlement proposal that did not follow the guidelines so there wasn't a valid basis for the deviation and the court rejected the settlement falls on the parties had to go back to the ... table so All right\nWell up next we're going to get into what\nActually change with a child support guidelines and how it's different\nNow and how those changes can impact several people they're going through the transport system trying to get jobs [noise]\n\n[noise] what the hell is this little coming to Ocala, Florida there's a Florida agricultural science teacher around to frack\nAnd a half in front of his and he will face criminal charges because investigators say the ... or any who may forgive my Brooks weekdays new ... new top one oh six seven\nGuys are bedroom troubles killing your sex life I'm rally I with health gains solutions regained your sex life with gains wave a revolutionary medical treatment\nThat's how the sanction it's painless requires no shots and no pills you can be spontaneous again\nGains away with a scientifically validated therapy that restores the poor blood flow causing ... for more information against way bucket dot com that's gains wave ... dot com or call for oh four four hundred forty eight hundred rich is on\nHis chest to run a really really good guy and determine good egg isn't enough to describe but he's also certified organic\nAnd free range rich puts the cat\nBack on everything the toothpaste and the olive oil and the shame who every say hey let's just ten year old nephew beat him in virtual tennis even though he constrained of slay ten year old nephew [noise] when the toilet paper is running low\nI mean they in a bad play in a bad place where they couldn't afford food and it couldn't even afford food when the children came over to visit with them and so being the federal office of child enforcement they're like well we don't want to be putting people in jail or behind because they're trying to stay alive\nSo they they told the Georgia or basically there's said to the legislature you've got to analyze this and so they put in a rule that the court should ... should actually start should shall consider the basic stuffs ... sub systems needs of the parents\nSo it's it's an obligation to the court does not discretionary\nYeah and again it makes sense because you know what the court wants is at the end of the day with court once is a child or children to be taken care of right pushing someone financially into basically a a no win situation where they don't have enough money to live\nThat's not ultimately going to help a child mhm you know ... pushing financially pushing that person off the the ... the proverbial cliff\nThat's gonna hurt that person which in effect you know the ripple effect is it's going to then impact that person's children All right so what what I I actually like the rule because what it's saying is come on\nLet's look at reasonable factors let's look at and considered reasonable information to make sure that this is is a winning kind of arrangement\nAnd by winning I mean everybody involved with\nAnd up next we're going to find out what the courts can do when considering computing income for someone who doesn't have a job\n[noise]\nShelley winter show where governor deal comes just hawk watching\nVery carefully to make sure that those who are campaigning not advocating that we destroy the progress that we have ... ...

learn more about us you can always call or check us out on line Atlanta divorce team dot com [noise]\nWell today we're talking about child support particularly we're talking about the changes the recent changes in the child support law there were several changes made this year uh some will impact people dramatically but others not so much other than sort of situation so it's more a matter of convenience\nBut um I mean definitely the ability for the court to uh except multiple worksheets as as a big help of a child's going to a job in a couple of years\nBut one of those things that that has always been a hot item is in ... income so and Putin income is where someone\nYou know some people they're just dead these I mean that's the term I'm putting this in their quote right now um they\nThey'd been heard to say I'll I'll quit my job and live in a box before I pay your child support so we literally had those cases where someone was foolish enough to put it in writing [laughter] so what happens is the court has the ability and those situations to say\nSir or ma'am costing both you have the ability you have the intelligence to go out and earn this much money and I'm going to put your child support obligation at that\nAnd yet implication is basically the way I like to refer to it it's a judicial assumption mhm it's it's basically the\nCourt saying okay I don't know how much you are earning or maybe I Know you're earning nothing right now but I'm going to now make an assumption\nThat you are either unemployed voluntarily or your voluntarily under employed right meeting a doctor who just loves to dance and says I'm\nI'm going to make my money Dan's on the street and making you know ten dollars a day and of course Hugo you better dance a lot because I'm going to assume that you're still a doctor that you could still learn at a doctor's level and therefore I'm shooting income at a doctor's income right All right so ...\nAnd ... basically to prevent people from trying to take advantage and gain the system\nYeah by saying I Am going to avoid a support obligation by limiting or eliminating my income\nRight in some situations you had cases where\nSomeone had parents that could support them so they said well I'm just I'm not going to work or they get remarried or inheritance inheritance and are in Idaho ... yeah I don't have any income I I'm living in a million dollar home but I don't have the income somehow mind paying for my car that is worth a hundred and twenty\nThousand dollars but and if I were a game show host I Would say survey says [laughter] no [laughter]\nAh All right so one of the changes in the chance for guidelines were ... was really a clarification what was going on so in the past the court just said that the court or the jury\nCould um [noise] that they could look at\nReliable evidence of a person's income or ability earn and they've changed it and that clarified it greatly so they've added a lot more very specific things that the court can look at\nYou know which which before you read off which again this list that you're about to read these are things that attorneys have been arguing in court for a long time right okay so so to\nPeople who practice okay like us\nUm and a lot of this is not knew what it is it's nice to see it\nSet forth in the law because basically it it it gets some of the ... some of the requirements and and get things out of that gray area where it's like well what can the court look out what should the court looked at so basically I Believe that this is sort of a clarification intended to say to the courts and two attorneys\nAnd to anybody representing himself and anybody else who's a board um no but\nIt's basically saying okay here you go these it's not an exhaustive list but here's a list of things\nThis is what the court should be looking at when determining issues of invitation\nSo here's a list so it's like look at the parents' assets like I said example for the house residence or maybe assets that could be a retirement account an arrogance but their residence their employment and earnings history\nOr their job skills educational attainment literacy age health criminal record and other employment barriers to so that actually is new employment barriers um and we will talk about that as well as the criminal record in the second because that was not in there that's a big change\nA record of seeking work as well as the local job market the village and that's I think that clarification is big too because I just\nI don't know if they ignored it per se but [noise] they didn't consider the job market change\nUm availability of employers willing to hire the parent prevailing in earnings level and the local community and other relevant background factors in the case and we're going to have Russia going to have someone come on the show here soon and that's one of his jobs he's a vocational expert and he actually gathers all that data\nSo that you could argue that perhaps a parent is under employed or they're actually making the best they can make so we asked I'm looking forward to that show are\nSo yes so some going through some of these just very quickly because like you said we're going to have a show dedicated to this issue you know things like educational attainment and work history and things like that\nIt cuts both ways keep in mind this is not focused only on the the pay or spouse right ...\n... the the because we are now in a situation where it's an income share my\nSo these new guidelines are say hey the court's got to take into consideration the ability of his parents actually pay because the process of throwing them in jail made things worse\nAll right so that's that and um the other quick changes were the changes to the health insurance requirement that isn't there a that allows parents to now use Medicaid or peach care to satisfy the health care needs of the child because the court could the mandate that\nI'm In the court continues to have the discretion to order that either or both parents obtain a separate health insurance policies for the children\nAnd then there's the low income deviations or we can already talked about that to give it gets a little more specific and that the court may consider the non custodial parents basic subsistence needs and all of his or her reasonable have three reasonable expenses\nWhich I'm not a huge turnaround when dealing with child support ... because I can tell you that the advice that we gave for ever was your budget really doesn't mean anything yeah and now we have to start saying your budget may mean everything yeah All right\nNow I Want to put a cautionary tale there that doesn't mean\nThat you can go around driving say well my mortgage is four grand a month my car payment for my brand new Porsche is Fifteen hundred dollars a month um you know I've got I've got a clothing allowance or you know you can't those the court will say that's not reasonable\nWell and that's the the focus should be on the word make words may consider yes we're not saying that you know we'll look my fourth Porsche [laughter] I got to tell you that they it's just my costs are through the roof [laughter]\nThat's not reason like you said ... though the court will consider it\nAnd will consider it to be a ridiculous position to take yeah ah so but it's what what may or can the court consider when determining these child support them out and and whether a deviation is reasonable\nAnd so as long as you have a reasonable carp and reasonable how mean reasonable everything you can show the court judge look at my budget I'm not doing anything\nUnreasonable trying to have a car to get to work you have to have a house for when the kids come see me and at the end of the month\nI don't have to Nichols to rub together and you're telling me that I should have basically three or four hundred dollars more than I think I can pay okay fine I just tell me when I can check into jail right so so anyway All right let's get to an example\nUh on oh let's talk first very quickly about and make sure that we're clear that there is now we are an on line work she\nWrites on the past there was an excel spreadsheet that you could download from um the child support office here in Georgia but they've done away with that um I'm not I don't remember the exact reason but I think we know someone that we bring on the show to explain it to us that will be another show a but\nStarting September thirtieth of two thousand Eighteen all lit against must present their transport

S L C ... is a forty eight thousand dollars based on your research\nSo what do you do\nAnd when that made a little ... [laughter] so what do you do Todd [noise]\nUh well uh go out and\nBuy yourself a Mercedes right [laughter] for tat I'm All right\nAll right so what do you do a well obviously what were the only child support you have a minute to talk about this we're going to have to\nLook at what her income is but then we're going to look at spending I can tell you right now we're going to end up looking at credit card statements and bank records and things like that because you're right a forty thousand dollar car with that kind of income doesn't make sense right then we have to look to see whether or not there's an argument for amputations is she getting on a regular basis\nSome amount of money from another source\nThat we can ask the court to consider as a part of her income if she got a single gift from someone maybe not if she gets every year gifts then maybe so and and ... then becomes a reality in that case so going back\nTo the new child support the new guidelines one of the first things just as a parents' assets so brand new forty eight thousand dollar car\nWould be an asset that the court can say well I'm an ad forty eight thousand dollar so your annual gross income is more like a hundred thousand dollars and fifty two thousand dollars well everyone thanks so much for listening about ... the show\nAnd we look forward to talking to you next time this audio program\nDoes not establish an attorney client relationship with Mary whether it's on [noise]\n\nThe police eating is a pain program does not necessarily represent their views or opinions on TALK one oh six seven or cumulus media program was paid for by Mary whether in ...

Donald Trump says you can have um they're yours now [laughter]\nI Know [laughter] or you know we're just waking up the sport is still dark hair but we're assessing a lot of the damage I tell people listen to the white I Know a lot of people down here to vacation Yes sir a destination\nBut ... uh we have just minor ... damage at all but uh on the bay itself a week\nLike I said we had a several boats break from their their cradle isn't there more and so they're going to stress that this morning but it's a head further east of course the damage gets much worse in fact ah Panama City Mexico beach were kind of ground zero on this thing and that kind of go beat\nTotally destroyed\nThe pictures from last night before they can get in there uh it looked like Mexico beach which is floating in the\nGulf of Mexico so uh uh it's quite go ahead go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead it's quite devastating to say the least\nI I have a question the Panama City and Mexico beach oh these\nUm but because you said you said earlier I Know that's an eye honeymooned in Destin and just kind of high end I guess if you will um Panama City in Mexico beach or those more middle class lower middle class working poor areas where are the same as destined\nNo attorney ... you're you're right on its more middle class a now Mexico beach is one of the last beaches down here\nTo be developed so will you go to Mexico beach you're basically going to a beach or what everything else looked like a back in the Nineteen fifties so or not now no high rises no uh no no restaurants and it's still pretty\nUh like I said the fifties sixties early fifties sixties so I'm a ... in my city is kind of the same way so yes you would be right up there\nGotcha so does that impact the people because I've got some sound of people from Panama City\nAnd Mexico beach that was going to play after um we let you go I'm a people that stayed does that impact why people stay is because of financial struggles that they're going through and why they don't leave what do people just think that the tougher tougher Lynn came for a category for hurricanes gives me\nWhat do you have to understand most people in those areas have been in this area for all their life okay under there and and their and their relatives have been there all their life\nSo yes we've had other storms they weren't as intense they may have been a one or two but nothing like this has ever hit that area so people are saying we've been through this before\nI think we can handle it now that being said nobody thought this was going to be a category for actually it was only one mile an hour away from being a category five surrounding the magic when that thing hit over there it hit at a hundred and Seventy five miles an hour wind and it was sustained for about ... a good hour so uh\nI think that's the reason why most of them stay is because you know uh and if you know Florida you're do or what we call oh Florida all the people that have lived here before\nUm ah they just you know they say you know we've been through this our grandparents have been through this and we can we expect this thing out\nSo what happens next is it passes because we've we've seen rain here in the metro Atlanta area or we saw a\nHigh winds I guess not hurricane force winds last night but very strong winds last night we had a lot of rain yesterday\nIn the early evening four o'clock around four four thirty and it's it kept going most of the night into this morning when I was on my way to work um tapering off a little bit in the next hour so what does it look like down there it was it passes it over and now the rebuilding starts\nRight absolutely everything pretty much a\nNormal day waiting for you want to talk about a normal day it's a little cooler than expanding it always been in a\nTerrible heat wave down here in the south for the past uh I'll actually too much but ah right now it's cool the Windsor are calm about six miles an hour or so the weather today is going to be absolutely beautiful sunny skies\nUm then again you have to deal with what's on the ground and not what's in the sky\nRight exactly now how does this I Know you're a meteorologist I Know that the weather is what you guys do but I Want to ask this question because we do talk politics here how does this impact\nOn the local races I Know a Gillum is the mayor of Tallahassee was Tallahassee hit\nTallahassee was hit and uh I haven't heard anything about the damage in Tallahassee but uh yeah they got to hit the uh they were mostly on the left side of the storm when it came through so\nUh I'm not sure how bad Tallahassee is right now I'm Still waiting to get you know the assessment wants the uh\nUh the the light comes up but uh it went straight up through a through Georgia south Georgia and then right took a turn I Believe right now it's in the Senate dust a movie that way and it's going to go out to uh\nTo the Atlantic and and and fall apart so but uh I'm not sure about Tallahassee we're still waiting on that you understand too that a lot of these places are are still without power so okay\nThe only people in our allowed or are or the or a National Guard in the I'm a rescue officials so we're still waiting to get the assessment all\nUnderstood and and the reason why I asked is because Rick Scott as governor I think I've\nI maintain and I wanted to ask us again you're meow meteorologist and really don't talk politics but do you think this will impact his performance at the polls the way in which he handles the rebuild or the uh the um you know how how they come out of this a hurricane in the next few days\nYou know I don't know that I Know the election is or what three weeks away four weeks away um I can tell you that the governor was a absolutely spot on before this thing happen the way he\nPleaded with everybody to get out and and most most people did get out they left um uh it's it's a it's a ghost town right now so uh I don't really get into politics but uh you know\nI think the governor for everybody's a sake as far as their safety and are doing what he's supposed to do as the governor he did a spot on job\nAwesome a

official meteorologist of the great might Brooke show Hey Ryan how're you doing brother\nI'm doing excellent how are you this morning I'm\nWonderful I think he's so much for joining us I wanted to get you on the line to talk about the local impact of a Michael I've been saying this morning we had heavy winds last night or Wayne is tapering off but what are what are the impacts that you're seeing around the state I'm as the hurricane blows through\nHere let me a list of some of the uh confirmed wind gusts that we've had a from Michael are the highest actually at the Atlanta Airport a forty mile per hour wind gusts so far I'm a National Weather service there was\nOne word at Michael\nA that was a the time a weapon fifty two last night wow okay\nSo in the middle of night we had our strongest wind gust of a forty mile per hour winds and then a Stone Mountain had a forty five miles per hour ... sustained wind but I have a feeling they're censor was up on top of the mountains so that's kind of a little skewed although I Would say that\nYeah I think the Atlanta Airport forty miles per hour wind gusts and also in Athens confirmed forty miles per hour wind gusts now\nNow what is that there is that just a tropical storm is that how is that the wind gusts of a tropical storm\nYes that is tropical storm force winds um so I I Would say that the warnings that were in place um they did a very good job of kind of slicing it and it verified I'm kind of a very close to what we were anticipating you know we did have\nTo tornado warnings yesterday one right here in in town National Weather service will go out and survey the damage shuts down in East Point and then down in Crawford county which is twenty six miles southwest of making a there was a tornado they are uh yesterday as well\nWho um who can I ask you when you say there was a tornado in East Point so there's the what's that mean didn't touch down and was how does that cause I heard nothing about that until you just said that just now there was a tornado in East Point\nThere is a possible tornado in East Point so reason why we weren't as possible as we have confirmed damage our reporters on the scene of that damage right now\nThere was a tornado warnings issued for each point yesterday uh between six thirty and seven PM um and what the National Weather service does is if you don't get a picture or somebody who cites the tornado\nThey have to wait until the next day or the day after to go out and survey the damage and then they can from it whether it was a tornado or if it were straight line wins\nUnder um but all signs\nAre pointing towards that was a brief spin up tornado 'em down towards East Point because I'm a reporter showed in uprooted trees which right off the bat that tells me you know that uh the winds are strong enough that's very tornado a torn addict like when we get damaging wins the trees snap\nAnd half get tornados the trees uprooted\nSo they're just literally pulled out of the ground correct ... okay that's interesting that makes total total sense now what are we looking at today for our weather what Ken my listeners expect and they're not only their commute on the way to work with the commute home\nNear the commute to work is rough out there I mean I Know we're talking about some standing water on some of the main roads and even the highways interstate\nUm so it's it's a rough morning commute in that regard but the ride home is going to be full sunshine a and B a rival of fall like temperatures it really it's going to be amazing how quickly we go from a gloomy start to a plenty of sunshine and and we moved\nThen to a a nice fall like weather pattern that I Know everybody has been anxiously awaiting but you know it's a kind of hard to look a bit optimistic towards that when you know all this devastation just happened it's kind of suck the energy out of all the excitement of the air with with fall returning\nBut it will return 'em\nAs soon as this morning in some areas in the ride home looks absolutely gorgeous I'll have my windows down I guarantee\nThat I got the high here about Seventy six degrees today\nYeah that's right right um and our some of our warmer temperatures are actually happening right now I'm at because the ... going to be moving through um you know mid day in early afternoon and why is that from moves through it's going to be a surgeon cooler air rolling in behind it and tomorrow are waking up in the forties and fifties\nWow so we're we're in the fall now Bob are yesterday we were talking about hurricane Michael coming yesterday on my show and I was reading the weather reports and I told my listeners that old southern in central Georgia will see the brunt of the rain and the\nWind and so forth but then last night I'm at my\nHouse around for thirty five o'clock I'm headed to an event in Douglas bill and\nIt's pouring down rain and I'm saying wow I just kind of told my listeners something that it is totally different what happened was the path of hurricane different or why do we get hit with so much rain and wind when they kind of said they that wouldn't happen to metro area to the metro area\nRight so uh the word I had mentioned in what we're kind of anticipated was one to four inches across uh as far as their range across our entire viewing area I Will level with you I Will say\nThat ah areas in metro north and west\nGot a little bit more rain that what we're anticipating right I'm fine I'm fine with it you know being honest with that but it was on the higher end you know Atlanta\nA storm total is three point seven five inches of rain so far and I don't think that number's going to change 'em and we did have a tornado warning in Atlanta which we weren't supposed to have a tornado warning that far south\nAnd I even had some comments that okay you said that we were going to be on the left side of the storm the website is usually safer less impact\nAnd it almost seems like the opposite with this storm well\nYou know uh and the grand scheme of things that were in perspective I think a lot of people were kind of caught off guard of all this actually was a little bit worse than what I was in dissipating\nRight but when you look down towards making your familiar which corps deal to ... a watermelon capital of the world\nIs too harsh when referring to groups of angry protestors to take a listen to this exchange on bravo Baldwin show\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a laugh when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use\nThem on our whole area totally oh without a doubt\nThat there's no other were mad mad mad mad paid off Matt somewhat\nOn the mom is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia August cigar no I'm not I have not what we saw chasing me right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls\nWhat do you call that civil protest or is that a mob I think it's easily um all yeah and if it were the party as we call it a ... come on my piece area living now let me let me move past the N. word\nShe oh Vietnam worms you know pretty Bobby [laughter]\nSo now mob is the more\nWe can say the N word hula who\nThe hell does broke Baldwin thing she is the arbiter of uh of all definitions of what a crowd is\nLet me tell you something I've been\nI I I've been attacked by mobs as a cop bricks bottles rocks thrown at me\nThey were among the people at the Supreme Court what what do you think tell me what you think a mob\nIs Charlottesville yeah\nYou had a mob of white supremacists and you have um had a mob of other people that were intent on concerning them they were both a mob I don't care what side of the fence you are on\nThey were a mom you know\nWe do we call them or you\nSay their mom and oh no you can't call them a mob\nOh that's that's just terrible oh\nSo Senate names for mob crowd hoard multitude rival mess so wrong group gang gathering assembled edge\n[laughter] [noise] oh\nAnd\nI told you that the definition of mob as a noun a large crowd of people especially one that is disorderly get intent on causing trouble or violence so was that in Charlottesville on both sides\nIt was a mop it was a month\nAnd then as a verb it's\nCrowd around someone in an unruly and excitable way in order to admire or or attack\nThem quote he was mobbed by autograph on her so it can go either way it can be you could use it as a now or you can use it as a verb it's a very nice word I think ... play play ...\nBut again I I just just just piss me off\nI'm Sorry I I'm an old by the way I I Know some people might be why do you know I'm just I'm just plain you the truth and and for them to say all the\nAnd we can't take a ...\nI Believe it's the overreaction of a laugh when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the mob or however it's totally a mock it is without\nA doubt that there's no other we're now it's a you know put up a mom and pop shop and went on the mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August cigar no I'm not I think not what we saw chain thing I'd like I think we've right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls what do you call that civil protest or is that a mob I think if he is the way I'm all\nYeah and if there was he partiers would call it a ... come on let's be serious [laughter] running that let me let me let me move past the N. word\nOh let me move past him were because you know she's wrong she has she has no defense\nAt all\nHow can you how how can you possibly defend\nThe word mom being used for the for the for the protesters the group of of protestors at the Supreme\nCourt trying to rip the bronze doors please please\nWell I'm very very heavy heavy ... let's go ahead Gary state enlisted in the hand to hand that's\nBasically what she's handling but we can't use the N word just moved I you know we don't see you know [laughter] the pride of Westminster Republican kennel club ha no be nice\n[laughter] she's a beautiful woman ... line was like\nYou're a mob ghetto club you your

because I'm concerned that if a mistake is made there's going to be a problem so I don't really like this particular track but\nYeah there are ways out there that it can be done\nVery very important item and you know over the years on Monday talk or for our regular listeners and we thank you for that by the way while we're on the thought\nSo many of our listeners over the years have called about rip offs and I was reading an article this weekend in the New York times about this very topic a very good article that appeared in the Saturday New York times and it really\nIs a cautionary tale for those of you involved with for example with your parents money\nMaybe involving business with the brokerage and how many times where we had color on money talks has talked about this very topic where they have a problem\nThis particular story that I reference and I recommend to money talkers\nInvolves a brokerage account at a major US Bank you know a lot of the banks have brokerage arms so this account was at one of those brokerage arms the details are named in the article\nSo\nThe daughter of of the individual that was the focus of the article the daughter of that individual found that there was unusual activity in her mother's account was she was overseeing and had been overseeing in recent years\nAnd one of the things that caught our attention\nWas that the account dropped one hundred thousand dollars and just one month\nDuring that period while the market was increasing most of this money was in the market despite the fact that her mother was in her eighties which doesn't make a lot of sense to me but that's what the article says and I'm sure that was the case so the account was\nVery very heavily in the stock market despite the advanced age of the owner the account\nSo the daughter hire counsel hired a forensic accountant or a forensic consultant and one of the other and they found commissions any account for the year\nOf one hundred twenty eight thousand dollars\n\nOne hundred twenty eight thousand in commission's charge to the ... the year which was about ten percent of the total value\nOf the you know\nThere's some out being paid out in commissions in a relatively short period of time\nWell what happened was most of the portfolio had been sold out and then the money to reinvest it and of course the commission's piling up on all of these transactions and in one month alone they found three hundred forty four trades\nThis is really staggering and it's real and these were in the unsolicited category well unsolicited means directed by the customer but of course that was not true the the mother of this daughter was not directing these trades in any way shape or form\nAlso another thing they found when they did their forensic work was pieces of stock we're being sold in small watch so if you had a thousand shares you might sell Seventy five than a hundred and twenty five and so on and so on even in the same day\nAnd of course that can pile up the commission says well sometimes the commission's can be larger on usually they are larger on the smaller lots\nSit ups the commission costs as well another thing they found was that was a margin account which allows you to borrow money to invest more well you don't do that when you're in your rabies and if you really smart you don't do it at all\nSo as the article describes there was a settlement was reached but obviously the overall result of this was kind of ugly and unpleasant\nAnd this is something that's common excessive an unauthorized trading are among the top complaints in customer arbitration and this is according to the financial industry regulatory authority ...\nAnd the FCC has issued an alert about churning they call this churning when you're excessively trading and account\nThey issued a warning just last year on this so this is something to be aware of if you have elderly parents and you're wondering what is going on with an account they may have been a brokerage or whatever or the bank workers as in this case it's something to be aware\nOf because I'll tell you why I said this the sharks are always swimming the shark swim twenty four

are on we ... we are on a ... a different schedule but we are on KBC Los Angeles you'll have to check the station for the schedule that they keep yes we are on gay bc\nBut not live um sometime sometimes did yesterday is sometimes\nOkay great listen I have a ... I'm retiring next year\nOr have about four hundred and fifty K. and um some fun that I wanted to invest in number three ... number three\nAnd um I I wanted to find out when you talk about dollar cost averaging One Fund that size you typically suggests you know four five six pieces um per dollar cost averaging\nAnd at the at the back a little bit of a background you know we just passed this last week the longest running a bull market passing up yeah nineties\nAnd that's why in just repeating based on your mark where October letter or a year ago\nTrenches interim head back this year and so I took advantage that thank you very much a Dutch help pay for the you know the letter many many times over a but anticipating a market a topic and the next that you say the next year year and a half\nUm dollar cost averaging watch that many comedy a\nPeach should I be putting my money into our apple you know how should it be breaking up into\nWell uh when would you be doing this investing right now\nI Would be doing it within the next month or two\nI Would say or muddle through on a fixed income side of the portfolio that um I don't\nI don't regard need right now and the central need per dollar cost averaging on a fixed income side\nAnd the reason I say that as we've largely inoculated that fixed income side of the portfolio by selecting a short duration portfolio assets in fact our average duration on a fixed income so I Know is less than one year\nAnd so with an average duration of less than one year and the current ... portfolio in terms of the interest income stands that a little bit over three percent\nI think we've covered the basis on that side of the portfolio we're getting nice yield in terms of the current income and we are reduced the duration down to a\nVery very low level on equity side really that comes down to your tolerance for risk to some degree because the fact of the matter is that um\nIf you're going to a dollar cost averaging money and you want to do it in a way where if something goes awry in the market you're not going to panic and do something that's going to be counterproductive so I Would move but then on a schedule that you're comfortable with in terms of of your tolerance for risk and I think that would be the key in terms\nOf how you'd be moving that money and you're absolutely right we're looking at a market that is basically the longest bull market all cyclical bull market ever were nine and a half years and so are there had been times to get really excited about putting money in the market\nUh I remember the a secondary by signal we had a secondary means we were fully invested so it applies to those looking for an opportunity we had a great a while and awesome secondary by signal\nIn I'm back in two thousand eleven\nBack in September of two thousand eleven yes be five hundred was in the low eleven hundreds I mean this things than the twentieth hundreds now so that was an awesome by signal we had back in September of two thousand eleven and a and I remember also we had a a terrific\nSecondary by signal because we were already fully invested so this is for those looking for that opportunity that exceptional opportunity and that occurred again\nIn um February of two thousand sixteen for crying out loud the SP five hundred was in the Eighteen hundreds or talking about an index is than twenty hundreds now\nIt was in the Eighteen hundreds in February of two thousand sixteen when again we had a second revised signal\nSo I mean they were fantastic opportunities\nBut but they don't come along every day opportunities like that don't come along every day so um I mean even people that dollar cost average money into the market in two thousand Eighteen at the at the lowest level we've seen\nThey were still in the twenty six hundred area\nThe lowest closing level we've seen in two thousand Eighteen\nWas only in the twenty six hundred area no big deal we're in the twenty eight hundreds so those kinds of opportunities that we saw in September of two thousand eleven with the S. and P. five hundred trading in the low eleven hundreds wow that's a buying opportunity big time\nUh and the kind of opportunity we saw in February of two thousand six team with the S. and P. five hundred trading in the Eighteen hundreds well that was a terrific buying opportunity for ...\nBut you know when you're talking about what's happened in two thousand Eighteen yeah there was a ten percent pulled back in the S. and P. five hundred but you know how long that lasted\nNine days that entire ten percent correction in two thousand Eighteen back in January February that lasted a total of nine days so\nFor legal services skew view oh the IRS back taxes payroll taxes for them not filed you

where it's all about the money that's getting out to Algonquin, Illinois Wally welcome\nOh Bob [laughter] I um I have a grandson who was\nSixty just turned sixteen and uh I Would like to get him investing in the stock market um he's got hit an ... you just received the ... of around twenty five grand\nAnd they had a savings account prior to that but he saved up to like Fifteen hundred bucks over a long period of time and I would have been full of paper work out you know so it so he was doing something I Would like to have\nTo know uh I was thinking about fidelity or or um or one of the uh the scope stock of says where you can get information but the help him do\nThe you know do the actual trade when it comes to talk about it together and try to pick the right one and then start investing some of the money's got\nWhat we mean I think I think it's a good idea I think that to me only need a three thousand dollars to open a a a personal personal account how old is the youngster\nSixty\nYeah okay well you want to have it ... through may yeah OK\nYeah through a custody custody accountant actually yeah yesterday initially but then he'll get to be Eighteen example you\nCan anyway [laughter] so I was just\nA ... ... ... so he doesn't get tempted with the with the money you know [laughter]\nWell I I think that it's fairly easy for a personal account for example but probably about three thousand dollars a vanguard probably about twenty five hundred dollars or so that the devil to be the first one that I Would\nBuy would be to get started would be a double the marked in total stock market index or vanguard till the stock market index depending on which company go to but I think that's a great way to get started and then they can dollar cost averaging as you wish is going forward\nI think the only caviar is that you know as you going to need money\nIf he's going to need money going forward then you know he's in a position where he has an investment accounts indication stock market which certainly tends to fluctuate as we know\nAnd so there should be money that he really is investing a on a longer term basis I think as as it gets started move as opposed to a money that he's actually going to need to go forward while you appreciate the call bill is in Missouri bill it's your turn\nA thank you for taking my call I'm trying to determine the best way to withdraw money from investments when I retire I'd like to tell you the two approaches I'm considering the first one would be to take four percent of my investments each year\nStarting with non IRA one ... gone go to regular IRA and then brought fire right approach number two would be to take all of my interest dividends and capital gains\nAnd then if I have money left at the end of the year I Would reinvest\nIt does that make sense\nWell I think it makes a lot of sense for you\nTo collect your interest and your dividends against that four percent withdraw guideline that you're starting with because I think what you're going to find is you will you will have some years\nWhere the some of your interest and dividends and capital appreciation could exceed that four percent figure and certainly I Would reinvest that money if that happens there'll be there'll be other years when they match up very closely\nThere could be other years where your dividends and you're interested in your capital gains a dumped him up to the four percent of what you in which case you can\nA small number of shares in order to get to that ... percent a year but I think that that should work okay I Would say that I'm not sure that uh I liked the idea of putting the traditional\nA tax brokerage account before the raw tax pros you know because the money you take from the raw tax revenues to his tax free if you follow the rules so I think we do a slight change there I'd probably priority to prioritize the personal money\nAnd then I'd probably use the raw money and then lastly I'd probably use the traditional money because that's going to be taxed you take it out\nOK and reverse the order of those too but I wouldn't actually tap into any of that uh until one of those years when I didn't get

Bush the president major proposal right to to invest a small portion of the Social Security fund in the stock market if that had been done that would have done extremely well\nBecause he made that proposal when the stock market was at lower levels much lower levels a door during his two terms so if they had taken up that idea the\nPlaced a small portion in the stock market which would have to be indexed then uh that money would have done extremely well unfortunately Congress which can't seem to agree or how many days in the week there are any more they just didn't get there simply dysfunctional they're incapable of govern\nWhat maybe there was that the condition on talking about is that that money cannot be touch on Social Security retirement age and maybe the concern that passed laws\nThat money has got to be touch prior to that is the risk and the stock market but also this money couldn't be invested and I'm thirty or so the U.S government\nUh or twenty five or ... which would be it would give certain uh returns\nWell they all ready invest a lot of the money in it and they already invest the money and the equivalent of us treasuries right now they do that right now\nBut I thought it's all I Do you I thought that\nMoney you know the yeah but that they consider it the equivalent\nBecause that's the rate of interest that earns is the equivalent to run it it earns the market rate of interest one has invested yes you're yes you're right there's no money there the whole thing is a\n... year right now because you know why because all the money is getting all more and more and eventually all of the money is getting paid out of the the people who are currently working paying Social Security tax and then they take that money and they pay it after the beneficiaries and that's where we're headed\nAnd so the whole thing is a under the unified budget\nThere's no question about it the whole concept of a trust fund with money out there\nYeah it's I always use you're absolutely correct but\nI don't see any any one first of all I don't see any one politically in Washington stepping up on this issue it's become the third rail of politics and they don't want to touch it they don't want to cut Medicare either\nA in terms of making those fiscally responsible they don't want to go near it on the other hand um I don't see the votes in Congress to get something done on this because they just are well they're totally dysfunctional and they've proven time and again\nThemselves they prove that themselves\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one it is on the line listening to the mighty WLS Chicago although it\nHell of objects in Chicago\nI got a a large portion of my money and money markets that are not covered by the icy and I'm trying to find a that is a problem the reason that I have the money and money market account or is that\nI'm not sure how long I'm going to live and I don't want to tie up my money you know a like a CD for a longer period of time or or even a shorter period of time so that it would be a hindrance to my ears\nAnd I'm Wondering if there would be a problem with keeping it in\nA money market at this point in time\nI think if you're with quality companies companies like a vanguard companies like fidelity any of the high quality companies I can only speak for myself I don't have a problem having money and money market funds because I'm worried about it uh but I mean you would have to speak for yourself on that issue as to whether you're comfortable with it\nOr there is another way for you to do this which is to just do in the short term treasury bills which could be liquidated or any time\nOkay\nYou could use for example if you owned Ninety One day treasury bills three month treasury bills than a\nThose monies can be liquidated at any time and they're perfectly safe or and or not only that the interest is exempt\nFrom um state and local tax so that's certainly something for you to consider you would not for example you would not have to pay\nOr the Illinois state income tax on interest you earned on a treasury bills so that might be an increased incentive for you to take a look at like ... or something like that and the rates have been increasing as the Federal Reserve continues to increase shorts or rich\nAnd so that certainly is something else was going on\nAnd I do appreciate the call\nAnd that was an interesting a speech that the fed chair Jerome Powell gave at\nJackson Hole Wyoming this week I Hope many of you had an opportunity to uh read parts of it or even more that you had the chance to go to the grand teeth odds and Jackson Hole Wyoming but uh there's no question about it that he has made it clear\nThat uh he's going to continue to watch inflation but he's not particularly upset about inflation right now\nAh and he certainly has made it clear that he's going to gradually increase short term interest rates until they get to some level of normal\nAnd um he he doesn't seem to be flicking in any way from the the program that he has set forth which he basically inherited from a from a chair Yellen his\nPredecessor which is to gradually increased rates of interest as the economy grows and as employment grows\nAnd as inflation remains manageable I think that would be a synopsis of his view and I think it's a view that's generally accepted at this juncture\nIf you'd like to join us on the toll free lie we'd like to hear from you one eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one that's our number one eight hundred Ninety

D. let her know if you're going to use the CD ... or you could use for example equal amounts of the three six nine and twelve month CD\nAnd by doing that you'd have a very short average duration your average duration and our portfolio is less than one year your average duration\nOn a three six nine twelve month she would be even less than a than the one that's in the portfolio which is already over one year and that would be another way that you could look at it in other words there are various ways\nIn a rising interest rate environment that you can go depends on how a wrist wrist tolerant you are if you're not risk tolerated at all\nThen to see the letter fully FDIC insured\nIs risk free is held the majority and that certainly is something to consider as well and that money market fund is also something to consider and we've included that as part of that portfolio let's get out to the great cayenne us radio Denver\nLawn is your return welcome\nBack five as for the time I waited for your ...\nThank you for holding on I Do appreciate your patience thinking\nIf I have two daughters my a fourteen year old I Need to do a college five twenty nine plan for\nAnd I have a hundred thousand set aside for that\nI'd like to know what would make up for lost time what would be the highest return a college spied for it I I Would recommend it then I have a twenty eight year old who she just finished\nHer medical school and I'd like to I heard in the long term IRA find which would you prefer\nWell I think that uh for the twenty eight year old certainly getting started a I Would look at something or with broad diversification and low expenses\nI Would recommend or that you consider starting with something like either the Fidel to the sport in total stock market index or the then go total stock market index they both have extremely low expense ratio is a minimal I Would consider the minimal not significant\nAnd they give you a broad diversification they give you tax efficiency so I think the total stock market index that either one of those out this would be a good place to start\nThank you that's within twenty eight year old for the fourteen year old where it's a little dicey because you're going to be writing college tuition checks\nIn about four years so you have to be a aware of that as well and so uh I think I Want to have some diversity in that portfolio um by that I mean I Want to have some liquid assets\nSome liquidity I mean in that portfolio\nOr at least by the time we get to the point where we're writing commission checked we can't make four year forecasts so in the market at least I can I don't have a four year forecast on the market\nUh so uh you know you have to consider is if you made a four year forecast on the market in Nineteen Ninety eight it probably would not have been they asked him the five hundred being an eight hundred right because it was in the mid teens there when we got around year two thousand\nSo making a four year for kids do more of the market's going to be as as a ... a activity but uh certainly I think at this point you have some time here\nWhere you should be able to um to hopefully benefit from having some money in the total stock market index in that account\nAnd uh I I Would just be sensitive to the fact that you don't want to get to the point where I let me ask you will you be writing tuition checks out of this account\n[noise]\nTo video camera show we have three to six finally Amanda ...

wanted to ask you a why did you write this book\nWell I think I'm a as a historian it was really striking how as the crisis struck in two thousand tonight a kind of ... and histories of the crisis began to be created by his by journalists by economists\nAnd I felt at some point that this was a really interesting\nKind of test case to show students are all sorts of different disciplines in fact how history is get created and having set myself to kind of read and study all the other people who bought and writing these histories of the crisis it felt\nI needed to kind of put it all together and work like this\nOne of the things it's always fascinating fascinated me about the financial crisis is the fact that I'm\nIn March of two thousand they you will know Bear Stearns and a gotten a lot of trouble and a wound up being bailed out in the end\nI'm with the help the Federal Reserve and a ... with the help of the major bank one of the things has always struck me is that uh I mean that was a really big deal that was a real shock wave for a\nFor Wall Street and for the Federal Reserve\nAnd uh\nAnd yet it really didn't serve the\nThe value of that warning shot across the bow so relatively soon in March of two thousand eight didn't really uh accomplish what it should have accomplished because All right they bailed them out and things move forward and\nAnd then things still disintegrated or within half a year ... what are your thoughts on that\nUp to the I mean the best to buy a bailout is one to this day at the most controversial elements really of the story because\nShowing up the cuts of what's known as the bowl has a point of view I think actually argue that the willingness of the fed to step in that environment and to broker a sweetheart deal for Jay people into type ...\nUm said the wrong message it made the chief executive and so on a limb and\nKind of picky about a deal for themselves it it made them feel that they had time ah to cut a deal that would really suit them so there was a real I think question mark about whether or not that a bailout as necessary as it seemed at the time because the risk was that bad would\nUm go bankrupt or be forced to engage in a fossil them than the huge losses would have to be recognized on other balance sheets\nThat bailout may have in some sense um in fact a heightened attention in the market because it's a loudly man ready to take far too long and occupy the Merrill Lynch is well thought too long about really deciding that future and they needed to take action or by\nOur guest is Adam twos Adam is joining us from

was made to ... leave and go\nAnd we've thrown out a lot of the excuses that were thrown out there that the Ben Bernanke excuse that well we didn't have the power to do anything which we threw out

Grillo with your guest is Adam who's professor at Columbia University and author of crashed into a decade of financial crises change the world we're taking your calls for ... overland\nOne eight hundred nine three four twenty to Twenty one let's get up to the great W. H. O. radio in Des Moines Dan you're on the line with Adam go ahead\nYeah Scott I'm completely been a ... this was one of the year two thousand and how\nPowerful mark communication seemingly create deflation or pressure on pricing price discovery let's see it all the time on television to see it all the crime on\nOn social media Twitter Facebook Amazon these are all mechanisms that are driving the price that act like they're stuck on the twentieth century they act like we don't know what the Internet really is when it comes to price perceptions election\nAnd are and how would the flights continuously while they can they scream inflation like no they're they're more a group that you're always on\nThe good life stretch into from their level so I I Can't believe nobody's called them out on it\n\nYeah I got that this was a I got to this was the topic at the Jackson Hole meeting this year the the the deflation repression from the Internet economy is obviously very real of this is the incredibly long upswing that we've had since two thousand nine no the exaggerated will fall on the many ways quite disappointing\nBut what's really remarkable about how little inflation repression there is in the system you see that on the wage side as well so I agree with you to speed I call it the shift in the world economy of the last Twenty years\nInternet is part of that story which you emphasizing but I also think you have to factor in this school season that connected with the into that story the role of the Chinese economy is a great manufacturing hub which is domestically pressed the cost of production down around the world\nSo this is I think that changing the game in terms of biology policy\nAnd yet professor there is a an intrinsic irony here that we would even for a moment the\nThinking gee I Wish there was more inflation\nYeah well that that's true ... on the other hand deflation is a very bad thing from the point of view of the credit driven economy\nAnd we don't have to look at Japan to see how to build a tightening that can be really sets into the system I will say from the point of view of handling you know an ever expanding volume of government that if\nYou look back historically for the Nineteen fifties or Nineteen sixties when economies like us in the u._k. with dealing with the debts accumulated during World War\nThey were paid back by very high levels of taxation they were paid by by high levels of growth but a key element in the story was also inflation running somewhat ahead of interest rates\nAnd that a is a century attacks on money values\nOr which helps to distribute the cost of paying for the war in that case paying for World War two across the entire population even though he's holding assets\nSay managing and economies with structurally love inflation and in fact a tendency towards the ... is a really difficult thing to do and it's actually ... novel it's a new problem and Japan is not exactly a promising example of how things might go\nOur guest is Adam Tuesday Columbia University whose new book is crashed we talk on the program um\nWe talk on the program at all about the fact as you will know that\nAre in a credit driven economy inflation is your friend in the sense that you're getting back your principal and depreciating dollars you're paying back your interest the depreciating dollars\nYeah just ... just briefly could you help our listeners understand a y ... in a credit driven economy is so painful in terms of what it does to Europe for example outstanding debt\nYeah I think the best way to look at this is the housing market I think that's where most of us understand this most intimately\nAnd you take out a mortgage on the property at one of the basic questions you've got your aunts or in your head as do I expect the value of this real estate to go up and\nAlmost all the details of done on the basis at least the ... the house will retain its value will probably appreciate to some moderate or perhaps greater extent if you're buying in San Francisco well Manhattan or somewhere like that\nAnd the entire basis of a deal this was true will say for the subprime deals the full two thousand tonight is that you'll have real price appreciation now did you have the reverse is if you have a sudden price full just the prospect of a long running sustain fold and prices\nThat hits your equity and of course it does absolutely nothing to the debt that you owe the mortgage doesn't adjust downloads\nSo in an upswing the price increase provides a huge benefit to leverage to investors who has to take it out to mortgage with a small amounts of equity they gain all the profits from the appreciation the reverse happens when you ... your situation\nI think insofar as the vast majority of people have most of the equity most of their assets most of their wealth in the real estate [noise] I don't miss the old and a very large part of that at least as leverage three mortgages to find yourself in a situation with prices falling is really a death now\nFor for households for consumers\nYeah and in a simple model one hundred thousand dollar property where you put twenty thousand dollars down if that if that property declines in price like ten thousand you've lost half your equity\nYeah it's a disaster absolute disaster\nOur guest is Adam twos in his new book crashed into a decade of
