yeah ... and apparently he asked his wife for a separation and then we're assuming that's what started some kind of a fight and that's when the police believe me just killed her and but I\nI don't understand any I don't I don't know how you can kill a four year old and thirty thirty three year old your own daughters monster as if he strangled others bare hands are I mean I just God I Can't I Can't imagine\nColorado had the death penalty or we know I don't\nYou know I'm not sure I I used to they used to have the firing squad Gary thank you to do if I if I'm not mistaken he wasn't very well maybe that was Utah they might have been Utah and I think what if you're ... yeah\nI don't know where the Colorado has the death penalty I'd I don't know but this I mean that's not good enough for this guy I mean the woman he was having an affair with only ... family over you know I Believe is reinstated in Nineteen Seventy four okay there you go well good 'cause he certainly qualifies\nFor death by avalanche and ski slopes he's eight now he's claiming that he came home\nTo find one of his daughters dead and the other one being strangled by his wife and that's why he snapped in a fit of rage and killed his wife and revenge of the prosecutors aren't buying that but that's the record I mean he just thinking about it I just can't imagine how you could kill your own three and four year

hundred foot pole\nAnd then when it was orange and it was funny and the way\nIt was part of a bathroom it was part of a bathroom and I was going to the bathroom and I got so scared frozen stiff I\nCouldn't ask for the gay super let's not read everything ended as your mind is kind of in one area they're paid I'm going to be more like\nWhat are you trying to say that scripture to bloom boy I

for ... for ten sixty seven you know what you're going to try to prove that it's a bit iffy from the beginning\nRobert Mueller is going to try to nail Donald Trump\nThe following way he's going to say that Michael Cohen has just admitted that Michael Cohen the president's lawyer violated campaign laws by paying off Stormy Daniels so that she wouldn't negatively affect Donald Trump's campaign\nSo Mueller's going to say that because Donald Trump tried to use a bribe to pay a slut not to embarrass him during the campaign he was using any illegal donation basically to pay off a tramp\nSo that she wouldn't turn on him during the campaign which would be helping his campaign so they're going to claim that Donald Trump violated federal campaign laws by paying the tramp us to keep her mouth shut\nWhich would have affected his campaign and that's how they're going to try to get Donald Trump\nOh man this is real if they run a duly elected president I'm all for silver something this negligible this country is going to explore I'll tell you I I I'll and I'll be right there I I Will I Will lead it until they take me off the air I mean this ... this was really appalling\nTwo years

a it's it's just just stressing\nWhen your hero and you disagree with you hero because technically usually you agree with everything you're heroes says or does and um it's tough\nWhen your hero or does something and I idolized Colin Powell for many many years is from New York went to ... a City College Jamaican immigrant family same you know a lot a lot of similarities between here and I now I didn't ... rise to the head of the joint chiefs of staff or anything like that nor\nDid I served in Vietnam but in terms of family background has a lot of similarities and er so he's always\nBeen a hero of mine and I I saw this interview on for ... this weekend and I said my God man\n[laughter] you're completely turn and and and and so it's instructive\nThat I play this and break it down for you because why he's turned is because this is what happens in it and why don't we want to be very clear this is exactly exactly exactly exactly what happens when one has become so much entrenched in the swamp that one doesn't even recognize that one is a swamp\nPerch person you don't you know what I mean it's like you're so entrenched you're so varied and surrounded by everyone's the same that party affiliation becomes negligible so you know one of the Republican you no longer a Democrat you're just a Washington insider it doesn't matter your party affiliation means nothing\nYour principles your morals your values they mean nothing\nBecause you become so entrenched and so he is a man saying that this president doesn't have the morals to basically become ... be president\nHe said uh during the election he said he only makes fun of everybody and I wouldn't vote for him he's not moral he's all that was just not\nPresidential what is exactly presidential I'm a General Powell because let me let me correct me if I'm wrong correct me if I'm wrong here the president that you worked under actually to to the three presidents that you worked on\nStarting with Nixon\nAll Republican presidential well Nixon kind of had to resign because he was so presidential\nBut\nThen the next one you worked for age W\nThis guy when he was so presidential he says you know what I'm not going to raise the taxes read my lips I'm not going to raise the taxes then what does he do he goes ahead and reads a raise the taxes that we do that is what we call in my community in my neighborhood where I was raised the Harlem that I was raised in we call that a wire\nThese wires\nMoral could do more allergy in line thinking about the war is think about the little battles thinking about the line that went on while you were there\nMan the cold is Trump were to call this president it moral you lied and took us to war blood treasure lives based on a lie\nYou went to war there's no more and more reality than that and then you let your mitigating the come back around and say\nI regret pushing for war in Iraq what this man as a push for war anywhere he pulled back on war everywhere so how do you call him

not the holiday it used to be used to be everybody was off now nobody's are [noise]\nI don't know a for for\nFor for one of six seven let me ask you this question [noise]\nThere is a growing movement to make this indigenous people's day in the city of Sao Fulton they passed an ordinance that said this today is not Columbus Day at city is indigenous\nPeople's day I'm as I told you in in in our little things that you need to know today um states have taken away Columbus Day in other words they changed it um to something else mostly indigenous people's day\nCelebrating the people that were already hear the argument being that how can you discover something that people already lived in so in other words if you're driving around and you see an apartment building and or plot of land in people live there you can't say hey look what I just discovered\nAnd this is the argument that's been waged for several years now and it's just an argument that's picked up steam over the course of time\nAnd the leftist ... won that argument in many of these states Alaska Minnesota Vermont Oregon and and hundreds of cities across the U.S the United states have ditch Columbus Day\nEven Columbus ohio will not observed Columbus Day in Columbus ohio was named for Christopher Columbus\nBut they're not going to celebrate Columbus Day so what do you feel about that aid for for for all for one of six seven seat\nThings like this don't bother me I I I don't will usually have an opinion on these kinds of things one way or the other you know it it is it is what it is what whatever you know what I mean if it's it's a bogus holiday in the beginning because it's just another day to be off but you don't give me off\nSo it's not a holiday anymore if I don't have off it's not Christmas or Thanksgiving\nI just don't really it does not holiday anymore you know what I mean you just say it's highly banks in Wall Street clothes okay\nIf I don't work in a bank and I don't work on Wall street was not a holiday to me just another Monday\nSo but what do you think do you think is a bad thing the Italian Americans who are always celebrated Columbus Day and see and always thought like Irish American sorting patties they have their day uh Columbus Day is always being seen by Italian Americans of their day\nWhat do you think of this aid for for foreign for one oh six seven I'm curious to know because like I said it doesn't matter to me one way or the other I see the argument from both sides\nAnd I bought you know I always found it interesting whenever I'm people say this you know Columbus discovered America okay great and then they say oh but they ... they had lunch and dinner Thanksgiving with the indigenous people well then how did you discover something that people are already living here\nI've always said that and I've always maintained the argument from the other side is the Indians or the Native Americans or indigenous people whatever you want to call them they have always I always used them as an example as why you should be against illegal immigration [laughter]\nBecause if there's any example of why Americans today should be against illegal immigration you should look at the Indians\nThey welcome people and they said hey come on and welcome welcome welcome then they lost their entire\nThey said well what was their their land if you will not their nation because there are a ton of nations in one space but they lost\nTheir land certainly by letting people when they come on and no problems that you want to eat you want to trade hey let me show you how to use this when we show you how to grow rice let me show you how to hunt deer\nAnd then look what happened not to three decades later they had nothing they got towels given to them blankets given to them with cholera in him and he got wiped off the\nFace of the are basically so if you think that illegal immigration is something that you should be for this one look at history and the Indians treatment should tell you why you should not be lent allowed ... illegal immigrants in this country without being checked was caught in the phones let's go to swat Jessie Jessie what's going on rather [noise]\nHey man I Do it how you doing sir a pretty\nGood about Columbus is that people are saying oh he didn't discover America first that's not the clay what it was discovered America to Europe\nAnd uh there are other people that discovered America First lego league leader but after Columbus discovered America Lancaster and uh the Native Americans may have discovered America but they didn't discover Europe\nSo this is an ass also said that he didn't ... because he didn't set foot all over America but he saw Florida\nI'm a Puerto Rico or find them up near the ... sea salt Florida\nSo Jesse let me ask you a question just for argument's sake you know what I mean it's this holiday here this is certainly or he just having a discussion you know what I mean you know how we do so you never step foot on a land of the continent should the people who actually celebrate your holidays for you discovering something you never set ... set set foot on\nWell William Herschel discovered uranium so never set foot on\nHere and that's a good point that's a good point but we don't have your rain this day\nRight right but\nUh I I like to go the other part of that that's an important point that I just got to go I got can you hold on short yeah just hold her just hold on [noise]\nWe have is the only one I guess maybe a lot of times past re just freely associate fair

I think a lot of people are like my ... year I\nThink a lot of people do make I I agree with what you're saying I I but I think there's a lot of people who do think that because [noise] and the reason why I think that is because the argument that was put forward\nAt changing the date to indigenous people's day or whatever they changed it to\n... that argument that was put forward was that what we both agree should not have been the case when when they teach it in high school they teach it as he discovered America that when he got in the America what like you said it was a restaurant that no one knew about until he discovered it I I\nI agree with what you're saying that no one really in their right mind believes that but that's true I I I Would you would think so but a large number of people do\nWell those people need to like the high school\nI I I mean I understand what you're saying like I really do understand what you're saying but I think that's why this argument was was waves and then the argument was passed and that's why you see it happening now and and I bring it up for a bigger issue the bigger issue is\nHow much do you change history and how much should history be changed and what does it ... the last line at a great book groups last line is it basically says that history is written by the winners\nIn other words if you if you conquer a people whatever you get the right to history you you see what I'm saying so the history is written by the winners and so I think that what we're seeing now is a is a rewriting of of popular history and how\nFar does that go how far down that rabbit hole do we go do we just change it outright do we just openly blazing Lee lie about what history is\nYou you know what I'm saying and I think that's the bigger question\nWill I mean if we if we want to go that far then you know ... Marco Polo didn't discover China you know none of none of what we've been taught because there's always been somebody somewhere\nHas always been someone somewhere you're you're right I I'm not disagreeing with you I'm not disagreeing with you at all I mean look at this situation here I Am an astronaut Scott Kelly apologize because he quoted Winston Churchill and so this guy is an astronaut\nQuoted Winston ... Churchill in an effort to show people we need to come together we're divided right now and\nI think we'd all agree that were divided right now right so he quoted Winston Churchill\nAnd the last one after in Saint church it was a columnist and a racist and this that and the other end so he had to apologize\nI did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities racist views which I Do not support my point was we need to come together as one nation\nWe're all Americans that should transcend partisan politics why did this guy I have to apologize\nWell those same people ever actually read what Lincoln said like during the ... Douglas debates there they're going to be calling for Lincoln's monument to come down that as he made some very racist statements and\nHe was the great emancipator linking after him as a\n... a ... be inflamed Africans Lincoln went on to invite black leadership to the White House to say okay what's next can we get can you guys do back home\nLike let's get you guys out of here and they were like no no no we want to say you know there'll be so you know I mean ... ... the history as complicated as are human beings we're all complicated world not perfect you know you might say oh you know I mean I\nI hear it every day I might say something that people disagree with\nAnd all of a sudden I got people on my Facebook page telling me they're not going to listen anymore because I said this and I'm like wow you like to show for nine months and I said one thing and now you're not going to listen anymore so you know history is as complicated\nAnd I don't think that we should throw people away because of the negative parts of their history or the negative parts of history I think we should embrace it all and bring it all in together because it's a really a part of history\nExactly\nYou know that's that's just my feeling great call my great talking to you smart kid my next time you call and make sure you let them know you're in a smart kids club\nOr will do thank you have a great

talk about a lot of people listening before I go to the calls I Want to talk about I went last night and see diamond itself and I want to talk about this yeah [noise] first of all is a packed\nHouse a absolute packed house who's at the uh marry at a conference center right there off of our powder springs road um and it was a packed house the VIP\nWhich was a a good price some use a good price to take a picture with have some little d'oeuvres open or that open bar but a bar um that was packed most of the people\nCame for the VIP the vast majority of people that were in that room we're in the VIP and so and it was a pay people pay to go see it and I was fascinating to watch this\n[noise] um and and what was fascinating to me was the love that piece sisters got from their audience\nNow obviously if you're paying to see someone speak or coming to an event that someone's going to speak out and you pay for you already have an intimate relationship with these people whether you know but not you have an intimate relationship right\nI had several people come up to me and say hey I Love your show we have an intimate relationship because they listen to the show they liked the show and so we were able to meet and talk to the point I'm trying to make us do do watch some of these that it was all women by the way now I'm Sorry I take that back\nThere was a lot of women mostly women\nBut to watch these women interact with diamond in silk told me that there's a love affair going on with these two women\nAnd it's not a love affair born in what the Democrats will tell you and have you believe that this is some sort of love affair of of of a one group of people laughing at and poking fun at another person this is I Love affair born out of an agreement them Paul agreement with politics\nAnd agreement with the president of the United states and a sassy way in which to deliver that message now let me explain this to you\n[noise] diamonds silk or they talk politics last\nNight they talked about Kavanaugh but they they talked about cabin on such a way that all these women that were there felt exactly what they were saying they weren't laughing at they were laughing with and I can see it with my own two eyes and I would tell you if I saw it any differently\nBut these women were suddenly it was one point and this one diamonds so said very clearly I Want my man to carry my bag I Want my man to hold the door for me I Want my bad my man to protect me\nI Want a strong man that's what these ladies said that place erupted when they said that retirees older women married women young women it erupted because these women saw the exact same thing\nThey want strong man\nAnd that's why there's such a love affair with Donald Trump because he represents the alpha male is I've told you before he represents that man that that man that says I'm going to defend myself I'm going to defend my family and I'm gonna defend this country\nHe represents that alpha male that man is stands up to one of these attack he stands up and defend himself he doesn't power in a corner\nAnd scared to say anything wrong and so\nWhen I was there last night I saw that and that was the first indication ahead and then I watch people wind up this line went on forever and a VIP I watch people line up\nAnd take pictures with\nA with a diamond in ... there was an old man there who\nWas crying tears when he got to the line and stood next to them to take a picture and old retired man was crying\nWhen he met them you don't do that the people you make fun of you do that\nFor people you respect and you finally get to meet in person there was a woman there who's been to every single one of their chit chat tours and had a picture that she kept in a folder\nThe man who was in a wheelchair who can barely stand who refused to take his picture I took a picture of him and posted on my Facebook who refused to take a picture sitting in a wheelchair and had to stand up and take a picture with them ladies and gentlemen what's going on in this country\nYou got to understand\nThis is not about black and white necessarily this is about right and wrong\nAnd this is about watching the president who's doing all they can to make this country great where these stumbles what he falls when he makes a mistake when he disagreed I'm he's doing everything he possibly can\nTo make this country great and yet there are people against him and diamonds are still represent those two sisters represent the women who are refusing to fold against all the attacks on them\n\nTelling you what I saw last\nNight at the Mary at a conference center with diamond in silk nearly brought tears to my eyes because I saw women white black women who are standing up for Donald Trump despite the attacks despite\nThe name calling despite all that they're going through\nAnd to me that means a red wave is coming in November\n\nWe gave him the guy that called show really fond of the press\nThat um ...

understanding was if the jury failed to reach anything on anything then it then you could read try him again or they could forget it but they could reach rhyme again\nIf the jury if they were Eighteen counts and the jury reached has reached a verdict on eight of them then those other ten are going to go by the wayside they can't try and for those other ten after this court verdict\nOr they have apparently they breached the verdict on it and it doesn't say guilty or innocent but it says they breach diverts on eight of the\nTeen counts er and by the way my Manafort has to go through another

on Michael\nWell button up pleading guilty Michael Cohen the Trump lawyer is pleading guilty to campaign finance and bank fraud and tax evasion charges which they didn't know about until they stole all this stuff out of his offices and as a law for Paul Manafort has apparently guilty on one count\nAt least ten were thrown out by the judge\nAnd I don't know anybody that's always necessarily know that it's coming out in the bits and pieces so apparently a Manafort guilty on eight counts jury undecided on ten\nOkay the verdict is reached on eight pounds but he's guilty on at least one we don't know how many they breached the verdict you could be innocent on the count on at least seven counts are saying guilty on one of the reporters no running out of the of the office to try to get to their

never mind\nRobert Mueller is going to try to nail Donald Trump in the following way he's going to say that Michael Cohen has just admitted that Michael Cohen the president's lawyer violated campaign laws\nBy paying off Stormy Daniels\nSo that she wouldn't negatively affect Donald Trump's campaign\nSo Mueller's going to say that because Donald Trump tried to use a bribe to pay a slut not to embarrass him during the campaign he was using an illegal donation basically to pay off a tramp\nSo that she wouldn't turn on um during the campaign which would be helping his campaign so they're going to claim that Donald Trump violated federal campaign laws by paying the tramp was to keep your mouth shut\nWhich would have affected his campaign and that's how they're going to try to get Donald Trump\nOh man this is real they run a duly elected president I'm all for silver something this negligible this country is going to explore I'll tell you I I I'll and I'll be right there I I Will I Will lead it until they take me off the air\nI mean this this is really appalling two years we've been doing this millions of dollars and he's got two guys in trial for tax evasion and a banking fraud counts and now he's going to try to complain that Donald Trump knew all about it from the beginning and tried to pay off Stormy Daniels to help his campaign was twelve years ago\nTwelve years ago\nAnd she signed an agreement to shut up and then broke the agreement I don't know why she hasn't been sued I mean you know confidential agreements are serious them for a reason not anymore

has a great piece on this a conservative review today\nFolks this is not a bad thing\nNow all of a sudden the Democrats that they have lost their bed to take over the majority on the Supreme Court they thought they'd have a six three majority where the\nPresident Hillary Clinton right ... ... and quite\nWork out that way now than it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather than an Anthony\nKennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in the future\nThe liberals are now attacking the courts that listen attacking an institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but high which makes a really good point here folks liberals for years have had a really hard time\nDoing one thing\nThey can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through think about it now I'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had they had the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen\nBut the big ticket items that liberals on abortion on demand\nA yeah a basic income Medicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals they have no national mandate for\nThey wanted a national mandate for gay marriage wherever you stand on it they couldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\nLiberals as a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend to be judges to pass those items of why it's very simple when you think about it it is\nVery simple mathematical equation do you want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in a presidential election to vote for your candidate along with your house of representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges and a black robe consider themselves swing voters to do it for you\nThe answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because he's the senior just get a bunch\nOf liberals pretending to be judges on the court to choose to legislate from the bench and you don't have to do the hard work\nOf knocking on doors getting elected in telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn the Ovie at a DMV excuse me or whatever the deal for years they can't run that either they convincing them that that's good\nFor them you can't there is no popular mandate for it so now that that avenue to the Supreme Court has been cut off for them they're starting\nTo now I Want you to screen shot all of their tweets when you're out there on Twitter them saying the Supreme Court it's not legitimate screen shot all of this\nBecause there may unfortunately become a time when they take\nBack the majority on the Supreme Court and I want you to fire all those screen shots back at them on Twitter hey look at this remember when you said judicial supremacy in the Supreme Court didn't matter\nNow it's not going to matter you're not going to change your mind these people don't stand for anything so there's actual principles their principles power they worship the golden calf of government that is what they do their national pastime is genuine selecting before the author of big government at whatever means they have to use the get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is this the Democrats are going to attack judicial supremacy we as Republicans should say is don't need to make this personal the courts do have a constitutional role but you know what labs you don't think the court should be deciding things [noise] [noise]\nYes welcome to the party piles Bruce Willis ed diehard\nCalmer than be why obey\nBreak it\nYou're welcome we don't believe that either\nWe believe in a constitutional republic to do the hard work of legislating you have to elect representatives and a representative democracy that are going to go vote for our values the fact that you can't do that live sounds a whole lot like your problem\nNot ours we haven't had any problem getting tax cuts passed through because we believe in economic liberty fat a lot of problems slowing down the growth of government but we've had some victories not a lot but some and it's been hard work and people have to take votes\nBut they don't want to take votes liberals they want to pass it all off on the courts why do they don't want to take votes because ladies and gentlemen think about this right\nWhy liberal elected representatives whether they're in the house of representatives of the United States Senate why do they not want to actually take votes and pass off all the hard stuff abortion gay marriage onto the course why\nBecause folks where do you think taking a liberal vote\nOn a national gay marriage referendum or abortion referendum in no matter where you stand where do you think that would do you think in in in the heartland of America that there's overwhelming popular opinion for abortion on demand out there across the heartland of America outside of say a Illinois Maryland New York and
