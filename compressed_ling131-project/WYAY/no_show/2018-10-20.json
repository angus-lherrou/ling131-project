spending forty five fifty because today it's for your job is to be one of the first thousand callers\nAnd take it seriously this the flies out the door and the big radio stations be one of the first thousand calls you get your ... and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you know\nWe want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it try it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take you to get people just choose the tablets are the powder when they calling for the free bottle today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing is becoming very big these days so if you're doing something like that to a jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDumping right into your juice dump it into your protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're\nCoated they're easy to swallow it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers and you're already found out that not only were these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFor teen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers call this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula the product we are talking about right now the ever strong powder so\nDouble blind placebo control study thirty golfers took the restaurant powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our every strong powder for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey get older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job or you can read five hundred dollars on a driver up five yards right this is for teen\nYards had people shouldn't just how how about this or you're on about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and there's more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board\nBut again these golfers one month on this every strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine pat you get your bottle of every strong you don't tell your buddies take her for a month and you go out and you're banging the both fourteen yards past them they don't know what hit him\nWhile I Would just had a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team what you like to

literally it sounds too good to be true right right like when I tell folks about average strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this\nIt's not possible right you know I Know how you

the process are being done and we checked him off one of the time to make sure that all of that has done so we don't want to let anything like that slip through the cracks and that was a possible it can still slip through the cracks absolutely no one's perfect we're not perfect\nNo if it was something where it was a major mistake in the investing side like they weren't supposed to sell something or maybe they invested in something that was real role about overall investment that\nThey felt that they were investing in something in the end when it came down to the investing side of it they made an error not picked the wrong thing but actually made an error well it's real simple you know as up to do Sherry we have the responsibility\nRight and you know again mistakes can happen but\nIf it's a serious one you kind of have to analyze woe\nIs something going on behind the scenes at that from that you know maybe I shouldn't be at that from ... again it all depends upon that particular

side are perhaps not so green on their financial symphony today as an all relates to your your retirement planning\nI Know you like to meet new people all the time you have new people come in from the show and what if someone comes in and says my advisors business seems to have gotten too big and now I never even see him or talk to him I just communicate with one of his associates what's your advice there\nWell that does happen in our industry I mean I can just say from personal growth here at the Lloyd group that there are times when someone calls in they're going to get my staff they're going to get my CSP they're going to get one of my other advisors because we're we're all amount of festivals twenty four hours a day I get that\nYou know one thing that I'm a real sticker on Ron is that a question gets answered immediately we try to get back with that person immediately if there's a question of any kind or in need of any kind I Am so particular about this round that even on the weekends\nIf someone calls are local number it does roll over to my operations manager\nYou know so that in case there's an emergency I guess this is going back to the old school old days where you remember back when your your doctor was available twenty four seven and you could call the answering service and get your doctor to call you back back in the old days I kinda still run this practice that way you know most people are really\nConscious about no no no don't worry about it cause back on Monday but I did one time I don't know if I've ever told the story but one time\nI remember calling one of my clients back on a Saturday because they were getting ready to sell a piece of property up all like all in there and they said whoa we haven't thought about\nCapital gains taxes\nAnd what's the tax ramification that's going to have a bearing on how much we can negotiate the price and when I told him what the tax rate was and we calculated it all over the phone on a Saturday they were able to get back to their offer and say okay this is what I Need and and the question was answered so they could sell the property up and I thought\nThat's why we do what we do to be able to give that kind of stellar customer service\nYou know but you know one thing I've tried to do as our firm has gotten bigger Iran is have really really good competent people here\nSee a piece that have been with me for Fifteen plus years you know we're family organization so my son in law that you've gone on twelve years my son has been since he\nWas a discharge from United States air force he's been here at the from you know my daughter works at the firm I mean we are a family organization and every one of us has the same thought process\nTake care of people every person Ron has their own unique situation their own unique story and we know that we want to know what that is and we want to be able to help them individually so sometimes it's firms do get bigger but you need to have a plan in place to still take care of\nYour clients and there's nothing wrong with being old school if you mentioned that\nYou know I I don't know I I Believe in customer service I Believe in talking to people live on the phone I really do\nAbsolutely well another person mark says I went to a dinner seminar with a financial adviser and found them to be very entertaining and engaging much more so than my current advisor should I switched to this new guy\nWell what's entertaining engaging [laughter]\nI mean [laughter] I mean is that the criteria they just do like comedy show or the song and dance I maybe I mean you know what does that mean [laughter] or you can have someone who may be a good communicator but then again they may be slick talking yeah\nSo you know one thing that we really really harp on and I and I do regular appearances here in Atlanta on TV and\nAnd we talk about how important it is to work with a fiduciary\nAnd if a do Sherry should always be looking out for your best interest there is no broker and that in that person's ear saying you need to sell this product you need to make sure you know you use these funds because these funds make us more money where we get a kick back from these funds\nI mean there's big companies big banks big firms out here that actually get a kickback from mutual fund companies if you use their phones are you kidding me yeah how can that be that's what's best for the client\nSo you know the way I look at it as don't get caught up and all that\nMake sure that you when you're talking to a person who doesn't mean that that person is bad because they're a good communicator it just means that you got to make sure you ask the right questions how do you get paid for do share those things\nYou here's another question for you and I think this is really a legitimate question a lot of people problem we have this because people tend to move around I like my advisor but I've recently moved to a different state and I'm Wondering if I should be working with somebody local instead\nWell yes I think there is some value to that and we see that a lot here especially in the Atlanta area because we're such a transient city just this week I've had to folks to families\nBoth from Michigan by the way I mean I don't know what it is about Michigan maybe it's just not a lot of migration south but both of these families one has had a long term relationship with their financial firm\nAnd really the financial firms that are really good job for him when we did the analysis I really couldn't find anything that I dislike the what the firms doing\nBut they had come to the realization that it made sense to work with someone local\nAnd they ... you know they told the financial advisor because they were going to be here in Georgia for the rest of their lives is is there this is where they're going to retire that they needed to\nShift from you know just the investment firm to more of a whole list the financial advisor that's going to put together a retirement plan and income plan we call that our financial roadmap\nThat's literally going to sit there and look at health care issues how do we pay for those extra health care expenses that's going to look at the tax sufficiency of their portfolio that's going to manage the risk and volatility so that you know the closer they get to retirement or in retirement\nTheir portfolio doesn't look the same as they were when they were twenty thirty forty years old because one thing we cannot allow that have happened is loose thirty forty percent of that portfolio and in some cases you won't be able to retire you'll have to eat if you're already retired possibly go back to work\nTo make up for the ... huge losses that could happen in the stock market so sometimes it makes sense to work with someone local\nHey let me just say that to you know a lot of people find themselves in that situation and I'm Glad that a particular person you were just talking about this couple came in and they found you to talk to you about that yeah they\nThey interviewed several firms are but they you know they end up choosing us up because they knew that the plan we put together\nYou know one thing I Do run I think a little different than people here in that I talked to this is what I'm this is what I'm hearing from folks who come in is that we explain things more simple I'm proud of that I'm proud when someone says you know I understand what you're saying no one's talking over my head\nAnd then another thing I hear is not only do you tell me what you do\nBut you tell me why you do it yeah I support and I think people need to know why we recommend what we recommend and I think by explaining that there's more of a comfort level\nMhm okay one last question I Want to throw out here in our greener grass on the other side conversation market the market crashed and I lost a ton of money in my portfolio is that a reason to change advisors\nWhoa again you know everyone's situation is different Ron I mean if I'm again like I mentioned earlier from Thirty years old and your vested a hundred percent into stocks then you know your portfolio is going to go up and down it's going to be

don't have to talk to anybody today you'll get a call back and then you can look at your calendar and all that kind of thing\nWas talking about finishing the race and by that I mean getting through retirement can be a lot like running a marathon marketing to\nEurope marathon runner yourself yeah right here being sarcastic yes I Am [laughter] but none of them like you're a marathon runner in Europe there isn't much of a marathon runners on here in our dream there\nAre some things there are some similarities to marathon runners and folks who are getting ready to retire so I thought we could talk about some of the similarities are first of all you don't just go out of here and we'll run a marathon without thinking about it or we're not preparing for it\nThere's a great deal of planning and preparation that goes into that so you can do it and the same goes for your retirement planning\nTo yell and when you think about it I Do have some friends who are runners and they love the run and they're constantly training\nYou know most marathoners will spend I'd read an article one time at least six months and training before they even think about it yeah you know mixing in days would light runs and some days long runs and they simulate what a marathon would be so that they're ready for when it when the when the time comes\nYou know the other day that might be doing the shorter fast run sprints and things like that\nIn your retirement plan he should have different buckets of money invested in different ways does the same thing you trained differently you need to have your money invested differently because there's different things that your money is needed for so we talk about having a rainy day bucket of money you know that we can get to is that the bank\nYou know ... unfortunately it's not hardly earning any interest but that's why we don't put a whole lot there and we just put enough there to take care of emergencies and you know I like to say a rule of thumb that if we lost our job we need to have six months worth of income in there you know we can we can get our hands on\nYou know but anything above and beyond that unless you have something you're getting ready to buy or spend it on you probably need to have that invested so it may be something that's more conservative maybe interest and dividends something that we can get some higher interest but we can get to the money if we need to we also need to have\nSome money put away more long term was a long term\nTen plus years we need that money to grow because of the light and you mentioned of ill or your retirement like a marathon\nTo me a retirement as a thirty year window\nYou know I Want to see my clients go all the way to age one hundred without the fear running out of money that could be a thirty five to forty year window it is a marathon so we need to have some money growing long term\nTo keep up with longevity and to make sure that we're going to have money when we get into our seventies eighties nineties or whatever\nYou know and then we also need to have income buckets buckets where we can supplement our Social Security even if we have a pension it may be a smaller pension or maybe there is no cost of living on your pension and we need to be able to pull income interest and dividends or you know maybe some structured income to supplement\nThat Social Security check it's critical that money does it need to be risky we need to have that money more conservative because the last thing we want to do is be drawing income from a bucket of money that's losing money that means we're locking in law says that will never get back every time we cash a check\nSo it's critical that we have the risk under control we can have some risk in some buckets but somebody just need to be safer\nSo when we have folks come in we talk about the power of having different buckets of money where you don't have all of your eggs in one basket we've heard that term forever don't put all your eggs in one basket it's critical that you don't do that in\nYou're listening to the financial symphony and we certainly appreciate your being there and and Mark I'm I'm not talking about you here but I'm Talking about the listeners out there who may be marathon runners I'm guessing that if you're a marathon runner you probably have a pretty good diet\nAnd uh that's one of the reasons that I'm not a marathon just one of the many\nYou know an athlete in general yeah actually I had an opportunity to meet Michael Phelps when he was training for the Olympics did you read one time at the amount of food that man I had to eat [laughter]\nTo have all the you know and how many carbs he ate just to have the energy to swim all those you know races and everything [noise] any kind of training like that you know you got to make sure your body burns cards more efficiently than it burns fat so I mean these are things that athletes will tell you all the time in retirement planning\nYou need to be paying very very close attention to your portfolio in the years leading up to retirement\nSo before this correction that we've had here recently\nAnd the month of September the market's hit an all time high we hit a the longest Bull Run and the history of Wall Street we used to say that was in the nineties not any more it's now\nWe hit the largest Bull Run in the history of Wall Street where back in March of two thousand nine that last crashed we had\nThe Dow Jones industrial closed at sixty five forty seven that was the low and then got the twenty six thousand in January gave some back then got backed up to twenty six thousand again in September ... given some back bottom line is that is the largest Bull Run in the history of Wall Street\nNow there is no calendar that tells us that the Bull Run is over\nBut we've got to be prepared that in case there is something going on something blows up there's a you know bubble out here that burst we do end up you know not being able to come to a agreement with China and then that trade war accelerates\nYou know something happens geo politically\nI read an article where the scrolling through a Yahoo Finance and I read in the headlights of the article is to you know Donald Trump junior be ready to go to jail I mean like ... you know something like that happens you know I'm not wanting to get into politics I'm not going to talk politics\nBut it's something think about if something like that happens a lot of factors that have on our portfolio\nWe need to make sure the closer we are to retirement that we had no exactly or at least how they stress tests performed to know the impact it's going to have on our portfolio going down because we don't want to have that happen when it's too late when we've lost our paycheck but\nWe're talking about the parallels between running a marathon in preparing for your retirement and you know experience marathoners notice that you can't go out and start to fast you have to pace yourself but if you're a beginning marathoner you might make that mistake of starting to fast and that can put you in a whole heap of trouble\nAnd ah you just click on that link and it's going to

Turkish officials who say that the body was dismembered\nBased on where we're at right now with earnings I think earning should take us into the rest of the year with the markets continuing to do well\nSo it was on the jury will also Fox Business and she asked me about the overall health of the U.S economy so I Want to play that clip and then we'll discuss\nA friend David necklace that reckless wealth management data what about that I cannot select set off at capitalism hair\n[noise] yeah you know I think they can I think it's a good catalysts deal with a strong numbers of their report it but you know what I actually think the story is even bigger than Netflix I just think overall what we're saying the strength that we saw yesterday was fueled by you know a few things\nEarnings right I Know early in the earnings season but when it's all said and done third quarter earnings sit somewhere be around twenty two percent\nIt would be the third consecutive quarter of twenty percent growth for the markets so that's good there's a few other data points that came out a home builder confidence homebuilders are motivated by strong economy strong demand generational low unemployment\nI continues on the job openings seven point one for a million job opening\nWell let me tell you I write to add on to that because that that ... Ashley more jobs than job seekers five nine I'm very in salads that and that\nIs just a break through a number it tells you that something's going on in this economy that we really haven't ever seen before and and what I'm Wondering is in the stock market playing catch up to the broader economy [noise]\nI mean I I think it is to a degree but you know what we're saying here and that number is look I think we're underestimating the overall strength of the U.S economy I think once we get through the mid term elections\nI think we'll see a melt up in the market is going through the end of the year but yet when we look at job openings a million more jobs are that are open that are actually American seeking jobs\nA manufacturing just say the sixteenth month straight increasing capacity for manufacturing is a jury these numbers are great remember before President Obama left office he said President Trump would need a magic wand say some economic numbers like this well advocate ever it's working I'm excited to see how you know and going after the end of the air and it\nWas my clip from Fox Business earlier this week just talking about the overall health of the economy and I said look\nYou know what we're seeing right now is something that we've really never seen before so I Know that there's all this volatility going on in the market\nBut this is why separating out emotions and I know if you turn on the radio you'll probably hear all these financial advisors telling you that the sky is falling\nAnd you need to move all of your money over to them so that they can help you protected and all that makes for great sound bites but the reality is the economy's doing fantastic unemployment or at levels that we haven't seen in in a generation\nSo just because everything is going fine now the question really than as well how long can this\nContinue and so you know I'm very optimistic but it does it mean that we shouldn't have any from financial plan in place and this is why I strongly believe in the bucket approach things to talk about a little bit in the next segment\nBut I Believe you should have a portion of your money that is really unaffected by the ups and downs of the market and that bucket is what should cover your retirement income in the years that you need income\nThe other bucket that's in the market sure that may experience the ups and downs\nBut we don't want\nAny money that we need over the next ten years for retirement income to come from the stock market so even if there is some volatility your first couple of years of retirement once you're in retirement that's fine for the bucket that we don't need to I don't need that money for eight ten twelve years down the\nRoad what does it matter what happened in the market last week when the market dropped off this week and last week did the fundamentals of the markets change no\nBut\nMarket volatility doesn't care when I'm eating come and so you may need income or maybe it's a required minimum distribution that you have to pull that you have to pull no matter where the markets right that is why having a bucket approach in your portfolio makes sense\nAnd so you know there's not just one investment a product that is right for every investor you've got to be able to have a bucket of your retirement portfolio that's what we call low volatility because we've run the numbers\nIf you take a major loss in your time report floated those first few years of retirement it can be devastating\nIf you take a thirty or forty percent drop your first couple of years of retirement it could take seven years to recover from that and if you're having to take money off of that portfolio when the markets are negative you can take even longer\nSo this is why I'm a strong believer in the bucket approached the three main buckets or your liquid bucket that's where your short term expenses if you have a home repair you want to take a trip you get your liquid bucket you're next bucket is your income bucket we had so let's just say ... million dollar portfolio\nYou may have four to five hundred thousand dollars in your income bucket that's going to cover expenses for the first ten to twelve years a retirement\nAnd the last bucket is your growth bucket which the growth bucket is what we don't want to touch pretend to twelve years [noise]\nSo if you're listening right now and maybe you said you know David I don't really have a full retirement plan in place maybe even say they've the markets are doing so well but my account hasn't really been performing well I think it's it's worth getting a second opinion\nSo what we do for for radio is just a thousand dollar value but we provided complimentary if you have more than two hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio and you call\nAre often do to a question about an hour he's willing to give the number is four four and eight nine zero five six years it's four zero for eight nine zero five six zero six thousand

O. L. A. as well W. E. A. L. T. H.\nA dot com or the clip that we just played was by David Stockman or who was the ... director under Ronald Reagan and you know what he was he was on CNBC and he was describing what he sees as a coming\nFiscal disaster monetary policy disaster that's in front of a sudden\nYou know he was only be director for many years in the Reagan he sees these things\nLook to budget and some of it has to do with just the fiscal sanity that we have coming out of Washington and so you know we're always looking for where's the next financial crisis coming from\nYou know the economy is doing well if you look at any economic data are the numbers show us the time it into a a two hundred thousand jobs created in January we had a wage increase for the first time in quite a while but federal deficits that are larger than a trillion dollars a year\nAre massive\nFor an economy that is an advanced stage of economic recovery and to me when we are still buying a trillion dollars to run our federal government that is just inefficiency and really my opinion stupidity and it's fine is\nSays Americans here we print the world's money foreign central banks they hold US dollars they hold treasuries to back up their own currencies why\nBecause most international transactions they go through the dollar the problem though is when fiscal us\nA solvency when we're running these huge deficits that increases risk to bondholders as\nDeficits keeps or we can expect investors to demand higher and higher interest rates on treasury is thinking about it they're going to want to earn more if they're going to hold us\nThat during the next door session\nWe could well force huge tax increases in order to fund our current spending\nSo the problem that I see right now is not a ... or a government that doesn't have enough revenues come in coming in we have a problem with the government that is spending too much\nAnd unfortunately we are having to look at some of these federal outlays and make tough decisions but it seems like Republicans Democrats don't want to make these tough decisions and here's the problem [noise] us investors unfortunately we as investors are left holding the bag\nBecause right now with a ... trillion dollar debt national that close to one trillion dollars in deficits if we go through any type of recession and incomes drop GDP drops where are we going to have the money to continue to fund\nWhat our government is spending without borrowing massive amounts of debt and we're already doing that\nAnd so this is why you know I'm a big believer in having puts inside your portfolio the reason I like puts in a portfolios because a put can allow you to help protect\nA portion of your portfolio if the markets go down [noise]\nSo would have put option does put option if you buy a put option a put option makes money when the markets go down\nSo what we've done in our portfolios is we have added put options into some of our heads portfolios so I Want to walk you through what that looks like\nIt's one of the nice things about each ... today is that with an E. T. F. you can own the entire stock market or what we say the U.S and the five hundred the large cap index you can own the entire large cap indexed by just owning an ATF\nTo the ATF that we use for the U.S and the five hundred is going to be an ATF called S. P. Y.\nIn the U.S economy what they've done it shifted stock an asset prices up it shifted after prices up significantly\nInto the question now becomes can the U.S economy survive on its own with how low interest rates\nWill the economy continue to create two hundred three hundred thousand jobs a month which is amazing without the support of the Federal Reserve there to prop it up\nAnd that's really the question of the markets were working through right now but unfortunately history paints a very uh unfortunate story\nWhen the Federal Reserve begins to raise rates significantly\nThat can be damaging to the economy\nSo when we look at a few different data points when we see we're valuations are stock valuations or some of the highest levels in us history we've been on nine year bull market\nIf we're approaching retirement we have to make sure that we don't get caught up in the next major market correction and so some of the things that we're doing right now for our clients\nIs we're actually adding protection to our stock portfolios and what I mean by protection is we're using something called a put option on some of our portfolios\nOr using call options to reduce our stock exposure\nAnd so if you're listening right now he should they be no I Love to be in the market I Want to get a good return that's most of us I'm sure listening but the thought of losing twenty thirty forty percent of my retirement money because the market collapses that's just not to comforting you know\nAnd so what we do is we add Hedges tore portfolio and so we we have a ... it's going to hedge equity portfolio\nThe goal of the hedge equity poor boys to get about Seventy to eighty percent of the upside of the market but help protect our downside when the markets go down so given example\nOn on average or going to set our heads up about ... percent out of the money\nWould that means is we're going to start the protection is going to kick him around the market being down around ten percent\nSo if the market drops four percent are we trying to protect against that no the market jumps five percent are we trying to protect against that no mortgage up six percent of return to protect against that know where we are trying to protect again\nIs a drop of more than about ten percent anyone here\nAnd why is that because we can recover from a ten percent drop that recovery time could be less than a year\nBut when you take a forty percent drop fifty percent drop sixty percent\nDrop God Forbid that can take years to recover six seven eight years to recover from a major type of recession type law so this is why right now to me it's important\nThat we have Hedges inside the portfolio the Hedges are there to help ... tech portfolios from major market decline\nWith David you know I Want to make sure I don't lose any money well that is tough to do in the stock market if you're gonna be in the stock market you're going to have to accept some loss but as we get closer to retirement or in retirement\nThe losses at significantly hurt the portfolio or when we get the major twenty twenty five thirty forty percent losses to the portfolio and guess what\nI was looking at our church here for average recessions ready for this the average recession\nLasted about a year and a half if we look from Nineteen twenty seven I'm Sorry Nineteen twenty six to two thousand Seventeen the average bear market recession asked lasted about one and a half years with an average\nCumulative laws you ready for this of forty one percent\nOf what a put that into context okay\nLet's just say you the million dollar portfolio the average\nLoss during a bear market has been around forty one percent\nSo a million dollars on average will lose four hundred thousand dollars based on the last bear market drops four hundred thousand dollars\nCan you imagine if you built up your ... you get to a million dollars you hit the magic number that you've been waiting for\nAnd then God Forbid we get into a recession you're first four or five years of retirement and you lose four hundred thousand dollars\nWhat do you do\nLet's just say you've got up to two million dollars in your portfolio we had a couple of our office early this week they had been saving they are they hit the two million dollar mark and their portfolio there were so happy there are so proud of asking the same question if we have another recession and the next five years\n\nOr are you comfortable taking a forty percent drop on your investments an eight hundred thousand dollar drop\nThey looked at me said they've actually not\nAnd this is why I don't want to some morbid here but you just you have to prepare your portfolios your retirement proposed for the worst case scenario why is that because in retirement there are no do over\nThere or not\nThis is why it's important to have a plan in place and what a proper financial plan does is going to show you wear your income is coming from\nHow much risk is in your portfolio what are the things that you need to do now to make sure that you can retire with out having this fear that if the market takes a big\nDrop you can lose a lot of principle [noise]\nSo I Want to give up the offer for morning star analysis where more than ... ... it's an in depth break down your portfolio it shows you where the weaknesses are it shows you God Forbid we have another year like oh way or the market dropped almost forty percent\nHow your current portfolio would perform\nIt's a thousand dollar value but we'll wave that thousand dollars for the cause of the more than two hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio you call the next ten minutes to take advantage of for all for eight nine zero five\nSix zero six and a number to call for all for eight nine zero five six zero six it's a thousand dollar value but we'll way but if you have more than two hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio\nYou call the next ten minutes for all for eight nine zero\nFive six year old six that's four zero for eight nine zero five six zero six\nYou know so I said this really on the show I said look a statement that you get in the mail every month that is not a retirement plan knowing how much you made or lost from one month and the next that doesn't tell you where you are retirement income is coming from\nDoesn't tell you what you need to know\nTo make sure you can retire successfully so give us a call for all for eight nine zero five six zero six I'm David Nicholas you're listening to protecting retirement\nHave a wonderful week we'll see you guys

delicious melted chocolate right down you your whole Shannon Bruce show on the news talk one of six seven I don't know was the\nGuy but here's another path from the uh ... the from the U.S\nRealtyTrac side of the tracks all real estate in the United states free foreclosures are down six this the September the latest or the end of September down sixteen point five percent of the previous month six point two percent of the previous year\nA ... a\nForeclosures are down fifty percent of the previous month in thirty one thirty one point nine percent of the previous year\nI mean I don't know if the guy I think pretty good news to me right\nIn total foreclosures are down one in a\nOne in every twenty four hundred\nOr ah or or are in foreclosure there's an average\nUh and here's something that that may have something to do with it and I think I think that's what we'll Duane how most of the loans that are ... through foreclosure now we're\nWe're a mortgages that were uh originally they between foreign away those are the ones that are in trouble those are the ones that are being there in foreclosure now real Duane how I rather\nYour exactly where I\nCan and um it has to do with that have program that how will affordable mortgage program right a lot of black folks were in laws you know they were bad low subprime low\nAnd they were unable to refinance those low so people will only decided not to continue to pay in housing that they were upside down in that they had lost their ... right I'm\nIn because the system is so broken so bad you have people living in holes for long periods of time without making mortgage payments at all this right um but you know it had to deal with the bankruptcy\nCourt and that the way that the judges were instructed to handle bankruptcy and the banks that were in charge of those low and the way that they got incentives to be able to have your house go into foreclosure versus workloads out but to some extent the guy is right\nAnd that was a lower income neighborhoods people are still losing their whole support closure because of bad loans\nBut to me that's a separate reflection\nOf the economy right now\nRight because the the there's a little bit or weren't originated under this in this economy they were originated under ... you know ... right after the the for between ... those are the majority of the loans that are being recalls right now\nYeah that affordable mortgage program that was instituted by Obama was just a bad deal and I don't want to read but Obama you know ... you know like I Want to make it his fault but um that was a difficult time you know and I said it'd be for like a couple of weeks ago those all old in a way that that\nThat we restructuring of those ... was just a bad deal or write a black folks low income folks there was already in a bad deal that laws are high office rating subprime bill so in in in to a certain extent he's right um but that's a separate issue from\nWhat I Do yeah I don't see the guy is is wrong I I just want an odd that someone's trying to find a something bad or ... in this economy going way out of their way huh\nHere's a full circle for you your daughter was one of the last eight then join a union right now Georgia has probably more black owned businesses than any other state\nOh well that's a full circle moment\nWhere you go well set but you do it how would you say look I've got to ask who's coming out to um big tax on the sex texting yeah you ...\n... yeah I really do\nA for for for all forms of six seven is our telephone number you want to get about the

wife is from eastern Kentucky and that's a kind of economically depressed area and it always has been so we moved away from that uh-huh would be the more intelligent thing to do if if it actually the area that you're in a bad move out of it but\nI'm also I was raised in the bad parts Atlanta where a lot of these foreclosures probably happen\nAnd I don't understand why people can't get roommates
