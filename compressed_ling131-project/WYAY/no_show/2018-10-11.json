I'm a wet out in public and made excuses for rioting in Ferguson and Baltimore so I'm not sure what Hillary Clinton is talking about what you said the era of civility is over but here's Hillary Clinton saying we don't need to be civil anymore because we disagree with Republicans and why would you be civil with people with whom you disagree\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nVictory civility civility can start again when we do\nYou and put our boots on your throat that's when civility makes a comeback that was funny about that is that her premise that you can't be civil to a party that wants to destroy all the things that you stand for that's the premise of party politics in the United states there's not a lot you can find a democratic and Republican parties right now\nThey both want to destroy what the other party stands for that does not remove the requirement to be civil\nNow I think Republicans understand as much better than Democrats do or at least did until twenty sixteen\n... the great untold story of less twenty five years\nIs that Democrats categorize every Republican as evil and nasty and bigoted and homophobic and racist and all of these terrible things and finally Republicans responded and twenty sixteen by saying you know what\nScrew you two were done and I have a truck to prove it to here's detract from Jonathan heights new book about polarization in American politics and here's what it shows it's partisan hatred for the other party and you will see that the lighter line if you're watching us into the lighter line shows that you like\nTo folks who hate the Democratic Party Republicans who hate the Democratic party and the darker line shows Democrats you hate the Republican Party what you will see is that until twenty sixteen\nDemocratic hate for the Republican Party was higher or equal to hate from Republicans for Democrats every year since Nineteen eighty\nLike that's the actual trend line here what you see in this friend of mine is that since Nineteen eighty when Ronald Reagan won election democratic hatred for the Republican Party skyrocketed and was significantly higher\nThan Republican hatred for the Democrats all the way up until Nineteen Ninety five or so then they sort of drew eating and they basically are right on top of each other and then after George W. Bush was elected than democratic hatred for the Republican Party skyrocket again and remain higher this is the part that amazing it remain higher than hatred\nFor the Democratic party by Republicans all the way until twenty sixteen which means even after ... rock Obama was elected Democrats still hated Republicans more than Republicans hated Democrats which shows you the Republicans in the end really believe\nI think ... they they believe and I believe this for decades that Democrats are wrong but not evil and Democrats believe that Republicans are both wrong and evil\nTwenty sixteen Republicans finally said listen you guys think that we're evil well that makes you evil we're done with it or you're going to say that you hate us just for partisan reasons well we hate you write that\nYou can go shove it\nYou're not interested in playing this game with you anymore that's what's happened so the media only noticed is around twenty sixteen because the media are partisan Democrats the folks in the media only notice the Republican hatred for Democrats have skyrocketed and twenty sixteen because for the first time it was evident that that was the case\nBecause until then democratic hatred for Republicans always had exceeded Republican hatred for Democrats and the media were part of that problem the media we're forwarding that hatred the media were cheering it on who's the media declaring the George W. Bush was a war criminal was a media declaring that the Tea Party were a bunch of terrorists was the media declaring that the that the Tea Party were a bunch of\nMobs Doug awkward the fans\nThat this

one I'm going to keep\nRight on a day die early this Donald Trump says you can have um they're yours now\nYeah I Know how you know we're just waking up this morning it's still dark hair but we're assessing a lot of the damage I tell people listening it white I Know a lot of people down here to vacation Yes sir a Destin\nA was spared a we have just minor ... damage at all but uh on the bay itself or we like I said we had a several boats break from their their ... and they're more and so they're going to stress that this morning\nBut if you have further east yeah of course the damage gets much worse in fact ah Panama City Mexico beach were kind of ground zero on this thing and that kind of go beat just\nTotally destroyed the picture from last night before they can get in there uh it looked like Mexico beach which is floating in the\nGulf of Mexico so uh so it's quite go ahead go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead\nIt's quite devastating to say the least\nI I have a question the Panama City and Mexico beach are these\nUm because you said you said earlier I Know guessing I honeymooned in Destin and it's kind of high end I guess if you will um Panama City in Mexico beach or those more middle class lower middle class working poor areas where are the same as destined\nNo attorney ... you're you're right on its more middle class or a now Mexico beach is one of the last beaches down here\nTo be developed so will you go to Mexico beach you're basically going to a beach or what everything else looked like a back in the Nineteen fifties or so or not now no high rises no uh no no restaurants and it's still pretty\nUh like I said the fifties sixties early fifties sixties so I'm\nA ... in my city is kind of the same way so yes you would be right up there\nGotcha so does that impact the people 'cause I've got some sound of people from Panama City\nAnd Mexico beach that was going to play after all we let you go on a people that state does that impact why people stay is because of financial struggles that they're going through and why they don't leave what do people just think that the temple temple in a hurricane for a category for hurricanes gives me\nWhat do you have to understand most people in those areas have been in this area for all their life okay there in in there and the relatives have been there all their life\nSo yes we've had other storms they weren't as intense they may have been a one or two but nothing like this has ever hit that area so people are saying we've been through this before\nI think we can handle it now that being said nobody thought this was going to be a category for actually it was only one mile an hour away from being a category ... magic\nOr when that thing hit over there it hit at a hundred and Seventy five miles an hour when why and it was sustained for about ... a good hour so uh\nI think that's the reason why most of them stay is because you know\nUh and if you know Florida you know oh well we call all Florida all\nThe people that I've lived here before I'm a they just you know they say you know we've been through this our grandparents have been through this and we can we expect this thing out\nSo what happens next is it passes the cars that we've we've seen rain here in the metro Atlanta area or we saw a\nWins I guess not hurricane force winds last night but very strong winds last night we had a lot of rain yesterday in the early evening four o'clock around four four thirty and it's it kept going most of the night into this morning when I was on my way to work um tapering off a little bit in the next hour so what does it look like down there as it passes\nIt over and now the rebuilding starts\nRight absolutely everything pretty much a normal day waiting for you want to talk about a normal day it's a little cooler than expanding it always been in a\nTerrible heat wave down here in the south for the past I'll actually too much but uh right now it's cool the Windsor are calm about six miles an hour or so the weather today is going to be absolutely beautiful sunny skies\nUm then again you have to deal with what's on the crowd and not what's in the sky\nRight exactly now how does this I Know you're a meteorologist I Know that the weather is what you guys do what I Want to ask this question because we do talk politics here how does this impact\nOn the local races I Know a Gillum as a matter of Tallahassee was Tallahassee hit\nTallahassee was hit and uh I have heard anything about the damage in Tallahassee but uh yeah they got to hit the\nUh they were mostly on the left side of the storm came through so uh I'm not sure how bad Tallahassee is right now I'm Still waiting to get the assessment what's the\nUh the the light comes up but uh it went straight up through a through Georgia south Georgia and then right took a turn I Believe right now it's in the Senate dust a movie about when it's going to go out to uh\nTo the Atlantic and and and fall apart so but uh I'm not sure about Tallahassee we're still waiting on that you understand too that a lot of these places are are still without power so okay the only people in our allowed or are or the or a National Guard in the I'm a rescue officials so we're still waiting to get the assessment at all\nUnderstood and and the reason why it is because Rick Scott as governor I think I I've I maintain and I wanted to ask you I again you're meow meteorologists and really don't talk politics what do you think this will impact his performance at the polls the way in which he handles the rebuild or the or the um you know how\nIn order to win the tickets I Need the name of the group and a three rafters and bread\nAnd roses guys right if it's three of\nAll right the only represent\nThe name of the group in order to win the family for a pack here we go aid for for for all four four to six seven that aren't ready to go this time it's time to go to my brother who is a wrap up this year not oh no I'm Sorry

of a sudden he announces he's running for president as a Republican and all of a sudden he becomes raises that just called to tell you that the word is overly\nUse that's what I Believe so I Want to talk about Eric Holder's comment let's play that again if we can Randy this Eric Holder this and Stacey Abrams event when you look at the video you can see the video on my Facebook page\nWhen you look at the video her sons are in the background it's a democratic it's a democratic event because you could see in the background\nThere's signs for all the Democratic candidates in the state and when you see that that means or at home location there is central location that's where people go to get fined for all the different candidates it's a holding\nHouse is a clearing house we have um two on our side of the fence but here's this comment\nYou just time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are to be as dedicated as they are to me is committed as they are Michele always there and show them all over you know my wife like really high um which will scare me [laughter]\nI'm assuming says you know when they go low we know [laughter] they go low we can\nNow couple that with the left\nNow saying there's no mob that they it's a talking point by the Republicans\nCovered that was what Maxine Waters says couples that with Cory Booker couple that with Rand Paul do we have Rand Paul's comments let me go to ramp won't give way this woman Randy\nI was there to ball field ones doing the Lacey almost died\nFrom a very very angry violent man who was inside it really by rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough when he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to\nTwo hundred shots at us shooting five people in almost ... he was yelling this is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket\nBut he was willing to kill so what happens when when Democrats say get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence they might even live next door to you you don't know where these people are for when we shouldn't do is incite people to violence and so\nWe've asked Cory Booker attract those words\nWe've asked uh the Democrats in general to try to ratchet it down and say look we want peaceful dial up\nSo that is Rand Paul he was at the softball game which Steve ... almost lost his life he got beat up by his neighbor six ribs\nAnd a blood intensive rehabilitation he was really hurt it wasn't just hit six ribs broken this guy kind of understand what he's talking about\nAnd you imagine what would be the outcry would be if the laugh if this were happening to people on the left you imagine what the outcry would be how oh one guy one guy carried a gun to a Tea Party rally oh ten thousand people and it just as well and called us\nUh anarchists let's go to Brett Barney and sports\nNight there was a lot going on it's\nWomen's soccer that I Would quotes yeah women's soccer usa did win seven Neal they're not only be Trinidad they also beat tobacco take that one

rebellious and and you don't understand where they're coming from they are being indoctrinated\nAbsolutely um I I've got I got my guess on the line I appreciate your show ... thank you for telling us\nThat and I I have my comments on I'm Angela Davis and just a second but I Want to go to our gas or gas in our own on the phone with us on the show he went to shows Kathy Abraham um is Abraham I'm lost\nHer son um two opioid abuse\nUm and I wanted to have ... have you done so I Know many of my listeners um many of my listeners are have teenagers you guys tell me all the time they're listening

talk to our parents out there who have children young children teenagers or or you know no matter what but they have children to kind of help them with seeing what to look for you know in in in in in in this opioid while we're going through this over your abuse\nSituation so kind of give us a little background what happened with your son\nYeah Joe was I'm\nJoe was a an outstanding athlete and scholar and did well in school popular kid\nAnd probably around eighth grade he\nUh he lost a couple of friends to um cancer and drowning and I could see a shift in him at at that point um I think the pain that he was feeling he started turning to marijuana\nUm which we then became aware of over the summer time and then a through his freshman and sophomore year especially a sophomore year he started to skip school and um I found him sleeping extensively um his mood what changed drastically from under the other\nUm you know he was on his phone a lot he was\nUm avoiding time with family so things like that really stuck out to me\n... now when you said 'cause a sleeping a lot was that a sign of depression or was that a sign of the the drug use\nWell I wasn't sure at first I thought I thought that it was just normal teenage behavior you sleep a lot you sleep extra but when it becomes extended and then come to find out it was really actually because he was um doing some Xanax and some other type of opioid pills that cause them to\nTo leave that extra yeah gotcha so we would go on you would take these kind of pills Xanax all I Know everything that your son participated in early on those were all over the counter drugs miss Abraham\nYes actually he was diagnosed with ADHD so he took you know the the the meds for that he had injuries as a baseball player so he was given pain pills you know so I really feel like a lot of that he was kind of predisposed to\nI think now the addiction tendencies and he liked the way it made them felt and so you know whenever there was a painful moment in his life or he struggled I'm ... and and again as a parent I really didn't know\nYou know there's not a lot of parent education out there um and we just kind of had to shoot in the dark as\nFar as where to go to help 'em and I guess that's where now that we've partner would navigate recovery there are a great resource for people looking for help um you know so there there are things that are coming about now but at the time viewed as a as a parent\nWe just thought maybe it's just normal adolescent experimentation but when the hairs on your neck stand up and you start to wonder you know I Would just tell parents just proceed forward and don't don't ignore it\nWell\nI Want to ask you this what you think about this answer him and I want you to answer it on the other side of this a quick\nBreak and weren't should tell us more about navigate recovery but I also want to ask you ADHD pill medicine pain pills are prescribed by doctors\nAnd he was a young man with a teenager at what point do we as parents we fight back and not fight back but push back when we're our kids and it's such a young age of being diagnosed with such strong medical or medicines\nAre for

will be shocked if how cold the fifties field tomorrow because of how um warm we've been and we really haven't had a good shock of cold air so I think um people will get a rude awakening tomorrow morning if they're not aware of the colder temperatures headed our way\nI've slowly so right now we have cold temperatures heading our way is that because of the time of year or is that because of hurricane Michael\nIt's a combination so uh the steering mechanism for Michael ... is this cold front that's pushing through um that's why you know a couple of days ago we were wondering when it was going to make it right turn to the east and it had to do with\nHow fast that cold front was moving so the ... literally picked up Michael and there's now pushing it off the eastern seaboard and that cold front still going to make a clean pass through our area which then filters and a nice cool crisp fall air\nUh down from Canada so it's a combination of two you know Michael sure had its influence but this cold front\nIs the main driving factor of the cooler air\nAnd when you say the driver it's pushing that's what you mean or\nYeah it's I I just I there are different ways you can phrase it I've one common way I've always said as you know it's just driving a or ushering in that cold air down down from Canada so uh that is\nCommon for this time of year to actually uh unusual we haven't had any you know good fall blast up until it's fairly delayed of the arrival of fall or because remember started three weeks ago\nFall Fishell he started so anxiously awaiting it\nNow you said earlier you're on with us for those of you miss it rhymes on with us a at a earlier this morning and he said there was a possible tornado incident or possible tornado in East Point have you found on a new news on that possible tornado in East Point\nUm I was in communication with the national weather service so right after your show and because of staffing because of how old you know uh how much they

don't I don't know I think\nYou can be I think you can still be a gentleman but there's a payoff for it if you have a really hot date your friends see out whether what the heck I may ask what you're willing to pay for\nIt here my friend I have read the Koran you're acting like you don't have any ... like the guy says hey would you like to go on a date\nSure this woman is\nTotally dishonest with

Chris not insurance it's ah UK based insurance agency take that into consideration first they claim\nCyclists are better drivers than non cyclists that means they're safer on the road whether behind the wheel or behind the handle bars they say this because their reaction time is faster and they're more aware of other drivers and the changing of broke conditions\nThat's probably true because they're on a by I mean I see that yeah I go hog wild yeah I was read on this one yeah I see I mean\nI find that cyclists probably you know they probably pay a lot by these guys but they act like they're in a veteran now that's different the way they act like they the way it's like when they are the biggest a hold on a Red Cloud has a ...\nLot of the biggest a bicycle as they watched it on the owner of the cameras on the weekends\nYou want to be on the road you tag your bike and you get some insurance because if I run you over it's all coming out of my insurance whether it's your fault or

I I think it's a lot worse than than we originally thought it was going to be at least those was up ... farther away from the beach we didn't really pay much attention to it the folks down to Florida knew about it like you said you would go down there to check things but\nUh yeah it's we're looking at the video and you know it's amazing to though I pat is\nIn some of these sections you can see nothing but devastation just rubble just absolute rubble and yet there are a couple of apartment complexes that are still under construction which you're standing just fine I'm assuming that because they have the very latest in hurricane a prevention technology or something\nBut very few of them at all every once in a while it's all devastation and then suddenly there's\nYou know like an apartment complex where two wings are totally on touch because I assume they were built better than the buildings long ago before that\nWriting is coming out of the city but it is highway thirty one that takes you to do ... and it's four lane you know what that divide or in the middle you know and at best that they had two lanes open for about\nTwenty miles because of trees down across the highway and you have to slow down to drive around the trees sometimes up the medium in order to get around it on the road\nWow brutal just man well ... thanks man yeah it devastation is and it's like you know if you've never been through a hurricane or a flood or tornadoes a man I remember a few years ago when they came through Atlanta and we had very close was still married to find a wife were very close friends who lost everything else just disappeared we've just been over there\nAnd it just was gone yet over and done what he yeah he I I was I remember that it would all have done what he was unrecognizable because of all the pine trees that blew over it was like two thousand three or four ... man I couldn't believe and thank God they were\nUh Shelley forgot to ask the question what would happen if we just put a great\nBig sign that said Trump or to sign that said Trump is president or excited said God Bless the president United States Donald Trump\nWould you allow that to be put up there and of course he would he would say no but it has nothing to do with the political science has to do with Donald Trump and these are the same pie oh by the way there's a sales cubicle in this building within two hundred feet of me or that has a a punching bag with Donald Trump's face on it\nBut I guess that's okay\nI guess that's fine [laughter] Donald Trump punching bag\nAnd apparently that's OK why do a lot of outsiders to determine if something's offensive\nYou know he said well we were in sales but we have a business we have a business run into people are upset and don't want to uh buy our business because we're upset and I've got to do something to make them not upset okay we're talking about throwing up sort of a bus not is not even not standing up for us in any way but at least they're consistent in their lack of support\nBut ... but this morning and never mentioned the social media and what they told us to be nicer and social media these are the same haters who called Donald Trump a Nazi and a racist in a white supremacist and every other name of the book everything but a freaking meatloaf sandwich and they've been doing it for years for two years and by the way they're now they've hit now they've ... mysteriously erased\nOr ... and all those earlier tweets that we would love to read forty but can't 'cause they're not disappeared about oh they're vicious hate stuff against Donald Trump\nAnd then she always said well uh you know is if there's just not Donald Trump I mean do you mean is it okay to still talk about Donald Trump and he says you can talk about Donald Trump as much as you want to which is exactly opposite of what he told the whole staff ... when I was out that day was on vacation or or what I guess was vacation\nYeah and they had the big step meeting in the last several stopped talking about Trump all the time you are right wing conservative you're you're you're you're not being inclusive and driving people away all this talk about Trump Trump Trump\nSo you know you didn't get any stories this morning on the ... winter show sorry I'm just telling you it's all a crack\nAnd if we put a Donald Trump sign up here just a big time so we love Donald Trump we loved the price of the United states they'd met that somebody would be offended and to make us take it down because they'll do anything for anybody except us support us in our in our freedom to support the prison United States because we are conservative\nTalk show unbelievable [laughter] but but consistent no no surprises for thirty three holding everything there is a news

Bush doesn't care about black people\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when negroes don't read you know you didn't hear you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou will get what modern day slavery is in this country what is it it is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent\nOn their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say they say no\nBecause we've got employees

Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left I Would argue the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that

on the plantation miss for days or wants to play that audio again this is Kanye West's while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after\nHurricane Katrina George Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great black man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation than the ...\nComes out in ... started singing for himself and starts realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good I I'm saying massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty\nI'm saying are kids that are getting a good education

so much and like you're doing an excellent job thrown into mark\nThank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I had two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt a number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was dying in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and I spoke out\nSomebody of use it that we're going on\nAnd from ... hill quake nut rolls and what have you all of the sudden I seem to have like thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought it had anything but you know mental illness from depression and uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of the two places\nEven up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on there and you're homeless twice I Lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention month\nAnd I think by making it sound as though ... what kind of mental illness whether he ... is not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him the four of them spoke out about Bush\n[noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't it wasn't he got out her day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nIs technically what'd you and just so people know that we were\nWhen we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen World Health or a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I say this\nFirst of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your life uh I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have\nGreat compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly in again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token\nA black man uh and and there and he's taking advantage of using him by putting them out there today no one said any of that when Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative Dan you are on the mark of in Chauvin Fergus and we didn't go ahead\nStole my thunder but the uh uh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was part of the hit that um they check this out so now Herschel walkers going to be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it was horrible at these lessons are doing but that's the whole ... thing let's talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only here my will first he's the only attorney general to be a\nContempt of Congress but that's a whole nother issue when the Obama's going to really you when you know you really going too far in the show probably grab by the ear and said you can't do this for quite yet we're not there yet um\nBut him Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters Democrat power base that's all they do their study violence and then they say it in the in the means of\n... and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide when they when you say they're acting like a mob\nMentality when you have people screaming and beating on the doors the Supreme Court 'cause they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality when you surround a senator like Ted Cruz at dinner\nA that's a mob mentality when you go in and you can you do these eat in and sit ins and scream in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking do you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nDeal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here to to seek out and destroy people when we think about the sadistic mob mentality you have to have\nTo ... to ... to first of all\nYou have a woman that doesn't and Mrs Ford they didn't want her name to come out and you do it anyway so you say we don't care about you were going to use the canary\nWe're going to force you to defend your story about sexual assault so hopefully we can find others it will say the same thing about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then what we're going to do is we're gonna find people to say we had sex we had a boat in the eighties well wait we got to recount the store and there might never happen well he he he actually in high school was was every weekend\nMaking parties for gang rapes and gang banging and and it's running trains on women no one else has ... but we got a porn star lawyer nationality that will that will act like it's a legitimate and we'll throw it on the news\nTo try to find other women out there\nThat this is what I mean this is the left this is what they're doing right now this is the normal for them and the reason why they're doing this is all I or go back to\nWhat I said earlier than there is not a single issue that Democrats can actually run on right now except for personal hate\nAnd and to turn people into villains so that you hate them\nThat's the only way you can't scare people on the economy you can't scare people in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan you can't scare people on on healthcare because you you are the ones that we create the health care disaster\nYou can't scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now is to say this guy's a racist and you don't want to raise has to be in the White House Kanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible what they really have no platform well don't forget they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and\nI'm abolish ice high crime I mean that's what they have to stand on you know speaking about the mob mentality I challenge any of these people to walk down\nI'm downtown Portland or a I've got friends down in Austin, Texas you go to parks down there and it's nothing but a ... and they will seek to living heck out of\nYou you will get the antifa protesters this week there were directing
