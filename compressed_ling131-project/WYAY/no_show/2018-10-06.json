members including this Fifteen year old\nA ... a chopped them up with machetes knives sticks and an ax\nOne of the targets got away he's now a federal government witness\nAnd everybody is describing this was one of the most brutal vicious horrific scenes they've ever seen this kid says I Know I Apologize to the families knowing my apology will not be accepted family was in court crying all the way and uh the lawyers are hoping that his me a couple of we'll just wait other kids from joining the gang he was Fifteen when he set up\nFor murders a jury reaches or oh boy oh they have the jury to Manafort trial eight counts on the Paul Manafort trial they breached agreement on eight\nSo I assume the tent others therefore will no longer be part of a it won't be part of any kind of a ... trial if uh my understanding was if the jury failed to reach anything on anything then it then you could read try him again or they could forget it but they could reach rhyme again\nIf the jury if they're Eighteen pounds in the jury reached has reached a verdict on eight of them then those other ... are going to go by the wayside they can't try and for those other ten after this court verdict\nOr but they have apparently they breached the verdict on it and it doesn't say guilty or innocent but it says they've reached a verdict on eight of the team comes\nAnd by the way my Manafort has to go through another trial after this one he faces a second trial again for nothing to do with Donald Trump the Robert Mueller investigation or has caught Paul Manafort with some banking schemes and not registering as a a a a foreign agent to take money from foreign agents or something\nAnd now he's got he's going to have a second trial and the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen is pleading guilty right now in court\nFor the for the crimes he was caught after Robert Mueller's team\nKidnapped all this information and stole his a tape recordings with his clients his conversations all his lawyers notes and found stuff in there to charge him with the breaking banking laws again with nothing to do with Donald Trump Russia collusion or the campaign\nAnd after Robert murder trial now they got into a banking crooks\nAnd so far and as far as mental unbelievable\nAnd they're making a deal with the president's lawyer Michael Cohen\nA brother and then here uh UNC last night so the kids went back to school and of course they decided to knock over the Confederate memorials statute called silent Sam\nWhich by the way is not real it's not really a thing but the two or three hundred of them a deal UNC last night in Chapel Hill knocked down silent Sam's Confederate statue\nA it was the governor knows that people are frustrated by the change of pace in sharing your frustration but he said violent destruction public property has no place in our communities Simon Sam was a statue erected in Nineteen Thirteen to remember the sons of the university who died for their ... south land and the civil war\nUnited daughters of the confederacy gave the statue to the to UNC in Nineteen eighty nine\nOr but some uh some black students or of seeing the school spending too much money to maintain a statue the glorifies enslavement of my ancestors dedicated by a man who took pleasure and beating a black woman on our campus erected by a group of people praised the KKK protectors of white womanhood\nAnd the same woman who is a PHD student [noise] UNC as soon as she went there to the statue and to put her red ink and her own blood on the statue and she's facing charges of criminal intent and also explosion from UNC that'll be the day for thirty three\nHold on news ... news regular line or good afternoon or\nGood afternoon game it it is you have friends and colleagues are really

and tax evasion charges which they didn't know about it until they stole all the stuff out of his offices and as a law for eye and Paul Manafort is apparently guilty on one count\nAt least ten were thrown out by the judge\nAnd I don't know anybody that's all that's all I Know that it's coming out in the bits and pieces\nApparently a Manafort guilty on it\nAlan ... jury undecided on ten\nOkay the

she took his place in opposition to one and the Philippines Ida four fifty eight on the new\nTalk one of those six seven eight for for for all for ten sixty seven you know what they're going to try to prove\nThat it's a bit iffy from the beginning\nRobert Mueller is going to try to nail Donald Trump in the following way he's going to say that Michael Cohen has just admitted that Michael Cohen the president's lawyer\nViolated campaign laws by paying off Stormy Daniels so that she wouldn't negatively affect Donald Trump's campaign\nSo Mueller's going to say that because Donald Trump tried to use a bribe to pay a slut not to embarrass him during the campaign he was using an illegal donation basically to pay off a tramp\nSo that she wouldn't turn on him during the campaign which would be helping his campaign so they're going to claim that Donald Trump violated federal campaign laws by paying the tramp us to keep her mouth\nShut which would have affected his campaign and that's how they're going to try to get Donald Trump oh man\nThis is real they run a duly elected president out of office over something this negligible this country is going to explode tell you I I I'll and I'll be right there I I Will I Will lead it until they take the off the air\nI mean this this is really appalling two years I've been doing this millions of dollars and he's got two guys in trial for tax evasion and a a banking fraud counts and now he's going to try to complain that Donald Trump knew all about it from the beginning and tried to pay off Stormy Daniels to help his campaign that day was twelve years ago\nTwelve years ago\nAnd she signed an agreement to shut up and then broke the agreement\nI don't know why she hasn't been sued\nMe they're confidential agreements are serious that they haven't for a reason\nNot anymore not anymore anyway it looks like Manafort's going to be in big trouble\n[noise] higher\nHigher drew oh did they\nGet it together later you're ready on your dog to target\n[noise] [noise] higher\nAnd higher out who\n... road guards I don't\n\n\nBelieve me it's only the gym or the new talk one of those six seven it was recognized government sponsored by all four

this is one of the most brutal vicious horrific scenes they've ever seen this kid says I Know I Apologize for the families knowing my apology will not be accepted family was in court crying all the way and uh the lawyers are hoping that his me a couple of will dissuade other kids from joining the gang he was Fifteen when he set up\nFor murders a jury reaches or oh boy oh they have a jury the Manafort trial eight counts on the Paul Manafort trial they've reached agreement on eight\nSo I assume the tent others therefore will no longer be part of a it won't be part of any kind of a ... trial\nIf my understanding was if the jury failed to reach anything on anything then it then you could read try him again or they could forget it but they could return andme again if the jury if they're Eighteen counting the jury reached has reached a verdict on eight of them than those other ten are going to go by the wayside they can't try and for those other ten\nAfter this court verdict uh but they have apparently they've reached a verdict on it and it doesn't say guilty or innocent but it says they've reached a verdict on eight of the Eighteen counts\nAnd by the way my Manafort has to go through another trial after this one he faces a second trial again for nothing to do with Donald Trump the Robert Mueller investigation or has caught\nPaul Manafort with some banking schemes and not registering as a a a a foreign agent to take money from foreign agents or something and now he's ... he's going to have a second trial and the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen is pleading guilty right now in court\nFor the for the crimes he was caught after Robert Mueller's team or\nKidnapped all his information and stole his a tape recordings with his clients his conversations all his lawyers notes and found stuff in there to charge him with the breaking banking laws\nAgain with nothing to do with Donald Trump Russia collusion or the campaign\nAnd that's your Robert motor trial now they got into a banking crooks\nAnd so far and as far as mental unbelievable\nAnd they're making a deal with the president's lawyer Michael Cohen\nA brother and then here uh UNC last night so the kids went back to school and of\nThey decided to knock over a Confederate memorials statue called silent Sam which by the way is not real it's not really a thing but the uh two or three hundred a ...

Senate it up yeah I Know now that it's finally time for yours truly Donald J tramp JFK anyway no stands but she says\nIt's time for me to take out the glass skimmer okay ancestor really corrupt

what the hell do you get like Mark Aaron canceled\nHis late night truck a show you know the two in the morning rush to Alexandria, Virginia when I fly\nWell you heard the Manafort jury might be hung\nWell how how do I tell you\nThis week I was a ... do you deal with the president if there's a lot to be funny when you're facing impeachment [laughter] it was the president\nAnd by the way apparently the judge has declared a mistrial on ten pounds in the Paul Manafort trial [noise] you'll see on at least one count I guess are coming out with the right now I'm there to trials going on Michael\nAbout blown up pleading guilty of Michael Cohen the Trump lawyer is pleading guilty to campaign finance and bank fraud and tax evasion charges which they didn't know about until they stole all the stuff out of his offices and as a law for Paul Manafort is apparently guilty on one count\nAt least ten were thrown out by the judge\nAnd I don't know anybody that's all that's all I Know that it's coming out in the bits and pieces so apparently a Manafort guilty on eight counts jury undecided on ten\nOkay the verdict is reached on eight pounds but he's guilty on at least one we don't know how many they breached the verdict you could be innocent on the account on at least seven counts are seeing guilty on one\nOf the reporters no running out of the of the office to try to get through their phones so they call it in your listening to the gym or show replay\nWell gosh this is ... and you're listening to a rape play of the cameras show you know I Love the camera because he never minds it went up but in Galway\nBoosters Dr ... portion of our show it was brought to you by the ... on like the camera yeah even the Amish by airline tickets on line now here's your host trapped in the fifties\nForty two how you doing do maybe going to become\nThe new talk one of those examples here in St Paul Manafort now apparently guilty on eight counts and others were toss [noise]\nOr hung jury is just so he was found guilty and eight pounds in his front trial so that's going to be some serious stuff [noise]\nAnd then he has another trial after this one\nTime and again has nothing to do with Donald Trump's campaign or Donald Trump running for president or Donald Trump and the Russians were anything nothing [noise]\nOh my God how\nWas who's had pets so what's your name that's Tiffany\nOh my gosh six Evan Tracey David ... who said that if like actors really tailor synthesis Sandy hey we have to be forty six sports I remember him and the headline\nReads six seven trades Davis just six days of the fan yeah that'll happen a player to be named later takes a swing at the camera before the party\nSo Mueller's going to say that because Donald Trump tried to use a bribe to pay a slut not to embarrass him during the campaign he was using any illegal donation basically to pay off a tramp\nSo that she wouldn't turn on him during the campaign which would be helping his campaign so they're going to claim that Donald Trump violated federal campaign laws by paying the tramp us to keep her mouth shut\nWhich would have affected his campaign and that's how they're going to try to get Donald Trump oh man\nThis is real they run a duly elected president out of office over something this negligible this country is going to explode\nTell you I I I'll and I'll be right there I I Will I Will lead it until they take me off the air\nI mean this this is really appalling two years I've been doing this millions of dollars and he's got two guys in trial for tax evasion and a a banking fraud counts and now he's going to try to claim that Donald Trump knew all about it from the beginning and tried to pay off Stormy Daniels to help his campaign was twelve years ago\nTwelve years ago\nAnd she signed an agreement to shut up and then broke the agreement I don't know why she hasn't been sued I mean you know confidential agreements are serious them for a reason not\nAny more not that any more anyway it looks like Manafort's going to be a big truck\n[noise] higher\nHigher who didn't\nGet it together later showed ready on your dog or\n[noise] [noise] higher\nHigher out

sixty seven here's Jay on the new talk what else except with the camera OJ thanks for calling you on the\nRadio towers are very well Sara what's going on\nGood I'm hoping to make two comments about the uh the not too was deported\nThe last known Nazi collaborator living in America the blast when they know of Ninety five year old former camp guard up played an indispensable role in the murders of thousands of Jews apparently six thousand killed in one day where he was and he said known about him for Twenty years and he finally got deported a welcome aboard what do you want to say about the guy\nOkay the first thing was that I had the correct in our day it made earlier in the day when they went to retrieve the Ninety five year old man they accidentally grab Bernie Sanders by mistake [laughter] and then it one other thing was when there were were removing the Nazi from his home yeah he had to be ... or\n... not because he was resisting is because they had forgotten to bring their district were later\nTold hey Ninety five year old ho house two girls\n[laughter]\nHave acted Nuremberg a British and Ninety five year old guy but apparently was an armed guard at a that'd be ... labor camp and help to kill six thousand Jews in one day in Nineteen forty three one day that\nIs what Fox called the polish camp camp yeah uh and by the way that he was telling me the polish people are not very happy with it because every they're describing is at a at a polish death camp well it happened to be in Poland but it wasn't run by the polls show putting trust me it was done by the German polish had nothing to do with it\nSo I mean there's there just wasn't a polish death cab who happened to be there but\nAnyway so they're trying to make the point he had his citizenship revoked Fifteen Years ago he appealed and that was denied in two thousand five\nAnd a ... and find a way this guy maintain friendships with Nazi guards who also came to America under false pretenses back when he did in the late Fort like Nineteen forty nine and how about this for in a a coincidence\nThe Nazi and his wife bought a home in Queens near La Guardia airport in Nineteen sixty six\nThey bought that whole near La Guardia airport in Queens from a polish couple who were Jewish and survive the Holocaust slowly and he bought their house\nThey didn't know anything about it but they do about it now and a great he's been deported\nSix thousand and by the way a he was saying well I was a you know I was a German and during the war but he he denies that he was responsible for the thing and then you have the whole question of gay and even even the German government is saying this was a troubling situation where they call it ah the U.S ambassador\nTo Germany called it a difficult task\nDeporting this guy back to Germany and no one's going to do with them\nThere I assume I don't want to put them on trial he won't be dead you know ... before too long I Can't imagine so but I was going to happen to him now I don't know but this has been going on for almost\nTwenty years actually more than Twenty years from time to his neighbors first realized that he was a belief was announced anyway they're going to and then people are saying hey wait a minute it was just following orders [laughter] you know and here's the other thing I actually did think about this I suppose you it was Nineteen\nForty one and you were drafted into the German army and given a gun and helmets and stuff and he said he our guard this uh entrance to this camp here and is it okay so you're guarding the entrance to the camp that's all you did was ... to the camp you didn't shoot anybody just stood there and guard at the entrance for a couple of years in the war was over are you a Nazi war criminal\nYou know you didn't have to be a notch you to be in now and then where am I right you know you just ... war criminal not necessarily Nazi but I mean if you'd anything that didn't stop the slaughter or whatever I mean I don't know I I don't have an answer to that but clearly a ... this last known one Ninety five years old\nSo you've got you've got you gotta you gotta do it you know the

all for ten sixty seven one zero six seven eight for for for all for ten sixty\nSeven this was a very day in Nineteen Seventy two grace slick got sprayed with me\nAnd Paul can't or got body slammed or the floor when police showed up after a Jefferson Airplane show in Akron, Ohio somebody phoned in a bomb threat fans started throwing rocks at the top the cops responded with tear gas and then all hell broke loose in Nineteen Seventy two in Akron, Ohio Jefferson Airplane\nNineteen Ninety six on this day Rick James gotten out of prison regime served two years for beating up a woman remember that story but ironically this day two days earlier in Ninety six the woman he was going to marry got put in jail for shoplifting a pair of thirty nine dollar boots seat [noise]\nUh let's see ... up happening around the same time yeah been on that in the report like three or four yeah yeah absolutely I almost every day or every other day as a regimes in Ninety six or ... from the blacklist is thirty nine years old today and Brooks wheel in the comedian from Saturday Night live is thirty two and\nFour Fifteen quarter after ... repeats coming up later all the crap it's almost baseball we have a game tonight at a seven year on at six for five six o'clock and we won last night ... just in Colorado Rockies cooked for in a row from is yeah Pittsburgh we want\n... as a ... well any way when we're absolutely Windsor good uh aid for for for all for ten sixty seven a lot of things going on including Michael Cohen the president's personal lawyers in court right now pleading guilty\nTo a\nBank fraud and tax evasion or something again and has nothing to do with Donald Trump's election has nothing to do with Donald Trump's so called Russian collusion Paul Manafort's jury is now in its fourth day they sent another note to the judge\nAnd clearly they're stuck on something we don't know whether they're stuck on one of the Eighteen things or on all parts of the things we don't know\nBut there are Manafort jury is a has a new send the new no to the judge so they're struggling with something\nOr if I'm guessing I there's no way talking I'm totally guessing my guess is they're going to have to convict him of something or else the field they waste your time wasted our time I think I'm guessing so that probably get 'em convicted or something but I don't know whether it'd be won't be ugly will be everything by a long shot\nAnd how about this story here in Georgia very very sad story ally handwritten could've been a lot worse oh\nAlexandra Suarez is uh twenty six year old mother\nExcuse me [noise] uh who uh\nHad her kids in the car she took two children inside their grandmother's house a couple of weeks ago\nActually about ten days ago I took two kids into her grandmother into the grandmother's house and left them there and then she went about her business and then realized that she had left another kid in the car\nFor about three hours a three year old child she left in the car outside the grandmother's house now this was in the afternoon eight o'clock that night the woman ... what she had done and called nine one one\nAnd said my God Bless my kid in the car and so the cop showed up and they arrested her\nAnd they took the boy to a physical checkup at the hospital he's in good condition he's fine uh but uh miss Juarez was arrested for child\nWell he even though she said oh my God my kids in the car called the cops and make sure he was okay for them to the hospital is going to be fine and now she's arrested she's being cooperative with the police but my God she's charged with second degree cruelty to children\nUh she drop your kids off at grandma's house third was had fallen asleep in the car or she\nWent home and realize later it was like eight o'clock you realize that kid was must still be in the car and she called the cops on herself and they arrested her and put her in jail what happens when you were a snitch\nThat's right things do you know your\nSelf snitching a slightly different story\nOr a for for for all for ten sixty seven you know I don't understand how Michael Cohen can be an all this trouble\nAs Trump's lawyer when the only reason he's in trouble is because the FBI broke into his office and is a home and his condo apartment that he said stays him and he's not home with the family and they stole all the stuff including all this tape recordings is a uh conversations with clients including the president United States all his lawyers notes\nAnd then they supposedly are saying well we only looked at the ones that are relevant to our charge uh-huh they took 'em all they took all of it\nIf it's not it's not rocket stop on time yes exactly what they did that's what they did\nAnd the same thing with Manafort wasn't a Manafort they broke into his house at three o'clock in the morning or something if he would have showed up and then he went to they would have said hey come on down we're going to rescue night I'll be I'll be there\nI mean but no they show up to you know break into the house Brad class and the doors and just to show Donald Trump and by the way Manafort his trial has nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing and Michael Cohen his pleading guilty today has to do with his tax evasion and his bank fraud has nothing to do with Donald Trump's presidency or\nA campaign or the Russians\nSo so far Robert Mueller's investigation for millions of dollars over two years has resulted in two trials that have nothing to do with Donald Trump\n\nBetter and you know he's not going to ... he is not going to ever clear Donald Trump Mohler we'll never clear Donald Trump he'll have a final report that will never said Donald Trump did nothing wrong he will never have report clearing them\nIs it just disgraceful and you know that my mother and call me are best friends and best with close friends best friends for Twenty years\nI tell you this whole thing is just a ... it's obviously a conflict of interest when when Donald Trump talks about the angry Democrats I mean my God the fix was in from the beginning the same people who tried to fix the election for Hillary Rodham PC give our cabbage or fixing the trials the federal empire out of control it is\nExactly what it is\nA will and they're still trying to do the metaphor jury is still the sort of knew no we don't know what it is it will if we find out will tell you obviously but holy moly\nOh oh oh [laughter]\nThat camera show replay whom I was ... and I always listen to a replay of the camera issue because you never know what might\nPop up\nThe cameras on a weekday afternoon lived three to six PM on the new talk what six seven years just sprinted toward him at this flashing of ice shelf is brought you by Stormy Daniels storming was now appearing on celebrity big brother yeah yeah stormy said she wanted to see\nHis late night truck a show you know they wanted to in the morning rush to Alexandria, Virginia wonder why why\nWhy we heard the Manafort jury might be hung well how how to tell you this week I was\nActually a very good show to do with the president to be funny when you're facing impeachment [laughter] it was the president\nAnd by the way apparently the judge has declared a mistrial on ten pounds in the Manafort trial [noise] guilty on at least one count I guess are coming out with the right now I'm there to trials going on Michael\nAbout blown up pleading guilty of Michael Cohen the Trump lawyer is pleading guilty to campaign finance and bank fraud and tax evasion charges which they didn't know about until they stole all the stuff out of his offices and as a law for eye and Paul Manafort is apparently guilty on one count\nAt least ten were thrown out by the judge\nAnd I don't know anybody that's all we necessarily know that it's coming out in the bits and pieces so apparently a Manafort guilty on eight counts jury undecided on ten\nOkay the verdict is reached on eight pounds but he's guilty on at least one we don't know how many they breached the verdict you could be innocent on the ... at least seven counts we're seeing guilty on one of the reporters no running out of the of the office to try to get to their phones to call it in your listening to the commercial replay\nWhale dog like this is ... and you're listening to a rape player the cameras show you know I Love the camera because he never minds it went up but in Ga\nSays Dr ... all of our show is brought to you by the ... on like the Kim Jong il even the Amish by airline tickets on line

guilty on eight counties\nAnd others were toss [noise]\nFor a hung jury is just so he was found guilty on eight pounds in his front trial so that's going to be some serious stuff\nAnd then he has another trial after this one\nTime and again it has nothing to do was Donald Trump's campaign or Donald Trump running for president or Donald Trump and the Russians or anything else nothing [noise]\nA guy\nWho is this whole who's had pets so what's her name that's Tiffany\nOh my gosh six Evan Tracey Davis is six eighty to ... who said that and it's like actors and Taylor symptoms Sandy hey we have

know still hurts to talk my ... my tongue the other day and it still hurts every and every time I talk in hurts that again just ... and ... does it matter\nHow how do you stop you can't you can't do

intent others\nAnd I don't know about\nWhat is what is essentially going to be or anything else in appealing all of a just just coming down right now and Michael Cohen the president's personal lawyer is also in court pleading guilty to\nTax fraud and tax evasion or something in the bank fraud or are they getting things had nothing to do with Donald Trump in the so called Russian collusion which is all fake or Donald Trump's anything so nice cool and Robert Mueller has the FBI sweep\nThe office of the president's personal lawyer taking all of his tape recordings conversations is notes files and looking through it and they finally got him to plead guilty to something\nCongratulations in fact a a peach going to have a story coming up about the uh uh Washington Nationals and something a move that might have or might indicate that uh things are not going to go too well for some\nReason I mention I wanted to say the whole thing but the reason I mentioned that is because uh the former or one of the the ... best morning man in America Tom Hughes the king\nIs a is a checking on what's going on in Washington right now the nationals and made a few trade so dark days in Washington every man for himself rats leaving the sinking ship but enough about those gnats\n[laughter] [laughter] the repeal heavy I've only grab a sports here and a half an hour or something like that up for forty six
