our country listened to Reagan bashing those immigrants\nAnd stay home I'd otherwise be held by citizens or legal end because the public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayer wash burdens and that's why our admitted Nazi moved aggressively to secure our borders more oh by hiring a record number of new border guard oh my God I only twice as many criminal aliens ... by cracking down on

Dennis ... illegal aliens in the workplace was that was one of them ended by the commission headed by former congresswoman Barbara joined ... gate those we are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws it is wrong and ultimate\nSelf defeating a for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration law God we have seen in recent years and we must do more to start a new crop of\nReagan condemning those dirty sinking immigrants coming into\nOh wait did I play the wrong oh God that was Bill Clinton [noise] oh\nWe need to raise that because we wouldn't want anybody

issues and if they're claiming asylum from you know the poverty is not a reason for asylum but if you're being raped and tortured or something then that's one of the excuses for asylum\nSo we'll find

president Biden who spoke to reporters Thursday in Buffalo New York\nAnd shouting lock her up is not the same thing as saying mail her a bomb it may in fact lead people to condemn each other at higher rate we talked about that yesterday but it is not in fact incitement to violence a scanner for incitement to violence is for nearly Hi Andrew American law as well it should be\nPresident Trump reacted to all of this yesterday and his first statement was we all have to unify you know you're trying times but we all have to understand that violence is not appropriate\nAnd I just wanted to use it in these times we have to unify we have to come together and should one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nOkay well that seems about the right answer doesn't it\nThat's the right answer and what he really should add at the end of that is listen I use charge Frederick my opponents used trucks rhetoric\nMaybe we should take a step back and tell them that down but the reality is that nobody not me not my political opponents nobody has actually incentive by this kind of violence in the United states nobody in the United states inciting this kind of violence in mainstream political rhetoric which is true okay to actually want to\nMainstream violence being pushed by political agitator all you have to do is look at actual government in Iran where they literally chant death to America and call for violence against Jews all you have to do is look at governments around the world repressive governments around the world and make clear they want violence done to their political opponents\nEven President Trump's were statements where he's making jokes about ... what you're talking about last week body slamming report there was an actual difference it turns out between body slamming reporter and bombing someone now if somebody went out and punch reporter and then I did it because President Trump was making this sort of remark about raging forte making light of that\nI Would say okay there's at least some connection there I'm not going to say that there's a connection between people sending mail bomb and Maxine Waters and the president of the United states saying that Maxine Waters is a very low IQ individual\nWe hit a kind of stuff about each other all the time in a free country maybe it's not the best thing to say but that doesn't mean it's an incitement to violence\nIs kind of stuff has to stop it really does but the media are not stopping it and President Trump buyers back in just a second\nThe media obviously are not lowering the temperature is amazing to watch members of the media claim that violent rhetoric began with President Trump or overheated rhetoric non violent rhetoric overheated rhetoric began with President Trump if it weren't for Trump we wouldn't have anything like this really\nRice in racing was sent to Senator Susan Collins two weeks ago a year and a half ago a Bernie Sanders supporter shot or tempted to shoot thirty six congresspeople and nearly killed the house majority what\nDonald Trump juniors white was sent an actual toxic substance she had to go to the hospital for like two and a half months ago\nNo this is not all from no it didn't start with Trump this has been true in the United states for very long time people use charged political rhetoric that does not mean violence is okay but violence has been commonplace in political circles for literally decades\nIn the Nineteen sixties and seventies bombings were actually quite routine in the United states they're not routine thank God now we have an eye out for them as well we should but to pretend that effort in the world began spending with President Trump is just absurd especially considering some of the rhetoric and its use on a fairly frequent basis by folks on the left about President Trump himself\nSo for example today in the New York times or yesterday in the New York times there's an actual piece in the New York times is a fiction piece to five novelist imagine Trump's next chapter\nIn the in the New York Times Book review section and here's what they say they take our focus here as a book reviews on books and stories but also on how the books being written in red reflect the world outside of books and one of the biggest stories out there of course is the ... investigation and the relationship between Trump and food and\nIt's hard not to speculate about what might happen next that and we thought who better than some of today's most talented spy and crime novel is\nOne of these novel is the person who's really sharp here's Joey sharp wrote isn't the pages of the New York Times Book review that quote\nThe Russian landed a Dell is after forty eight hours traveling of necessity came from Moscow by circuitous routes a long way with very specific task there'll be no return flight and the airport bars the TVs were tuned to different news channels but the story was the same\nFor the president's campaign manager then his lawyer Republican congressman former aide family members those words indicted were subpoena house arrest had become fashionable\nAnd then it goes on and on about how this guy was basically shadowing the president of the United states and here's where where's always sharp gets to the key\nWhen it was time he went downstairs took his place in the lobby before the entourage appeared the hotel staff have been lined up and see their boss the president go buy a few of them applauded most did not the president didn't seem to notice he waved and has its sultry fashion the secret service agents clustered around him assured him toward the armored limo idling outside of the curb\nThe Russian waited until they were a few steps past before you drew the gun\nDecided on the center of the presidents back and squeeze the trigger\nThe mackerel missed fired the secret service agents at the president shoulder heard the collection going into a crowd you registered the scene instantly drawings or weapon with razor edge reflected\nThe Russian tasted failure he closed his eyes and waited to pay the costs it did not come he opened his eyes the secret service agents did before him presenting his glock but first hear the agents had lightly used mind\nIf it's just printed in New York Times the same day that the media decided that President Trump was the one who is pursuing violent rhetoric and was the only one pursuing violent rhetoric\nSo I'll take a step back here everyone is overheated it needs to stop a few things can be cruel wants one wait for all the evidence to don't blame non violent but overheated rhetoric for violence and three if you want to take the temperature down you have to obey wanting to\nIf you want to take the temperature down wait for evidence and don't blame people for violent act by third parties unless they're actively telling the third parties to commit the ...\nWhat about our country that's what we're all going to need to do and that means don't come to confirmation bias\nAs soon as humanly possible okay I'm gonna get through the media is response to all of this which is just egregious and then President Trump's response to the media but first let's talk about your underwear guy's fall is here as you switch out your wardrobe don't let your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade to reach soccer draws on this fall colors in print from Tommy John Tommy John it's just fantastic under where it's so good\nMy kids took it out of my door and started wearing an around this morning I Am not kidding five pairs of them one over the other\nThat Tommy John as my kids love it Tommy John obsesses over every little detail in such using proprietary fabric to perform like nothing you've ever warm before as a result\nTommy John men's and women's underwear sworn to know what you guarantee would've been helpful at high school comfortable staple waistband and a range of fabric that are luxurious lease off other like moisture ... reasonable designed to move with you not against you that means no bunch you know riding up\nTommy John his so confident in their underwear that if you don't love your first pair you get a full refund their best burial everywhere or it's free guaranteed so you got nothing to lose\nAnd this includes their women's underwear to now fully back in ... hurry to Tommy John dot com now and he's probably been for twenty percent off your first order that's probably been for twenty percent off only at Tommy John dot com again Tommy John ... for twenty percent off the media\nHave decided that President Trump is to blame which was predictable Paul Waldman\nIn the Washington Post actually just blame the president of the United states straight out he says allow me to suggest that blame is too narrow way to make sense of a series of attempted bombing aimed at precisely the people from another Republican spend a huge amount of time ...\nWe don't have to look for clues about whether the person responsible as a ... or what their party registration is we don't have to assign directly and beyond a reasonable doubt well we can say that given what Trump has Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact I Wonder it took this long\nSo in other words you don't need to wait for evidence right there's a guy who's overtly making the case in one of the nation's premier newspapers you don't need to wait for evidence if you wait for evidence then you're doing something wrong and said I'm going to jump to the conclusion I wanted to jump to which is that President Trump is responsible for all of that\n... years a woman that does not trust the Trump advocate violence against

[noise]\nWelcome back\nTo the bench of hero Shasta CNN making the case that the president of the United states is responsible for this spate of male bombing attack again without any of that they have no idea who this person is or why they're doing it but what do you need evidence for when you hate the president\nWhen when they suggest that President Trump not liking his political opposition is to blame for somebody sending bombs to members of the political opposition all I have said you are trying to outlaw politics in the end what you're trying to outlaw get political opposition\nWhen I spoke at Berkeley there are people outside chanting speeches violence that's basically the chat this happening on CNN her headquarters here but it's completely hypocritical by the way also because what the ... and what the folks at the end and really mean is it features only violence is coming from the right\nHere's an example so Don Lemon written it from you know President Trump is blaming members of the media anything mean any being cruel it's at night he's letting members of the media but really the victims in all of that well\nLet's be real they're the victims of the bomber but they're not necessarily the victims of President Trump the media can stand on their own two feet and they're fully capable of fighting back against the president as they have been for the last three years\nHere is Don Lemon thing President Trump blame the victim\nNumber I blame the victim tonight cheap for him to sit there and blame us were the victims here and only a disgusting\nAnd he just you know what were the victims here were the victims here again CNN were the victims\nBut not a president from not when it comes to that hey president from what they did the overheated rhetoric on the part of the media are contributing to a bad environment the United states and the response of the folks in the media is much overheat the rhetoric even more\nAnd I'm Sorry but this is this is over done okay they yep Kris ... hugging each other outside of CNN you know in the middle of a segment\n... them doing this you\nTake the gruesome facts the opportunity to be better if you'd rather have a good show you very much to be careful\nYou know all all the folks who are or acting as though there is some sort of existential threat to the media in the United states I'm Sorry no I'm Sorry no there isn't okay this is a bad incident there's no question it's a bad incident\nThe reason I have a little bit of lack of sympathy for that we we almost died here regime is because this thing was stopped in the mail room with no detonator on it apparently\nMy Jewish high school used to be evacuated three times a year for a bomb threat minimum three times a year and you know what it wasn't people hugging and kissing outside because\nThere are crazy people out there there are crazy people out there but the way the CNN is reading that is that it's not crazy people it's perfectly sane people who are being directed by the president of the United states to attack them they're an institution under assault by the president the who is calling for violence on behalf of his of his political friends\nNo no and you don't get to do this I'm Sorry dumb and does not get to do this routine or the media are the victims at the same time that he is out there claiming that antifa is wonderful this is just a couple of months ago there's just a couple of months ago Don Lemon claiming that antifa an actual violent ... grew up in the United states is totally fine\n'em knowing condones violence but there were different reasons for empty foot and for these neo Nazis or to either one racist ... the other groups fighting racist fashion\nOr they're not that bad I mean they're just fighting racist fashion antifa it's it's just\nAgain everyone is garbage okay the memorial today show everyone is garbage going good mad yard and they say\nIt I Know the evidence dab in the morning some of the show run and you're getting Israeli jet rather Raul ... and I just talk about whatever pops in my brain lame me cough and just get your own golfing critic I felt that by then I come in without any conflict in the late ... gotten me saying don't go\nTo say there is no can actually Richard what Trump is about Hillary Clinton Brock Obama earth colder John Brennan and CNN and the thinking of a person who said those type bombs is foolhardy how do you know that you don't know that\nHe doesn't know that because he doesn't know thing everybody assumes the worst on behalf of everybody else and instead of saying there's a difference between he'd political rhetoric and violent political rhetoric we just jump in with both feet the Democrats are even worse than the media and that's because the Democrats are absolutely hypocritical\nAnd absurd so Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer put out a statement\nOn that are on on the attempted bombing and here is what they said this emily's an audio recording over at the wire\nAnd she says Senate minority leader Senator Chuck Schumer and house minority leader\nNancy Pelosi lashed out at president Donald Trump in a statement released Wednesday afternoon appeared jointly condemned the statement from the president you should earlier in the day expressing his concern over a series of suspected explosive devices sent the prominent Democrats they take we listened with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we'll take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people\nAnd that is our first responsibility however President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that can do an act of violence\nTime and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body slammed reporter the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville his supporters of rallies you get violent with protesters dictators around the world and murder of their own citizens and referring to the free press and the enemy of the people\nNow I think President Trump in a while back up have I been unclear about this but you're

Clinton for exposing national security secrets to prying eyes outside it's not quite the same thing Hillary Clinton actively attempted to conceal documents from government discovery specifically for our own political motive in in the process\nUp exposing secrets maybe to foreign adversary\nPresident Trump however appears to have been using his cell phone in ways that exposed secrets to America's enemies as well maybe there is a story from the New York times on President Trump calls old friends on one of ... on the gossip rape or was it the latest take on how he's doing\nAmerican intelligence reports indicate Chinese spies are often listening and put them to use invaluable insights into how to best work the president and effect administration policy current and former American officials said Mr Trump's age repeatedly warned him cell phone calls are not secure they told him Russian Spies are routinely eavesdropping on the calls\nBut aides say that the president who's been pressured into using his White House landline more often these days has still refuse to give up\nHis eyes on White House officials say they can only hope you refrain from discussing classified information when he's on the\nPresident should not be doing it now the president has an idea count the president said that he has not done any of that that you know this is all fake news again it's all fake news\nMaybe it's fake news and maybe it's not it's not that the president please stop doing this okay like really it's not good and if we really believe that it's bad to expose America's national security secrets you prying eyes and we probably shouldn't be doing it on our side either in other news\nThe stock market has taken a massive hit this month it is now at a ... year remember already in October so that means that all the games and left him most where basically raised\nOver the course of an October the Dow Jones industrial average dropped six hundred and eight point twenty four thousand five hundred eighty three and race all with gains for twenty Eighteen yes and the five hundred dropped frequent one percent to two thousand six hundred fifty second term negative for the year\nWhy while the earnings are down so a lot of the tech earnings are down and also there are a lot of fears about the idea that the economy was overheated in advance of the of the terrorists that President Trump has put in place against China so people basically stocked up on products before the terrorists were set to hit and that means that there are a lot of four cats at the economy is actually not going to grow as much\nNext quarter we have yet to see whether that is the case also the housing numbers are down there's a lot of uncertainty heading into the end of year according to Jay Jay kind of hand chief market strategist at ...\nAnd just get it feels like people feel more comfortable sending short term rather than long term now is quite possible some of this has to do with the midterm elections the feeling the Democrats\nCould get into power and then start signing every possibility of deregulation\nThat they could be looking to raise taxes again\nThen you could look to cut a deal President Trump's you raise deficit and to blow out the spending\nThat's going to have some impact on the market as well that's why it's imperative that if you like if you like ... if you want to keep their economy if you like every time you can keep your economy but only if you keep electing the people who brought you that economy namely the Republicans in Congress\nEven more so than the president the Republicans in Congress responsible for President Obama not getting through his worst\nHis worst legislative proposals and they had been effects awaiting President Trump's economic policy for the last couple of years as well\nNow what are the chances that the Republicans were tend to how well they've been moving in the wrong direction and house there's according to five thirty five and six chance that Democrats win control of the house the Senate however is a little bit different so therefore casting that the Senate is going to be held by the Republicans in all likelihood\nAnd they say that right now the the Senate is about Seventy five percent likely or that the Senate is is I get yet five and six chance Republicans keep control of the Senate and they may gain up to to see two three four seats they say that there is a a Seventeen point eight percent chance\nThat everything remains salad there is a ... basically well within the bell curve that Republicans pick up anywhere from three to three to four seats to foresee so that he was the most likely outcome at this point\nYou know all of that has led people on the rights jets that maybe this

that one of the things they've been saying yes they said yesterday was oh oh Trump defended this congressman who assaulted a reporter\nWhat Trump was saying was I can use this guy in my cabinet he was saying that in the congressional he was saying that the guys congressional law a district that the guy's a\nCongressman ed in a state that he's a congressman and one of those people do they shared they didn't cheer because of congressmen shove the guy and assaulted the guy that share because the guy was defending himself against the reporter not be heat I'm just pushing because he was a reporter reporter was being a you know what to him\nNow not condoning the congressman I'm just telling you that it's it it was a Trump calling for violence but that's what you guys keep saying this is our Jeffrey too but\nThere are all people that Donald Trump aides they are all\nAre people that he has used violent ugly incendiary rhetoric against what via whether it's journalists like CNN where there were John Brennan letter was addressed or Hillary Hillary Clinton\nYou know from the lock her up chants violent rhetoric is not you know there is a lot of false equivalence that goes on in these discussions when we say well you know here in Florida right now tone down their rhetoric is just not a both sides issue this is a Donald Trump issue Donald Trump is the only one who has been using

allow those are all the people in stoked by nature towards that group really also say sure hold on\nLet me break it down on when he came down that thing he said they're sending us they're sending us their rapists\nAnd murderers and the drug dealers he didn't say all Mexicans are rapists drug dealers and rape is he said Mexico was sending us their drug dealers they're rapists and murderers he never said all of them were but even if he did\nFor that and that that's the truth you can re look it up I mean you could look it up yourself but even if he did say oh Mexicans are rapists ... are are are murderers and rape is that that that's calling for violence on them\n\nWell basically it's a it's still a little animosity towards ...\nWho is calling from Cleveland so the black lives matter is stoking a whole bunch of a a whole bunch of rhetoric and and dislike and hatred towards police right no\nI wouldn't say that because one on it it ... it's on just how many people die every year in the United states from getting killed by police ... eleven or twelve hundred people a year I mean so if\nWhich is a great friday mash up easy and Johnny Cash and say well you may have the money you're talking about violent lyrics Matt door I shot him in Reno just to watch him die that's some violent lyrics right there right\nWhat's going on\nThat means if no one is in there and we play in the door

I don't think anybody ever doubted it\nDid he shot him in Reno due to demand him so the actual artist did Johnny Cash the heartland in radio I don't think you did okay so do you believe why do we not believe him but we believe hip hop artist when they say what they say\nWell you know when they go to trial for murder that died of a way to a vote was artistically do\nRight but that one one on one goes to trial from right that he committed number right right and we're not talking about that we say why do we believe hip hop artist when they sing a song but we don't believe Johnny Cash shot a man and Reno just to watch him die I'll let you\nHang on that no I Know the answer but you know what are your answer the answer is one is a song and the other if a bunch of guys go to prison overtime for murdering people\nWhat bunch of guys go to prison for what bunch of guys are you talking about hip hop\nOn a lot of am I going to play some ethics you know what I'm saying is that what I'm saying your
