off a little bit maybe maybe start talking about that again and and what somebody could do you know financially maybe they have the money if they like going out more than what's here\nSure membership in season passes or just a wonderful way to experience everything at the park over and over again and it's really you know light on the pocket\nUm so what the membership right now for the listeners who are who are out there if they go to our Web site they're going to see a lot of great deals on any kind of just pick which is best for your family um but right now with our membership if you get one of those were automatically upgrading to a gold pass which gives you things like preferred parking\nUm discounts up to fifty percent on everything in the park\nUm it you're going to get bring a friend free offers and days where you can bring other folks along with you um and again I was just a lot of great other parks and they'll start as low as five Ninety nine a month or\nSo and I don't think people really realize that you know if you think about a season pass\n'em it's a ... right now he can get one for about fifty six dollars and but it's either way you go it's going to be cheaper than a one day ticket I'm so if you're the type that you know you think you might come to the park with your family at least twice a year go with the membership or season pass it's going to be a much better deal for you\nWhat a wonderful family value\nIt really is a big savings I mean this is what we do in our family and uh I could tell you that that the savings that you get even like something like parking right away or you might be twenty bucks when you get free parking Everytime economy and that's a that's a huge savings I mean this this if you if you make it\nThree or four times a year Jeremy you're saving tons and tons of money but just two times a year and you're going to be a big city\nAnd you know if you go out to Six Flags at different times of the year I don't think it's the same thing they always got something different going on events or we're going to get in the later but you know we kind of passed over the food and I'm a kind of person who was on one thing I like the more the food and that's more food\nAnd I want to hear about what the food is out there 'cause you know you're out there all day you burn enough calories the kids get hungry and thirsty talk to us about some of the things we have the out\nThere and we were absolutely right at Six Flags were always doing some type of game changer and right now we've got some limited time offers there'll be the types of food that you're only going to get during ... fast cruel I'm going to be with something called the colossal lawful burger\nOkay this is chicken ... colossal waffle Barker this thing is a giant enormous it is a chicken or beef smothered in bacon and she's been more baking more chief and stuff in between two Belgian waffles and this thing has collapsed all and it was really really something that the like\nEven if you don't want to try to eat it just by once you can look at it\nAmazing buy one get a wheelchair for so Sharon it on a\nThat doesn't tantalizing enough we've got something called children of the corn on the top\nAnd corn on the cob done three ways one is mother again in bacon because who doesn't love bacon one has a parmesan cheese topped on it in the third one and done Cajun style with a little heat jalapeno is on it but all of them start with a little bit of garlic butter first\nSo that when it really really interesting it's a great way to do a vegetable and kind of turn it out I'm a you could top it off with us more parfait because who doesn't love ... during the fall where we've taken the idea of Mars but just put it in a cup they've got your Grammy are putting in a bursting with marshmallows so that's really good\nUm we've got deep fried pretzels this year which again is limited time and they come in either traditional or red velvet cake batter does look really understand of course they're drizzle lets them more good Dewey goodness\nUm and then we don't ever forget candy down at our coastal candy store we've got a new pumpkin pie budge we've got apple pie budge candy corns budge so and it may may fresh everyday right there in the park\nFudge than for her it was it at all that stuff it sounds good\nYou know this was just like you know grabbing a hot dog and a coke I mean they've got all kind of very creative things delicious ... this is well it's\nSo far as I don't care about what the mentioned you're talking about in the park they they do it right they do a top quality and it's just everything's so clean out there you go on the restrooms even with a big crowd like a park like the restrooms are always spotless it's just a very well run\nUm and so again most folks who who knows Six Flags over Georgia that\nSpace really well um and so that's a really really great show um we've also got bad Bob the bone but you're down in lick skill it which is another show it's it's it's really funny it ... it has more of a I'm a ... a different tone but it's a comedy show it's it's really funny um and this year for twenty Eighteen we've got ... tricks unleashed\nAnd end this show is a band of female demons that try to lure you in and they danced with ... cent change to some you know chart\nChopping hit send and you know it ... hopefully you can make it out of that one alive because that one is definitely a\n... if it puts the hair on the back of your neck start to stand up and then we'd have the uprising which kicks off everything for ... that\nEvery year sorry every night and that one starts at six o'clock and that's how you know when the park is changing from thrilled by day and to thrills by night with the uprising where they do a little show and then all of the scare actors\nCome out and then and they stay out until the end of the night\nOr these shows that you just measures this a one night basis or this every night that these shows are going on during recess\nEvery night that we have friends that we have these shows available you know it takes about two hundred and fifty scare actors and dances and performers to pull off writes every night and our entertainment themed books really hard to make sure that we hit those marks and they're doing make up for every single one of those actors every single night a fright fast and it's really incredible to watch well\nYou know one thing I Want to emphasize this isn't a bunch of people they just hire off the street that never acted before I've known some people that worked out there and these are actors this is professional makeup ... doesn't get any better if you're in Hollywood right this is done like top notch\nYeah well it it is a very skilled\nPerformance that they do I mean the whole thing is very choreographed throughout the night to get these guys out into the park we use high tech air brush equipment to really create some cool techniques on the skin so we have everything from aliens to zombies to you know something we call the riders what your demons and\nDevils and which is and you know it's it's it's amazing to see I actually was one ad I said you know how can I be out talking about this unless I actually become one so few weeks ago they created an turned me into a witch doctor bar by you burial grounds scare us zone and I had an amazing time here and all the gas\nAnd and you know it was it was really cool to watch you know we we started out with a fresh foundation and they started to apply it I didn't even recognize myself after we were done but it was really really fun\nAnd it's not just the shows these actors and these costumes and all the makeup mirror wandering through the park and you're going to walk through the park and when you least expect it what happens\nThey pop out they pop out of everywhere we've got seemed scare zones situated threw out the park or in some of our high traffic area is\nSo unfortunately you can't get to one side of the park without walking through one of these scary downs um but the thing is none of our scare actors can touch you so you know the most that will happen is you'll just be really really scared which is which is our plan trying to scare the pants off ...\nAnd and what about the haunted houses that that you set up\nWe've got six hundred mazes this year our newest one being alien abduction at the six thousand square foot\nFacility that it's brand new that we just built for this purpose\nA and it had aliens living working and breeding anew the human victim um you're going to see 'em everything from aliens you know working on\nA some excruciating experiments on humans that it is it is definitely not for the faint of heart but it is really fun to walk through and try to make it through and we take all of your senses through that experience they've got one part in the maze where you actually walk through\nA tube ballooned walls and it kind of compressed view and you've got to squeeze through and we thought about everything there stuff\nComing from the ceiling on their stuff blowing at you know there's there's you know some trickery with some of the mirrors and there are some at some point it makes you feel like you're in a space it three times the size and you don't know which way to go and again it's all it's all in fun and fried\nYou know it started as Jim ... says her age restriction ... what is it that was pretty scary\nAgain so thrilled by day ah it has more to family and younger friends right ah but after six o'clock is when we turn it up and you know so for kids start Tina now there may not be appropriate um but you know what we've got some seven year olds that you know don't even play it should have a great time so it's all up to what you think your family can handle and what you think your kids can tolerate\n'em but it is again extremely safe again no one\nNo one can touch you or anything like that but and and it really makes you think about what fried is you know sometimes it's just\nWhat's inside of you that you know what what what scares you and what you know for sure absolutely\nYeah I've got my oldest one he's he's only five but he could handle it it sounds like from my house we're idol they can handle this I rarely get scared if you've uh you know you sneak a lot of them was the oldest one's five is are scared and nothing else you know Jim he's scared anything\nHe's already Twenty years old ... ... what are they going to be for Halloween than those busters Ghostbusters Ghostbusters you're going to call it a bit but\nThen he was already ready today he was telling me all about it he's so he's going to choose to go so yeah she's excited\nWell they were ... when when the when you go out to Six Flags you need to bring him in costume right\nTo ... twelve and under kids can wear their costumes and have it and have a great time in the park rather rides on a costume where else can you do that you know right around the coast during the ... well they love\nIt I mean my kids that go around the house I mean they visit for a month and a half before Halloween there they've got a different costume out every day at our house I don't know if it's like though with with everybody else but we ... we could all we've about a month\nThat's fantastic because it and it's it's Six Flags is so easy to get to write to tell people you know words you remind them words that if they don't know where it's at it and the parking you've got massive parking you you're not going to be sitting there in lines right wedding the park and and get in to get into the the amusement park and all\nOur teams at the park do a wonderful job with making sure everyone gets into the park swiftly because we want you on the rise we want you inside the park having a great time we're located at two Seventy five riverside park lay right there in ... uh you know and you just come down and again if you've got that membership you don't even have to pay just going to blast your badge and go right in and get your spot\nHead to the ... and then onto the rides\nConvenient sufficiency I Love it\nWhen you get in there you get in there faster you don't have to pay gentlemen I'm telling you these memberships or\nI mean there are quite a deal and it really is\nWell you know what I like to know I'm I'm curious 'cause you the park has a massive and you have the park decorated well almost like it's somebody's home how long does it take to do all that you know\nWe start early a very early in fact\nAround July just to make sure we hit the mark for wind fight that kicks off and it's happening now through October thirty first and then uh as we speak we're actually decorating for holiday in the park so guess who are coming out to the park now may not really noticed that\nUm but they're small subtle things going in here and there so that when we turn on those millions of glittering lights were holiday in the park or you want it's very seamless transition and we and we give you a whole new experience\nWow and it's ... it's quite an investment right well I mean all you're decorations you just to store them I can imagine takes a warehouse right or yeah well\nWe have plenty of space the park is five hundred and Ninety acres and so we've got plenty of places to store all those great things um and one thing that people should know too if you're going to come out for ... or holiday in the park you can start now with that season pass their membership you can actually use it if you buy the twenty Nineteen path\nYou can use it through the rest of twenty Eighteen and then all the way through January of twenty twenty\nSo it's a huge investment am and you know it it really again is lead on the pockets in a great way to get a huge value\nWhen my co hosts a sponsor of our show loves to save money and uh I can see smile from year to year every time you talk about these values\nThat I Do like it I unfortunately I don't get to go as often because I'm working in it but the kids and my wife been the grandparents go out there often and I can tell you they love it\nAnd this summer you can also use that same season pass for white water and Thirteen or ... at the sixteen actually other parks\nIn the country I mean you can use that season pass for so it's not just here so if you're traveling and going on vacation find a Six Flags near you you can use it there and you get a mission into ... and how they in the park and all those other good things that that we offer a nickel and of course referring to\nThe whitewater Jim man that's huge and some people\nDon't even know what waters associate with Six Flags right\nRight so we um have that park now under our beautiful properties here in Atlanta uh we have Six Flags over Georgia and whitewater um but then also we have hurricane harbor which is also free with your mission or your ticket you see them pass their membership um we have hurricane harbor which is bright also right there on our property as well\nFantastic well so that's on the Six Flags or over George property and the the whitewater that's something different but it's kind of a water park type\n... park water park right there on the same property so if you can't make it over to whitewater you can always take a dip the hurricane harbor\nWell you know we're up against the break again but we're here with the Venus from fright fast at Six Flags over Georgia talking about the most I think it's you know she's talking about the south but I think is\nProbably one of the best places in the country\nLow is that I don't know but I Know I Know right here it's the only game in town\nYeah we're going to be right back with some more special guests you're listening to the all four seasons farm show right on the news right here on the new talk one oh six seven foreign land it comes to talk [noise]\n\n\nAnd you can use that same pass at sixteen other parks\nUm and it you know that's just one of the best ways to to visit to visit the park and right now for your listeners if they go to the website um there's an offer to get up to Seventy percent off on those season passes when you buy for more so that's a really huge park and we're helping folks rush on over and and get those right away\nNow how long does for access last when does it end does it end right on Halloween or how how is it\nSo that is open on select days and weekends now through October thirty first and we are open the week of how the how Halloween so it's a really great option for families waiting for something safe to do something fun maybe a you know skip we have to get treated for the kids to maybe skip your traditional trick or treating and come out and get some free candy\nTake ... take on some ... go through some of our scare zones and and create a new tradition\nIs it a while and what about after right fast what is your what's the next season what are you what are you putting together\nSo right now we are our ills are hard at work getting ready to unleash holiday in the park so that's our next really big season that will have and again that's where we transform the park into a magical winter wonderland with\nThousands if not millions of glittering lights there's one area called peppermint plaza where you literally walk through and we pump\nMen the peppermint smells through\nThat whole entire area so as you're walking through the deeper you go in\nIt smells like pepper met and you see all the red and white candy cane trees and if he had never seen holiday in the park this is what you're doing it and it is something a sight to behold I mean if you're looking for it's a much different atmosphere and experience and that's where we we really get into the goals and goblins of it\nThis one is all about you know the warmth\nAnd and celebrating holiday I'm In a in a much different\nYou know way but we still have those thrilling rides um sell any we're going to give you some floors in a\nCup of cocoa and you can just you know really have a great time for holiday in the park\nAnd I'm sure that jello jolly old elf is going to make an appearance right\nAnd we always make sure ...

being a nationalist [noise] I said a\n... a ... a global as the person who wants to blow to do well but you know what we can have that we have a word is sort of became old fashioned it's called a national ... and I say Trump said we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist okay I'm a nationalist and now the leftists are going nuts there now comparing Donald Trump\nTo well I'll read it two years one from a\nA Chris Cillizza he's known him right on CNN with like an\nHour oh my God he's heat waves its hands right he's an actor he's like he's just stimulating all the time it's like he's self part political eating them I mean there's just brutal anyway he's such a screaming leftist\nOr he says let's start with nationalism that means the sense of national consciousness eggs only one nation above all others in pleasing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture interests well OK and now he says what makes nationalism different from patriotism\nOr the stroke of contracts with the word national again this is a solution to the idiot from CNN [noise] uh the word nationalism primarily conjures too close associations not to use them and white nationalism\nThe roof of roots of Adolf Hitler's rise were built around his emphasis on extreme nationalism superiority of the German people\nAnd white nationalism which he claims reared its ugly head in Charlottesville, Virginia last year under the principle of the Caucasians are inherently superior the agenda of whites needs to be recognized as a first priority\nNationalism is not a new concept writes this idiot ... or ... you said it's often but he was not to promote pride one's country and values but to subjugate those who don't share those values so already now because Donald Trump says he's ... he'll be how many times as you said we put America First\nYeah but it shouldn't we\nI mean really shouldn't we is that a thing and so now they're calling them a Nazi in a white

I read brave new world last year and found it to be hilarious what are your thoughts on it and what are some other book to point out the laws and less yes left his ideology you would recommend well brave new world is actually a very\nPrecious and take on what exactly a technology center he had an ethnic society would look like and then the the basic premise of brave new world is that\nThere is a group of people who have basically separated facts and procreation that day and our our drug to be happy with the drug called ... that they are they they're emotionally manipulated be happy and then there are these primitive sort of live out in the middle of nowhere as people used to\nThe question and brave new world really is whether the brave new world is good or whether it's bad it's pretty obvious that it's bad for people who live in western civilization which means you have to ask yourself why as far as other books along those lines obviously the worst of George Orwell or along these lines animal farm in Nineteen eighty four a post apocalyptic fiction\nI mean that's and that's actually a book I recommended this week a submission it sort of along these lines of product take and what is happening in Europe I mean the undercover story of the of the year is that the European human rights commission they ruled today that it is proper to find someone for speaking against the prophet Muhammad in Europe\nAnd that is that is indeed a brave new world palaces have when I was curious if you're going to be on a strict parent a strict parent and who your children date when they're older are you going to let your kids gator marry whoever they want huge fan of the of course movies ... idiot\nAnd you think that I'm gonna let my kids have whoever they want kids or stupid or

believes argument I was wondering if you could help explain the hatred of Jews\nFrom the radical left it they parade around calling everyone else not he's thanks to well I think that most people on the left are sincere but I don't know that they really thought through their own arguments which is why I spend a lot of my time when I talked to folks on the left trying to get people on the left to recognize the consequences of their own argument by what are they actually believe that route\nAnd as far as anti Semitism on the left I've suggested the dirt really three main types of anti Semitism in the world right now there's kind of be All right anti Semitism which is old style racial and religious anti Semitism Jews are inferior or bad or corrupt or greedy or communist because they killed Jesus and all of this kind of stuff\nThat's tied number one and that's pretty terrible an old school\nTied number two is Muslim anti Semitism radical Muslim anti Semitism which sort of conflate religious anti Semitism with ethnic anti Semitism I and you see that throughout the world where hate crimes against a rising in Europe at the radical Islamic population of Europe rises and third type of anti Semitism is let just anti Semitism\nWhere anti Semitism arises for two reasons one second ... doesn't like religion very much and to take a little less very often believes that basic ... that

going to find all of these are exactly the same but nonetheless what is the second is\nAre we part of the solution or we part of trying to make us more perfect union and we try to accentuate what what

shared and pick up more more slots\nOh that's a sitting congressman he's the chair of several committees saying that Trump wakes up the president United States of America wakes up each day figuring trying to figure out a way to divide us\n[laughter] ... yeah\nThis is talk now that we're in a place that we've never been before really we've never been here before I remember when President Reagan got shot I was in high school I remember people on in my high school who were clapping and cheering\nWhen he got shot I remember as clear as day cheering Reagan got shot Reagan got shot gay I remembered as clear as day\nI remember when two thousand happened in the election of two thousand happen and George Bush and it went to the Supreme Court I remember the Democrats spending the first two years of his entire term saying that he was a legitimate president I remember as clear as day that nine eleven was a plot by\nA Dick Cheney the get go into war so we go to war in his oil buddies would make all this money I remember this clear as day\nI remember it\nSo now you're coming to tell me that we're as partisan as as we've ever been before you don't want to partisanship started ladies and gentlemen when the media figure it out and I'm blaming the media oh I'm completely blaming\nThe media come late late blaming the media\nAnd I'm not blaming conservative media not blaming liberal media um blaming the media when media figure it out to have showing winter on representing one side and Joe blow on the other side representing the other side\nThat's what it all came apart\nBecause everything became may fight everything became a debate everything became an argument between the right and the law\nThat you have social media comes along and now everything is partisan most of the people that are different than most simply because of me specifically it just because of of who I Am not that kind of let me roll that back I don't want to sound\nHokey but my page is a little different my social media is a little different because I have a lot of people who listen to the show will conservative on my page I have a lot of people who are on the left or reading my pay so it tends to be a little bit more balanced\nThan most but for the most part most of us live in a world where everyone in our social media things like us whether you're in a writer and all that so you're talking to like minded people all the time\nAnd so this is where the partisanship comes into play but is there anything wrong with that absolutely not you know why because Ninety nine point\nNine nine

interesting stories\nWho was a lifelong Democrat who sort of Democrats getting out of hand did not like them anymore and he created this hash tag hash tag walk away you've probably seen my T shirts that I made the seats been walked away\nBut he started to shoot you bang going all around the country people posting videos about how they walked away from the Democratic party\nAnd he talked about it and they did a whole bunch of pieces and a lot of them were African American and a lot of them were Hispanic bottom all white women and and this is supposed to be the base of the Democratic party these people were walking\nAway so he had an event this past weekend up in D.C called has to walk away and it was a full week ... people gathered people talk the matter of fact in about an hour we're going to have a family with a mother and father went to ... went to the walk away advance and they sent their two sons to the young black leadership summit\nAnd we're going to have them on and talk about their experience and the young man fourteen year old is going to tell us about young black leadership summit that he was attending all weekend but\nThe the two events that went on a young black leadership some it was put on by turning point usa in random paid them who I told you Earl is going to be on the show live a well on the phone line with us in a forty AM\nSo stay tuned but this past\nWeek and these two events went on and they were important\nIn that they both were talking to people on the one hand young black leadership summit young African Americans who wouldn't normally vote Democrat\nThey were all they are supporting Trump now I Want to or what to talk about something and just second the walk away people were Democrats who walked away from the Democratic party\nSo this was in a very important crucial weekend in the history of this country because the people who are normally the base of the Democratic party some of them were publicly at events\nSaying no not anymore\nAnd the media covered it but here's what they covered I posted it on my Facebook page that oh he'll go in the media is not covering the R\nA young black leadership summit or walk away\nAnd you know what they said to me I just heard about it I saw it on CNN no you didn't see it on CNN what you saw on CNN was Trump's remarks\nAbout shooting that's what they cover\nAnd I think a a Fox News covered it live and maybe CNN came back to it after they cut away from it but for the most part this wasn't a lot of coverage of especially the at walk away hashtags walk away more more a weekend\nWhy is that why don't we see the median covering these things because they're scared they're scared to terrified this is what this is how terrified uh they are I Want you to listen I Want you to listen to um this is Trump at\nThe young black leadership some and he's talking to a room full of about two hundred and fifty to three hundred I I've been told that there was a total of about four hundred but I think in this room was less a lower number because not that many people could fit in the room so I think it was a lower number but this literally hundreds of young people in the East Room that Trump is talking to right now\nI heard this one a couple of weeks ago I said give me a break America First that could be racist is that right [noise]\n[noise] why is that racism here we are I I think is everybody in this room a grave when you're living in America America First\nThat's a room full of young African Americans\nRight there that is a room full of young African Americans right there\nAnd Trump says the obvious how can America First and he says they said it was racist so we started the black kids and it's simply says to the black kids you live in America would don't you want America to be first and they all share and they started chanting usa that scares these folks because these kids they're out the door\nThey're gone they're they're out there like yo\nI'm Out of here and I'm so

I don't think she served she still thinks she should be the first female president and it was incredible incredible because he had her granddaughter on the show with her and when she got a granddaughter got in Hillary Rodham piece to get far cabbage is lap\nAnd said gee grandma first you said you wanted to be a ... a president and then you said you weren't going to run so uh what's the difference in that\nReally turned on her granddaughter there I'd TV [noise] ah ah waiters do Sherry I think sharing surely Sherry\n...\nHere we go\nTo the little blonde jokes twenty eight when Oh thank you hangman or [laughter] play ready for vine joke though\nA blonde is watching the news with her husband\nThe newscasters says six Brazilian men die in the sky diving accident the blonde starts sobbing her husband looking at her she says oh that's horrible it's horrible and the husband confuses yesteryear it's sad but there were sky diving and there's always that risk involved\nAfter a few minutes the blonde still sobbing says yeah but how many years of Brazilian six silly\n[laughter]\nSorry [laughter]\nThat one I here sure all the new talked for those six seven hello Cheryl how's it going\nGoing great thank you so much for taking my call love the show and group is why I say I know you're talking about um you know I Can't do anything right and ...\nAnd all that good stuff yeah it's my opinion that they want us all they want everyone to believe they're in their head and think Trump is doing horrible and make sure they stay mad at him with all the live and everything they sit in the media because me and doing exactly what he said he was ... yeah the opposite of what they want to happen\nOn he showing out everything that the previous administration did against America and against the Americans that they hated\nThe previous administration dealing and getting away with calling them out starting to get where they can prosecute Ben and as long as they can keep everyone fighting and away from the ... they can keep their base on hand in glove\nCausing trouble riots and all this other stuff to keep the attention away from white he's actually getting which has nothing but good for the country you know our\nAmerican people you know they can get him out and not let him any more people elected in or um appoint any more people that can help them initially he started and they can try to get a grip on what they want to have this country all over again and then we'll just all screwed\nUp through the surely you're right and and and by the way I think again this goes back to a basic philosophy and heard someone talking about this a year ago and I can't remember who it was right give them full credit\nBut it seems and I totally agree with it seems to me that Donald Trump what's happening in Washington around the country now it spreads so much what's happening now is it is it's the old fashioned\nA status quo system is trying to belch out Donald Trump the system doesn't want an outsider like Donald Trump who's not taking rap off anybody\nHe moved to sit at the headquarters of the uh the Jewish people to Jerusalem east on gay killed the ... nuclear deal used on every he's kept all of his campaign promises so far and working on the wall\nAnd they can't stand it and it's the system it's time to try and do ...

administration they still talk about Trump putting kids in cages where the hell of this happened\n\nBut they say look Kelly separating children from adults\nAnd the facts never seem to catch up with the media first of all some of those children don't belong to some of those adults some of them are coyotes some of them are are kidnappers and smugglers but even more than that\nWhat the children with the adults would mean that the children go into adult detention centers where they can be molested and so forth that's why was set up that way not because Trump's racist\n\nMy God\nThe reporting

the key Senate races in this country is in the show me state Missouri [noise]\nAnd uh he got an excellent Republican candidate Josh Hawley versus Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a moderate I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look I bought with Trump half the time and I post Kavanaugh because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she's a she's a little desperate to be honest with you mark and as you should be because ... she is out of step\nWith the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her that they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nDinner McCaskill turned her out to vote no on Neil Gorsuch would scream court no one justice\nKavanaugh no on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could not be more out of step\nWhat does she running a New Yorker Missouri\nYeah exactly well most of her money comes from New York and California Beth she'd be a great senator one of those places but for this state hardly and that is that's our big problem and that's why she's down to the poll or she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a leftist to be perfectly honest with your hair votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or a Chuck Schumer and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she is accepted twenty six million dollars that expenditures\nAre from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country\nTrying to prop up but Senator McCaskill end up by her seat and you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they they don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just doesn't blind\nThe the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in one of your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh is a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted\nAnd are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and that is a huge issue in this race\nImmigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and that is a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against the middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes in Congress and that people want somebody's going to be a fighter for\nThe middle class and workers and are not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's a pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill's saying you will oppose a ... a ... methods of protecting people who have pre existing conditions is that your position or she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I've called her out on many times in our debates\nI support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare to do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state income\nHealth care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan but is it Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell she she tries to talk as he says he's open to it you know she's open to it of course we all know that that's\nWhere this is headed and we all know that that that she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on edge any major issue an issue consequences and\nYou know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare imagined what they'll do\nTo pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate a folks who are or who have paid into the system it will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nThat you make a good point Medicare for all his Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to ... every employer based private plan that the polished all private insurance and basically turn us into one DMZ VA right\nExactly exactly and you know the fact is Senator McCaskill has voted already to cut that seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars out of Medicare that's money that goes to hospitals money that goes to home health services money that was supposed to go to hospice they cut all of that\nTo pay for Obamacare which of course is driven prices up through the ceiling here and now they now they want to cut further and that and take it all away and it's just part of their plan they all just like they want to throw up the borders are just like they want to go back to uh allowing trade cheaters to take away our jobs are this is the wrong agenda for this country and I tell you mark", "year": "2018", "show_name":
