guess they didn't know what to do with this this will female cop was was lax\nBecause you had a baby recently at home and so she uh was a strange kid nurse\nThat weird I mean the kid doesn't know I mean you know I mean\nI guess it's good for the baby that for some reason yeah it's weird is it a little colleague nursing of what they're what nurses all over the place right same or when ... you

talk about like why why did the news like that should you should just do\nIt just it was a gesture of love and and and uh and and for humanity and\nYou know people to do it says oh you know\nWho without knowing you didn't hesitate in for a moment you've fulfilled\nHow if you were a mother or you don't care about the filth and the smell things like that so so I guess it was a really sneaky little baby what can be cleaning up about the same same thing when I was watching the baby was just hungry you can put in his hand his mouth and I just ... just let him latch on to sad moment\nBut to me uh I don't know\nI'm having a weird comparison here you know\n[noise] well now I Want to hear a bit since then\n\nIt's like now for you for for for them for awhile six seven ...\n[noise] uh

will [laughter] I don't know I guess it would just comes out of all there is a mother there she has a milk but I don't know so for some reason I think that your milk isn't customized your kid yeah

very much we got to stop a front whole talk I'm Sorry I brought it up now [laughter]\n\nThere's a Bill Bill go ahead\nHey Shannon I I just wanted to comment that are there is no statute of limitations\nAnd murder and whether someone's Fifteen Years old or a hundred and five years old they murdered six thousand\nJews [noise] they should be held accountable to the other thing I don't know anything about the best but I got to believe that it was a a\n... you you don't get drafted into the assets to seek out a physician in that part of their of their military\nI don't know I haven't seen that he was part of the well I guess he isn't as if you're if you worked for the if you're a guard at a at a desk you have your your debt you had to be as\nFast as I say ss was a little more elite but yeah you're right I ... it was a Nazi I mean he participated the death of thousands and thousands of of of Jews are agree\nSo I Believe it was my point here is my point bill why why does why does that not see get to stay alive period why hasn't he been in a while to provisions of no\nI mean they said uh but they couldn't deported because no country would take him no the topic was able to work to deal with a Angela Merkel with Germany would take him for some reason I don't know in what capacity but why do we traveled shelves would let the guy live\n\nYeah why not yeah find out find out if it was a murder or find out if you if you took part in it and then the ...\nHe took part of if you're a guard at a death ... people were dumped six thousand people dying day there you're complicit\nRight\nBut I agree I sort of thing that I can think of it that you know maybe these guys weren't you know they were just going along to come you know they're just the kind of a scared for their own lives and they they were they didn't have any platform to stand up and say hey this\nIs all white light light shot and I was I was a Nazi against my will like it was afraid of I tried to tried it I was really hatred if I were the full of aid for Jews I Would get shot so I had a knee up yeah I get it I get it and that's a good\nNot to rent a valid point so really valid point there was a ... I imagine there were there were some Nazis that really weren't down with this but you know what are they going to do\nRight right got it right off camera all around them\nBut the main thing is a statute of limitations there is no statute get an adult gotcha yeah yeah so that's my point All right thanks appreciate up a good word thank you so you write\nRight they didn't commit any crimes in America right\nThat was the guys are I mean he's well I mean we know that he's a Nazi who\nMy point is that Germany or the ... and\n... and maybe they will punish you may be the ones in ... he had to punish him no he didn't\nDo it here right\nCan you imagine what I mean we've had been in Brooklyn to forty nine something like that\nWow in the United states at least they found him he'll live in Brooklyn but living in the same place forever Seventy a Nazi came at a ... a bona fide certified Nazi living down the street in them in a brownstone ... that's where the Nazi guy live oh where did it or the death camp in Poland\nRight there was right there\n[laughter] I don't know whether he they didn't break down his door you know\nApparently been protesting out in front of his house forever but of the for the last administration couldn't get him out good didn't want to get him out I don't know Trump's I'd get them out of here\nTo actually leave pole and everything and that would be silly and our I see [laughter] ... yeah I just figured out a he'd read women by the by the front of all\nThat if there that you that you ...

I I don't know if I misunderstood you weren't you talking about the guy Colorado to kill this family earlier yeah yes it's a low like humanely they gave me the needle and let me do it myself\nWell you know they they're saying now that he was having an affair with some girl at work\nAnd yeah ... and apparently he asked his wife for a separation and then I we're assuming that's what started some kind of a fight and that's when the police believe me just killed her and and but I I don't understand any I don't I don't know how you can kill a four year old and thirty thirty three year old your own\nDaughters stir especially if he strangled others bare hands I mean I just God I Can't I Can't imagine Colorado\nHad the death penalty or we know I don't\nKnow I'm not sure I I used to they used to have the firing squad Gary thank you I appreciate it if I if I'm not mistaken he wasn't very well maybe that was Utah\nThey might have been Utah to say that I think what is your toe in his firing squad yeah uh I don't know where the Colorado has the death penalty I\nI don't know but this I mean that's not good enough for this guy how do you like to me the woman he was having an affair with only ... family over you know I Believe is reinstated in Nineteen Seventy four\nOkay there you go well good\n'cause he certainly qualifies for death by avalanche and you're right the ski slopes he's he now he's claiming that he came home to find one of his daughters dead and the other one being strangled by his wife and that's why he snapped in a fit of rage and killed his wife\nAnd revenge of the prosecutors aren't buying that but that's a record anyway I mean he just thinking about it I just can't imagine how you could fill your own three and four year old daughter's three thirty one\nNewspaper lines coming up hold on here's Ryan on the new talk one of the six seven oh Ryan how's it going\nPretty good so along with I can listen you're in every so often but sometimes to all

I don't think you're going\nTo\nSay you're on a bed\nAnd now\nIt was like do you stand they used to have an old circus act where the guy would get up in a like a two hundred foot pole\nAnd it was orange and it was like\nWell it was part of a math\nRule it was part of a bathroom and I would go into the bathroom and we've got so scared frozen stiff\nI couldn't ask for the gay super\nLet's\nNot

action\nSort of like President Trump when he goes on Twitter and winds about Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein teen and Christopher Wray who he is in his power to fire there or at least tell him to do

you need or on the\n\nBall over\nIn ...\nThe way Mr manager\nWay to do so by the fifty seven or the new talk what six seven eight for for ... for ten sixty seven what a sad story this is and I don't I just I hate to even to talk\nAbout an eleven year old boy in Iowa named Caleb Hammond has leukemia\nHe's been undergoing painful treatments at a Des Moines hospital for months it's not working other doctors are saying it's not working and we don't really have anything else we can do so the eleven year old kid said you know what screw it I'm going home\nSo he went home and he has a final wish for when he dies he's eleven and he's making final wishes\nEleven year old Caleb Hammond wants people to send him racing stickers\nHe's loved auto racing since he was two years old healed his passion is what prompted the request for stickers and his uncle says the stickers have been pouring in after social media appeal is trying to keep everybody spirits up\nUh he's been home for about three weeks now and he does what other eleven year old kids do as much as you can but then he gets tired really easily and he's hoping to get some racing stickers to cover his casket when he dies\nThat's what the eleven year old boy says he wants to racing's tickets are stickers to cover his casket when he died from leukemia God what a heartbreaking story that is\nAnd how about some good news it's also a little sad in some ways to have you seen the video of the reunions of families in North and South Korea holy smokes a Donald Trump by the way is getting full credit for this\nHe arranged between the presidents of north and South Korea to get together to make a deal so that families who are separated during the Korean War are finally getting a chance to meet relatives who were separated from them fifty sixty years ago\nAnd there was video of of of of families women who are in their Seventy five eighty year old range seeing their brothers and sisters but the first time since they were for\nMe and there I mean it's ... will they now have more than one surname ... [laughter] well I think you're on the same name still but can you imagine I mean the video is really is it's really astounding there you know they haven't seen family in sixty years Berlin Wall stuff God\nI mean can you ... and ... and here's the here's the kicker is just the sad part about it is that apparently they were given a Donald Trump arrange the meeting to have them get the reunion together but apparently the deal is they are they can meet together in the same spot for three days\nBut they're being limited to only talk with each other actually sit together with each other over the three days for a total of eleven hours\nAnd the reason for that is the north Koreans don't want their people to find out too much about how good it is in South Korea are afraid they'll defect or tried to defect\nBut again there at least getting to see the relatives of the first time since Nineteen fifty or even before that when they were separated before the war [noise] a quaint and spell oh man I\nDon't think ... percent on your [laughter] [laughter]\nOh pi Justin ... [noise] uh the current level of terrorism threat has announced a ... required the following announcement from the French government has just announced that has raised the terror alert level from run to hide the only to higher levels in France [laughter]\n\nThe only the only two levels higher than runner hide in France are collaborate surrender [laughter] who rises precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed Frances White flag factory\n[laughter]\nEffectively paralyzing the country's military capability meantime the Spanish or all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy these beautifully designed Spanish subs have glass bottom so [laughter] so the new Spanish Davey can get a really good look at the oldest they should be\n[laughter] they're sneaky [laughter] Iraq [laughter]\nFour oh one of the new talk of six seven I'm not making this up it parasite and when I was there or if you were more than about six pounds over what they thought was your weight your call it a fat body when I went to Paris island\nI weighed I think I weighed something like two ten maybe to come up by about two ten\nAnd they wanted to meet my drill instructor a foot in the first day they are the drone structures put me in the fat body platoon or in the ... which meant when you go to the mess all I Would say fat body so their leaders to the front as well as you go to the front of a chow line and the fact that he's had to go to the rear which means you have less time to eat\n'cause you're weak by fast I mean there's no goofing around and Paris island but the key was the a drill instructors had to look at the food that I Would get on my trade and we're all ... and this is true story we're only I was only allowed to eat for like the first seven or eight weeks\nAnd then it became a squad leader and and they and they took over a lot but anyway for the first seven or eight weeks all I could eat which meat vegetables and water no bread milk potato is no pasta ... salad dressing no milk no desserts\nKnown and all the other guys are piling on you know ice cream bars isn't a no no and ... the last one in line you have to eat quickly in order to be in the first one out so he had like you know two minutes eat your food uh meat vegetables and water and that was it and I lost forty pounds\nI went I made it to one Seventy five or something she anyway uh but ... but the they didn't go from now the marine corps has had and now has a sports\nDietitian expert Charlene holiday she serves the marine corps war fighter and performance dietitian so now it every meal they will have clean protein offering gee offerings at every meal in the marine corps the clean protein offerings are chopped eggs\nYogurt cheese sauce a sauce is a protein ... wait a minute\nProtein offerings that all meals would include shopped eggs yogurt cheese sauce a\nLagoon this trail mixes and vegetarian options and now the Marines are going to have a color coded system to help you to decide whether you're eating the right stuff for the Marines oh my God this is like kindergarten tomatoes tomatoes that protein well there you are on the protein\nAnd now they have color code so if you see ... of food has a green coat next door to eat as much as you want a yellow means go with caution and a red you know does sign next to the food means minimal amount it's only\nOr she went home and realize later it was like eight o'clock you realize that kid was must still be in the car and she called the cops on herself and they arrested her and put her in jail what happens when\nYou were a snitch that's right things do you know your\nSelf snitching a slightly different story or a for for for all four to six years of it you know I don't understand how Michael Cohen could be an all this trouble as Trump's lawyer when the only reason he's in trouble is because the FBI broke into his office and is a home and his condo apartment that he says stays him and he's not home with the family\nAnd they stole all the stuff including all this tape recordings as a uh conversations with clients including the president United States all his lawyers notes\nAnd then they supposedly are saying well we only looked at the ones that are relevant to our charge uh-huh they took 'em all they took all of\nIt if it's not it's not rocket stop on time yes exactly what they did that's what they did\nAnd the same thing with Manafort was Manafort they broke into his house at three o'clock in the morning or something like that he would have showed up and then he went and they would have said hey come on down we're going to rescue night I'll be I'll be there\nI mean but no they show up to break into the house Brad plaques and the doors and just to show Donald Trump and by the way Manafort\nOr his trial has nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing and Michael Cohen his pleading guilty today has to do with his tax evasion and his bank fraud has nothing to do with Donald Trump's presidency or a campaign or the Russians\nSo so far Robert Mueller's investigation for millions of dollars over two years has resulted in two trials that have nothing to do with Donald Trump\n\nTower and you know he's not gonna yeah he is not going to ever clear Donald Trump Mohler we'll never clear Donald Trump he'll have a final report that will never said Donald Trump did nothing wrong he will never have report clearing them\nIs it just disgraceful and you know that my mother and call me are best friends\nAnd best with close friends best friends for Twenty years\nI tell you this whole thing is just a ... it's obviously a conflict of interest in when when Donald Trump talks about the angry Democrats I mean my God the fix was in from the beginning of the same people that tried to fix the election for Hillary Rodham piece to give our cabbage or fixing the trials the federal empire out of control it is\nA will and they're still trying to ... the Manafort jury is still send a new note we don't know what it is\nIt will if we find out will tell you obviously but holy moly oh oh oh [laughter]\nThat camera show replay whom I was curious do key and I always listen to do a replay of the

which first approached bought teaches vehicle from behind and I quote Frank that car is moving\n[laughter] because\nWhat has to do it either but he sure made them away a hundred and Thirteen [noise] oh mercy or a for for for all for Ted sixty seven eight for for for all for\nOne zero six seven an image Thirteen gang member and they're legal citizen\nIllegal non citizen rather legal criminal alien immigrant\nHas admitted he's a slaughtering butcher gang bangers MS Thirteen gang member has pleaded guilty as one of the three men who butchered and bludgeoned for teenage kids who were in a rival gang\nJose port killed a said quote and myself and another MS Thirteen member personally murdered Michael Lopez by stabbing him with knives I did this knowingly willfully and without coercion when I was Fifteen Years old I Will forever suffer the pain of knowing how senseless these murders were in that none of the victims deserve to die\nYou'll recall that this name may be familiar because it was the victim's family ... survivors of his rage\nWho are with Donald Trump at a press conference calling for tougher immigration laws\nOr he was an undocumented the killer and undocumented teenager immigrants from El Salvador known is Sparky or curio so he was in ninth grade when he planned and carried out the quadruple murders\nHe faces white behind bars obviously he admitted he and his buddies had two female MS Thirteen gang girls gang banged girls\nLow or five suspected members of a rival street gang to the woods where they were ambushed the he says we trick the victims so they would go into the woods where they would be murdered the uh MS Thirteen gang members including this Fifteen year old\nA ... a chopped them up with machetes knives sticks and an ax one of the targets\nAway he's now a federal government witness and everybody's describing this is one of the most brutal vicious horrific scenes they've ever seen this kid says I Know I Apologize to the families knowing my apology will not be accepted family was in court crying all the way\nAnd uh the lawyers are hoping that his me a couple of we'll just wait other kids from joining the gang he was Fifteen when he set up\nFor murders a jury reaches or oh boy oh they have a jury in the Manafort trial eight counts on the Paul Manafort trial they breached agreement on eight\nSo I assume the tent others therefore will no longer be part of a it won't be part of any kind of a roof trial if for\nMy understanding was if the jury failed to reach anything on anything then it then you could read try him again or they could forget it but they could read tram again if the jury if they are eating counts on the jury reached has reached a verdict on eight of them then those other ten are going to go by the wayside they can't try and for those other ten after this court verdict\nUh but they have apparently they breached the verdict on it and it doesn't say guilty or innocent but as soon as they breached the birds on eight of the teen counts\nEr and by the way my Manafort has to go through another trial after this one\nHe faces a second trial again for nothing to do with Donald Trump the Robert Mueller investigation\nOr has caught Paul Manafort with some banking schemes and not registering as a a a a foreign agent to take money from foreign agents or something and now he's got he's going to have a second trial and the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen is pleading guilty right now in court\nFor the for the crimes he was caught after Robert Mueller's team\nKidnapped all this information and stole his a tape recordings with his clients his conversations all his lawyers notes and found stuff in there to charge him with the breaking banking laws again with nothing to do with Donald Trump Russia collusion or the campaign\nAnd that's your Robert murder trial now they got into a banking crooks\nAnd so far and as far as mental unbelievable\nAnd they're making a deal with the president's lawyer Michael Cohen a brother and then here uh UNC last\nNight so the kids went back to school and of course they decided to knock over a Confederate memorials statue called silent Sam which by the way is not real it's not really a thing but the two or three hundred of them a deal UNC last night in Chapel Hill knockdown silent Sam's Confederate statue\nA it was the governor knows that people are frustrated by the change of pace in sharing your frustration but he said violent destruction public property has no place in our communities\nSimon Sam was a statue erected in Nineteen Thirteen to remember the sons of the university who died for their boulevard south land and the civil war United daughters of the confederacy gave the statue to the to UNC in Nineteen eighty nine\nA but some uh some black students or of seeing the school spending too much money to maintain a statue the glorifies in sleeping in my ancestors dedicated by a man who took pleasure and beating a black woman on our campus erected by a group of people praised the KKK protectors of white womanhood\nAnd the same woman who is a PHD student UNC as soon as she went there to the statue and put her red ink and her own blood on the statue and she's facing charges of criminal intent and also explosion from UNC that'll be the day for thirty three\n\nAnd I who who okay I just I Can't think about it for forty eight a

place in opposition to one and the Philippines\nIda four fifty eight on the new talk one of those six seven eight for for ... for ten sixty seven you know what you're going to try to prove\nThat this has been iffy from the beginning\nRobert Mueller is going to try to nail Donald Trump in the following way he's going to say that Michael Cohen has just admitted that Michael Cohen the president's lawyer\nViolated campaign laws by paying off Stormy Daniels so that she wouldn't negatively affect Donald Trump's campaign\nSo Mueller's going to say that because Donald Trump tried to use a bribe to pay a slut not to embarrass him during the campaign he was using an illegal donation basically to pay off a tramp\nSo that she wouldn't turn on him during the campaign which would be helping his campaign so they're going to claim that Donald Trump violated federal campaign laws by paying the tramp us to keep her mouth\nShut which would have affected his campaign and that's how they're going to try to get Donald Trump oh man\nThis is real they run a duly elected president out of office over something this negligible this country is going to explode tell ya I help you and I'll be right there I I Will I Will lead it until they take me off the air\nI mean this this is really appalling\nTwo years I've been doing this millions of dollars and he's got two guys in trial for tax evasion and the banking fraud counts and now he's going to try to complain that Donald Trump knew all about it from the beginning and tried to pay off Stormy Daniels to help his campaign was twelve years ago\nTwelve years ago\nAnd she signed an agreement they shut up and then broke the agreement I don't know why she hasn't been sued mean confidential agreements are serious they haven't for a reason\nNot anymore not anymore anyway it looks like Manafort's going to be in big trouble\n[noise] higher\nHigher who didn't\nGet it together later you're ready on your dogs are game\n[noise] [noise]

for for for ... for ten sixty seven here's J a new talk one of the ... with the camera OJ thanks for calling you on the\nRadio towers are very well Sara what's going on\nGood I'm hoping to make two comments about the uh the Nazi was deported\nThe last known Nazi collaborator living in American the blast when they know of Ninety five year old former camp guard up played an indispensable role in the murders of thousands of Jews apparently six thousand killed in one day where he was and he said known about 'em for Twenty years and he finally got deported a welcome aboard what you want to say about the guy\nOkay the first thing was that I had the correct in our day it made earlier in the day\nWhen they went to retrieve the Ninety five year old man they accidentally grab Bernie Sanders vitamin C. and then it one other thing was when there were were removing the Nazi from his home yeah he had to be ... or ... not because he was resisting is because they are going to bring their district were later\nOh hey Ninety five year old ... how to get off\n[laughter]\nHave acted Nuremberg a British the Ninety five year old guy but apparently was an armed guard\nAt a that'd be ... labor camp and helped kill six thousand Jews in one day in Nineteen forty three one day\nThat's what ... the polish step camp yeah uh\nAnd by the way to my feet was told me the polish people are not very happy with this because every they're describing is at a at a polish death camp well it happened to be in Poland but it wasn't run by the polls show putting trust me it was on by the German polish had nothing to do that so I mean there's there just wasn't a polish death cab who happened to be there but\nAnyway so they're trying to make the point he had his citizenship revoked Fifteen Years ago he appealed and that was denied in two thousand five\nAnd a ... oh and find a way this guy maintain friendships with Nazi guards who also came to America under false pretenses back when he did in the late for like Nineteen forty nine and how about this for a a coincidence\nThe Nazi and his wife bought a home in Queens near La Guardia airport in Nineteen sixty six\nThey bought that home near La Guardia airport in Queens from a polish couple who were Jewish and survive the Holocaust all week and he bought their house\nThey didn't know anything about it but they do about it now and a great he's been deported\nSix thousand and by the way a he was saying well I was a you know I was a German and during the war but he he denies that he was responsible for the thing and then you have the whole question again even even the German government is saying this is a troubling situation where they call it uh the U.S ambassador to Germany called it a difficult task\n[laughter]\nParalyzing the

to say that because Donald Trump tried to use a bribe to pay a slut not to embarrass him during the campaign he was using an illegal donation basically to pay off a tramp\nSo that she wouldn't turn on um during the campaign which would be helping his campaign so they're going to claim that Donald Trump violated federal campaign laws by paying the tramp was to keep her mouth shut\nWhich would have affected his campaign and that's how they're going to try to get Donald Trump\nOh man\nThis is real they run a duly elected president I'm all for silver something this negligible this country is going

Japanese people I mean\nArea the hundred and eighty thousand two hundred thousand as opposed to a NATO or six million avidly ... six million Jews genocide\nOr ... I Am for the Jewish people I'm done so what I'm saying [laughter] well oh yeah it does sound like it because it hey I'm just\nSaying that that that sets the bad press that for us up for our soldiers they do things we make decisions in war war is not a\nGame it's not something you play on the TV on I mean with the controller in your hand or how that is what those guys were doing and they didn't have any choice they were following orders like if you're\nIn a way way way way way [noise] [laughter] so to exterminate a\nUh uh uh uh people uh for his agenda of all the genocide is not a war you understand that on the\nThe Jews are hiding Jews weren't fighting the Nazis they didn't do that today that they would have been trying to defend themselves they are trying to ... I understand\nThat but war is war and that's why even ... that it and and I just think that that the bread threads that once the war is over if he was trying to kill Jews then yeah\nA red team get him out of the country or whatever but when wars over ... they are soldiers responsibility should be ended right there [laughter] they lost the war and and\nI don't know matter what no matter what happened with Hitler wars are no matter what types of crimes against humanity you were guilty of as a soldier\nWell well what about the the the ... soldiers that killed kids out of it just\nBy accident and should they be held responsible no\nWar it's war\nIn that war is never can like Robert Louis whatever I made up of Robert Lewis saving that war is not gun war is and and I hate it I Love the Jewish people I give money to Israel but I Do\nBut it was a war and so I'm not a five year old guy who lived his lab otherwise faithfully once the war was over and just I mean he did what he had to do any of us face in the ... at the end if you don't do it\nWhat would you do that that's why he was he was following orders\nAre enough I'm like my reminding I appreciate your opinion thank you very much there you go\nAnd it was just ... following orders and uh\nAnd I guess I guess what he's saying is I mean I\nDon't think ... chasing camps are war for Dickey less\nWell there was no ... yeah the Germans weren't at war with the Jewish people they were trying to exterminate them all forever for get rid of him completely and the ... there was a war going on at the time\nBut the the these guys weren't fighting a war they were continuing their mission of of of genocide well other Nazis went out and bought the war [laughter] right\n[laughter] oh [laughter]\nI get it if you're out in the ah if you fall on if you if you had nothing but they're looking for old Nazi soldiers\nWho who fought in the in the in the war those guys aren't it's the people that were involved in the genocide the people who are involved in a ... in the extermination of Jewish people that were working at a concentration yeah yes those people those are the people\nHe thinks that's the same as as a war\nIt was during the ... I don't know he he is [laughter]\nIt sounded like what's the wars are is that no matter how many Jews you sent off to the to do the gas chamber\nAnd shut the door and hit the button or whatever you ought to be able to go you know ... ... ... in in in New York and have a barbecue solely because of someone's religion wars over All right if I go home so I'll let you guys been good good America I have a nice life story about things here\n[laughter] a for for for for one of the success that is really a man who is Jay Jay go ahead\nSo that guy that was just on you must have been smoking that so that it marijuana\n[laughter]\nSo I've been to war [noise] seen it it's not pretty but there's a difference between\nPeople that go to war and do what they're told and people that kill a whole entire generation of families yes\nWar crimes should be upheld\nThat I Want to thank you for each other I don't know when it's so hard to see you know my point was\nI don't I Believe that you if you're yeah those are those are the the war criminals but they're out looking for\nThe kids the Nazi you can fighting in the in the you know\nThe ... a foot soldier they're not directly involved a genocide now I don't think that's who you know but the trials are about ... which is Ninety five he lived there in limbo\nI mean ...

[laughter] and then it one other thing was when there were were removing the Nazi from his home yeah he had to be ... or ... not because he was resisting is because they are going to bring their district or later\nTold hey Ninety five year old who houses at all\n[laughter]\nHave acted Nuremberg a British and Ninety five year old guy but apparently it was an armed guard\nAt a that'd be ... labor camp and help to kill six thousand Jews in one day in Nineteen forty three one day\nThat's what ... the polish camp camp yeah\nUh and by the way the if he was told me the polish people are not very happy with this because every they're describing is at a at a polish death camp well it happened to be in Poland but it wasn't run by the polls show putting trust me it was on by the German polish had nothing to do that so I mean there's there just wasn't a polish that can't happen to be there\nBut anyway so they're trying to make the point he had his citizenship revoked Fifteen Years ago he appealed and that was denied in two thousand five\nAnd a ... oh and find a way this guy maintain friendships with Nazi guards who also came to America under false pretenses back when he did in the late for like Nineteen forty nine and how about this for a a coincidence the Nazi and his wife\nBought a home in Queens near La Guardia airport in Nineteen sixty six\nThey bought that home near La Guardia airport in Queens from a polish couple who were Jewish and survived the Holocaust all week and he bought their house\nThey didn't know anything about it but they do about it now\nIntegrating has been deported\nSix thousand and by the way a he was saying well I was a you know I was a German and during the war but he he denies that he was responsible for the thing and then you have the whole question again even even the German government is saying this was a troubling situation what do they call it uh the U.S ambassador to Germany called it a difficult\nTask deporting this guy back to Germany and I know what's going to do with them there I assume\nI don't put them on trial he won't be dead you know ... before too long I Can't imagine so but I was going to happen to him now I don't know but this has been going on for almost Twenty years\nActually more than Twenty years from time to his neighbors first realized that he was on the belief was announced anyway they're going to and then people are saying hey wait a minute it was just following orders [laughter] you know and here's the other thing I actually did think about this I suppose you it was Nineteen\nForty one and you were drafted into the German army and given a gun and the helmet and stuff and they were city our guard this uh entrance to this camp or is it okay so you're gardening evidence to the camp that's all you did was guard the interest of the camp you didn't shoot anybody just stood there and guard at the entrance for a couple of years when the war was over are you a Nazi war criminal\nYou know you didn't have to be a notch you to be in now and then where am I right you know you just where you were war criminal not necessarily Nazi but I mean if anything that\nDidn't stop the slaughter or whatever I mean I don't know I I don't have an answer to that but clearly a ... they get this last known one Ninety five years old\nI got you gotta you gotta you gotta look at the week on the\nAnd then it became a squad leader and and they took over a lot but anyway for those first seven or eight weeks all I could eat which meat vegetables and water no bread milk potato is no pasta ... salad dressing no milk no desserts\nAnd all the other guys are piling on you know ice cream bars isn't like that\nOh and since you're the last one in line you have to eat quickly in order to be in the first one out so he had like two minutes eat your food uh meat vegetables and water and that was it and I lost forty pounds\nI went I made it to one Seventy five or something she anyway uh but ... but they didn't go from now the marine corps has had and now has a sports dietitian expert Charlene holiday she serves the marine corps war fighter and performance dietitian\nSo now it every meal they will

played an indispensable role in the murders of thousands of Jews apparently six thousand killed in one day where he was and he said known about him for Twenty years and he finally got deported a welcome aboard when he want to say about the guy\nOkay the first thing was that ice had the correct in our day it made earlier in the day when they went to retrieve the Ninety five year old man they accidentally grab Bernie Sanders vitamin C. and then it one other thing was when there were were removing the Nazi from his home yeah he had to be ... or\n... not because he was resisting is because they are going to bring their district or later\nOh hey Ninety five year old who how to get off\n[laughter]\nHave acted Nuremberg a British some Ninety five year old guy but apparently it was an armed guard at a that'd be ... labor camp and help to kill six thousand Jews in one day in Nineteen forty three one day that's what Fox called the polish camp camp yeah\nUh and by the way to my team was told me the polish people are not very happy with this because every they're describing is at a at a polish death camp well it happened to be important but it wasn't run by the polling you're putting trust me it was up by the German polish had nothing to do with it so I mean there's there just wasn't a polish that can happen to be there but\nAnyway so they're trying to make the point he had his citizenship revoked Fifteen Years ago he appealed and that was denied in two thousand five\nAnd a ... oh and find a way this guy maintain friendships with Nazi guards who also came to America under false pretenses back when he did in the late for like Nineteen forty nine and how about this for a a coincidence the Nazi and his wife\nBought a home in Queens near La Guardia airport in Nineteen sixty six\nThey bought that home near La Guardia airport in Queens from a polish couple who were Jewish and survived the Holocaust all week and he bought their house\nThey didn't know anything about it but they do about it now and a great he's been deported six thousand\nAnd by the way a he was saying well I was a you know I was a German and during the war but he he denies that he was responsible for the thing and then you have the whole question again even even the German government is saying this was a troubling situation where they call it\nAh the U.S ambassador to Germany called it a difficult task\nDeporting this guy back to Germany and know what's going to do with them\nThere I assume I don't put them on trial he won't be dead you know ... before too long I Can't imagine so but I what could happen to him now I don't know but this has been going on for almost Twenty years\nActually more than Twenty years from time to his neighbors first realized that he was a really be was announced anyway they're going to and then people are saying hey wait a minute it was just following orders [laughter] you know and here's the other thing I actually did think about this I suppose you it was Nineteen\nForty one and you were drafted into the German army and given a gun and the helmet and stuff and he said he our guard this uh entrance to this camp here and is it okay so you're guarding the entrance to the camp that's all you did was ... to the camp you didn't shoot anybody just stood there and guard at the entrance for a couple of years in the war was over are you a Nazi war criminal\nYou know you didn't have to be a notch you to be in now and then where am I\nRight you know you just ... war criminal not necessarily Nazi but I mean if you'd anything that didn't stop

used to give her as a job three to six every afternoon Newt talk ...\nThis is the rubber now shock this Bush you know by show is brought you by Democrat attorney general nominee Keith Allison Keyes beat his opponent so badly I figured it had to be a woman that had been in the ... show host the camera in our hourly tribute to the\nShow here on the news talking with those six seven we know where to butter I've read in your ... or you\nKnow they have they have no radio\n\n\nLaw here we\nSometimes we\nDo use music radio down at the\nWay they live\nOh\n\nSee you already have\n\nAll the\n\nWay we me what you mean are they saying\n\nOh\nIn\nThe way Mr manager\nAgainst so by the fifty seven out of the new talk of six seven eight for for ... for ten sixty seven what a sad story this isn't a oh I just I hate to even to talk about eleven year old boy in Iowa named Caleb Hammond\nHas leukemia he's been undergoing painful treatments at a Des Moines hospital for months it's not working other doctors are saying it's not working and we don't really have anything else we can do so the eleven year old kid said you know what screw it I'm going home\nSo he went home and he has a final wish for when he dies he's eleven and he's making final wishes\nEleven year old Caleb Hammond wants people to send him racing stickers\nHe's loved auto racing since he was two years old killed his passion is what prompted the request for stickers and his uncle says the stickers have been pouring in after social media appeal is trying to keep everybody spirits up\nUh he's been home for about three weeks now and he does what other eleven year old kids do as much as you can but then he gets tired really easily and he's hoping to get some racing stickers to cover his casket when he dies\nThat's what the eleven year old boy says he wants to racing's tickets are stickers to cover his casket\nWhen he died from leukemia God what a heartbreaking story that is\nAnd how about some good news it's also a little sad in some ways to have you seen the video of the reunions of families in North and South Korea\nHoly smokes a Donald Trump by the way is getting full credit for this\nHeat range between the presidents of north and South Korea to get together to make a deal so that families who are separated during the Korean War are finally getting a chance to meet relatives who were separated from them fifty sixty years ago\nAnd there was video of of of of families women who are in their Seventy five eighty year old range seeing their brothers and sisters for the first time since they were for\nMe and there I mean it's ... will they now have more than one surname heart [laughter]\nSo I think they're all of the same name still but can you imagine I mean the video is really is it's really astounding there you know they haven't seen family in sixty years Berlin Wall stuff God\nI mean can you ... and ... and here's the here's the kicker and the sad part about it is that apparently they were given a Donald Trump arrange the meeting to have them get the reunion together but apparently the deal is they are they can meet together in the same spot for three days\nBut there are being limited to only talk with each other actually sit together with each other over the three days for a total of eleven hours\nAnd the reason for that is the north Koreans don't want their people to find out too much about how good it is in South Korea for afraid they'll defect or try to defect but again there at least you're getting to see the relatives of the first time since Nineteen fifty\nOr even before that when they were separated before the war [noise] a quaint and spell oh man oh\nAnd Paul can't or got body slammed or the floor when police showed up after a Jefferson Airplane show in Akron, Ohio somebody found in a bomb threat fans started throwing rocks at the top the cops responded with tear gas and then all hell broke loose in Nineteen Seventy two in Akron, Ohio Jefferson Airplane\nNineteen Ninety six on this day Rick James gotten out of prison regime served two years for beating up a woman remember that story but ironically on this day two days earlier in Ninety six the woman he was going to marry got put in jail for shoplifting a pair of thirty nine dollar boots [laughter] see [noise]\nUh let's see ... up happening around the same time yeah been on that a pie report like three or four yeah they have yeah absolutely I almost every day every other day was regimes in Ninety six or ... class in ... from the blacklist is thirty nine years old today and Brooks wheel in the comedian from Saturday Night live is thirty two years\nAgo for Fifteen quarter after ... repeats coming up later all the crap it's almost baseball game tonight at a seven year on at six for five six o'clock and we won ... different Colorado Rockies cooked for in a row from us yeah Pittsburgh we want\nWhere nearly as well hey you know when we're absolutely Windsor good uh aid for for for all for ten sixty seven a lot of things going on including Michael Cohen the president's personal lawyers in court right now pleading guilty\nTo a bank fraud and tax evasion or something\nAgain it has nothing to do with Donald Trump's election has nothing to do with Donald Trump so called Russian collusion Paul Manafort's jury is now in its fourth day they sent another note to the judge and clearly they're stuck on something we don't know whether they're stuck on one of the Eighteenth things or on all parts of the things we don't know\nBut there are Manafort jury is or has some of the new no to the judge so they're struggling with something\nOr if I'm guessing I there's no way telling I'm totally guessing my guess is they're going to have to convict him of something ... are also feel they waste your time wasted our time I think I'm guessing so they probably get 'em convicted of something but I don't know whether it'd be won't be ugly will be everything by a long shot\nAnd how about this story here in Georgia very very sad story ally Hendra who could have been a lot worse oh Alexandra Suarez is uh twenty six\nYear old mother excuse me [noise] uh who uh had her kids in the car she took two children inside their grandmother's house a couple of weeks ago actually about ten days ago I took two kids into her\nGrandmother into the grandmother's house and left him there and then uh she went about her business and then realized that she had left another kid in\nThe car for about three hours a three year old child she left in the car outside the grandmother's house now this was in the afternoon eight o'clock that night the woman ... what she had done and called nine one one\nAnd said my God Bless my kid in the car and so the cop showed up and they arrested her\nAnd they took the boy to a physical checkup at the hospital he's in good condition he's fine\nUh but I miss Juarez was arrested for child cruelty even though she said oh my God my kids in the car called the cops to make sure he was okay for them to the hospital is going to be fine and now she's arrested she's being cooperative with the police\nBut my God she's charged with second degree cruelty to children\nUh she drop your kids", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Gainesville", "day": "07"}
