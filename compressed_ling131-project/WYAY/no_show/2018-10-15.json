keeping the\nHeating side of the house a ... in the winter time when it's cold we turned the heat on to be comfortable inside of the house then he hates the glass on the inside tiny bounces back into the house into the room saving you as a lot of\nHeat in the wintertime so thin\nAnd and I I might add also is a lowly and you can have a story that saved the furniture and some of the walls pain yeah it's like that who are not getting that direct sunlight areas so you're getting your furniture is not going to survey and your your walls aren't gonna start fading vehicles\nSenior lacks the UV rays from coming into your house aid that's in yellow your furniture or your floor us or a court dense or anything like that yeah that's a great\nPoint and and the son Jim we talked a lot of people to do a lot of things or whatever who garage doors doors or anything else the sun painting the sun is a killer if the killer for everything on the exterior house at the same thing it sounds like with the with the windows as well right that the uh the lowly windows are are going to protect your house\nYou're more of a point to on the subject or we in our quest for the much similar the highest possible and then ...\nFeel the war between the two or three banks of glass with and it with a guy called our income gosh that is a ... a guy's that he's ... he's in a harmless to\nHuman beings are is the way the every breaks you can breathe that these a lot of the air with your breath but eating has is about four and a half to five times the energy efficiency of the windows\nAre contributed to making the window even more energy efficient and that's what we do with our windows\nWere you know ... there's one of the thing you do with your windows I remember let's talk about the quality\nAnd the difference in the finals the the vital 'cause I Know you're vinyl is superior that you use\nYes Jim ... the vinyl we use is strictly a hundred percent voting final we don't use any recycling material or to make our windows because in the yellows a\nRecycling material things to yellow and uh maybe after a year or so it has these cards you know nobody away and that's why we don't use the vinyl we use is a hundred percent\nPure virgin vinyl and he is guaranteed to be in ... to all the elements to the heat the cold the ice water sleet snow you name it at when neighbor harm the quality of the composition of the vinyl\nAnd uh we have a\nWindow or to I've been we have a good bit it I'm best a level of quality the better I'm best that formed field frames and ... for added insulation and for a stronger structure of the window\nSills that's the way we have to make the the the windows wow [laughter]\nBoy oh boy you know that\nSounds like high quality that say this and when you would you do it as I can tell you that you don't want to do it again anytime soon I mean that none of the land of and it it does cost money where you got a lot right as in that house and you did not want to go out and do this again and five or six years\nBut you know Dan is you know being on your business to you're going to have a fantastic quality product like bird has but that's only half of us window factory success the other thing that's so important and I think we ... mentioned on break it's sixty percent of your success is what\nWhen you know with ... and then we talk about it every single week it you know you could have the highest quality product or with a with bad insulation it's it's not going to perform the way it's supposed to do so why don't you talk about Dennis wanted to talk a little bit uh installation you're that that's your forte\nWell thank you the installation uh the installers are trained boss at us wonder factory they all go through a rigorous training on how to remove the existing one is in the home\nHow to read and re installed a new one does uh the proper calling talking procedures and also the proper capping procedure which is the PVC coded aluminum that we use on outside to cover the brick mall and the cells with\nUm it's kind of unique uh you know I can express you discuss that with the homeowners\nA which is not something that they normally here on a regular sales pitch they hear about the windows the company and all of the different things but on a mosque sales they get a you know what's gonna happen how it's going to happen or who's going to be doing it and I'm In all the information that they need to know on the installation\nAnd you get the measurements right there and I get the permits right too I I Do know how to read is that better if that's helpful I can tell you that ah\nThe the other day I Want to do with installation I Know people are thinking well how long is this going to take I got a lot of windows here what is kind of your timeline to to to wrap up a job how long does it typically takes per per window well\nBasically on I Would wonder job out ah say Twenty one is it can be done in one day it is a long day but it can be done in one day they usually start about eight thirty nine o'clock they arrive on saying\nA set up the windows a walk through the house you know make sure what they need to do want straight size that any furniture that needs to be moved\nWe require the Hummer to move any foreign jury of about four feet away so that the installer has access to it\nUm again it's a very clean process and usually by four thirty five o'clock in the afternoon they're complete cleaned up and ready to go\nOkay so there's er there's your answer Jim yeah in fact when he when there was a day sounds like and what is that a couple of guys do three ...\nOkay we you know I'm a lot of people uh they hate the\nProcess the sales process dealing with sales people from different companies and you know being a being a conned into this or or or or or\nThe bait and switch and all that talk to us a bird or Dennis whoever wants to jump in here talk to us about how us window factory handles the sales process so walk us through from the time somebody calls and\nSo our listeners and get an idea how you guys operate\nIs a very simple process as far as you as one of the size of his concerns gym or the cost of ... will contact us and expressed their desire to get an estimate from us\nSo we set up an appointment to the office level and the ones that day and time one of ... with ... mile with add ... both the windows\nAnd we will show them to the homeowners are typically has a husband and wife team a and we'll only talk to them all the\n... of the windows and then the benefits how those features are going to work in their benefits in any in the\nSense of ... of a ... and savings\nAnd how the windows the new windows and doors will at it a lot of beauty or to the the at their home\nAnd um he said then we get to the point we don't waste their time shunned by by that by being there for three four hours or ... or anything like that okay on on average our\nAt time with the costs somebody is about an hour\nIt sounds like it's more of an education process hanging a hardcore sales\nMitch exactly and I one thing I Want to point out to you had to leave about the way we make our windows these these sort of thing that separates us when the factor that distinguishes that I've done it from the bulk of the weed those out there in the market\nFor instance we only use\nGlobal strength last stand the glass is once sixteenth offending each\nHowever we don't have that at all and we use only one eighth which is twice as thick as once these things and these two or three poor glass so let's say the lower paying so you'll have like for the Cleveland itself a quarter of a sudden each in glass\nAnd the space we use is probably the most expensive in the industry bought\nIs by far the most energy efficient or\nEat it prevents condensation from forming inside the glass now the homeowners get a written warranty from us when the factory at warranty that we are more them proud to honor\nWe're if you aggregate as a homeowner and I wonder if our customers\nAny compensation\nInside the glass ... plays the entire such decides she's comprised of the glass and the frame I round the the glass free of charge for ever\nCame out we don't ask questions or anything like that again or the the last ... that any compensation and links to replace for free ...\nYour ... everything you talk about you are a stickler for quality from a to Z\nWhere did that come from where you you you're a big believer in quality oh you you you you know because everything you say I mean everything is just the best thing or a materials and the way it's constructed and it just seems like you're very proud of that\nAnd yes I Am a I'm maybe I'm just guessing a that comes from my a\nNatural way of being a half old was being flooded in mind that they never things that I Do I have a new steal my children the fact that even if yes cheaply before doing it properly\nAnd they don't do it this ... do a good job even see the floors or doing anything at all washing dishes do the right job so I mean in the winter basis are all together for close to Thirty years\nNow and a half or was being involved with providing might cost so much with the highest possible quality and surveys that goes with it\nWell that's refreshing in a damn well Sam ... what does that term any job we're doing is we're doing right\nWell you know we we see all these ads all the time one Ninety nine to nine and I for a window you know the window companies are always talking about cheap and how cheap they can install window and and really that's a that's a bad road to go down right\nNow you know there and ask a couple of days I think about the last segment here we need to we need to talk about that a little of everything to talk about some of the scams on the window industry the other thing I Want to I Want to talk about is they'll look\nSome of the window what kind of different looks can we get so maybe we can talk\nAbout that in the next ... absolutely and uh you know it's um\nUh it it sounds like us window factory it's got to you they they they got some Perrier I won't just say quality product but as superior product and the installation is\nThere real I write right off the bat when you're producing your windows right you you really you really got control of the quality level and that's important piece of this you know many companies have anywhere Atlanta or anywhere else\nIn ... and I would I Would imagine somebody can actually come out and take a tour of of of your show ...\nYears that's a great time and we invite all now we're close somewhere to feel free to coming to the side and see how it is the way I see how well they're only ... I mean\nHow many people are going to say that hey folks I tell you something this is this has been great where we're up against a break here but we're with Bert concrete in debt as would have us window factory talking about all things through the window quality and installation and uh we've got another segment yet dance so we're going to be back and\nAnd dance going to be a be asking them about scams and rip offs ride dance yup and also I Want to know what these windows looked like he wants to know what they look like we'll be right back folks right here on the all four seasons home show\n[noise] [noise]\n... man I rode a horse drawn out on the back woods trail\nSettlers seeking a joy\nIs not true band yeah soda that starts coming off\nThe air to screw up helping dedicated home in Atlanta are essay Andrew ...\nWhich part of this is true ah the wagon horse drawn station wagon backwoods trailer side Dr was a two lane dirt road dirt okay not dirt but two lane why the worry yeah because we need one ... have why not sexy an hour a day we built our seniors delivering smile that\nService no surprise up from ... tax you can trust queen screen trained and timely every one of them there you go a good story ... be would be ... started that\nAgain ... we're our essay injury eating an air conditioning I mean I don't watch golf or how can we make you smile today are is Andrew's dot com there many sounds\nIn your day to day life there than step wake you up [noise]\nSounds that make you smile\nSounds ... energize him [noise]\n\nAnd found that help you relax [noise]\nHe said all going through your dealer ... three or four weeks or longer\nYou know where we're at the end of our show but real quick let's say somebody says Bert I Love your window I Want to call the window and I'm willing to pay for it but I Need some help what about financing\nWe provide financing zero money down\nOn twelve months they must attach Eighteen months they must not kidding ... get financing wow that fail you work two or three four or five years yes either way oh they're great and we accept all major very cards right at all you can pay by Chet whichever ways easier and more more convenience\nWell I Want to ask you guys before when the show is there any type of special were offering or anything that you want to mention to our listeners out there that if they call up and contact you mentioned the ... show that they can get by listening so you know they were listening to the show\nOkay by far the most\nPopular ... in the United states as well as in the state of Georgia\nAll sports including a lot to use the ... the ... called the global home that's the type of leader that goes up and down and it also tilts in the ... as well as the bottom side she's gate when those weaned those we're running that ... you buy one\nAnd you get the other one is second one for free\nFantastic fantastic ... told and everything ... concluding installation include ... how to folks get in touch with us window fact\nVery simple they can visit our website is W.

I don't believe in tax loopholes I Believe we should play pay everybody should have ... a a flat tax rate or we should have a national sales tax but\nThere is no such thing as a quote unquote loophole that only applies rich people it's just there are different types of income like capital gains versus traditional income we can discuss when those are the ... if you're bad policy but the language of loophole in accurate how about the trickle down effect doesn't work\nWell the trickle down effect is a term that it's going by left that economists no one on the right has ever suggested that there is something called trickle down where you give money to rich people and rich people suddenly make everybody else wealthy the idea is supply side economics meaning the people who develop new and better ... drive the economy\nTo nobody knew there was a demand for cars until cars were mass produced and suddenly everyone knew there was a man for cars they talked about this a little bit earlier this week the lie that\nWage stagnation in Nineteen Seventy nine means that\nThe quality of living since Nineteen Seventy nine and stagnant is ... idiotic and ... we live far better than we did in Nineteen Seventy nine without any doubt whatsoever Ronald Reagan supply side economics theory led to the greatest peace time growth in the history of the nation hey Joel says\nIs the Democratic party in the on recovery due to embrace it socialism and rockets behavior\nI mean it's probably the Dems and the wasted of history with the way the party well I mean as it currently to it as it currently can sure I Would prefer a Democratic Party that was not insane pressing actual solutions that maybe I disagree with us so we can have an honest debate about issues I think that a two party healthy system\nIs worthwhile and I think the right now\nWe have a ... party in the Republican Party and dying party and the Democratic party\nAt least in terms of ideology and the problem is that there are a lot of people who believe in that ideology we will be here on Monday\nWith more on the news if you are around on Sunday and make sure the check out the final episode of the ... bureau election special I'm fascinated airing it should be if you're not going to want to hear necklaces aventura\nCagey and reading ... why why they\nIn New York [noise]\n\nBefore\nI or go morning just heard new guys voice but then I realized also we have a new phone number [noise] and uh [noise]\nFirst time now my whole life has changed everything's different but the quick weight loss center program is specifically what I Need\nFor my needs my desires my goals also my life my whole lifestyles different I'm older of heart attacks since the first time I went back at work I have a whole different schedule here's the key one on one private counseling eating a lot of food kids\nJoined frequent parents went up I tell you about the conditions or how to check those out\nEleven locations and make it so easy to lose up to thirty pounds in thirty days for thirty bucks all services included the results are guaranteed I prove it free consultation tell them the ... eight hundred for all four forty fifty that's eight hundred for all four forty fifth year click 'em up on the Web cute W.

I don't know they called me right wing fraternal organization I'm not sure what that means but\nI Will say this\nAll of these groups are not the I'm going to say this [laughter] I was going to say that I Know I may get a little\nFlat for this oh by the way our number is still a for for for all for one oh six seven I Know I\nPosted it on Facebook that a change but that's the email I got then

were standing down again\nAnd I say to myself wow so you're going to allow these two thugs of the two groups of bugs of violent or they're not protest these none of these guys are protesters there not\nAnti fascist and the Proud Boys are not protesting and supported Trump or policy\nOr anything like that these are brawling young white males who want to fight\nAnd they this gives them a reason to fight\nThat's all these people are and I and I and I stress to the white part because a lot of times people talk about black lives matter and all these groups and the violence fog so I'm I'm I'm turning the tables now [laughter] black lives matter has nothing\nOn these two groups of people antifa and Proud Boys\nI mean black lives matter does protests they do shut down the highways I'm pissed that that too I don't like that strategy I don't think it's a viable strategy to get people on your side but trust me black lives matter is not marching the streets covered in black with their faces covered ready to beat people up with brass knuckles and sticks and baton\nThese two groups of\nPeople are antifa and Proud Boys like they look to fight each other they they they just nothing but gangs\nThug gangs\nAnd they just they're they're they're they're trade is beating people up who disagree with them\nAnd it's it's sickening it really is so much that come down is put both of them in their places because they're both they're both or a\nA ... ... fighters who have to fight in big groups go one on one with some people these are all these are all nothing but thugs all of these people all of these groups all these separate\nGroups that goes back to what I said about pledge of allegiance goes back to what I said about the America and being a a national identity it's all the same thing\nEvery once in a subgroup of some subgroup of some sub group this whole intersection\nNow the you know what that means that means that if I'm a male and and black and and and and and say uh what is it a a heterosexual heterosexual that I've got to have a certain belief system because my intersection al ... says I should\nJust utterly ridiculous as an ally ridiculous so it comes Brett Barney stood bunch a street or chin dogs\nThat's all they are no anti fur and Proud Boys all these groups are nothing but fighting all they want to do is draw that's all they want to do they just what

[noise]\nProtestors be warned you don't want to get between this black man and the buffet [noise]\nUsually winter [noise]\nChief justice Roberts refers Kavanaugh ethics complaints to the tenth circuit do you guys know the story the big story\nAh I I'm not sure if it's what the left\nWants to to be but it's a fairly large story\n\nSo as a Republican leadership Reno was celebrating you know within the beer and the champagne and everything like that I'm chief justice Roberts requested\nLast Wednesday on October tenth that the tenth circuit investigate more than twelve ethics complaints that have been made against the new we see the justice Kavanaugh\nAnd Democrats are excited ooh boy this is gonna be cool\nAnd Republicans alike up Justice Roberts fraud\n[laughter] did it again to us and so here's the interesting thing so the\nCharges there almost twenty something and all of these ethics charges stem from one thing and one thing only justice Kavanaugh's\nA\nTestimony the second time around\nShe remember when we're all happy it would still are that he fought back he robbed that yeah he ... he was ... you know they said he was on civil and he was he didn't have the ah the ah\nJudicial temperament whatever that means I guess you have to be you just have to take things thrown at you know I [laughter] don't judge is always hand down like contempt\nOf court charges and all these kind of stuff when lawyers get out of hand so well anyway I don't know judicial temperament means of some newly made up a left thing to attack people on but\nJudge Karen ... crap Henderson of the district court of appeals\n\nThat the complaints concern Kavanaugh's statements none of actions and so the statements statements that he\nMade a a ... what did he made during his testimony\n[noise] so what we do know is that you you can't complain about statements that at it you know that I don't know what to me\nBut I Know the weapons excited about it the right things he's that we've been stabbed in the back and I'm just not sure do we need anything to worry about twenty four hundred law office is determined that just judge Kavanaugh display they lack of judicial temperament that will be disqualified for any court\n... what does that mean he was in testimony defending against things that never happened to him so I don't what what law professor what are you guys talking about\n\nWith us know that President from was in ... when you say the capital swearing in that as a justice of the Supreme Court cabinet I being it had been proven innocent\nAt fifty for the majority of the Senate merely voted to approve cabinet is not even the nomination\nWell there was no what do you mean ... ... ... what do you mean Trump wasn't incorrect he was proven innocent you know one from an innocent because the lady that accuses him of of assaulting her in fifth grade or whatever ninth grade whatever grade they were in\nSays she's not going to pursue the charges any longer that's how we do is ... considered innocent he you guys go again\nClaiming someone's guilty without them going to court without doing anything and the person who said they did something about going to pursue it anymore so you're not going to pursue it anymore so you could see you to call me guilty of something that's ridiculous\nThis is absolutely ridiculous but people do it all the time left and right let's go to cowboy cowboy\nWelcome to the shelling went to the new talk ...\nSize you are wonderful cowboy [noise]\nOf course they helped me understand this latest shirts stream the Democrat voted\nOff the air thank you well he um okay okay I understand your question I'm Sorry I'm not no I Will answer your question it has been done in America churches\nAre not allowed to have any political speech that's how they enjoy tax\nExempt status historically in the African American community churches represented something more than just a religious place they were meeting their worship I mean there was a center they were centers of community it was a different dynamic so by\nAnd large the federal government the federal government has never really ever come down on any white churches all black churches synagogues or ... or ... I'm I'm a mosque or anything for talking politically they they really have not they pretty much left that law alone and they don't challenge it and that's white and black\nChristian Jewish gentile whatever it is religion you are the kind of left that look left it alone however\nThe differences in this case the New Georgia project partnered up with a prominent pastor\nOr the pastor of Ebenezer church was a part of that organization to register voters and so that's the interesting part and that is new that is totally new\nOkay\nSo that that was new now he was going on and he wasn't doing it as the as the a pastor of a church he was doing it as a private citizen but he was definitely involved with that and and I\nI don't know how you separate your your prominent position in the community from your prominent position in the community to do something different [noise]\nAll right now it's not a problem sir blessed day due to my brother [noise]\nFlorida Jamie what's happening or going all eyes are on what's going on in the morning was more good morning to\nYou were talking about they they didn't have no kind of communication down in Florida offered this storm I thought we had a staff bullet satellites was Dale that's how we communicate\nWell apparently up until yesterday there was no cell service so to cell towers the towers have to communicate with something of the towers are blown down you have no cell service\nYeah I Do I'm going to mess with you that\nOh man [laughter] [noise] hey look that guy was talking to call they're talking about we got a ball running our government\nI don't know how much more playing or or in your face they got to be to show you that they're that they're evil people that are in our government run it because they get away with the crowds they do and it's not just the Democrats that it's on our side too that's while they get away with it because they're all to grow up\nThey have dirt on each other for a while they don't they don't tell you know like that's how they control they get hurt on them and they they hold it over their head and you say something will go released this information against you and you ain't never go get a leg and again and you're going to jail time yeah well you need is law abiding citizens\nIn in our government they don't know what we're politicians that's the problem is politician\nThat's the reason we're going to shake Maureen absolutely I got to go to sports Jamie thank you for calling my brother are sports with bread Barney\nFalcons get a big win even though she doesn't think so what are the bigger the law no no you're right on your back when it goes\nFor free of your five sports broadcast last week I said this is the big game for the falcon yes so I've got this got if it's a big game for the falcons\nThey one that's got to be I just weren't impressed with their when that's what I think I Want to say it wasn't a president or a win win but it was an impressive they should have smacked Tampa Bay and Tampa Bay was in that game to the very yet and I think that's what I was saying\nAfter you laugh to demand alright I'm a keep trying to keep try John lover boy John Donne lemon\nLemon sleazy easy peas eleven squeeze easy ... he says that is not my name he hates it and what do you call it what does it gets his ... he said oh I don't we're panties\n[laughter] at least not on air [laughter] Lisak a student enters the so so Harvard University I'll keep trying crystal Jones or keep trying she's the contact for CNN a lawsuit try or talked about this before mhm\n[laughter]\nI talk about this before the um so the Asian Americans is to rehash the story students for fair admissions\nWas or what is a group that assuming Harvard because they feel and just an Asian American students they feel an Asian American students are not getting into Harvard the way they supposed to because they're the they're being disproportionately or I'm\nA a prejudiced against because they have test scores high test scores high scores on on grey high grades and everything like that but they're being left out because we hear this their argument is white African American and Hispanic students\nWho perform lower on their test scores and have lower grades than they do are getting into school and so their argument is wait a minute what ... what we thought this was a ... the best the best\nTheir argument is why should Joe the senator's son get in with a C student why should you know Jim malls get in because he's African American\nThe white guy get in because we no other reason except that he's diversity to and Hispanic guy get in because why why why are you keeping us out\nThat's their lawsuit\nWhile at the same time they're white students suing in other ... other ... parts of the country who are saying they're being disproportionately ah left out because they're white\nAnd so what's going on is you're seeing basically a dismantling of affirmative action\nNow what I always found interesting affirmative action they every study of affirmative action you know affirmative action benefits more than any other group of people if you're going to break this country down into groups you know who have benefits more than any other group of people white women\nWhite women benefit more from affirmative action at formative action than any other group of people in the country for instance let's say you have an affirmative action program for contracting and businesses\nThe vast majority of people get those contracts are white women the vast majority of them tend to be married to guys who own forty nine percent of the company\nBut the ... biggest beneficiary\nBeneficiaries of affirmative action historically have been white women which is all which is why I've always found it interesting that African Americans go so hard for ... for ... for a for a a a a program or a policy\nThat doesn't affect them oh doesn't benefit them one way or the other let's go to

a bookie out here in LA and that book was tied in with\nItalian guys and booking loan sharking and you know you work your way up you know you can work yourself through all sorts of situations are for the good or for the bad and if you're successful enough even in the vet you know eventually you could end up in prison\nIf you're good enough got that and that's a very good way of putting it so you met this guy young kid and so later on in life now how did you you know because I'm looking at your picture on a book and you know you you look you're African American so I ... it when you say it's a family business you're not Italian or you\nKnow and now he was an undergrad and he was he was Jewish and he was ... yeah right through the Jewish mom\nWell he had associations with\nWith the Italians from long standing just you know book making loan\nShark gotcha I'm Jewish as well and that's how that's how I started with\nUm and you know anytime you can find a way to make a an extra buck you know you could team up with anyone\nAbsolutely and I want to take a real digress here put ten seconds and thank my uh my uh traffic guy door to door traffic map your door for getting his interview with you so I think you Matthew I'm now what was your criminal act that got to put in jail\nOr initially I was arrested for the kidnapping extortion of Joe France's a crime that had to and originally happened in two thousand and four but I was arrested in two thousand and five\nNow Joe Frances so tell us help you tell my listeners who that is for those that don't remember who use these famous at the time will tell our listeners who that is\nA he started the the girls gone wild video series\nYou know all throughout the early to thousands you know plastered all throughout late late night TV a small towns Panama City Florida Cancun, Mexico where are you gonna get fined young girls that were all liquor it up and\nYou know get them to show that their bras for a trucker had\nMade money off of it yeah\nAnd they made money off I'm so bad as discussing it that was I Am familiar with the girls gone wild videos because they the commercials and late at night and at that time before porn was so ubiquitous we could uh that was kind of porn for a lot of us watching those commercials what made you want to kidnapping extortion him though\nUm so I had known him for for quite some time being in the LA nightlife saying you know you come across all sorts of folks and he was around so it wasn't you know he wasn't a stranger to the nightlife saying that I had come up in\nThat we had many mutual friends uh I had been to his place party you know in the clubs and thousand times with him\nBut the word I got a I got called to a meeting at I was told that uh there was a girl who lives down in Mexico with him party in her and her friends were down there separately but they wind up running than to him as in late two thousand and three\nAnd she's you know voluntarily went back to his hotel and parties with them and the next morning she woke up she knew she was no longer version\nSo her her dad was connected with the guys that are associated with\nThe guy was connected with them yeah gotcha okay now what well before we go any further when you say connected to does that mean they were soldiers they were part of the mafia or they just business associates like connected to does it what does that exactly mean in in in I guess mafia per land\nUp business association of some kind\nOf kind of guy I didn't I've never met her got ya I'm\nSo whatever the connection the guys that I you know go meet with me the rundown of what happened and their preference I mean they could have easily send the hit squad to get rid of them right or that would have been easy part but they actually just want him to be embarrassed and\nThey wanted him to be in fear every time that he goes to open his door that he's asked to think about what might be on the other other side of the wall so that's when I came up with a an ingenious plan that eventually you know was read about in the police report\nTo go around and let people know that I'm a crime does cost and it does it does it does pay to stay away from it and I appreciate that are you doing that and God Bless you and good luck to you sir thank you thank you\nGo to ... percent of with Matt door got a new crash in ... county eighty five

interesting about this interview yesterday\nIs the things like a ... a lot of Trump's interview with the same I I had some stuff for that but I'll probably pray for Morrow but millennia norms interview with the same way you know what I mean it was totally totally totally you had an agenda coming into this thing and\nMost people you know I interviewed people all the time my agenda and

like how do I get what questions do I ask you so you could say the things\nThat my listeners want to hear or are interested in hearing is better way of saying it\nIs it's really it's complete insanity

to the government you might as well turn or you might as well bird you're flushing it down a toilet Milton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while you know\nIt's always worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman the late great Milton Friedman he had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on here and there's no turning back\nThis way to spend money summarizes completely why the government giving the government money is a total complete epic disaster [noise]\n\nWhat are the most efficient what's the most efficient ways to spend ... way to spend money right you spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why\nBecause the cost of the product you're purchasing matters if your money\nBut the quality of what you're purchasing matters too because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family you want a good car you want to go home you want good clothes you don't buy crappy suffers going to fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\n\nWhat's another way to spend money left going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people\nFriedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer\nDoes equality matter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest feel a little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way when you spend money on other people the quality of what you're buying on matters so much\nIt's not yours\nOther people there's another way to speed less efficient other people\nCan spend other people's money on themselves you going to work trip you your job is is a is paying for the hotel that's other people's spending other people's money on themselves you're spending other people's money on your hotel room this quality\nMatter yeah you're damn right is your hotel room you want the best hotel room out there but the cost that no\nNo it doesn't matter that's the jobs money you know yours gimme the to the top floor of Trump Tower I'll take it cost them matter\nYou may say wow that sounds like really inefficient way to spend money all the way it gets worse it gets even worse\nOther people spending other people's money on other people\nThe most inefficient way to spend you can never run here this folks other people's spending other people's money and other people what is that it's the government it is the the the cesspool of government taking your tax dollars to think about it the government's taking your money and spending it on other people\nThat's the costs matter how low it ain't their money they don't care what they're buying this equality\nMatter if they're not even spend it on themselves they don't even care they're just giving\nPeople money while working to pay for their health care yeah but it's crappy health care we don't care it's taxpayer money whatever just go to spend that just keep spending\nThat's government it is the worst possible way to spend my the government's better off taking your tax dollars\nAnd buying themselves lamborghini's at least they look for quality car and boost the economy or we need we need quality you're not going to care about the costs when they take your money and they spend it on other people the cost or the quality none of it matters nothing\nFreedman was a genius a genius\nYou know understand why it is an imperative to not fall into this gas lighting truck that we're not paying their fair share your fair share as much as you can keep as possible because every dollar over that amount to fund our military and the constitutional role of government is wasted by people who don't care about the cost or the quality of what they buy the centrally flushing your money down the toilet\nBowl and that's a fact jak we\nNeed the Reagan days ... when Reagan made the argument the government is the problem in Trump's doing that right now you just force their hand in
