Williams Sweeney I think I said they're each time that we face similar situations but it bears repeating today\nIt is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adversely impacted our investigation worry future prosecution\nThe public understands the need for this level of operational security and for that reason I Will not be able to answer specific questions on what we know\nWhat I can say is that at various times over the last few days Ken suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles\nLaw enforcement responded and each package was collected by experts and examinations or now underway at the FBI lab in Quantico\nAdds to the device is located in New York which contained a powder\nThe initial now it's just indicates that the powder in those particular ... did not present a biological threat other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nWe continue to revise the American public to remain vigilant as it does remain possible further packages had been or could be mailed\nThese devices should be considered dangerous report any suspicious package to law enforcement and it is worth repeating do not touch do not move do not handle any specific suspicious or unknown package leave it to the law enforcement professionals\nDid he talk about the oil in the public to cause any information you may have we've set up a hotline nationwide that hotline is one eight hundred coal FBI\nDid he make anything I mean we're just beginning ... information down there and no one else speaking at an anti communist dangerous beyond now that I have as he talked about the

here at the beginning of this thing but I don't know whether there was in fact\nAny explosive powder or device and apparently there was not a detonator so it couldn't have been blown up anyway so I'm either way it's obviously a that's a scare tactic stunt and it didn't work and it's not going to work\nAgainst anybody in that shouldn't makeup anybody's mind about it and ended up by the way\nAlthough these liberals or you're killing me Anderson Cooper actually had the balls to criticize Donald Trump blaming Donald Trump for this bomb business [noise]\nBring people together with the

screaming for interns and we finally got to you know you guys have insurance government yeah we got in terms of guess when telling the truth ...\nLargest people for ... you know I'm sure it was a cameras demand you know I Know it wasn't as demand is it it's the people who make these decisions\nWhich is why why why did Donald why do people believe the more you spend on wind the better it is that's not true exactly it's not at all but people do what he's writing ... do\nWe were like oh I'd spent fifty dollars on wind is definitely better than twenty dollar ever going to have you ever go on a on your way to a house party and want to pick something up on a way\nThat quick ... a quick quick trick quick trick yeah we got like ... trip thank you quick trip wind for three Ninety nine that's the best thing that you have never come into my house\nFor why you bring whatever you need to right that's great wine three now is that you get three bottles out for a little over ten bucks yes star\nIdol noses from what I was told one time that if you're showing up to somebody's house never bring a bottle is less than twenty dollars there's no rule on\nWhat you need the biology there's just so and that's what I was on I never heard some advocate in there it is harder stuff\nOn there is no longer have there is no there is not a dollar value to be placed on where when you're taking something to someone's house that's no dollar value it's the thought that counts I just look for the wine that's twenty dollars but with my Kroger postcard is like you should\nTalk to her son twelve dollars there's yeah there is no um there is no a dollar value you could take all you could take all Milwaukee for the house body and it doesn't rank up all the IBM i know I feel like you're not a good\nYou're only once you've ... you've you lying and put it in a free drink all the eggs\nWere did you guys get this this is\nGood stuff [laughter]\nOkay so people also think just like expensive one that imported wine taste better so they did this blind taste test with ones from South Africa Germany Spain Argentina I was in Wisconsin guess who won Iowa Iowa when was the guy you know you have good order them when people knew where the winds were far from just you have the worst one and\nI Am so since then I've known as one of the jump into combat snobs and now now that's not just like what you got there a a a plastic bottle of vodka you bring into my house that's disgusting dude you show up with toilet water I mean\nI think I Would not do I would not bring a plastic bottle of wine in a box you wouldn't think that I wouldn't bring wine about right yeah and that's too obvious I Would prefer the one in a box over the other stuff because at least the boy slaps the bag was well I don't know\nAbout that we could lose that was ... we're going to go right well I'm not\nAsk we're not even going to ask which has got to go right through what's the word meant so far fetched sometimes at Grady I forgive you can give another person is is to simply include them see that's why you're not suspense when he wants to\nLive man you come to my house you bring some alcohol I don't care what kind of ... see that's why you my brother so we're asking the question of the day is Rudy you'd think sent to bomb a for for for for one of six seven George Soros wants to get five hundred million dollars to migrants and refugees\nNext on a shelf he went to the show you're listening should also went to a show\nFrom Haiti and reading dot com studios why why do you\nTo see [noise] accused\nBomber charged Trump lashes out I'm Christopher cruise\nBy federal charges so far against accused male bomber Caesar sale but fifty six year old man from Florida is a former amateur body builder and stripper he's in jail in Miami this morning justice correspondent Evan threads sociology has been arrested many times they started\nFocusing on South Florida in particular because they were able to identify that a lot of these packages most of these packages appeared to have come from one specific area in particular that ... facility where a lot of them were processed before they were there were shipped\nToyotas as an officer of ah of over twenty six years\nI can tell you there there are some people need to be in jail you know one of one of the cases we've been talking about on my show over the last several months is that case in front of the capital city club where you know of where Christian broader Washington DC was shot and killed during a robbery where you have\nAnd one of the defense in that case Jason or Jane my Rick ... who had been let out when he probably should have been kept behind bars and and this is coming from folks that I Know who are both criminal defense attorneys and\nFormer judge that also feel the same way that that person should not have been let out and maybe we'll talk about that case somewhere down the road as a progressive but no you're right there are some people like him that need to be light of it\nThey they need to be in yeah absolutely um but there are others that don't write and both regardless both neither rights protected shore and they need a good defense they need good lawyers because if we don't protect\nThose who've done allegedly the worst of things are accused of during the worst things are those are just really bad backgrounds right yeah we don't protect their rights under our constitution then all of our rights are taken away absolutely history shows one thing it shows that when government tries to take away people's rights\nThey always take away the rights of those liked the least ... first they always take weight in the rights of the criminal\nThe rights the person accused of crime right they always go after the undesirable first\nBecause they figure nobody will care and that's how we lose our rights as citizens so if we represent the rights of everyone\nEveryone's rights are protected\nThe usual ... but you're right we still do also need good prosecutors as well and you know it's interesting how many people I've met along the way that ah that our life long criminal prosecutors yes you know that that they\nMaybe had been on the defense side for a while but they uh you know where the prosecutor went to the defense side then decided to come back to the prosecution side\nIt's true and I know some of those people yeah and the the system in order to work has to have really good prosecutors really good judges really good defense lawyers\nAnd really good jurors New Jersey the bedrock but the key in a trial or any part of the criminal justice system\nIncluding the police right is that everybody does their job\nAnd everybody does their job according to the laws vary according to due process that the laws and liberties and due process for all citizens are respected and that way the system works for the system breaks down is where somebody doesn't do their job as well as they could\nExactly what you're talking about the criminal justice system we are going to take apart and we're going to find out what the criminal justice system is all about\nHere on arrested on the new

system and and and who's in polluted in the criminal justice system\nThat's a great question um what I Would say and I talked about my book arrested by the way America's criminal justice system I'm Talking about in the first part of the book which is called the beast revealed\nThe way I described the criminal justice system is as obese it's a piece for two reasons okay one it's obese because it was awesome power\nYou have the incredible power of the federal government and or state government behind a prosecuting people arresting people take away people's rights and liberties and possibly throwing them in jail\nUm and so it's an ... it's a beef with awesome power I go back to what James Madison said one of our founding fathers he said the government his definition of government\nWas a necessary evil\nMhm yeah I've a lot of people think it's an ...\nExactly and and many people tend to think of it that way and that's okay because that's what it is it's necessary but it's evil for what makes it evil what makes an evil is incredible power that it has to destroy our civil liberties and thrown in jail\nSo it is obese at the same time it's also a based because it's a bureaucratic nightmare and this is one of the reasons that really kept me in the system and kept me working as a criminal defense lawyer all these years has been practiced now for twenty five years now\nIs the bureaucracy of it and it's not anyone's fault it's just the nature of government itself\nGovernment by nature is utterly inefficient\nAnd quite frankly a big cluster sometimes and what happens is new ... what happens in the criminal justice system is no different what happens is any other government bureaucracy where you have a lot of inefficiency and a lot of problems and the dangers of people getting lost the system the rights being violated all sorts of things\nBut ... what are we talking about the criminal justice system would you say that the the bottom rung of the ladder if you will of this of this criminal justice beast as you call it or the maybe the the the first vote of the beast it would be\nThe law enforcement officer on the street because he or she are the ones every day who are out there that are that are answering calls for service that if you dial nine one one uh you have a problem they're the ones that are going to show up at your house if you have an accident they're the ones that are going to show up on the accident scene\nAnd unfortunately even if it's a fender bender if there's damage ers bodily injuries that they're going to wind up giving someone a ticket and that is going to put that person into the criminal justice system or\nYou might get a DUI and then you get arrested and that might be the first time you're really introduced to the criminal justice system\nIf you had not been in jury duty or something like that where that too is a piece of the criminal justice system\nThat's absolutely right in my because I'm so many people end up in her face and with the police first it could be anything from a police officer at a traffic stop right\nTo a federal agent who comes with a search warrant wanting to search your business and look at your computers and files and these kinds of things but it's usually at the investigatory stage at the police days right will become involved\nSo that is like the feet if you will or the the basis of the New York\nUm and then and that is many times a person's first introduction ah beyond that then you get into the other players in the system and there was a prosecutor and the judges and the defense lawyers the jurors the bail us all the people to make courtroom run the court clerks probation officers\nOn and on and on and on and on sheriff's departments people around the jails yeah or like you mentioned a DUI DUI school people who run DUI school bail bondsman sure there are all part of the beast it's not that the beast\nElection twenty\nYou can make a difference you voting began to seven AM do your part cast your ballot\nPlaying now on the news talk twenty six seven where Leno comes to talk [noise]\n\nNow I Know this month or two pack of napping night vision had lamps was up to ten dollars off because we're ball comes longer nights and\nVisibility luckily our hand lamps up superior elimination which helps reduce the chance of an accident [noise] see better drive safer with up to ten dollars off to pack up and night vision had left ... people back snapping no well I Know\nThat participate in up all of our source for instance they're wanting to [noise]\nWhen I was I get the um the song do and that's what I make my things in a blanket with I find it and everybody ran or fixing them like if you had a special recipe\nYeah let me give you a receipt allergies here you\n\nGet a ... and his ... happy to America [laughter] and just by saying she had a lead you hear\nWhat happened in my neighborhood Twenty one Savage Pettus\nTo school a vet said it was a shooting so you know [laughter]\nOh no this is a factor school like\nJane I'm going to go [laughter]\n\n[noise]\nBut this is arrested with Mike Brooks and it went a criminal defense attorney damn caught way for them to arrest in with your host my brush and criminal defense attorney Dan kind of way recovered or what the criminal\nJustice system was or\nOr what it is and how big it is you know we always we always hear that we even heard during the during judge Kavanaugh the or the confirmation hearings over over almost forty hours of testimony and questioning by the United States Senate Judiciary Committee we we we heard\nOne thing come up all the time and that was due process what the hell is due process you know what is it what makes up due process it in in what is it really what does a really neat that\nThat's a great question All right so we try to\nDo to try to break it down and try to get their ... you know really we hear about it all the time but what what do you know ... let's go to keep it simple exactly that's for me you need to do the guy\nSo when you think you'd do process you have to think first where most of our constitution and it's really does start there you're the Fifth Amendment and you've got the fourteenth amendment both preserve our rights you process one perspective the state's one with their sports that's the fourteenth the other with respect\nTo the federal government right the ... the whole idea is to both the states and the federal government meaning the government and all it's awesome power that the government has over citizens\nThey have to the government of the United states in each state\nHas to respect the due process rights of every single American period that's what it's about now within due process you have two terms and I'll throw them both out and ... because there's really two types of due process [noise] one is called substantive due process well what the heck is substance of process frankly\nWhat what that is those are your rights\nWhen you think of like for example you're right to free speech your right to freedom of religion your right to own a gun but you're right to be indicted by a grand jury was just the specimen yeah these are all substantive due writes in other words to process the substance of due process because there were whites you have as an American\nThey're based in natural law they're based in concepts of western human rights some of them go back to the ancient Greeks and they've been developed through the years and the others come forward\nThe second part is procedural due process procedural due process that's the process itself I Gotcha like for instance if you get accused of crimes or you have the right to a jury trial yup the judge can't come in and say you're guilty so you have a right\nTo a jury trial but you also have a right if you want it it's up to you or you know if you you can for with your ... you have a bench trial did the judge is going to hear the only the only way that's\nGoing to happen is if you choose you the citizen choose hopefully with advice of your lawyer right to wave your right to a jury trial so for instance your right to be read your rights you're Miranda rights in certain situations or your right to remain silent so we're going to talk about that all this kind of stuff these are all procedures they're putting in place to make sure that people\nPeople's substance of rights are protected\nAnd that they receive proper due process why is this important we're now we go back to the peace why is the beast obese yeah these the beast is the government the government can take away your life liberty\nOr property from you actually and\nSo therefore but they can only do it if they follow due process you know let me give you a couple of examples of what we're talking about one of the earliest examples of due process is talked about in magna Carter really which was written and\nTwelve Fifteen I guess that's it goes back a long way flown like short and basically it was a bunch of Doberman and England who really kicked off a king John ... king John kept taxing them\nTo get more money to raise more funds to go fight wars in France oh whereabouts actors in Britain okay and as governments and king John quite frankly was it a very good soldier\nHe kept losing so not only did he tax the nobles and take all their money to go fight these wars in France but he lost them\nSo doubled that right so they finally got tired of all king John the novels and they made him sons magna Carter off the field ... ... and then it it talks about the process it says king you may be the king you made me you know what about God on high it'd be ...\nBut you will not take our money and tax us without proper due process\nSo it actually talks about it so it goes way back and you can go all the way back to the ancient Greeks and find such\nEven back then that people really understand what due process\nUnderstand the government is the beast we've established that we understand that government has a tremendous amount of power why because the kings soldiers the sheriff's department the FBI whoever it is\nCan snatch you up and throw you in a cage\nAnd lock you in there that is pretty powerful is pretty bad for the police have the right to actually kill you shoot you for instance under certain circumstances\nRight those rights you know it looks worse so this is these are awesome powers cages guns shooting death right track awesome powers you okay so we need some due process to make sure that if our rights our liberties or property are threatened that it's done properly\nLet me give one example hey by the white folks you're listening to arrested when your host Mike rocks and global defense attorney Dan kind of way to go ahead day\nOr so let me give you let me give you a a another country and other play okay when was due process you remember a gentleman named Saddam Hussein\n... yes very well\nAll right so this was Saddam Hussein's due process let's say he didn't like his Secret Service will pick up the middle of the night drag either house put over your head\nAnd you'd end up in the outskirts of Baghdad summer in a room filled with people you know officers and so it's an all we were sitting there smoking a cigar and accused you of water we felt like using off\nAnd then you know the right to protest and say you didn't do whatever he accused of hay and care that didn't work [laughter] and then they pretty much hung you before dawn and then your body's probably dumped in a river whatever that's due process that was due process under but that was due process under Saddam Hussein while\nSo we don't I don't like that to profit I don't like it either in our founding fathers didn't yeah and and also quite frankly police officers prosecutors judges defense lawyers any you talked to anybody involved in the criminal justice system\nThey had a really any it's almost part of a DNA in this country an innate understanding the due process protects\nOf us on our rights and so it's pretty much respected by everyone in most circumstances but it's also why\nWhen someone feels that they are due process rights have been violated did they get so upset because it's that intense a feeling it's ... it's a very intense feeling because it's part and parcel of who we are as a society as a country\nAnd and due process I get from what I'm hearing it starts from the time unfortunately you're you're getting arrested from the time you're as a 'til the time\nUm if you're found guilty that you're sentenced but the due process even goes further than that it goes all the way into the appeal process is well is that is that is that pretty accurate\nThat's accurate and one of the things that I talk about my book arrested battling America's criminal justice\nSuch a great book by the way if you have ... if you haven't picked it up is it on Amazon on Amazon okay great definitely it's by dead Conway Esquire\nUm yeah so when you talk about when you talk about sort of the rights of the protection all that stuff we talked about in the book\nIs that it really is a soup to nuts process where it does start when you're a yeah if you're arrested and charged nationally because even before that many times especially in the federal system\nWhere you don't get arrested but you you'd be come under federal investigation by the FBI or or another organization I'm associated with the federal government so it's a due process is always there and it's all it was part of everything I'm One of the things about\nLike we talked about earlier on the show basically all we do in this group is we follow the proven software it's presented on a very basic level it's color coded it's only two colors it's not

[noise]\nSpecial report deadly Pittsburgh shooting a deadly attack on a synagogue and Pittsburgh is being investigated as a hate crime correspondent neck for land sales but the tally from Pittsburgh public safety director\nHe would not confirm the number of those killed only saying that there were multiple casualties are\nAdding that this was a horrific crime scene perhaps one of the worst that he's ever seen he did say there were six injuries and of those injuries included for police officers he says three officers had non life threatening injuries three others were in critical condition\nPresident Trump is monitoring the situation\nThe markets it's it's almost like the market doesn't believe that this economic growth can continue and the stock market is more about a production of what we can anticipate from stock earnings\nAnd what the markets are telling us right now is that the market doesn't believe the twenty ninth Tina will see the same earnings growth like twenty twenty and so because of that you're seeing the sell off and you're seeing investors find exits ... even\nThe report we're third quarter GDP did three point five percent that's great under President Obama we barely average the book two percent under eight years or President Obama here we have four percent in second quarter three point five percent and the third quarter these are\nGreat numbers but yet the markets are selling huh so why\nDid this there's a few different reasons but you also have to remember there was a few other factors at play your interest rates that are rising\nWhich puts pressure on the U.S economy which actually could send the U.S economy into recession and then you also the mid term elections coming up and under two weeks markets hate uncertainty markets don't like knowing or\nBeing on aware of what may be coming in the future\nAnd so this is why if you're in retirement or approaching retirement\nIt's important to have a portion of your portfolio that you need for income unaffected by the ups and downs with the markets there was a\nEconomist on CNBC earlier I was watching it earlier this week and he made a great point said look if you're a retiree the money that you need to live off of month to month should not be in the stock market\nAnd I know we we've probably been low to sleep a little bit when we look back over the last few years the markets have done so well we've gotten by by having our money in the stock market we continue to see it go up and we think all as well but that's not the norm\nSo I Want to send out a word of caution today the money that you need for income in retirement over the next few years should not be in the stock market because think about this\nIf you have the money that you need in retirement for the next few years off to the side in a bucket that's unaffected by the market just stuff really concern you it should and\nBecause you got all the income that you need off to the side but if you're relying on the stock market to cover your retirement expenses I'm Sorry someone has sold you ally\nSomeone has sold you ally that says put your money in the stock market and just sell stocks when you're getting come off the portfolio in my opinion there's nothing worse\nThan selling stock especially when the markets are down to meet your retirement expenses that can be devastating\nWe've run reports I've looked at analysis that says if you take a major loss your first few years of retirement while you're making withdrawals off of your retirement portfolio that can wipe out your retirement why\nBecause if you take ... withdraw from your portfolio when it's losing money you've locked in that law\nYou have a hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio and it drops ten percent Ninety thousand just using ... numbers hundred thousand to up to Ninety thousand\nAnd you make need to make a ten thousand dollar withdraw so you're Ninety goes to eighty\nSo overall you're now down twenty percent what type of returned\nDo you need to get back to break even okay if you drop twenty\nPercent what type of returned do you need to break even you needed twenty five percent return to break even how long did that take what if the market is negative the next year\nWhat is it only average is five percent you can take you five six years just to get back to break even\nBecause you made a withdrawal and a year with the market was negative I Hope you can understand the implications of this\nSo this is why when we look at these macro issues like the economy and I am very bullish on the economy I've been on the news quite a bit in the last few weeks\nVery bullish about the economy but it doesn't mean that the because the economy has bullets at the stock market's going to be bullish if you actually look back to Nineteen eighty seven I was looking at the GDP back in when we had a market crash in Nineteen eighty seven\nGDP was well over three percent in Nineteen eighty seven to get another example to where the economy can doing good be doing well but the stock market you perform horribly\nSo this is a good time to just share with you if you're listening right now he's a David it'd be great to have a second opinion you need to know if we go into a recession and what that will do for your portfolio\nWe do something that our our office called a stress test analysis along with the morning star now this morning star now says\nIt's a thousand dollar value but will actually provide a complementary if you take advantage thousand dollar value

S. wealth W A L P H\nA dot com or the clip that we just played was by David Stockman a who is the ... the director under Ronald Reagan and you know what he was he was on CNBC and he was describing what he sees as a coming\nFiscal disaster a monetary policy disaster that's in front of\nA sudden you know he was owned bee director for many years and the Reagan he sees these things he looks at budgets and\nSo it has to do with just the fiscal insanity that we have coming out of Washington and so you know we're always looking for where's the next financial crisis coming from\nYou know the economy's doing well if you look at any economic data are the numbers show us the time we were doing what we have two hundred thousand jobs created in January we had a wage increase for the first time in quite a while but the federal deficits that are larger than a trillion dollars a year\nOr masses\nFor an economy that is an advanced stage of economic recovery and to me when we're still barring a trillion dollars to run our federal government that is just inefficiency and really my opinion stupidity and it's fine\nSays Americans here we print the world's money foreign central banks they hold US dollars they hold treasuries to back up their own currencies why\nBecause most international transactions they do through the dollar the problem though is when fiscal us\nA solvency when we're running these huge deficits that increases risk to bondholders\nAs deficits keeps or we can expect investors to demand higher and higher interest rates on treasuries think about it they're going to want to earn more if they're going to hold us\nThat during the next door session we could wells for huge tax increases in order to fund our current spending\nSo the problem that I see right now is not a ... a a government that doesn't have enough revenues come in coming in we have a problem with the government than spending too much\nUnfortunately we are having to look at some of these federal outlays and make tough decisions but it seems like Republicans Democrats don't want to make these tough decisions and here's the problem you as investors unfortunately we as investors are left holding the bag\nBecause right now with the twenty trillion dollar debt national that close to one trillion dollars in deficits if we go through any type of recession and incomes drop GDP drops we are we going to have the money to continue to fund\nWhat our government is spending without borrowing massive amounts of debt and we're already doing that and so this is why\nYou know I'm a big believer in having puts inside your portfolio the reason I like puts in a portfolios because a put can allow you to help protect\nA portion of your portfolio if the markets go down [noise]\nSo would have put option does put option if you buy a put option a put option makes money when the markets go down\nSo what we've done in our portfolios is we have added put options into some of our heads portfolios solar walk you through what that looks like it's one of\nThe nice things about ATF today is that with an ATF you can own\nThe entire stock market or what we say the U.S and the five hundred the large cap index you can own the entire large kept indexed by just owning an ATF\nTo the ATF that we use for the U.S and people have hunters going to be an ATF called S. P. Y. so S P wise and each year that is the entire S. and P. five hundred so typically what we'll do in our heads portfolios is about Ninety five percent of the portfolio we will own the U.S and the five hundred the ATF\nBut with the remaining five percent we will buy puts inside of the portfolio\nNow we're typically buying or put somewhere between eight to ten percent below where the market is trading okay so what that means is that put is going to start to offset the loss in the portfolio for selling it ten percent what's called out of the money\nThat put will begin to protect the portfolio once the market begins to drop below that ten percent\nOkay so I had someone the other day say hey you know there's zero to ... percent since there's no protection for that that's almost like a duck to pull in a way okay it's a good analogy a way to think of it so if the market drops five percent is there any protection there you know the market job six percent is there any protection there are no\nJobs eight percent of the protection there no but if the market starts to drop more than ten\nPercent that is where we just did the protection starts to kick in why because we had that put option there in the portfolio\nAnd so if the market jobs forty percent fifty percent sixty percent guess what that is there to lock in and protect the portfolio from law\nAnd so this is why when we look at this strategy\nWe look at it and say okay if there's a way for us to be able to still get a good return so are we going to be are we going to beat the market no last year for example the essence he did a little over twenty percent well our head shredded you did about Fifteen point three per se\nBut the difference is how much resisted we take to get that Fifteen Percent our downside was protected and about at ten percent level so God Forbid if we had a recession or if the markets takes a big correction\nAnd so what we do is we add Hedges to our portfolio and so we're we have a ... or hedge equity portfolio\nThe goal of the hedge equity port voice to get about Seventy to eighty percent of the upside of the market but help protect our downside when the markets go down so I'll give an example\nOn on average or going to set our heads up about ... percent out of the money\nWould that means is we're going to start the protection is going to kick him around the market being down around ten percent\nSo if the market jobs four percent are we trying to protect against that no the market jobs at five percent are we trying to protect against that no market job six percent or were trying to protect against that know where we are trying to protect against\nIs a drop of more than about ten percent and the one year\nAnd why is that because we can recover from a ten percent drop that recovery time could be less than a year\nBut when you take a forty percent drop fifty percent drop sixty percent drop God Forbid that can take years to recover six seven\nEight years to recover from a major type of recession type law so this is why right now to me it's important\nThat we had Hedges inside the portfolio the Hedges are there to help ... tacked portfolios from major market decline\nWith David you know I Want to make sure I don't lose any money well that is tough to do in the stock market if you're gonna be in the stock market you're going to have to accept some loss but as we get closer to retirement or in retirement\nThe losses that significantly hurt the portfolio or when we get the major twenty twenty five thirty forty percent losses to the portfolio and guess what\nI was looking at our church here for average recessions ready for this the average recession\nLasted about a year and a half if we look from Nineteen twenty seven I'm Sorry Nineteen twenty six to two thousand Seventeen the average bear market recession asked lasted about one and a half years with an average\nCumulative laws ready for\nThis of forty one percent\nOf what to put that into context okay\nLet's just say you the million dollar portfolio the average loss during a bear market has been around forty one percent\nSo a million dollars on average will lose four hundred thousand dollars based on the last bear market drops four hundred thousand dollars\nCan you imagine if you've built up your retirement for full you get to a million dollars you hit the magic number that you've been waiting for\nAnd then God Forbid we get into a recession you're first four or five years of retirement and you lose four hundred thousand dollars\nWhat do you do let's just say you've got up to\nA million dollars in your portfolio we had a couple of our office early this week they had been saving they are they hit the two million dollar mark and their portfolio there were so happy there were so proud of asking the same question if we have another recession and the next five years\n\nOr are you comfortable taking a forty percent drop on your investments an eight hundred thousand dollar drop\nThey listen to the absolute not\nAnd this is why I don't want to some morbid here but you just you have to prepare your portfolios your retirement proposed for the worst case scenario why is that because in retirement there are no do over\nThere or not\nThis is why it's important to have a plan in place and what a proper financial plan does is going to show you where are your income is coming from\nHow much risk is in your portfolio what are the things that you need to do now to make sure that you can retire with out having this fear that if the market takes a big\nDraw you can lose a lot of principle [noise]\nSo I Want to give up the offer for a morning store analysis where more than ... ... it's an index break down your portfolio it shows you where the weaknesses are it shows you God Forbid we have another year like a way where the market dropped almost forty percent\nHow your current portfolio were perform\nIt's a thousand dollar value but we'll wave that thousand dollars for the cause of the more than two hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio you call the next ten minutes to take advantage of the world for eight nine zero five six zero six number to call for all for\nEight nine zero five six zero six it's a thousand dollar value but we'll waive it again where the two hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio\nYou call the next ten minutes for all for eight nine zero\nFive six year old six that's four zero for eight nine zero five six zero six\nYou know so I said this really on the show I said look a statement that you get in the mail every month that is not a retirement plan knowing how much you made or loss from one month and the next that doesn't tell you where you are retirement income is coming from\nDoesn't tell you what you need to know\nTo make sure you can retire successfully so give us a call for for eight nine zero five six zero six I'm David Nicholas you're listening to protecting retirement I have a wonderful week we'll see you

six seven\nNo let me tell you why [noise]\nI'm really upset about the way to CNN handles\nLiterally opening that package yesterday after they X rayed and saw that there might have been some kind of hazardous device inside you\nKnow there's all this speculation though there was no ... there was no this\nLet me just tell you something if you put any kind of energetic material a powder of anything else inside of a close to like a pipe bomb\nYou find somebody that you call the bomb squad you handle it yourself I I I had a case that uh we had five litter bonds let me let me tell you has his letter bomb was made up it was it was post march Alexandria, Egypt and um\nThey got it they didn't know what they just use one of those little razor blades at one right across the top of the envelope you know to open up the envelope well what they didn't realize that there was a bomb inside of that envelope it was a little sick it was um it was a musical greeting card\nEverybody's seen a musical greeting card you open it up and plays music what would they didn't realize is there was a strip of seven techs plastic explosive with a flattened blasting cap\nUp against the sim techs and the leg wires from the blasting cap went out and went to a Polaroid pull a pole battery you remember the old Polaroid cameras you would you you take a picture and it would be you and you come out well the you know what ten pictures and then you take that out and you throw it away\nWhich is what people didn't realize you're that was actually the battery and it was batteries have a shelf life of somewhere between possibly eight and ten years and it's enough to kick off or cap\nSo they take an ad in any way they used a piece of monitor filament blind to run up across the top of the envelope and thank God when they opened did\nThey use the razor blade and it cut right through it otherwise but had to pull that what a portrait little piece of chip board out and what a completed the electrical circuits and the bomb would have gone off\nI Hope these idiots at Time Warner center they if they they realize they probably did need probably didn't realize it\nBecause even with the X ray there's a possibility that little monitor filament line may not have shown up in the X ray\nGod\nThe bottom line is they are ... idiots and I'm going to tell you in a little while how to recognize a suspicious package\nBecause hey man that after you had yesterday you said you you knew you were getting an absentee\nIs that it is that the U.S postal service app that tells us what you're getting yeah really cold\nUm\nDid you do you ask PS mobile and I also get an email every morning that tells me what's being delivered to my house when I go into the athletes basically that a little bit more information than on the email\nI turn it down there it is that the informed on delivery yeah you have to sign in you have to sign up for that yeah I Know but there's a precedent formed delivery I don't know how you sign up for a\n... you have to wait for the thing the pop up that says you know are starting to count it um it takes them a couple of minutes there's a lot of\nI guess it uses a lot of data oh especially in the office if if you try to use the why fight doesn't work very well on it it sucks it sucks in here um huh but it's it's it's really cool out\nWow and I know when my male gets delivered 'cause they they have to scan it therefore they put it in your mailbox yeah so I get a get another email saying the following things have been deliver\nGotcha gotcha and you know there was all just speculation oh well these didn't go through because there was no cancellation on stamps you know we discuss it at great length yesterday well\nThe the um they did go through the postal service and um the tracking information and the scan is all apparently on the other side of the envelope so\nBut that rumored to rest with all of the so called experts as well go back out to the phone he uh Chris thanks very you know and what's up\n[noise] um well do you think a journalist would have the addresses to all these so called people I mean how does somebody get the address is everybody\nLike that well it sure yeah you have any government no the ... yeah\nIt's well it's it's pretty easy to find out what the address is arming or with the Obamas private home you could you know where that but it was lifted when they bought the plays you can go by there and uh and and look the address up it's not it's not hard to find that you know Maxine Waters that was sent to a her a\nMan why ... why they've been they've been busy and so have the uh the FBI speculation Bob jak they've been extremely busy and they've added um\nI Know I\nFormer squad mandated they're really busy I got joint terrorism task force all the J.

seven different is that it's getting make up their mind and throw them all to get\nDown to them that are that are some of them that don't that um yeah ...\nAnd that that will scares me a few days later he got\nAll that garbage can me at least ... blocks\nNot well let me say let me tell you I've seen I've seen some\nA pipe bombs package bombs letter bombs that didn't look like much but uh\nI mean if you if you if you come right down to a job the devices that were used during the um Boston bombing when it comes right down to it and they weren't much either but they did they did a lot of damage they did a lot of damage no pressure cooker\nWell yeah but you're cooking ah but yeah that ... you're talking about for the post office at one that's out when he was able to get the a postal employee fired because he lost that package with those uh special control the drugs that she would get\nA there you go so\nWe got the ills saying it's going to be delivered and they get their ...

a lower third surgeon judge devise\nAre you kidding me so they say Trump's targeted it sounds like CNN is saying that President Trump is orchestrating descending of these are these packages that is the most responsible journalism or if you want to call a journalism that I've ever seen in my entire life\nGod Almighty when will they stop when will you stop CNN\nGod oh my [noise] that that that is just unbelievable to me stick to the facts one\nYep yep yep hey\nTechnical difficulty believes Dan by yeah go ahead\n\nYeah it's not far enough anyway well we'll get that ...\nThing for how he me this

they'll say oh you guys over dramatizing here's what no yes\nYeah I have spent so many years\nGoing around looking at the remains of people who die or an explosives like this in situations like that I've seen it all over\nThe world I think that one less impressive and this actually with more and you never know potential was always there if somebody is willing to try to do something that's why they're chasing so hard to find out who this one and this was someone who wanted us to know\nI can be kept in touch and wants to an active duty ... if I Want to I\nWill will will will will\n... this

the six seven [noise]\nNow my books on the new one of six seven\nNow let me tell you why [noise]\nI'm really upset about the way CNN handles\nLiterally hoping that package yesterday after they X rayed and saw that there might have been some kind of has this device inside\nYou know there's all this speculation though there was no initiated or there was no this\nLet me just tell you something\nIf you put any kind of energetic material a powder of anything else inside of a close to like a pipe bomb and you find somebody that you call the bomb squad you handle it yourself\nI I I had a case that uh we had\nFive letter bombs let me let me tell you has his letter bomb was made up\nIt was it was post march Alexandria, Egypt\nAnd um when it got it they didn't know what they just use one of those little razor blades one right across the top of the envelope to open up the envelope what they didn't realize that there was a bomb inside of that envelope it was a little sick\nIt was um it was a musical greeting card\nEverybody's seen a musical greeting card you open it up and the plays music what would they didn't realize is there was a strip of some techs plastic explosive with a flattened blasting\nCap up against the sim techs and\nThe leg wires from the blasting cap went out and went to a Polaroid pull a pole battery you remember the old Polaroid cameras you would you'd you'd take a picture and it will give you you and you come out well the you know what ten pictures and then you take that out and you throw it away\nWhich is what people didn't realize you're that was actually the battery and those batteries have a shelf life of somewhere between possibly eight and ten years and it's enough to kick off or cap\nSo they take an ad in any way they used a piece of monitor filament blind to run up across the top of the envelope and thank God when they opened did\nThey use the razor blade and it cut right through it otherwise if I had to pull that what a portrait little piece of chip board out there what a completed the electrical circuits and bomb would have gone off\nSo I Hope these idiots at Time Warner center they if they they realize they probably did need probably didn't realize because even with the X rays there's a possibility that little monitor filament line may not have shown up in the X ray\nGod\nBottom line is they are ... idiots and I'm going to tell you\nOh how to recognize a suspicious package because hey man that ... you had\nYesterday you said you you knew you were getting an absentee\nIs that it is that the U.S postal service app that tells us what you're getting yeah really\nCold um did you do you ask PS mobile and I also get an email every morning that tells me what's being delivered to my house when I go into the athletes basically that a little bit more information than on the email\nI turn it down there it is that the informed on delivery yeah you have to sign and you have to sign up for that yeah I Know but the president form delivery I don't know how you sign up for a ... you have to wait for the thing the pop up\nThat says you know are starting to count it um it takes just a couple of minutes there's a lot of I guess it uses a lot of data especially in the office if if you try to use the why fight doesn't work very well on it it sucks it sucks in here I'm tough but it's it's it's really cool out\nWow and I know when my male gets delivered 'cause they may have to scan it therefore they put it in your mailbox yeah so I get I get another email saying the following things have been deliver\nGotcha gotcha and you know there was all just speculation oh well these didn't go through because there was no cancellation on stamps you know we discussed at a great lengths yesterday well the\nThe um they did go through the postal service and um the the tracking information in the skin is all apparently on the other side of the envelope so\nPut that rumored to rest with all of the so called experts as well you know back to the phone he uh Chris wrote on what's up\n[noise] um well do you think a journalist would have they address to all these so called people I mean how how does somebody get the address as everybody\nLike that well it sure yeah yeah ... ... ... you know the ... yeah it's\nWell it's\nIt's pretty easy to find out what the address is arming or with the Obamas private home\nYou could you know where that but it was lifted when they bought the plays you can go by there and uh and and look the address up it's not it's not hard to find that you know Maxine Waters that was sent to a her a\nOffice on Capitol Hill so that you know that that's that's pretty easy to find out or the Clintons in ah you know up\nIn New York in Westchester County uh that's all so easy to find a yeah it's not it's not hard to find out where these were\nUm whereas these officers were and you know they sent the one to Eric Holder wherever they sent that it was\nNot the right address soldiers return to sender so that's why are they got that back at that Debbie Wasserman Schultz dissolve is because that was the return address on all of the uh on the outside of the envelope are all the packages\nThat you know right there you know so so the cancellation on the stamps or on the back\nYeah there's um there's apparently some tracking and it's not your your typical cancellation but it it it's on the package them up my source\nYou if you send something that's over Thirteen Allen says it can't just have stamps on it it has to go to the counter you actually physically have to present it to a postal worker and they ask you these questions like does it contains anything liquid hazardous fragile Christ and then they put a separate\nThey found one at Robert De Niro does\nA studios down in Tribeca in Manhattan and wipe the bomb squad they've been they've been busy and so have the uh the FBI speculation Bob jak they've been extremely busy and they've added\nA or do I\nMy former squad mandated they're really busy I got joint terrorism task force all the J. D. D. S.\nAround the around the country are really busy right now and uh I I I like\nThe NYPD also has a NYPD shield\nThat is a a a joint effort between a different businesses and companies and are within city New York\nAnd it's all information sharing and they were sending things out yesterday as well so Hector\n[laughter] he says hey go your jets deputy I'll be [laughter] have you back there I got your deputy ready listen here Barney it's right\nYeah okay let me get a job they ruined or what's up\nI don't know who built the bombs but it ... it looks like they looked at about seven different is that you could make up their mind and throw them all to get\nDown to them that don't that are on them that on that um yeah ...\nAnd that that will scares me a few days later he got\nAll that garbage can me at least ... blocks\nAnd that's well let me see let me tell you I've seen I've seen some a\nPipe bombs package bombs letter bombs it didn't look like much\nBut uh I mean if you if you if you come right down to a job the devices that were used during the um Boston bombing when it comes right down to it and they weren't much either but they did they did a lot of damage they did a lot of damage in a pressure cooker\nWow yeah you're cooking ah but yeah that ... you're talking about for the post office at one that's out when he was able to get the a postal employee fire 'cause they lost that package with those uh special control the drugs that she would get\nAh there you go\nSo we got the ills saying it's going to be delivered and they get their ... whatever you call the eight or they get on that\n[laughter] that oh the headline on I'm seeing it right now man hunt for serial bomber going after Trump's\nTargets\nWhat that is totally thank you Joe I'm now ... that is totally totally responsible journalism right there you don't\nWorry is Dixie which sluggish look see\nSay manhunt for serial bomber going after Trump's targets\nThat that is to see in a lower third\nSurgeon judge divides\nAre you kidding me so they say Trump's targeted it sounds like CNN is saying that President Trump is orchestrating descending of these are these packages that is the most responsible journalism or if you want to call a journalism that I've ever seen in my entire life\nGod Almighty when will they stop when will you stop CNN God all my [noise]\nThat that that is just unbelievable to me\nStick to the facts\nOne yep yep yep hey\nTechnical difficulty pleased and by yeah go ahead\n\nYeah it's not far enough anyway well we'll get that for things for how he leaves this time saying the words that come out of\nOur kids would find it was a failure and you know some people will watch this today nobody was hurt I called it a good game right because nobody got hurt thank God and they'll say oh you guys over dramatizing here's what no yes\nJohn and I have spent so many years\nGoing around looking at the remains of people who die or an explosives like this in situations like that I've seen it all over\nThe world I think that one less impressive than this nice to meet with more and you never know potential was always there if somebody is willing to try to do something that's why they're chasing so hard to find out who this was an mess with someone who wanted us to know\nI can reach out and touch you wants to yeah and I can be wildly if I Want to I\nWill will will will will hope\n... this there was another there was another thing that he another diatribe I did not do that there's no one will find it but\nHe he I mean he goes on place basically blaming everything on President Trump\nTotally response totally irresponsible was ridiculous ridiculous\nAnd and I you know in the talking heads and you know he says oh you're a little less impressive or more impressive than is yeah well why don't we why don't we uh what are we to say hey a a bomb maker you suck\n[laughter] remember remember what\nHappened when a deep experts in talking heads during the\nUnabomber case were saying well you know these weren't very sophisticated ...\nKnow what happened\nThen Ted Kaczynski crank it up a notch remembered that\nYes so go ahead and poke go ahead and poke the bear go ahead go ahead yeah go ahead and poke the bear\nDon't being idiot that's what that's what\nPeople that they are and just and just say\nThat the serial bomber going after Trump's targets\n\nThat is that is that is one of the most irresponsible things I I think I've did they they say a lot of stupid um start\nOff yeah it's not built back up yet [laughter] did he say that the\nThe only reason they were going after whoever this was so intently was to\nAdvance the narrative how about a sea keep people safe mode Ron\nGod unbelievable\nHow do you look you sell it mirrors you in such stupidity stupid you know if you joined the program [noise]\nHey lied to things about pro ball\nHe is alive I told you he was alive [laughter]\nFirst are you sending a ball that time it was somebody on the order lying on the postal service just to get that dead and dying\n[laughter] yeah [laughter]\nWell that's how they and that's to say if there was a actually a timer\nThat was involved with this that's to say there was a timer but you know there's a lot of speculation you know a lot of speculation\nOkay I made all the chaos with these bombs will just be a good time to send a package deal with the image show to blow up Danny de Los ...
