time jobs and so we can't commit one hundred percent to this but uh but it's just getting out there and talking to people and\nYou know put it on our website ... you know that they can donate and see what happens\nSonia really start ramping up for the Christmas season\nAnd we are already ramped up already right we are already read that already already go yeah so we we had the warehouse um it's stocked with toys now you know were lining up to the agencies yeah we're yeah we're ready to roll come October first\nAnd when the boxer started going out like you could see boxes everywhere for those who\nYou can go on line people can go on line now and request them\nPeople have already requested him and that's probably another you know a few weeks out but but now it'll start then the next month for sure\nAnd once again or anybody listening if you have anything anything you can donate sponsor a money website once again Atlanta twice we're taught that work and that's where you go to find how you can do that how you can volunteer just seems like this they don't go off without volunteers\nNo it really doesn't run without volunteers a you know we need\nThat um\nThat executive branch to kind of run things and you know uh and kind of coordinate the volunteers and uh the receiving of the toys and things like that so yeah we carry on with our volunteers for\nSure so last year we had over four thousand volunteers were thousand\nFour thousand volunteers and this is people from um high up to ... for media coordinator to driving the truck\nIs this for this I mean this includes I mean the board is only made up about Fifteen people so that so the board is very small that were out on tears but\nYou know to go into the warehouse to drive in the trucks to picking up till ways to you know if it's all done on a voluntary basis so yeah so it's like um four thousand dollars\nA share your John ... the head of all this and and the fact that you know you're organizing and so what are what are other people like that are in this room right now what are they doing right now\nOh my goodness um they they probably aren't the warehouse there's they're setting the box up there still sorting the toys out from last year to get ready um they're coordinating events I mean that that's one of the huge thinks that that\nHelps drive you know helps to express that we have anywhere between three and six hundred events every year\nAnd and it's all done by individuals is not coordinated by the wayside ... it's done by people you know ... having kids birthday parties and they instead of getting totally if they wanted they wanted them to toys for thoughts or it's golf tournaments\nFrisbee golf you can do that ultimate Frisbee\nAnd it was so there's there's an event next I think it's either this weekend in Mexican innocence Stockbridge and it's the rise you know money and and toys for toys for not um you said so it's it's it's a different things on different levels I mean we have people who will donate food\nTo the volunteers are working in the warehouse we have people who will donate you know or volunteer to go pick up toys they'll they'll\n[noise] um I'm trying to think anything you can think of it it's it's all donated all volunteered um drive trucks drive forklifts sort toys bag delays drop off boxes ... anything you name it it's all driven by volunteers\nSo ... so you're not just taken toys on a day to day basis you also have really cool events so would have been some really good successful events that are for ...\nYou know one one of my favorite events is is actually has to buy the Atlanta Falcons\nAnd um I don't really know that it has a title or if it has a name but this'll be the third year that they've done it and what they do is they bring in children from under privileged families\nAnd they have a whole event with him at actually at ... stadium which is really kind of cool um and so what they do is they they get a wish list of as the children and it's usually I don't know I'm going to say like forty five fifty kids um we supply the ... um the wives of the falcons rap the toys\nAnd they put the name of each child on a lock her in the in the locker room and the kids get to go in and they get to find their locker and they get to to get their their toys and one one year it was just so heartbreaking because I'm One ruble he must spend five or six and he open up because\nI get to keep these aren't they own mind he says I've never had a Christmas\nYou know and and you that just breaks your heart and and you asked why we do it that's why we do it\nAnd that once again as a huge reason toys retards needs money they need sponsors there it's not like you're cheaper than any of the money you get all the money's going back to giving kids a Christmas that they otherwise wouldn't have and I share with you many times ... a share that I was extremely privileged growing up in a you know never wanted for anything\nA wealthy family and but every time we were given something we were made sure of our parents were they always reminded us you remember that when we give you this you better be grateful because you know their kids would would never get kind of stuff and I'm taking that\nInto my adult life now and that's why I Love doing this and getting to talk to all these nonprofits and all these people that are doing such amazing things because you're out there giving up your time uh and do doing with a lot of stress on the same time to make sure kids have a good Christmas\nIt's you know it's absolutely worth well I mean you know and I know in my heart of hearts that they can replace me tomorrow\nBut I don't think so yeah well thank you but but I you know I Do what I can and and I hope everyone else says what they can you know one of the biggest things that I Am courage people to do is like you know that Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving when everybody's out shopping you just grab another Barbier grab another football or whatever it is you know and start that process now\nAnd that again that again or most kids today one ... they want the newest iPhone they want these crazy gadgets these kids are happy like you said you know football ... be a new T shirt\nYou know ... and that just blows my mind a happy you can make a kid that you know has never had a Christmas before going back to the falcon story kid looking into a Walker and said I get to keep all of these\nAnd and then it makes me feel awful from my privileged upbringing to where I got what I wanted a more that's why I Love doing this and you know given people a choice were taught a platform to you know say what they need what you know well because they are doing\nYou know and that's and that's a big mission of the the marine reserves I mean is to give a child a toy that that is they are that they can show ownership that they can take pride in that they you know to help them you'll feel confident about themselves and you know not envious of somebody who gets everything I mean 'cause it's like I've got something up my own\nAnd torture ties how some amazing current sponsors\nRight now yes um public's is obviously a big sponsor of ours every year but some that don't always get mentioned quite as much as cutie they are huge sponsor for us\nI'm looking forward to working with him again this year hopefully we can drive more toy drops to their location there's also a group here in Atlanta called um M. A. I. D. A. which is the metro Atlanta auto Dealers Association they're huge supporter as to his friends and I think they have like a hundred and twenty nine dealers\nAnd each dealer is a drop site\nAnd they not only are they a drops out but they also pick up the toys and deliver into the warehouse for us so they do it for us which is huge you know because we don't you know obviously we're we're working with volunteers so anything that we can help you know the or the companies can help us that's huge\nAnd that's an amazing thing about a city like Atlanta we have so many people that are willing to help you know you're looking for a permanent space that you know you don't have to pay for it because like I said going back to the beginning for every ten dollars that torture taught to suspend\nThat's one child that might not have a Christmas ... and we're we're always like you said the goal is always a million every year to reach and it's sad that I always say this is well twenty Eighteen we shouldn't have a society where kids all over the next Christmas is coming from work because they'll know where their next meal is coming from\nOr they don't even know what Christmas is because they've never experienced\nIt never woken up on Christmas morning and ran into a tree and seeing presents under a tree or at a Christmas meal is a family\nMhm and that's it yeah and again you know Atlanta's a great city huge they and I know everyone has a big heart and it's just getting the word out and getting people to understand this is what we may\nOnce again push thoughts needs money they need sponsors and website once again this year\nAt ... dot org\nThat's how you give that's how you record the box it's how you volunteer that's all you become a sponsor a Sherry Carney ... assistant coordinator for toys were taught and dynamic was out of a media coordinator now for tours for toss thank you so much for taking the time coming in speaking with me again thank you so much\nNursing rolling on a radio man what's up to a giver um first of all just one of those who my wife who is listening\nWe both wasn't too but we're we're the good and you're left or all your girls and your crews the really pulled through the day she doesn't enjoy a good lives are just wants a job doing that for her well thank you what did I say this and best wishes you anyway\nThat that was what people have a hard time Grassley in their shocked and you're like I Can't believe that he looks so happy he had all this money et cetera that has nothing to do with what that person is experiencing internally\nAnd so because you can see it\nThen we tend to think well they must not be and obviously that's not the case\nOf like a one of my favorites are hit on about this is in the ground when people look at others in the ground but all of us are driving a car they you know just went on a shopping spree on rodeo drive in LA and uh\nIt's like those are fraying moments I got I got pictures of my Instagram we will you have the greatest life ever you're always concerts ... those are the moments you\nSee that I've had pigs fried or put on the Internet right\nI'm not going to be doing my taxes like everyone else right you know I mean it's just it's just ... what\nPeople see on the Internet they take so much into themselves my why don't I have that why don't I have their lives\nAnd it's it's taken the concept of I used to say like when people would date or first meet someone that you bring for your ... your representative so is the person that you want others to see you as they may not be who you really are\nSo as you get to know more about people you get past the representative that they bring forward Instagram is just in ... exaggerated form\nOf the same thing I get to pick and choose the moments that I Want to share with you I Do it I Want us there and I will pick and choose my best moments my best angles [laughter]\nAll those things because that is the image I Want to be put out I don't necessarily want to share on a day that I'm not at my desk I'm not feeling well I've had days where I Do it regularly my job is complex I take a mental health day when I Need it\nI don't allow myself to get to a point where I'm so overwhelmed and I'm so stressed that now I'm physically impact impacted I Will take those days and I encourage people to do that\nAnd that's another thing I I remember the first time I saw someone tell your mental health day\nThey were gone for ... you don't need a mental health the European barred yeah and um I don't I think I don't want it to be home to a point where people start to abuse mental health day right artist won a day off so I'm gonna take a mental health day\nI don't want it to ever be abused and I personally never taken one who I'm not because I don't I don't believe it or it's just I just I just had my way of coping when I when I get off work sometimes but\nAh the stigma that comes along with that especially a man of masculine man saying hey you almost like a mental health day as a manly and society and I think that is just ... ...\nI agree and you know what's happening is people are taking them that is calling them something else I don't feel well today I'm sick today I'm just not feeling myself today and so which you can have physical I'm\nI'm a a physical impact because of your mental health state so depression can lead to physical and I'm just using depression\nAs a wide obviously assortment of mental health disorders we could talk about what their presence with his prevail is I think is relevant for this um\nHas physical you can have physical pain associated with your depression you could have digestive issues associated with your depression so the person may not even realize this is really\nBecause I Am stressed or I make at a level of depression or anxiety whatever it may be but they can see the physical impact so I think people do it they just don't say it's a mental health day they just say it's a sick day\nAnd world thing going back to suicide prevention is every time someone commits suicide I I Know that\nSome people will like you know you you see there was a good person and then they commit suicide or there that's bad or a bad person on this is one of those wrong with it and people instead of saying what caused him to do that or they gave up on life you know there's an easy way out who\nUm [noise] ah that\nThat bothers me it it bothers me as well and I've had the opportunity to speak to people many people who have attempted suicide and we're not successful and are\nThese are not people that are weak people um these are not people that are um are scared or trying to take an easy way out they are dealing with some very significant issues and for\nThem in that moment they see no other way and so when you talk to survivors and you talk to people who've been in that space I think you start to feel differently about that\nI don't care who you are I don't care how successful you are how um whatever your life your every single person at some point in their life has had a moment no really thought they were going to know I'm going to kill myself but I Wonder if they were in such a bad mental health state\nAnd wondering what does that would be like right right I was having everybody I'm Sorry I agree\nI I don't disagree at the same way that so many people would ever be afraid to say it would be afraid to say but is it a shame because everyone doesn't matter how rich you are everyone has a bad day sometimes absolutely ruin as a day where they're just like this is not working you know I just can't take this anymore\nIt does not discriminate it doesn't matter what race you are it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter you're socio economic status it doesn't matter what country you're from it doesn't matter what culture you're in North south it does not matter it doesn't discriminate it's an equal opportunity\nIs um type of thing so if people don't take anything else on the conversation that we're having today is that\nUm this can happen to anyone this is a everyone issue everyone should be concerned everyone should have awareness and everyone should become more informed and more educated about mental health and how it impacts everyone\nWhen we really want to do Monica is trying to get away from the stigma that some we you know so I was very important is you know the the negativity like you said earlier in the interview no one's going to laugh at a cancer patient\nOr no one's going to live with someone that has a brain tumor store for someone that has mental health problems\nExactly um I agree a hundred percent is no laughing matter and we've seen what happens when\nUnderlining mental health issues don't get addressed um people may say oh well this person committed suicide and they don't have a history of mental health that doesn't mean just because that person never was diagnosed as having a mental\nIllness that they did not have mental health issues I'm obviously there's a level of at a minimum depression that exists for someone who feels so I'm distraught that they have come to the decision\nThat's the only way out for a situation that is in many many many circumstances if not all temporary\nOr situation that is temporary to make such a permanent decision so recall is that they have a history of a document it mental health issue their mental health obviously a compromise and so this is a person problem people problem and it does not discriminate and I just can't get that point across enough\nAnd for more information or working people go\nSo I think you we have in our state um one of the one stays in the country to have a twenty four seven crisis and access wind that anyone in the state can call 'em that is the Georgia crisis and access line\nThe number one eight hundred seven one five for two to five\nMonica Johnson director of division of behavioral health for the Georgia department of behavioral health and developmental disabilities thank you so much for the time today will definitely have you back on a this is such an important issue and I look forward to talking about a more\nDays every animal ...\nEverybody's kids ate animal crack even you probably\nDid Hackman he is still on I Love him right now I remember getting a little box with the little white spring and opens it up because I had that kind of watch the paper on the inside you open it up and I love this well\nPeter they've pressured Nabisco Sharif\nDo the boxes remember the boxes would have four little animals on the front yet a it looked like there were like little cage had little line\nYou know the it looked like an old circus train the\nAuthor of out of the cages now\nOn the ... you know I'm I I'm not kidding\nThe new talk one of those six seven months later comes to talk chances are they'll never be an emergency ever again but just in case let's talk about a plant or who is going to grab to go back\nGo magnate is a bag redoing I've found that it's still the things we really were really needing in an emergency definitely\nWant to have to worry about it that you know this is great I Am so glad that we don't have a plan\nWinning is not an emergency plan to make sure your kids know what to do during an emergency political where to me what to pack\nVisit ready ... information wrong to you by the money out of town [noise]\nWhen I was I get the um the costs on so and that's where I make my things in a blanket with I find when everybody or fixing them like if you have such a recipe\nLike yeah let me give you a receipt of how I Do serious I put him\nWhile\nWe'll see it at the end is the ... happen to America and I did this by saying we hear [noise]\nA point and so forth when you get to do when you get about three points on your driver's license it gets really serious and I am told that insurance companies are taking these uh citations very very seriously they\nAre wanting their customers about being cited for a violation of this law they saw this will offer a lot of reasons one because Georgia had had the highest increase in automobile rights and a lot of that was due to\nA distraction and so a lot of a lot of companies are saying okay you've gotten one you need to be careful you know a we're taking this very seriously uh they're not necessarily the castle but the but you could make your rates go up\nOr it's amazing the amount of people that I've talked to that thing oh you know government or you know police just trying to be tougher on us this is an amazing thing that's going to reduce the amount of accidents we have in\nGeorgia you know when we were already down now eleven percent for the year that's great news for your job that makes your child\nOh absolutely you know we're a hundred and a fourteen people there are a hundred and fourteen people who are alive today\nUh that that that\nIf this was last year they they ... they might have been killed in the crash or were trying to make sure people understand this is\n... first of all it is serious business when you're driving a car you've got two tons of steel and a lot of horse power under the hood and handled properly it's a great thing it's a it's something that gets you from point a to point and in a city like Atlanta where we're working on our\nAh our a rapid transit and so forth are are expansion a martyr and all of that but\nUntil that happens it's a city that requires a lot of driving and if you want to go from point a to point in the city and we want you to get there safely that's all we're trying to do you know and let me see if it's about raising revenue or let me assure you that that's not what it's about\nUm and we're trying to make sure people have properly\nThe one way we could enforce texting is to get the the phone out of the hands of the driver\nA ... you can also you you were able to adjust your a navigation and this sort of thing but if electronic communications you can send and receive for example\nIf you have the ability on your phone to sin verbal you could say I want to send jak send a text messaging and what do you want to say to Jackson and you dictate it um\nYou know into the the Bluetooth device and you know you can still do that you can have it read your lashed\nTakes misused too you know most of the the modern phones will read your last four or five of 'em you read me my on red text messages and will tell you what what what is being said a and you can respond and long as you're not\nTouching that phone and your hands are on the ... you're you're fine\nIt's uh it's amazing because what they're growing technologies you ought to just creates more destruction and when you're on a road in rush hour traffic on Seventy five or to eighty five and you got your phone your hand you're putting yourself in every other car rounds you at risk\nActually you know if you're going sixty miles an hour and you have a phone in your hand your eyes are on the phone\nIn five seconds you go to the length of a football field and I would not think about navigating a football field with my eyes closed but if your eyes are on that phone and you're not looking in the road that's exactly what you're doing\nOr if you're going sixty miles an hour down a highway and then a car or on a road someone stopped in front of you and you don't see and you look up a from your phone with forty feet left not much going to be done\nYou know we we've had and the one thing we have seen unfortunately is a lot of crashes where people would run into the back of a car and the brakes were never applied sometimes going forty fifty miles an hour and sometimes it results in significant injury to the person\nFront you don't have to be going very fast to do a damage to your self or others\nYou know and and I will tell you or the other thing that the insurance companies tell me is is you know the the\n... the damage to the vehicles is much worse uh I I was on my way up here and I saw somebody rear end another\nAnd then I Would dare say that car probably total just by looking at what I saw there and uh it is you know\nIt is expensive and uh you know that there's not many two or three hundred dollar repairs on on body work you know uh when you have a car it could cost you five six seven thousand dollars a year like significant a you damage on the front or rear\nAnd real quick as we always say uh living in a place like Atlanta you go out you have fun you got to you as you're always say every time as soon as that second drink touches your lips thinking about how you're going to get home\nYou ... ... by then you've almost waited too long do we want we want you to we want you to think about it you know everybody when they go out and they think about where they're going they think about what they're gonna wear and\nUh maybe some folks how they're going to style the hair and whether they're going to you know how long we've got to be going to\nThink about how you got to get home and they're too many safe Raj the ride services and uh we were getting such great cooperation from people like lifting Hooper and a ... even the traditional taxi cabs they're not that much difference in the cost of a taxi cab lot folks ...\nHad an aversion to it for some reason or another but um ... you know they do and are designated driver and you know\nUh there's some places a designated driver and they'll make sure he has a a coke or something like that a a you know in some some snacks throughout the night um\nDon't don't beat up somebody because they're being the designated driver you ought to be thanking them because they may be saving your life\nOr our stuff to to watch out for its important stuff to always talk about that's why we always have you on and Harris black director of the governor's office of highway safety thank you so much as always for coming back on\nGreat to be with you know you do in

[laughter] do you play or what but I I have had\nSituations where I've had to tell me look I don't well in that way but I don't to and before we make it a bigger situation when we got to stop because I've had\nSome situation was I got really clarify because because for me but in the middle zone where you know if I felt like OK okay who you are if I feel uncomfortable with men that's\nWhat I'm saying I I was uncomfortable in that situation will do so should I mean now I'm I'm fine or whatever when there are situations where you don't have proof like what\nThe lady was yeah how are you going to say I'm going to prove that right and you know it is because now just like the case a couple of weeks ago it was kinda like\nMy word verse against your right and I can't prove you know will he touched me wherever it is I can you can you prove that you didn't open up a book you know somebody walked out of this role and looked at this book and that's it and they ask you before opening how ... how do I proved that didn't do that right now\nBut I Believe it would hurt the reason why I felt so passionate about standing behind her here is because I felt like she could prove it had documentation meaning the people there the ... the the the people saying that his behavior was erratic and he was ... ... what's your word on the bottom line at women's\nMember okay and um boys will be boys or the woman in my mind right again to you that um and the other people she mentioned didn't want to be caught up\nRight they didn't want to maybe where this guy was going to be sure ain't going there right\nSo people just kept kept quiet and that's the problem you know bad things happened with the people remain so right right so and I will say this tape guts to do what she did it takes a lot of guts takes a lot of guts and it takes a lot of people I was talking to a girl that she says she was ... or raped or whatever\nAnd she said to this day she tell nobody first person well into there and see how they say he is and it happens Thirty years ago and I was right then and I told him no body and and I\nWonder if that happened to me to when I was Seventeen years oh here's the thing now and I'm not I I talked about it on a road about it in my book um from time to get a fabulous no I didn't actually reading a book I'm writing about it and my new book\nIt's not that deep but I if I found out that guy was going to be a Supreme Court justice\nAnd if you have someone you trust an absolutely I don't shut the door to communication with that person but sometimes I'll hear the advice it's being given and I'm like you need to shut the door\n[laughter]\nYes and you know I had a call not too long ago where someone call them and then we didn't handled the original divorce but they were calling about I'm alimony modification and I said well I talked to two of my neighbors and they said they got lifetime alimony well I only got twelve years I think something went wrong in my case and so\nIs this person was calling from Florida and there but they're divorce was here in Georgia so I asked him now did your neighbors did they happened to get divorced in Florida\nWell yes they did as a matter of fact well in Florida there is no such thing as there is lifetime alimony sent a statute and if it was several years ago [noise] um so many you know after so many years there's a ... a marriage there's a presumption of lifetime alimony awards\nNot here in Georgia and so I had to explain that to her so that's\nWhen you start listening to other people's other people's cases they you know may have been they may have been dealing with a different um time where the law you know the last constantly changing so maybe they got a divorce five years ago and the laws change since then or maybe they got a divorce in front of a different judge that thinks a different way or another state\nOr it could just be that there was an agreement between the parties round one party gave\nAway the proverbial farm ... along with the whatever reason I just I wanted to be generous I wanted I out of the issues of feeling guilty maybe they had an affair and they felt really bad\nAnd so they gave away a lot more than maybe they needed to mhm and then someone will come and go well that person got ten thousand dollars a month and their income is acts\nAnd that's similar to my situation it's like yeah but hold on one second to David trial did they actually cause your husband or wife is saying absolutely not to those types of numbers right and\nI don't think you're going to get that from a judge they got it by means of an agreement\nSo that's you want to listen to your lawyers advice over ... vice of third parties specially about what may have happened in their divorce cases\nThere may be some exceptions about that and we can talk about that some other time so that goes into the the next one not listening to your lawyer right and and so putting aside the third party stuff you know a lot of times\nAnd it's completely understandable I'm not saying that the the person who's doing this I'm not saying they were bad person or there are a stupid person I'm not saying that at all when divorces there's not too many type of situations dealing with court\nThat are going to stir up more emotion than a divorce and uh we got a lot of judges have classically said um you know I've seen criminal cases where the criminals come in and you got bad people acting on their best behavior and divorce you have good people acting at their worst\nAnd is the emotions are running high and so what happens is they they hear advice run their lawyer and they're they don't want to hear it because it's not what they you know perhaps they feel like\nThe other side needs to pay maybe there was a adultery involved and they said well that doesn't seem fair how is it that he's not being punished for that or why is that I have to pay all this alimony she should go out and work you know so you have these things and\nAnd when you don't listen to your lawyer and say no I understand that but here's how the judge thinks about this issue and here's how the judge is going to apply your facts\nTo the law and that's why you need to settle\nAnd so some people will just say well I'm not I want to roll the dice I Want to go before the judge in my case is different and you're sitting there and from our standpoint no you're not I tried three or four cases like this in front of the judge very similar facts to yours\nAbout exactly the same but very similar and this is what the judge did and then you go to court and you know unfortunately you get the outcome that you expect and it's not that you\nAnd you know some people like well if that's what you're thinking that's what we're going to get my no let's we're going to fight like heck for you in the courtroom but I'm just telling you\nLook at the way I put it is if you're going to spend time and effort and money\nHiring and attorney to represent you and give you the advice that you need to make good decisions and you need to trust that person if you don't trust that person ... and the advice that that person that that attorneys giving you that it's time for you to find another attorney\nOr it because what happens is if you ignore that advice again you hired the person because they understand the law they understand the you know the application of the facts and your case to the law yeah I understand who the judges and which way a judge potentially leans on any given issue\nNow saying all of this that doesn't mean that you don't question strategy that doesn't mean that you don't work hand in hand with your attorney to talk about the pros and cons of the strengths and weaknesses exact come up with a strategy there are plenty of times where we looked at clients and we said\nYou don't really have much of a shot or the percentage chance of succeeding is very low and our client goes I Need to fight the fight for whatever reason I Need to put this in front of a ... fine done we will fight tooth and nail for you and present the best case possible\nBut we're talking about simply shutting down and not listening mhm when your attorney is giving advice and it could be advice on settlement but it could also just the advice on behavior [noise]\nYeah and so the other thing too I think I'm a steak I've seen some people make as though um they'll not listen to the lawyer they'll call another lawyer\nOr not give the this lawyer all the facts or and it's not that sometimes the clients lie but there are some times when an hour ... sometimes people live but then there's other times that\nThey just say what they think is important and the lawyer says well here's my legal vice based on what you told me and so they switch lawyers they spend a ton of money switching lawyers\nAnd then they get in front of this um you know this new attorney and they the attorney gets the rest of the facts are facts where they get the whole file for their ... and they go oh my gosh you didn't tell me about this oh no you're this is not good so\nUm it's like you said and we're not saying it's that you shouldn't question your lawyer we're not saying that because you should understand why strategies being taken what\nWe're saying is once you that's been fully vetted you really need to listen to your turn hey up next we're going to dig into more common mistakes we see [noise]\n\nMy days every animal\nEverybody's kids ate animal ... even you probably did hey man needs to be a silver of oh I Love them ... remember gets a

people represent by lawyers but people that try to handle the cases themselves so we've um we've gone through what five of them now\nSo number six how about this how 'bout inaccurate information in a domestic relations financial afternoon ...\nMan that is a huge leap common mistake\nIn some people will not take that seriously enough and they won't focused and try to make sure all their numbers are accurate or they'll give it to their lawyer at the very last minute\nBecause they need to file at what the court and a specially here in Georgia in most states have a timer requirement when you're supposed to file this before hearing and so people rushed through it they don't make it a priority [noise] um and then it gets filed and there's something wrong on it\nYeah because you have to understand that as a litigator as a family lawyer\nPart of my job is to ensure that the other party's claims relating to their budget ... meaning the information in a we call it a DARPA in domestic relations financial affidavit DARPA so that the information in the DARPA\nIs accurate and part of my job is to explore\nWhy the information may or may not be as accurate as it should be and if it's not accurate than it calls into question or at least it's my job to call into question the credibility of that witness because if you are willing to put into eight signed\nYou know uh you know document filed with the court and presented as evidence and it's a notarized document mhm if you're willing to put false information into that what other false information or you're going to give this court\nThat's that's the argument that we are eight and even though it could be a simple mistake\nNow there are some judges that kind of blow off the domestic relations financial off the day but there's others that take it very very seriously\nThey um they side to it in their court order their ruling like art I find this is what the the hour we're going to divide things up on I had a case once where I mean it's everything from income and and and expenses but also assets because I've seen\nSomeone listening on financial half a day but I'm a hundred thousand dollars and jewelry well when we went to have the item position of the jury we only were able to itemize twenty five thousand now my client also said would they had over a hundred thousand dollars and jewelry and that he had remembered buying all of it\nUh that was their retire part of their retirement plan I'm not I won't go into what that was a good retirement plan but that was there they were um for whatever reason that's what they were doing\nOkay so she was probably we only had twenty five thousand\nWell I have a financial affidavit where she lives at a hundred and he listed a hundred yeah so it looked very suspicious like she hit suddenly ups gone to about Seventy five thousand dollars and joy\nAnd even if because if we're talking about the actual [noise] excuse me down and getting choked up um [laughter] the actual if I were to shoot we have to shoot [laughter] um\n... even ... I don't need to issues though Tom [laughter] I was looking for is usually got me on I promise I'm not going to cry you know even if the court doesn't take that into account and basically you know take the missing asset and assign you know some value to a party\nThe the the impact on the credibility\nCould be far more damaging because in other words let's say well the twenty five thousand dollars missing even if the court says well it's not there I'm not doing anything about that yeah but now the court doesn't believe you yes that that impact that harm to your credibility in the eyes of the court\nCan have a real impact and can influence the court's decision on a whole bunch of other issues\nAnd here's another thing we're all about settlement we're trying to avoid court if we can but as our as lawyers if we have a ... a day when we look at it and go well this is not accurate I Know that there's um there are things that are not being disclosed here we're now bound to go okay\nAre they hiding things this sounds like they're hiding things with the when there's smoke there's fire and we have an ethical duty to explore their at least tell the our client hey look this doesn't look right we can export ears are avid as we can uh do discovery and everything so what happens is if you start the case off all the bad\nDomestic relations financial ... I mean we're not talking about off by five or ten bucks\nWe're talking about something significant what it can cause the case to do this suddenly get more expensive\nBecause the other side and it could be driven by the ... not the lawyer or the other side somebody says you're hiding money or you're not being honest about everything so we need to do a lot of discoveries oh and also\nVery quickly before we move on to the next one mhm I'm also if you do one and you don't do a good job then you do another one [laughter] and our numbers\nAre different now I don't think that the attorney is going to call into question the accuracy of your ... both of them of because it's like well hold on one second here you said you have nothing you can hear you said you have a hundred thousand dollars or here there was fifty thousand dollars in here it's\nNothing ma'am three weeks between these two draft you know or ... ... it's clearly one is very very very wrong yeah okay so which is correct is that there is money or there's an asset or there is not so you have to spend the time to make sure it's accurate okay\nEnough on that let's go to the next one because I don't want to procrastinate [laughter]\nDon't put it off [laughter] you know so procrastination this is a little bit different than head in the sand so you have people that are they don't have their head nurse and they're very involved in the case\nBut they don't make their divorce a priority and we actually had a whole show on how to make your divorce or priority that I think it was episode or show fifty three if you wanted to go back and listen to it but\nHow to make your divorce or priority you need to understand how to do that because here's what happens you have someone who is active in the case or talking to the lawyer talking about strategy and the lawyer says All right here's what I Need you to do I need you to let's say the issue is\nA there's an assertion that the husband's an alcoholic and he's denying it okay I Need you to go and itemize let's say the ... like I Need to save money okay great well we'll let you itemize all the bank records and every time he made a trip to the liquor store an added up for me I'll do it I'll save money\nPay retainer and hire an attorney mhm it's almost like they feel like I'm done I've I've done all that I Need to do the lawyers gonna do or yeah you do everything in almost like a leave me alone kind of attitude right and then there are people who want to you know just ... you might micro manage and\nThat can interfere with the attorney client relationship Enron it also is something where you're never going to be happy because you you're not trusting the attorney and the uh the attorneys ability to come up with strategy and implement strategy so you have to find a middle ground but the middle ground absolutely should include\nActive participation be proactive don't procrastinate and and be a part of the team because that's the way when we're hired the way that we like to think of it is it truly is Eighteen yes you're on her ears for expertise but we have to now work to gather to accomplish ...\nSo I don't want your lawyer says I Need you to come in to help prepare for court next week and talk about what your testimony is going to be\nDon't ignore what can't you just testify nope you need to be hard it took an active role in that preparation for the hearing and here's another really important thing that I don't want to I mean we have a lot of things that gets you but I just think this is critical\nBecause we've seen these mistakes too\nIf you're a lawyer is not getting back to you if you've taken an active role and I'm not saying you're not micromanaging I'm not saying you've called five times that day for the last five days I'm not ... that's ... maybe a little bit too much but I'm saying if you called three times in a week and you haven't gotten a call back and there was a hearing around the corner\nYou maybe there may be a reason to be concerned because we we've had cases where the um\n[noise] turned I've actually had three cases with a lawyer in the middle of the case was disbarred\nWhich means they have not allowed to practice law and they just kind of disappeared and ah um gosh I actually had a call or two weeks ago where the person wasn't getting called back and I did some research and found out the ... the lawyer was in jail\nHe'd been arrested and so he wasn't getting back to the so you've got to take an active role so there was one case the lawyer was getting notices of court but the he had disappeared in wasn't relying on to the client and so there was a hearing held without our clients notice\nThankfully I got that one overturned because he had been disbarred so that the information should have gone directly ... anyway\nWhen you take an active role that also will join your yeah you're holding your lawyer accountable right so that's the only ... but I wanted to make sure we threw that in the next one are firing off emails or tax when you're angry or tired\nYeah we've we've spent a significant time on that in previous shows but just to repeat\nUm we're all\nTo some degree driven by emotion mhm right we're emotional animals I'm not trying to play the therapist here but it's it's true true All right\nAnd and so I Am just as guilty as everyone else when somebody upsets me or angers me that I Want to sit down at my computer and\nStart [laughter] ... ... ... and I'm like oh no are you there\nBut but we train everyone at the firm and we train ourselves to once we are done tap tap tapping walk away yeah take a deep breath don't put an address into the\nThe the in the sand portion of the ... the yeah the ... the male so that you don't accidentally send it before us\nDon't type in if you're on the phone ghetto type it as a text message yeah type it in the note section most phones have a note session type out your email or text message you want to send but probably shouldn't because words\nCan hurt you yes okay they don't hurt physically but as\nHer dad or as we've said time and time again sort of like the Miranda warnings anything you say can will be used against you in a court of law so if you say something ugly and angry and insulting\nBe prepared for that to get thrown back in your face some point at the appropriate time in front of a court so be careful what you do and what you say\nThat and so avoid it when you're tired because sometimes you say things you you you don't use a filter 'cause you're tired and when you're angry definitely don't\nDo it and if you have the ability we and our from have a second I policy yeah we want people to review those types of communication to make sure that hey you know I maybe two invested here and to you know emotional honesty I sometimes\nYou can have your lawyer look at some of them and and we even had a ... on the show who I mean she's got a class where she goes through and says you know and looks at your text messaging or emails you have to help you write better or messages to your book or other other spouse or ex spouse\nOkay All right so a next one calling your lawyer so many times that use up all your money on phone calls and they after withdrawal\nOkay and we've had to do that if you hate to do it\nBut I've had we've had situations where the client recall or the you know what caused so many times during the day\nThat um it would just chew up there ... the the retainer and then they ran a money we had to withdraw so we I mean we get paid by the hour or so and we have a whole show where the whole show not actual awhile ago wanting to do another one on how to effectively communicate with your lawyer so\nI yeah I was trying to climb very quickly I had a client who left and was with another attorney mhm and complained about the billing and was very upset and I looked at the billing and and there were just hours of phone calls hours of email hours of even in office meetings\nAnd she came in and started to act the same way\nAnd I had to stop and say you know I hold on one second\nI Know you weren't happy about the building over there\nBut you need to start ... and I didn't say this way but it was that I Need to look in America you need to understand that your behavior is resulting in some of these costs you need to understand how to effectively and efficiently communicate with your attorney because if you do that you're going to cut your bill by you know ... percent fifty percent Seventy five percent\nAnd you'd rather have your lawyer prepare your settlement pay for prepare you for mediation rather than being on the phone all the time not that we don't want to talk to people we just want to be efficient with the the time we spend on your files\nAnd instead of sending you know fifty emails with one question each email that requires a response to each email right send one email was fifty topics or fifty questions than the attorney can say oh okay well that's organized let me go through\nAnswer answer ants rise answer here's one email response and what took you know twenty minutes to to respond to all those things\nYou know it what didn't happen is instead of it being you know fifty minutes to hours responding to fifty different things you know he's a ...\nPart of the last one um I Wish we had more time for it but [noise]\nLine I mean that might be the war one of one of the worst mistakes that you can make ... is an absolute is just flat out lying during the course of the case uh that will get you in so much hot water I have seen judges\nGets so angry or from the bench because someone lied to them perjured themselves on the stand um you know there are some situations where you can be arrested for that for perjury but there are definitely situations where we have seen I mean to the benefit of our client we call the other side of a lie and cross examination\nWhere they got hammered at the end my client got you know eighty percent of the marital state when the normally it should have been maybe fifty or sixty percent but because the other side lied\nBoy there was a two hundred thousand dollar swing and what the you know what recovery was for my client\nYeah there's ... as I said before I Know we're we're almost out of the time it's all about credibility and if you lie and get caught not lie in first of all attorney shouldn't be letting you lie but if you get caught in a lie it could be the\nThe smallest little white lie it could damage your credibility which can then impact what the court does\nIn terms of a final order on all the issues\nYeah well hey thanks every one for listening about wraps up this show if you you know what if you're getting a lot of the show we would love it if

a girl Frank read and they want and so that that they identify as women\nBut they ran the track so where are we where are we conservatives and liberals I'll invite my liberal listeners to always do but specifically where are we\nWhat are we fighting now as Britain and I were talking before the show Brett said a week ago if you ask conservatives what is the biggest issue they would have said getting Kavanaugh ... are being accused of a crime you didn't commit and and possibly ruining alight but Kavanaugh got a ... um um\nYou don't want it confirmed confess warning and so we're now what

was the very clear for care for the thirty year old now this is a thirty year old not a child the thirty year all\nHell breaks I was younger than thirty I think that's a little bit over thirty ran and I you know it but the thirty or think of what a thirty year old Liz\nOkay they're working they're kids they're paying taxes more importantly they are voting we won't get to their would just stop right there for the thirty year old who was born female and his transgender [laughter] sleaze lead\nThe thirty year old who was born female and is transgender which means that it's born female acts like a male is supported by his husband and handler in quotes Andrew who copies of companies him to regular play dates with other role players\nIn their home town of Los Angeles\nTony said to me a dog is everything pure in a world dog just experienced the world through the lens of pure joy that I don't think other animals have and now in my adult life in my relationships the way for me to feel vulnerable and exposed and close to my partner it's a very intimate thing\nNow I ask you all if I were to come home first of all let me see what you guys heard my mom on a on a radio God Bless her I Love my mom more than more than life itself as many of us do right [noise]\nIf I went home with thirty\nThirty years old company a couple a couple of years ago I go home with thirty I I I think I was down here around thirty was down here in Atlanta and let's say I got back on a plane and went home I had my husband\nRight problem number one to my mom I'm not calling around him just tells you as it is that would be problem number one if I went home to New York with a husband\nThere'll be problems already but if I went home to New York as a husband and I was transgender acting like a female there'd be problem number two if I went\nHome at Thirty years old to New York and open up knocked on my mom's door\nBecause I still don't have a key to our own houses which is another story we'll talk about later [laughter] but I don't have to eat at my mom's house in New York I've had it she gave it to me but I kind of misplaced it and then she would give it to me [laughter] so we'll have that's the topic for another day\n[noise] but if I went\nHome with thirty knocked on my mom's dog with my husband has a transgender male acting like a female and then said to my mom I'm a human dog because dogs are everything pure on a world my mom lives on the twelfth floor of espionage\nGardens in New York City that probably said too much right there but she does\nShe was outcome y'all real nice and sweet she said let's go on the terrorists that have a drink [laughter] the poorest of the drink as he's come to the front of the terrorists and she said do not have a wonderful view\nOf downtown New York and my husband and I was standing there and me and my humid puppy cost you will be standing there acting like a transgender woman I always say that says yes ma you have a\nBlack lab I at the bottom that's exactly what she would do I can see your mom doing this and she would tell her friends they would say why don't you throw your son\nOff the balcony and she would say\nWell one he's not my son anymore because he identifies the woman so he's my daughter now she got against traits that she'd say too I have no problems with his new husband that's fine\nThat's the life he wants to live that we fell in love with I Can't control that I may not agree with that but I Can't control them either grown man or woman now and he fell in love with a man that's fine\nThat's not why ... why don't you throw 'em off Valerie because he's crazy so I threw my\nBalcony because he's nuts [laughter] he doesn't think he's a man anymore thinks he's a woman who also thinks he's a dog\nHe's nuts and that's how we should view these think this is not normal behavior ladies and gentlemen this is a no stretch of the imagination normal behavior why are we treating this like it's normal behavior\nIs in an effort to not insult people isn't an effort not to make people\nFeel that what is the reason why we can't say that this person you need to seek mental health\nHelp why what is the problem with that why we see this as normal while I was saying is five year old coming along and saying oh mommy I'm a a five year old boys criminal say mommy I'm a girls today and we saw okay let's just sum up in girls close\nWhere we see this as a as a psychological problem which was seen as not a stand five or six years ago\nOr transgender cyclists who simply identifies as a woman gets a race and woman races because he has no she didn't have a uh\nUh what do you call it um she didn't have a um uh what do you call it what do you call it the operation she just identified\nThe woman that just sickening but how do you have been and then she called us our well being offended this is this is wild that's absolutely crazy to me\nAnd so I just don't understand why we as normal rational people cannot said no ma'am you're not a woman you're a man you can't race in a woman racist and you might want to seek psychological help you're listening\nAnd also went to show\nThat garbage piece of music making two hundred and sixty million dollars what\nAnd you can make an ATM saw\nWell that's all we have to do and it makes them worse gung\nHo on SAT I'm so Trump didn't want people to buy you know he was

dot com or the number for your call today seven\nSeven zero five for five\nEighty eight eighty wine ATF question to that end of the things we've been talking about today we're talking about different ways to plan for longevity in retirement and Patrick volatility is a big concern for a lot of people how do we insulate our savings to make sure it will last for several decades when we do face\nThe rest of the market's going down\nFirst we got to understand how much risk are you currently taking and this is something that a lot of people don't know how to measure the a lot of times people think that there are invested very conservatively that if we have a big downturn in the markets and maybe it'll go down\nFive ten or Fifteen Percent but we're only doing analysis on folks portfolios gym we typically see the folk stand to lose thirty forty fifty plus percent of their life savings oh gosh if I go through another two thousand and eight type market condition and people are starting to not remember but a volatile market looks\nLike because we haven't seen one for quite some time we've had you know for the last nine years weren't wearing the longest Bull Run and stock market history\nWe've never had this kind of run before ever and people are starting to get very complacent thinking that owned the markets go up there just always go up my mind just keeps growing\nRand or so you know now people are starting to freak out a little bit when they're starting to see this ... maybe starting to tune in and like they should and in protecting some of the money because it's kind of like a Las Vegas casino you know if you're if you're way of genuine started taking some of those ships off the table and repositioning it and it's a lot\nEasier to go through a big financial downturn like a two thousand and eight or two\nThousand two two thousand and two in the markets went down to two percent as well it's a lot easier to go through something like that when you still have a paycheck coming right\nWhen you're when you're when you're retired\nAnd you don't have that paycheck coming in and you take a fifty percent hit to your savings and you're still need to reach in and take money from your portfolio to you know to find your lifestyle then you got some serious decisions to make were either you dramatically change your lifestyle or you're going to have a really good chance of running out of money\nSo let's talk about the planning process here for how we figure out which tools are going to be best for us Patrick because I think everybody's going to need different amounts of growth in different amounts of protection what are some of the tools we can use to achieve those goals\nSure we got to look at what the bounces really between safety what you want to keep safe and what you want to have at risk and the market and there's this thing called the rule of one hundred gym where you take whatever your ages and\nUsed to track that from a hundred so whatever you're ages that's the amount that she should have and things that are safe and protected so if somebody is for an example of sixty years old then you should have sixty percent of your money and things that are are safe and protected from lost and the remaining percentage when we subtract out from a hundred so forty percent\nIt's that's an amount that it's okay to have at risk and the market so as you get older more and more keeps going over to the safe side because we want to be protecting them money\nAnd you don't need to be taking all of that risk it's more about protecting yet and preserving it and creating the income that she needed so that's the other piece that puzzle genders that yeah we want to make sure that so much money is safe but then also\nWe want to make sure there's so much has allocated to producing the income that you need so you can maintain their lifestyle you\nEvery month every year for as long as you and your spouse live if you have a spouse and this is the process so we walk everybody through with our bell or a term of formula is that we want to sit down and we want to understand where are you currently\nOut right now and what is the current path that you're on a retirement and what is it what what do you really need at this stage and so we'll take a look at the risk that you're taking how much you're paying fees and we'll show you the things that are good and will show you things are maybe not so good that we would fix if we were you but you've got to take the action and you got to schedule a time to come in\nFor a visit you've got to give us a call here if you're one of the next ten callers we do as such you saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars towards your retirement to walk you through this\nProcess but you have to give us a call here at seven seven zero\nFive four or five eighty eight eighty one again that seven seven zero five four or five eighty eight eighty one and we will walk you through a process\nHe will understand currently where you're at what your past looks like in your retirement this stuff this good stuff is not so good that we would fix and if their strategies we can help us that's great\nBut there is no obligation we just want to make sure that you are clear on where you are currently out and where you're headed you just got to give us a call here seven seven zero five\nFour or five eighty eight eighty one and I can't wait to see a\nWe're talking today with Patrick knew where he is the\nFounder of ... majors and I'm generally jak alongside gay we're talking about how long you'll need to find your retirement balancing growth and protection when we have\nTo deal with longevity as a factor now Patrick when we're talking about this volatility that we've seen lately how do you help your clients to not some of the\nNoise to where they are not panicking by headlines and making emotional knee jerk decisions yes\nEverything is so fear driven today isn't it it is yes\nWe have the the media that you got to realize how they how they make their money is that they keep people fearful and they keep you tuned in to their to their advertisements that they're you know they play all the time so\nEvery you know this guy is always falling with whatever it is whether it's political or whether it's on the stock markets and what we tried to do is we tried to educate our client money once you have a good plan put together where you know that well here's the plant and this is how much I have the safe\nHere's the plan that I have this bucket of money to set up just strictly for income and then you know the money that you have that sort of risk and how much risk you're really taken but it's not everything and so when when you have an overall plan that you know what's going to happen in the long run and he's got that carefully thought out we just don't get phone calls in the office\nHere Jen um when when mark is volatile every now and then somebody will say you know we're okay is everything good and just kind of checking in but everybody knows that they have they're planning a place where their income is good they got so much money safe and so they're they know that that might send the market is there more for a long term growth strategy most of the time it's not\nSo you know have their whole retirement isn't hindering on you know their their money being invested in the markets\nMost recently the fed raises rates on the money that they can land they called the Federal Reserve fund rate to ... record happens temper and when those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes right so you're going to borrow money for a home\nIf you're going to refinance your home if you're gonna buy a car and you're gonna financed that car or you're going to use credit cards for that matter anything we're we're you're borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up and that's books\nAll spoke some market right because of your\nHome maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance or home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop less when it costs more to borrow money the markets can spoof that consumers will slow down on their spending and\nSo that's the first thing it's really been a story about the fed\nAnd rates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and those historical rates which the fed put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective um and they're all some other things that are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up\nThe ten year treasury the rates have gone up on that right now and that's the highest rates we've seen on tenure treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happened and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't weighed like as right let me see if we see a sell off in tech stocks\nTech stocks though I'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches\nWith companies involved like Amazon a potentially data breach and Facebook had a recent data breach so there's been some soften these tech stocks but again\nMaking putting that in perspective it's been the tech stocks have been driving the market higher company and we call him saying companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google use main tech companies\nHave been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising and it was probably about time for us to see tech stocks pull back and I think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that the trade wars um\nAll this talk of trade war with China\nIs having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally the global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been\nAbsolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world um and so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um it's really been a lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging marked down\nAnd we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a breather to an almost a recognized that things are slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nEven I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can still trouble where the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates really liberal retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees a special retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest\nWay to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if if you're doing long retirement and the good news about rich going higher is that the rates on your money markets in your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher\nIf in most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see ten year treasuries 'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe ten year treasuries could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know what that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is\nRetirees it can actually be a very positive\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David not well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] right it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what what I Know and and we've been talking about this and maybe you know I've done other interviews\nOn um I Know that we're live we we've just had the greatest full market of our lifetime I I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had\nAnd at the same standpoint the last eight months I've been telling people don't get greedy [laughter] I like I don't know it's not time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because\nIf you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can afford to take the time to let the markets recover but if you're retired\nYour ... your comfort level with seeing your money drops significantly is gonna be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you're approaching retirement order or you're already retired that you talked with a financial adviser that you work with a financial wise or if that if you have a financial wise right now that you\nPick up the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do call your financial advisor go back into their office\nSit down with them have them walk you through what you're invested\nA lot of people who are retired that might be fearful the stock market today\nActually have a very what we call very low exposure to the stock market like all meet people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and half of their money in an annuity paying them a guaranteed rate and half of their money is in bonds and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so uh but they read the news and they're very fearful\nSo don't be fearful find out find out how much money you actually have in the market how\nMuch risk are you taking and again I work with your financial advisor I just a big believer that\nWe recommend people registering that's when you watch the most important part they will financial plan for you that they they get to understand what your comfort level with the skin\nAnd then they helped build an investment portfolio based on your goals and your comfort level risk if you have a very low comfort level with ... ... any risk well then you should have less money in the ... but the key right now I Know this when markets are going back the most important you can you\nCan just call your don't sit still don't do anything every market all that ultimately has had can't promise always out but I can tell you it's always had to recover right every single major Mark Twain had a recall\nSo I'm just a big long term believer that you want a diversified portfolio high quality investment built up a financial planner working with a financial trust that they're old your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky\nDavid fantastic insights on this market drop what the silver lining here and all of this\nWell I think the silver lining is how incredible and economy we are right now like let's not leave sight you know look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment in America in forty nine years unemployment three point seven percent right\nWhat is that why is that because we haven't read it strong economy right now so GDP which you\nKnow two years ago what do you believe that most people certainly GDP right now for your point there are predictions that the third quarter could be as high as ... or so the economy in the U.S super strong\nAnd things really are which is why by the way also we had stock market it ...\nAll time so just notice\nThings Connie are strong this was a very normal time to see a pull back in the market if anything is probably very healthy that we're seeing a pullback in America right now and just notice the economy's doing really well the tax cuts and for the foreseeable future we see an economy that's continuing to grow\nDavid Baake always a pleasure thank you for your insights today nagging my pleasure thank you [noise]\n\n[noise] they submitted to the weight watchers and when the Republicans sound like a logical leftists and I'd like during the no they're not enough their knee jerk\nBy\nThree reporters were mouth pieces for the prosecutors they don't question\nThem they don't see what the law so that they sit there by their their the information and\nReached the peak of your testosterone in your early twenties and it starts gradually going down and so now that I'm over\nForty or I decided you know what maybe I should go in and get this tested because you're hormone levels right they affect a lot of different things that are going on with you and makes it a whole lot harder to be able to lose body fat and and you get you sleepy during the day and all kinds of different stuff so I went in and out when I got this testing done it turns out that my testosterone\nWas pretty low and uh but if you didn't go in and get a second opinion that get that test I I Would have never\nKnown this and so now I can take the steps to correct the levels and not only was my testosterone down but my estrogen levels were up so basically my doctor was telling me that I was turning into a woman ...\nWatch out All right we're\nGoing to have you know so that's why you know we've got to tune in and we gotta we gotta find out you know what is really actually going on with you and you want to get that second opinion so that way if there is something off that you can start taking the actionable steps to to get things back to where they they should be\nA Patrick ... just a couple of minutes left ... start to out saying that the little data we focused a lot today on longevity understanding that you might need to find your retirement\nFor a very long time that of course there are other factors to think about as well and we aren't guaranteed tomorrow is the point where they're making here and this last part of the show any final comments you'd like to share with us\nAs it relates to making sure we get the proper planning done for both scenarios living a long life or not letting his long life\nAnd and it all starts with getting clarity on where it is that you're currently are just like what I went through with a different testing that I'd just done we want to do the same type of testing\nFor you and what is going on with your current investments in your current retirement plan so we're walking through the five areas of retirement planning saw walk through your current income plant\nAnd what does that look like and then we'll we'll talk to you about your investments and we'll find out how much riskier currently taking right now now that the markets are an all time high how much downside risk because really there we go through another downturn and then we want to talk about taxes are there ways that we can make things more tax efficient now or some point in the future we want to talk to health care if you have\nTo go into assisted living nursing home care of these these things are skyrocketing\nPrize and how do we take care of those needs and then you've got legacy planning which we talked a little bit about today where the uncertainty where if you do pass away you know how\nDo we now get that to your loved ones the way that you intend to two and so we call this all five of these areas the bell retirement formula and it's all about getting a clarity on where you're currently and putting a proper plan together for what it is that you actually need and what you want in your retirement and so you just have\nTo take the steps to give us a call and come in to schedule a visit and we will walk you through this if you're one of the next ten callers we're going to walk you through our bell retirement formula and do

Donald Trump caved in to the pressure from the liberals in the left is even though ... put those children in cages years ago in for the entire eight years of his administration\nAnd the Democrats didn't give a damn about it then suddenly they do now so Donald Trump said okay tell you what I'll stop separating families even though when you come across the border illegally and got arrested you can't put children in shale so we had to separate him for children's places anyway so Trump said you know what I was stopping will keep them altogether from now on and guess what happened Caleb in a month or September\nThey set a record of arrests of families almost Seventeen\nThousand families were arrested coming across the border in one month that's an eighty percent increase\nAnd it's a record never happened before and it's because when Donald Trump said I'm not going to put you up it was like a cold all the ... come on over folks\nThat the liberals made him do and now we're paying for it was Seventeen thousand families under arrest in America and we have to deal with them now because they made him cave into business with the border we should have a wall up their Trump's been trying to do it people who were against the wall or the ones who are hurting American Caleb not Donald Trump\nI mean think about history surprise from it immigrant\nWeren't welcome aboard all illegal immigrants absolutely all those illegal immigrants\nOK sign\nBullet Elizabeth Warren would love to see how it'll to legal immigration who\nCares among all immigration or at least you're which Elizabeth Warren's from Boston\nWell because we have a lot of elections in this midterm cycle which we have people that are being\nChosen against that could really help ah our situation when it comes to how we treat refugees how we treat\nImmigrants here and talking nonsense what does that mean that we have a wall or we don't even have you have border secure or you don't\nWhen I can ever have the ability to take out every single person that we want to uh what what we need to have this ability to any person comes to our border truly understand what they come with\nAnd I both take them on case by case\nRight absolutely ... where are we really but you don't let you do you agree and open borders anybody can just come in here no we'll be Democrats do\nYou know I obviously I I agree with you that there is a\nVery ... did then you can't vote Democrat because if they can uh ... they've already said it if they get in control of Congress in the house one they're going to impeach Donald Trump and to they're going to open the borders and they're going to give back your tax cut that's their program we're going to open your Oregon was the\nThing is that I I Am not a fan of a cult that movement on either side I ...

what else except a little colon how's it going\nGo get a ... or ... or ... you\nCan work I work for a second time caller from ... to comment of what you said earlier about the situation with a veteran and the rifle yeah uh I got to say I'm a bit disappointed with your opinion on guns there I work near show a couple of times and whenever the topic comes up\nIt's the same thing with this always wanting to take the guns away and I think that's a bit misunderstood\nWhat now here's the thing I used to say that these people didn't exist and I wanted to take that back there are people out there who want and all the guns you know I Can't deny that any more but those don't speak for the majority of people the majority of people simply wants in place certain restrictions that would make it easier for people to get a gun\nFor example they always point to the fact that most gun deaths of suicides and that may be true but yeah I'm One of those things fact that so I got an issue and by restricting access to guns you know\nYeah you want the aerial Rick access to guns yes but you know criminals are always you know white guy and\nCriminal and the problem with access to guns ... come on ... and you know that\nCriminals don't obey the law they don't go into gun stores and say oh I'm not going to fill out your forms they steal them they buy 'em on the black market it's got nothing to do with gun laws good luck with nothing to do with criminals\nGun laws have nothing to do with gang bangers and all the violence in Chicago and other cities never most gun laws have nothing to do with that and I do is make one damned bit of difference of gun law hasn't affected me I've been a gun numbers since I was sixteen\n... you know I mean I\nI agree I agree with you um\nSo I don't mind why should I my right to restrict it I didn't do anything wrong it's like saying hey I'll give you an example let's say this let's say that you know you have a friend in your neighborhood who got drunk one night and drove his car and had an accident killed somebody that means we could take away your car too because you're going to be with your car like he did\nA I don't think that for her and\nAlexander the affair now let's see if one guy misuses a gun you want to take away mine\nNo I don't want to take\nAway or you know if you want to say look I used a semi automatic rifle like he did it in Las Vegas to shoot all those people you want to take my semi automatic rifle\nI didn't say they will say moderate you went\nThere I did okay well do you want to take away my semi automatic rifle\nNot necessarily know\nWhat do you what do you mean don't necessarily yes or no do you want to do you think I have the right to own a semi automatic assault rifle\nI Believe that there are certain ... and says you know just to stop just stop go away I mean I Know if you go through their guide and\nHaving the closer we get some action no more democratic boss or calling up explaining why we should have\nLooked like if you're in a gun control the way the Democrats looks equally don't want to answer the question you know and I think in the car drove cars a perfect analogy\nBecause someone else misused his car you want to take away my car I don't think so somebody misuse the gun you can't take away my gun 'cause somebody else misused it it's not just guns\nEvery day we're all from Democrats say well this is why you should be doing Democrat yeah\nRight 'cause they don't have any issues but again he had you know he won't even say it that well we need to do a better laws and you know we don't I mean my God we need people to stop being crazy misusing guns 'cause they're mentally ill\nRuled on here's a great guy three their feet on the new talk one of six seven hello Greg how's it going\nI'm great my friend our you very well\nIt was just thinking I'm thinking you're due to the service that democratic straight\nMan they're always double sided yeah just just unreal it's just the pony [noise]\nIt is phoning it is absolutely and here's another phone if you remember when that illegal alien alien Gonzalez was here to the Clinton Administration sent him back to\nThat is right send them home by the forces were gone remember his face when the federal agents came in and took him away screaming and petrified and everything else that was the uh the federal John ... send them to help back home\nExactly when they took him or from his family here in the United states I got to go and kill and\nYeah I work on it a\nYou know but it is really is it pretty Russia you know what happened last week ... what do you mean last week a guy asked me if I give five dollars in world hunger yeah wise that absolutely I didn't know where you were that close\n[laughter] all these five job and I know I got it right here\nI said I didn't know where you were that close and maybe it's the closest they carry with that but last night where that grab my girlfriend's G. string\nYou grab your girlfriend is ... what happened\nShe should give me back the guitar\nRight they say oh shut up [laughter]\nYou buddy hockey\nCoach you know that it's a show and days and said he wouldn't trade Anthony Davis for anybody not even beyond say which makes sense to me\nWell what do you mean to her ... limit yourself to one cup paid it first started like Anthony Davis should mean you could get killer Mike T I surely\nWhen it Michael grabber Brian Joyce I mean why live which is just trying to make a point there you go ... glad the ... words in it so are we probably should have\nYou noticed that I did that strip tease millennia video we'd never do that with Michelle Obama\nNever do and Michelle Obama probably wouldn't want to get slapped in the face you know obviously the live show in person I don't get too close to this right yes I Know [laughter]\nThey see a ... I don't know why she went and stuff to people in that regard to the farmers really admire you know what I\nMean the farmers are ...\nHip or seen anything that big that didn't have John did written\n[laughter] calms lines in the ...\nThe ... what's that ... the with the delta flight attendant got in trouble\nAll yeah the adult to have a part of the porn star is a ... a campfire they didn't will Austin will six foot four inch porn star yeah\nOh yeah the guy that ... activity in the laboratory but it proved something that I wasn't aware of you know it's that rocks you don't have to be at the death of the ticket counter ... to take it up to\nHave a terrible manager there [laughter]\nAnd then she says oh man [laughter]\n... actors to read off a flight from Los Angeles ... off a flight yeah yeah what happened I guess they call it a habit of national anthem I think she told him ... thank you for your service to country you know I didn't believe death or life can even get off the ground with the two left wing judo\nSoon as he would do that let me see the thing is you know I was ... G. string and she said give me to get hired back with a G. string you see us people forgot that ... the other the other shows lie [laughter]\nYou know I Would ever since the disaster women and children are evacuated first\nWomen and children evacuated first why why is it\nWell it gives them a chance to think of a solution is silence\n[laughter] necessary nagging going on how you got to do\nThat you might be able to secure way out of string you start out as I was in a while [laughter]\nChicks man said\nNext rise alone you know hopes\nAnd dreams kick cause we have women in the ...
