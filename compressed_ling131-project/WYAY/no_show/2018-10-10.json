TV will covered this story because Seventy five percent of all advertising on television is coming from the pharmaceutical industry\nThey're not going to let me do the story right they wouldn't let Fox to it when that MSNBC didn't matter who you were so I thought a film\nAt least the film is at censored how you censor film we get into try back to film festival I don't know that one of the sponsors of the pharmaceutical sponsor ... and they even Robert De Niro stood up for a film and he and he started the festival he couldn't even keeping the festival that's how powerful this vast lobby in this industry is\nLet's aid for for for all for one of six seven I'm In the studio with Dell big tree the producer of acts the movie which talks about the city what's this guy's name\nSo Dr William Thompson is still still employed by the CDC he has a whistle blower attorney that protects them they can't take this job away he's one of our top vaccine safety scientist\nSo so the story goes like this he and five other scientists or all cast in in early two thousand to look at the ... vaccine the measles mumps rubella vaccine does it cause autism because there was this huge hoopla going on in the u._k. where a doctor Dr any Wakefield was saying\nThe but then part of the media can actually harder to debunk of that portion of the I guess the what the the pro vaccination people say the pro vaccine mess says I guess the debunking of it says that once that study came out\nTen of the Thirteen doctors who are part of that study all said take my name off of it and and studies that came out afterwards\nSay they've found no I'm a no relationship between autism a vaccine and one or more compelling arguments I've heard made by the other side if you will let us call or two sides yeah one of the more compelling arguments that I've read is that they found that autism\nDevelops in utero before kids even get vaccinations do you want to respond to that\nYeah there's actually ... there's not any real scientist will stand behind that statement it's still a hypothesis and the problem you have with it was originally that was the truth with autism autism was called it was\nThe original when we found it in Nineteen thirty eight first appeared Nineteen thirty eight forty three was the first published documents we've got a couple of handfuls of kids that have an issue we've never seen an insane asylum or anywhere else in the world the hundreds of years we've been studying psycho issues right you know\nSo it was a brand new issue and they called it they blamed refrigerator moms because they said these babies don't connect to their mom they don't look their mom and the odds they don't touch them because the moms are cold and it's the coldness of the money would lay in the middle of the causes autism\nAnd it was originally started at birth as soon as they were born they just weren't connecting with the mother but then in the Nineteen eighties nineties we started seeing a new form of ...\nDoes and where kids were developing perfectly normally they were talking there were touching their parents are looking their parents in the eyes and then they were grass into autism for a long time there was an argument and science are we going to cause autism even though it has made assume attributes it's it's happening later without any leisure\nAnd so that killed the idea that it's happening in euro why do we have these why has it changed one of the perfectly healthy because it's you know it's I think more and more they're starting to admit it they are now adding in an environmental issue is part of this like they don't know\nHow mental issue is a pseudonym for maniacs nation oil or any any environmental\nInsult but I think you know when you think about\nThe toxins in our air or water food the pollution all those things are all to be contributing to this issue believe me I don't think back to them so the only cause of autism and I do think there's autism that happens in utero\nAt the pharmaceutical industry is making vaccines the same sick people that are just out to make money that lie to us all the time that's why the lawyers that they're going if you've been injured by blah blah blah blah blah blah blah call me or whatever but you can't sue with vaccines we've created in density they're totally protected from liability on this one product is crazy\nLet's go to the phones or let's go to Austin Austin do you have a question for our guest there'll be tree\nHey chalet hey Dale on the clock you regarding what he said only vaccines and they karma I personally agree with you while I Do think there needs to be more work done I Would not be surprised at all to see if there is a link between vaccines and\nAt least some cases of autism now I Do have to admit that I think there is more to it than just vaccines has been taken out\nOf all the chemicals and you're putting into our bodies of all the industrial ... instead of getting into our water and personally I forget what it's in my studies and adds a water treatment technician you'll be surprised how many\nCases of wag the copper mercury to how big a problem that can be found our local water sources you take that parts of the crop is putting vaccines I wait and honestly\nNot sort of ... profit or if they are meant to be harder to growing up\nIn there getting hit from all sides and people will say to me do how do you know it's not the food the air the water that's part of this and I always say look we should be spending millions and millions of dollars investigating all those\nThings like we said lipid said there's a product sprayed on all of our crops now\nAnd I wish it had it's not going to get all that you're not just getting that stuff or am I hearing something you know here's the one\nReason I think back soon as it is is a little different we're talking about a rising autoimmune disease so remember when you were a kid back Nineteen eighties let's say we were getting about ten eleven vaccines by the time or Eighteen now we're giving Seventy two vaccines by the time or Eighteen and that same exact time period we've gone from\nHaving twelve point eight percent in the eighties twelve to eight percent chronic illness so that's either autoimmune disease or a neurological\nDisorder an auto immune system so that\nMeans your body's attacking itself it's going to fused your your immune system is attacking your own body see your own blood vessels your cells different parts of diabetes as an enemy and it's attacking you so what I say this if we have an increase in all amused we've gone from twelve to ... percent than up fifty four percent of America's children\nHave a chronic illness either a neurological disorder or an autoimmune disease shouldn't we be looking most closely at the one product is designed to alter your immune system for life that's what it does if you ask someone ... vaccine works they say well tricks your immune system and the thing is that a disease were not trick that immune system one time ten times twenty times to Seventy two times any song\nWhat'd you get a question for Dell big tree producer of the movie back to the movie\nSteak you taking my call 'em a lot of this and if we take all of that what you just said look and you missed their own\nShow and we took all this into consideration what kind of country that really speak to us because I Know as I mentioned to your screener you up\nFor ... for ... for a you know open the market capitalistic society but some of it is true 'cause I Know you're going to hit you know the benefit of the doubt this is Shelley right we're going to put on your side of it is true that is still bad but you're not agree\nI agree but I don't think it has I\nI understand where you're going to nice um I Want to answer that question and then I'll have to answer that question I think the the beauty of the free market system is that you're allowed to have a Dell big treat tell you what he thinks and then you make a decision on your own so that's the beauty of the free market system if we didn't have a capitalist system\nThen you would just be told that you put this in your body and you have no fight against putting it in your body so the free market system says hey you have a choice do you want this for your children that's why we're bringing you the information I understand what you're trying to do with this\nBut I think the beauty of the free market system is that you're allowed to say hey I don't want to send my system and if more people listen\nAnd and and way the benefits and the and the and the uh uh negatives I guess if you will of vaccinating their children maybe that now you start to affects effect that um that system Denise does that answer your question\nOf the most also he was a keen on what you've just said I take all that you can imagine what you have a system because it is such a complex system that is allowed and just shutting down as well as\nTo what is that the capital of them is that I mean let me jump in here because I\nThink it's as much about being shut down this is the product is being forced on our children can't go to school you can't get an education kicking the things that America is supposed to offer you if you don't vaccinate so we don't have a choice it isn't a free market any more and more and more laws are taking that away from us and by the way\nHealthy people twenty twenty on health and Human Services website there they want to force vaccinate all adults now to you're not gonna have a choice you're not going to work you're not going to be all get on a bus you know I can be on a plane and this is a product that is moving outside of a normal\nMarket system it has no liability you cannot sue these protections by government go against the fabric of what America stands for which is freedom of choice I should have the freedom to not have to vaccinate my child\nI see that children the sickest they've ever been more children dying in America than we've ever seen before sick this nation of children industrialized world every stat says so I just want to say because of no running out of time

now right now as we speak until ...\nGo out one of the CDC people gathered there because we are tired of a government that is not giving us a choice that is not investigating safety that is it is protecting the pharmaceutical industry on a product it's injected new children and here's the truth\nBobby kennedy and I we went to the national Institute of health Donald Trump set that up Donald Trump does still care about this and what things we discovered we talked to has more health department there has never been a proper safety study of a single vaccine you give your kid\nThe double blind placebo studies where you test against the placebo has never been done on a single childhood vaccine I can see the competently\nThey kids to me that's the truth the you're not using the
